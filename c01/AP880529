   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of
Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society.''
   The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the second century A.D., which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' Winfield said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the Yucatan
Peninsula, more than 700 miles to the east, Winfield said at the
museum in Xalapa, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in
their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars,
equivalent to May 22, 143 (A.D.), and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' Winfield
said.
   If the mysterious people did exist, Winfield said, they also
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who
emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the
artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one
century later.
   ``They could be the Xicalancas, of which Clavijero briefly
talked about,'' Winfield said, referring to the Rev. Francisco
Javier Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787), a Jesuit priest who
was the first to systematically study Mexico's ancient languages
and peoples.
   In his ``History of Ancient Mexico,'' Clavijero in three lines
briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the
Olmecs, but did not go into details.
   In ``nahuatl,'' the trading language of the Aztecs, who came
much later, Xicalanca means ``the people who live by the Great Body
of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of Mexico was called.
   The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in
the village of La Mojarra, where the Piojo River meets the Acula
River. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be
reached only by boat, Winfield said.
   La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the Acula
about 20 miles south of the port of Alvarado in Veracruz state. But
neither the village nor the Piojo River can be found on any map of
Mexico.
   Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of
basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length
profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering.
   ``He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest
_ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region
in ancient times,'' Winfield said.
   The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four
representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight
feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic.
   A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat
rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 ``elements'' like the
rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab.
   ``It was all carved during one continuous period,'' Winfield
said. ``It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient Mexico.''
   About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded
top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the Acula, just
outside La Mojarra.
   Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of
villagers.
   Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but Winfield said he kept
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed ``without the
pressure that such a discovery creates.''
   The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the
region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one
of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the
museum, is so badly damaged it cannot be studied, Winfield said.
   In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing.
   That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf
cultures. The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the
Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of
fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers.
   A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces
in a cardboard box.
   ``We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let
the museum have it,'' Winfield said.
   Winfield suspects the La Mojarra area could have been a
ceremonial site.
   ``If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be
found,'' he said.

   When the ``Albion Tornado'' roared toward
East State Street three years ago, Earl Rice ran to warn his wife,
Ruth, on their front porch ``when I saw the wind pick her up and
throw her over the rail.''
   Across the street, the Rev. Robert J. Reilly prayed hard as the
gathering winds sucked him toward a second-floor window and his
strength ebbed.
   Next door, 5-year-old Katie Steff screamed ``Tornado coming!''
as her father, Samuel, huddled the family above their funeral home.
In a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later, Steff knew they
were in the eye of the huge twister.
   Forty-one tornadoes, including nine of the highest intensities,
swept through Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Ontario during eight
hours of May 31, 1985, killing 88 people and injuring more than
1,000.
   The tornado outbreak, worst since April 1975, caused $450
million in property damage in the United States.
   Of the dead, 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and
a disproportionate number, 15, were between 66 and 70 years old,
according to the National Weather Service.
   The Albion tornado was among the worst, packing winds estimated
at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the
Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The twister, estimated at 1,200 feet
across, quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads
town near Lake Erie on a 14-mile tear that killed 12 people.
   ``I watch the sky now, just like everyone else,'' Mayor Bonda
Dahlin said recently. ``Tornadoes were Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska
kind of things. But I don't think it's something we'll ever
forget.''
   ``People here still cringe the minute there's a dark cloud in
the sky. There's such anticipation,'' said Borough Secretary Paul
McKnight.
   Rice, 72, a retired railroad worker, heard the first frantic
warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife
get swept away. He woke up trapped in his own house.
   ``I started hollering,'' Rice recalled. ``There were timbers all
over me. The beams were across my legs and I couldn't move. They
tried to jack up the beams, but that just put more pressure on my
legs. Then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and
pulled me out.''
   Rice suffered only cuts and bruises. His wife suffered broken
arms and a dislocated shoulder.
   Reilly, 68, pastor of St. Lawrence Roman Catholic Church, was in
his rectory's living room ``when the roof went off and the windows
went out.''
   ``I kind of spread-eagled in front of the window as the thing
began to suck me out. I grabbed anything. I just hung on until it
ended,'' Reilly said. ``I asked God to make it that I was ready to
meet Him.''
   The church and rectory were destroyed, but two days later Reilly
said Mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins.
   Steff, 43, a mortician, gathered his wife, four daughters and a
friend in the family room of their second-floor apartment. Katie
screamed just as Albion's fire siren began to wail.
   ``Then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom.
Things just bombarded the building,'' Steff recalled. ``Then we
heard a silence, just for a second, like in the eye of a hurricane.
Then everything hit us from the other side. Patty, my wife, opened
the door of the family room and it was gone.''
   The Steffs' business and home were destroyed, a $200,000 loss.
   Steff ran across the street to help free Cathy Gibson from her
three-story Victorian house, which was down.
   ``I called into the debris to tell her help was coming,'' Steff
said. ``Later, she told me she was never so glad to hear an
undertaker's voice.''
   A deputy Erie County coroner, Steff helped set up a morgue at
Northwestern High School. They brought in 11 bodies.
   Today, the tornado's southwest-to-northeast path can be clearly
seen in rebuilt split-level houses and new mobile homes, grassy
lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of Albion
look like a new subdivision.
   It was only a few months ago, McKnight said, that he ``closed
the books'' on Albion's claims with federal and state disaster
officials.
   Mayor Dahlin estimated that fewer than 200 of the town's 1,800
people moved away after the tornado ``because of memories, lack of
money or whatever.''
   ``People are getting on with their lives,'' she said.
``Businesses are being rebuilt, changing hands, and there are new
ones.''
   Reilly's modern new 400-seat church is linked by a glass
breezeway to a new three-bedroom rectory. Behind, a new recreation
building stands in red brick. The complex cost $1.1 million, he
said.
   ``One of the greatest experiences of my life, as tragic as it
was, was to see the spirit of the people of this town. They took a
tragic blow. They rebuilt the town,'' Reilly said.
   ``It's almost profane to say it was a good thing, but the bottom
line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town
is even physically better with all the new construction,'' he said.
   The Steffs, fully insured, rebuilt their small funeral home with
two viewing rooms, but took the opportunity to move their living
quarters to a house in another part of town.
   ``We shed our tears over it. We're trying to get our lives
together. You can dwell on the negatives, but the positives are the
concern and the love of the community,'' Steff said.
   ``When I walked out the door that day, I knew I was going to
stay.''
   The Rices built a modern two-bedroom split-level house. ``It's
starting to feel like home,'' Rice said with a shrug.
   ``You still think about it. Last September, I had an operation
for cancer and when I was in the recovery room, I thought I was
still under the house,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to see another one.''

<HEAD>Candidate Sounds Like Reformer In Final Weeks Of Presidential
Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At times, Carlos Salinas de Gortari sounds
too much like a reformer to be the presidential candidate of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico since
1929.
   The 40-year-old candidate preaches democratic reforms and clean
elections as he campaigns not so much for the office, which he is
certain to win, but to regain his party's lost credibility.
   Salinas de Gortari, whose thick black moustache and balding head
feature prominently in political cartoons, is described by those
close to him as a pragmatist, influenced strongly by his Harvard
education.
   Before his nomination last fall as a candidate in the July 6
election, he was President Miguel de La Madrid's budget and
planning secretary, a key figure in developing the economic
austerity programs that have prevailed in Mexico since 1982.
   Salinas de Gortari has strong family ties to the northern state
of Nuevo Leon, home to political conservatives who oppose the
guided economy and government controls dear to governing party
ideologues in Mexico City.
   Some foes within the party felt Salinas de Gortari would be
identified too strongly with the business sector and with
conservative groups within the party.
   But this has worked to the party's advantage. Salinas de Gortari
has managed to bring private business back into the party fold by
advocating fewer government controls and urging business leaders to
join the government ``in the battle for world markets.''
   ``The time is past when the state was the instrument to solve
all of society's problems,'' he told a cheering crowd at a recent
meeting of business leaders in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon's capital.
   He also wants more foreign investment to ``modernize Mexico
technologically.''
   ``What he says agrees with what private business thinks Mexico
must be,'' said Agustin Legorreta, president of the Business
Coordinating Council.
   Mexican business traditionally has identified with the
conservative National Action Party, although it must maintain a
close relationship with government agencies.
   Salinas de Gortari speaks confidently of the resurgence of
Mexico. The country has a $105 billion foreign debt but has
renegotiated it and is keeping up payments.
   Last month in Puebla, a politically conservative state in
central Mexico, Salinas de Gortari upset some party officials with
his call for reforms.
   ``The citizens' vote must be respected,'' he said. ``The party
will defend its victories, but it must accept its defeats.''
   He also promised reforms to encourage more independent judiciary
and legislative branches.
   ``Let us lead the democratic reform the country demands,'' he
stated.
   The political reforms may be difficult because they imply the
acceptance by the PRI of electoral losses and the consequent loss
of power of local or regional party bosses.
   The party never has lost a presidential election or
gubernatorial race in any of Mexico's 31 states since its founding.
   It is generally conceded in Mexico that the governing party wins
elections, but it often is criticized for ``winning'' by more than
the necessary votes _ by stuffing ballots to claim overwhelming
victories.
   ``There is a great internal debate going on now,'' said a source
close to the candidate. ``Salinas de Gortari is demanding elections
free of fraud and there is a lot of pressure being put on local
party leaders to be more democratic.''
   This year, with the country in the middle of a serious economic
crisis, and an increasingly vociferous opposition that includes a
dissident group led by former party leaders, those close to Salinas
de Gortari believe reforms have a good chance in his six-year term.
   ``It is better in the long run to win by a small margin than to
announce we won by a large margin and lose all credibility,'' said
a source in Salinas' entourage during a recent campaign trip.
   Some PRI officials privately admit the party may even lose a
Senate seat, something that has never happened before.
   De la Madrid won the elections in 1982 for the PRI with an
official 71 percent of the vote, a figure many considered
exaggerated. PRI officials now predict Salinas de Gortari may win
the July 6 election with a more realistic 55 percent to 60 percent
of the votes.
   ``We do not know if he will have the freedom to do what he wants
to do,'' said Alejandro Junco, publisher of the newspaper El Norte
of Monterrey and a frequent government critic. ``But we are
condemned to be optimistic evey six years.''

<HEAD>Grave Of Sylvia Plath Unmarked In English Village</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

   First her married name was chiseled
off her tombstone three times. Later the stone vanished, and so did
its replacement.
   Even in death, Sylvia Plath is not at peace.
   The admired American poet lies in an unmarked grave high in the
Yorkshire hills, a bleak resting place for a tormented soul who
killed herself when she was 30.
   Nobody knows who is tampering with her grave, but some suspect
feminist activists of erasing ``Hughes'' from the stone in the
belief that Plath's marriage to British poet Ted Hughes contributed
to her misery by turning her into a housewife.
   Plath's reputation has grown since her suicide in 1963. ``The
Bell Jar,'' her semi-autobiographical novel, has sold 200,000
copies in Britain. She posthumously won the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for
her ``Collected Poems.''
   Her grave in Heptonstall, a clutch of stone houses in the
austere south Pennine hills, has become a place of pilgrimage. A
little rosebush grows on it, and some modest wreaths and cut
flowers lie about. Crows and magpies fly above.
   A large granite tombstone once stood on the grave, inscribed,
``In Memory. Sylvia Plath Hughes. 1932-1963.''
   Below were two lines of poetry:
   ``Even amidst fierce flames
   The golden lotus can be planted.''
   They were written by Hughes, now Britain's Poet Laureate. He was
estranged from his wife she gassed herself in their London
apartment Feb. 11, 1963.
   In February of last year, residents say two women were seen
picking the lead letters of the Hughes name off the tombstone. They
said the name had been removed twice before.
   The stone then disappeared.
   ``We get visitors from all over the world to see the grave, and
they come in to say they can't find it. It seems a shame,'' said
Judith Parish, who runs the newspaper shop.
   ``I think feminists interfered with the inscription because they
object to the addition of Hughes' name to Sylvia's,'' said Elaine
Connell, a local teacher.
   ``Some people think Hughes was somehow to blame in his wife's
death because he left her to cope with the children,'' Miss Connell
said. She said a local newspaper had reported the tombstone was
removed for restoration.
   ``But that was hardly true as only the one name had been picked
off, and the tombstone was never returned,'' she said.
   The question of feminist involvement was raised again after the
publication this year of ``Sylvia Plath,'' a biography by Linda
Wagner-Martin, professor of English at Michigan State University.
   Hughes, 57, was reportedly furious with Wagner-Martin for
writing that he left his wife to do the housework and raise the
couple's two children while he pursued his career.
   Hughes was recognized as a fine poet when he married Plath after
they met in 1956 at Cambridge University, and critics say his
influence deepened his wife's poetic creativeness.
   The poet, who remarried 18 years ago, never talks to the media,
and his sister Olwyn, who sometimes speaks for him, did not return
phone calls.
   The Sunday Times of London reported in March that Hughes sent it
a 15-page rebuttal of Wagner-Martin's book after reading an early
draft of it.
   Hughes conceded that Plath may have resented his ``comparative
freedom'' but insisted that to suggest she was jealous of his
poetic ability would be ``a major misjudgment of her character,''
the paper said.
   Wagner-Martin told The Associated Press that she felt Hughes was
not sensitive enough to his wife's needs in the last months of
their marriage.
   ``I saw her daily calendar of the things she had to do, like
mowing, cooking and shopping, and there was no suggestion that Ted
was going to help with them,'' the professor said.
   However, critic Frank Kermode, reviewing the biography in
London's Sunday Telegraph, wrote: ``Surely the enemies she had to
deal with weren't housewifely duties and the selfishness of men,
but interior demons much more terrible.''
   Plath's best-known poems dealt with illness, suffering and death
_ she had already survived a suicide attempt at age 20.
   She is buried near Hughes' parents outside the churchyard wall
of St. Thomas the Apostle.
   ``I was told that it took some pressure to get a tombstone and
it was only put on her grave five or six years after the burial,''
Wagner-Martin said. ``I have no idea who interfered with the stone
and the grave, but I am sure it is not the people of Yorkshire.''
   Villager Ronald Eveleigh, 76, a retired engineer and admirer of
Plath's poetry, said he made a border of little stones around the
grave when the tombstone disappeared.
   ``I also got larger stones and scratched or painted the name of
Sylvia Plath on them so the grave could be identified by visitors,
but those were taken away, eight times altogether,'' he said.
   Eveleigh's wife Evelyn said she tried to discover who was
responsible for the grave.
   ``I couldn't find out, and it seemed the church authorities were
being evasive,'' she said, adding: ``I presume it's up to Ted
Hughes.''
   The Rev. John Harrison, vicar of Heptonstall, confirmed that the
Hughes family was responsible for the upkeep of the grave.
   ``The gravestone was removed last year because of vandalism. I
have no idea if the stone is going to be replaced,'' he said.

   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev toured Kremlin
churches Sunday, holding hands and dismissing their reported feuds
as ``rumors,'' but when talk turned to religious activities, the
Soviet first lady abruptly cut the conversation short.
   While President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev squared
off over human rights inside the Kremlin's Great Palace, the two
women wore smiles and strolled hand-in-hand toward the cameras in
an attempt to put to rest the stories about the tense relationship
that emerged from their last meeting at the Washington summit.
   ``We've gotten along very well every other time,'' a smiling
Mrs. Reagan said in response to queries about the supposed frosty
relationship.
   The Soviet first lady, true to the forthright style she
displayed at the White House, chimed in at length and insisted that
she considered such reports frivolous.
   ``Rumors have it, and there was a question, that there is some
misunderstanding between myself and the (president's) wife,'' she
replied through an interpreter. ``... I would like to say, I think
it's not serious.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev said her contacts with Mrs. Reagan have been part
of the on-going improvement in relations between the two
superpowers. ``We do have a lot to talk about and we are going to
have something to remember, which is very important. I welcome Mrs.
Reagan here and the president to Moscow,'' she said.
   At one point, Mrs. Reagan was asked whether former White House
chief of staff Donald T. Regan incorrectly portrayed her in his
book as having asked, after an extended dinner lecture from Mrs.
Gorbachev, ``Who does that dame think she is?''
   Mrs. Reagan, with an icy stare, replied curtly, ``Yes.''
   Even though the two women offered nearly constant smiles, the
first lady did display a bit of the impatience she'd shown during
the Washington summit as Mrs. Gorbachev maintained an extensive
dialogue with the press corps.
   During a tour of the Kremlin's sun-splashed Cathedral Square and
its ancient, golden-domed stone churches, the two first ladies were
often shoulder-to-shoulder, pointing at the sights and talking
through interpreters abot the fortress' collection of buildings
that served as the residence, places of worship and tombs of the
Czars.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, attired in a fitted, winter white wool suit and
dark suede high heels, repeatedly patted the back of her neck to
smooth her closely-cropped red hair. On her left shoulder, she wore
a gold and green-stone firebird, a famous figure in Russian fairy
tales. Mrs. Reagan wore a black-and-white checked Oscar de la Renta
two-piece suit, complete with black patent heels and purse and
white pique bowed blouse, all set off by a matching set of gold and
black bracelets, sparling earrings and a large stone ring.
   The Soviet first lady quickly took charge of the tour as she put
her arm about Mrs. Reagan's waist and guided her about the inside
the 14th century Cathedral of the Assumption, the largest and one
of the oldest churches-turned muesums in the Kremlin.
   The vaulted stone church, crowned with five gilded domes, has
40-foot high walls covered with a rich collection of priceless
paintings and icons that show scenes from the life of Christ and
the Virgin Mary. It is the repository of the finest and most
revered icons in Russia, some dating from the 12th century, brought
to the church and restored.
   After they entered the Cathedral, Mrs. Gorbachev was asked about
what she wanted to tell the American people about what the summit
should produce.
   ``Peace and friendship and that they understand the Soviet
people,'' she replied. Asked what else, the former university
lecturer shot back, ``What do you mean, what else? That's the most
important thing.``
   Mrs. Reagan, appearing a bit bewildered, was asked her
impressions of the Soviet Union. ``Wonderful, very exciting, it's a
little overwhelming,'' she replied, eyes wide and blinking.
   At that point, Mrs. Gorbachev interrupted, insisting, ``Please,
I beg you, allow us to see the cathedral.''
   The Soviet first lady then guided Mrs. Reagan from reporters and
launched into a lecture about the religious paintings that adorned
the golden wall that divides the church sanctuary from its main
hall. As they reached one icon depicting a sorrowful Virgin and the
infant Jesus touching the mother's cheek, Mrs. Gorbachev remarked
that it was one of the most beloved images in the nation.
   ``Very, very, very maternal,'' Mrs. Reagan remarked.
   Mrs. Reagan then turned from Mrs. Gorbachev and towards the
interpreter, asking, ``Now let me finish,'' and she queried whether
the cathedral was used mainly as a museum or for religious
activities.
   ``Nyet,'' responded Mrs. Gorbachev, to which the first lady
quickly replied, ``Oh, yes, nyet, the word `nyet,' that I
understand.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev then added that there had been no religious
observances in the Cathedral since 1918, but the interpreter
apparently corrected the date to 1917.
   ``It has obviously a very religious feeling,'' Mrs. Reagan said,
softly of the paintings. She then turned to Mrs. Gorbachev and
asked if it were true that a concert was planned for the cathedral
during next month's celebration of the millenium, the observance of
the 1,000-year anniversary of the spread of Christendom to Russia.
   ``Nyet,'' Mrs. Gorbachev replied curtly, putting her arm around
Mrs. Reagan's waist, briskly guiding her out the door and jumping
into a discussion of icons, frescoes, and wood carvings _ out of
reporters' earshot.
   According to Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, the
two women held hands again as they took a walk along the Kremlin
embankment that overlooks the Moscow River. Spectators applauded
the two women as they strolled about the cobblestone square, and
they then retired to the Great Kremlin Palace, where they had tea.
   Mrs. Crispen said the two discussed the supposed feud, and she
quoted Mrs. Gorbachev as saying, ``All these rumors are trivial
stories.''
   Mrs. Reagan then replied, speaking of the media, ``Yes, but you
can't get them to change their minds. I've told them so many times
that the rumors are not true,'' Mrs. Crispen quoted her as saying.
   The two ladies agreed that what was important was their
husbands' work and the change in relations between their two
nations, Mrs. Crispen said.

   A drowning, a missing swimmer, and a
boating accident that killed two people, injured five and left two
men missing and presumed dead marked this seaside resort's Memorial
Day weekend.
   Searches continued until Sunday night for a missing 16-year-old
boy who apparently was caught by undertow Saturday afternoon, and
for two men still missing from the boating accident late Saturday
night, authorities said.
   One woman was killed when an 19-foot boat carrying seven
passengers plowed into an anchored, 25-foot boat with two aboard
about a quarter-mile north of Ocean City, said Ralph Parker, a
Maryland Natural Resources Police spokesman.
   The seven were ejected into the water and none was wearing a
lifejacket, authorities said. Searchers found the body of a second
victim around 8 p.m. Sunday about 300 yards from the collision
site, officers said.
   The two men still missing were presumed dead, officials said.
   ``Most of the injuries seem to be impact injuries,'' said Sgt.
Michael Bloxom of the Natural Resources Police.``And there's a
possibility some of them might not have known how to swim.''
   Authorities would give no further details other than that a
23-year-old Baltimore woman died at the scene and five people were
taken to hospitals.
   The names of all nine people were withheld until relatives were
notified. Authorities confiscated both boats, but issued no
citations pending completion of the investigation.
   The 16-year-old Pennsylvania boy was reported missing Saturday
afternoon after he and a friend went swimming and were caught in
the undertow. The friend reached shore and alerted lifeguards.
   A search by Ocean City police, the beach patrol, the Coast Guard
and a state police helicopter Saturday turned up no trace of the
youth, whose name was not released.
   Around 8:30 a.m. Saturday, Robert S. Hinkleman, 28, of Glen
Burnie, apparently drowned in the surf, 90 minutes before
lifeguards went on duty for the first time in the beach season,
police said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans Experimental Rocket Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon plans to build an experimental
rocket that would be dropped from a B-52 bomber and used to launch
military satellites into space, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The three-stage, winged rocket would be dropped about seven
miles above the earth and then blast into space, placing payloads
of up to 600 pounds into orbit, The New York Times reported,
quoting government and industry experts.
   Officials have said they hope a prototype will fly next year.
   The Pentagon wants to test the rocket for a program designed to
develop light-weight satellites and launchers for various military
uses, including spy and communication satellites.
   The experimental rocket is being pursued by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, which develops futuristic projects for
the Pentagon.
   There is concern on Capitol Hill that the rocket could be
launched in secrecy, the Times reported.
   Although there is an agreement requiring space-faring countries
to notify the United Nations of all payloads going into orbit, the
rocket could be fired from remote parts of the world, far from
Soviet trawlers and spy satellites that monitor military launchings
from the United States.
   The Pentagon has given no indication that it would violate the
treaty obligation, but some military officials say privately that
it would be useful for the United States to have the option of
quick, secret launchings in the event of war.
   The Lightsat program, which includes the rocket, is part of a
five-year, $240 million effort.
   On May 13, the Pentagon signed a letter of contractual intent
with Orbital Sciences to buy one test rocket, with an option for
five more, industry sources say. Orbital Sciences would be joined
by Hercules, Inc. which makes solid-fuel rockets.
   The three-stage, solid-fuel rocket would weigh 15 tons and
measure 50 feet in length.
   Proponents say the air-launched rocket system would be
inexpensive, less vulnerable to attack than ground-based spaceports
and ideal for quickly launching small spy satellites to monitor
fast-moving battles.
   Donald C. Latham, a former assistant secretary of defense, said:
``The nation looked into air-launched rockets 20 years ago and
found them wanting. There are better ways to make systems low cost
and survivable.''

   President Reagan becomes the first U.S.
leader in 14 years to step foot on Soviet soil Sunday, carrying the
only superpower treaty to ban an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   But the summit was clouded by uncertainties that developed
Saturday, when U.S. officials said prospects had faded for signing
three secondary arms agreements and the Soviets harshly criticized
U.S. aid to Afghan rebels.
   Reagan and his wife Nancy were scheduled to board Air Force One
midmorning for a 90-minute flight to Moscow and the president's
fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The couple
planned to bid farewell to Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and his
wife, Tellervo, at an airport ceremony.
   The Reagans spent three days in this Baltic capital recuperating
from jet lag and preparing for their historic five-day visit to
Moscow.
   Reagan's chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr. arrived in Helsinki
on an overnight flight from Washington, bringing with him the newly
ratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF).
   Baker carried two bulging briefcases into the VIP lounge at the
Helsinki airport, where he waited to link up with Reagan for the
flight to Moscow.
   Reagan and Gorbachev will exchange ratification documents during
a Kremlin ceremony Wednesday morning. It is the first ratified
superpower arms treaty in 16 years, the first major arms control
agreement of the Reagan administration and the only treaty to ban
an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   The exchange ceremony substitutes for the previously hoped-for
signing of an agreement slashing by half the arsenals of strategic
nuclear weapons _ the most powerful and dangerous in the superpower
arsenals.
   Reagan was described Saturday by his national security adviser
Lt. Gen. Colin Powell as ``well rested,'' and looking forward to
his first session with the general secretary, scheduled withing an
hour of the president's arrival.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa arranged to greet their American
guests in the Kremlin's 200-foot long St. George's Hall, a gilded
and marble reception room on the second floor of the former
residence of the Czars.
   As the first ladies planned an afternoon tour of the fortress'
collection of churches, apartments and bell towers, the two men
were scheduled to meet over a table in the Hall of St. Catherine at
the west end of the palace.
   The U.S. Senate voted 93-5 on Friday to approve the INF treaty,
signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at their Washington December summit.
In a rare televised session, the Soviet Union's collective
presidency unanimously ratified the pact 17 hours later.
   A Soviet government spokesman described the action as ``a very
good prelude'' to Reagan's visit.
   But in a pre-summit snag, U.S. officials revealed that chances
had evaporated for signing an agreement on advance notification of
ballistic missile tests by the superpowers. And they said two
lesser arms-control measures may not be ready for signing during
Reagan's talks with Gorbachev.
   The agreements, while not major, would have given the leaders
grounds to boast of progress on arms control issues _ particularly
in view of the failure of the superpowers to conclude a treaty to
curb strategic nuclear weapons.
   Aside from the arms agenda, officials said they did not expect
``announceable progress'' on differences on human rights and
regional disputes.
   Asked by reporters in Washington about problems with the
secondary arms agreements, Baker said ``nothing will seriously
detract'' from the importance of the summit meeting.
   Soviet officials, meanwhile, criticized the United States for
its insistence on sending U.S. aid to Afghan rebels after the
withdrawal of Red Army troops. And they hinted they might halt
their withdrawal from Afghanistan if neighboring Pakistan failed to
stop aiding Afghan rebels.
   The Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Tass news agency
and the evening news show Vremya, took aim at the ``lavish supplies
of U.S. arms to Pakistan, intended specifically for the
anti-government Afghan forces.''
   The United States has been supplying Afghan rebels with an
estimated $500 million annually in arms and other military supplies
channeled through Pakistan. It has pledged to continue to do so as
long as the Soviet Union keeps up its military support of the
Afghan government.
   Asked about the Soviet comments, Baker told reporters, ``The
relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is
complex and spans many issues. A single summit or four summits, as
we've had now, isn't going to solve them all at one time. The
general relationship is better and I think prospects for general
peace are improved.''
   Gerald Ford was the last U.S. president to visit the Soviet
Union, traveling to the port of Vladivostock, located on the Sea of
Japan, in 1974. Richard Nixon met the same year in Moscow with the
late Leonid Brezhnev.
   Reagan, in an interview with Soviet television broadcast over
the weekend throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said he
could not have envisioned a trip to Moscow under the Soviet
leadership before Gorbachev.
   ``Very frankly, I have to say I think there is a difference
between this general secretary and other leaders of your country
.... I don't think they had any dreams of perestroika'' _
Gorbachev's program to restructure the nation's troubled economy.

   Here is the statement by Soviet Communist Party
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev welcoming President Reagan
to Moscow:
   Esteemed Mr. Ronald Reagan, president of the United States of
America, esteemed Mrs. Nancy Reagan, on behalf of the people and
government of the Soviet Union, I extend to you my sincere
greetings on the occasion of your visit. Welcome.
   It is now almost six months since our meeting in Washington,
which went down in history as a major milestone in Soviet-American
and international relations. Now on this return trip, you, Mr.
President, have traversed the great distance that lies between our
two capitals to continue our dialogue. This is a fact we duly
appreciate.
   As this is our fourth meeting, we can already make some
meaningful assessments. As we see it, long-held dislikes have been
weakened, habitual stereotypes stemming from enemy images have been
shaken loose.
   The human features of the other nation are now more clearly
visible. This in itself is important, for at the turn of the two
millenniums history has objectively bound our two countries by a
common responsibility for the destinies of mankind.
   The peoples of the world and, in the first place the Soviet and
the American people, welcome the emerging, positive changes in our
relationship and hope that your visit and talks here will be
productive, providing a fresh impetus in all areas of dialogue and
interaction between our two great nations.
   You and I are conscious of our two peoples' longing for mutual
understanding, cooperation and a safe and stable world. This makes
it incumbent on us to discuss constructively the main aspects of
disarmament.
   The set of issues related to 50 percent cuts in strategic
offensive arms while preserving the 1972 ABM treaty, problems of
eliminating chemical weapons, reductions in armed forces and
conventional armaments in Europe, cessation of nuclear testing.
   The world is also looking to us, Mr. President, for responsible
judgments on other complex issues of today, such as the settlement
of regional conflicts, improving international economic relations,
promoting development, overcoming backwardness, poverty and mass
diseases, and humanitarian problems. And of course we shall discuss
bilateral relations.
   Our previous meetings have showed that constructive Soviet-U.S.
relations are possible. The treaty on intermediate and shorter
range missiles is the most impressive symbol of that. But even more
important and complex problems lie ahead of that.
   And so, Mr. President, you and I still have a lot of work to do
and it is good when there's a lot of work to be done and people
need that work. We are ready to do our utmost in these coming days
in Moscow.
   Mr. President, you and Mrs. Reagan are here on your first visit
to the Soviet Union, a country which you have so often mentioned in
your statements. Aware of your interest in Russian proverbs, let me
add another one to your collection: It is better to see once than
to hear a hundred times.
   Let me assure you that you can look forward to hospitality,
warmth and good will. You will have many meetings with Soviet
people. They have a centuries-old history behind them. They love
their land and take pride in their accomplishments.
   They resent things that are presently standing in their way and
they are heatedly discussing how their country can best progress.
They are full of plans for the future.
   Being ardent patriots, Soviet people are open to friendship and
cooperation with all nations. They harbor sincere respect for the
American people and want good relations with your country.
   Here within the walls of the ancient Kremlin, where one feels
the touch of history, people are moved to reflect over the
diversity and greatness of human civilization. So may this give
greater historical depth to the Soviet-American talks to be held
here, infusing them with a sense of mankind's shared destinies.
Once again, I bid you welcome.

<HEAD>Pope Names 25 New Cardinals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II named 25 new cardinals
Sunday, including the archbishops of Detroit, Washington, Vienna
and Hong Kong and a prelate from Lithuania, the Roman Catholic
stronghold of the Soviet Union.
   The pope made the announcement at the end of a Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica during which ordained 69 new priests from 25
countries. He said he would formally elevate the new cardinals at
the Vatican on June 28.
   The new cardinals include Archbishops James Hickey of
Washington, Edmund Casimir Szoka of Detroit, Hans Groer of Vienna,
and John Baptist Wu Cheng-Chung of Hong Kong. The new Lithuanian
cardinal is Vincentas Sladkevicius, apostolic administrator of
Kaisiadorys.
   Other new ``princes'' of the Roman Catholic Church include
Archbishops Paul Gregoire of Montreal, Canada; Jose Freire Falcao
of Brasilia, Brazil; Alexandre Jose Maria dos Santos of Maputo,
Mozambique; Simon Ignatius Pimenta of Bombay, India; Mario Revollo
Bravo of Bogota, Colombia; Edward Clancy of Sydney, Australia;
Lucas Moreira Neves of Sao Salvador da Bahia, the primate of
Brazil; and Laszlo Paskai of Esztergom, primate of Hungary.
   The pope also named Archbishop Christian Tumi of Garoua,
Cameroon; Franz Hengsbach of bishop of Essen, West Germany; Jean
Margeot, bishop of Port Louis, Mauritius; Anthony Padiyara,
archbishop of Ernakulam of the Siro Malabaresi rite in India; and
Swiss theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar.
   The appointments bring membership to the college of cardinals to
161, of whom 120 are under the age of 80 and eligible to vote to
elect a new pope. Pope Paul VI had ruled that only cardinals under
80 could participate in a conclave and he also limited their number
to 120.
   In his announcement Sunday, the pope said he still will not
reveal the name of a cardinal he chose ``in pectore'' _ in his
heart _ in 1979. There has always been speculation the prelate came
from a communist country.
   In all, the new cardinals come from 18 countries and include
several Vatican-based officials. Among them are Archbishop Achille
Silvestrini, who is equivalent to the Vatican's foreign minister;
Archbishop Antonio Maria Javierre Ortas, head of the Congregation
for Catholic Education, and Archbishop Jacques Martin, prefect of
the papal household.
   The session on June 28 will be the fourth held by John Paul II
since his election as pope in 1978. The last was in 1985.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev opened their historic summit Sunday with an exchange of
Russian proverbs and a vow to continue the work begun 2{ years ago
in Geneva. ``We both know it won't be easy,'' Reagan said.
   Not long after the Reagans arrived by motorcade from Vnukovo
Airport outside Moscow, they walked across a long red carpet to the
center of a 200-foot-long chandaliered and gilded reception room in
St. George's Hall, where their paths crossed Gorbachev's and his
wife's.
   Gorbachev and Reagan reminisced briefly about earlier summits in
Geneva, Reykjavik, Iceland and Washington, while their wives, Nancy
Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev, looked on in an inside-the-Kremlin
scene broadcast live by Soviet television and seen by millions in
the United States and around the world.
   Reagan, who once called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' had
arrived on Soviet soil for the first time, under sunny skies, just
after 2 p.m. local time. He was greeted there by Soviet President
Andrei Gromyko, for years the foreign minister, and Gromyko's wife,
Lidia, who gave a bouquet of roses to Mrs. Reagan.
   Amid mixed expectations about the success of the five days of
talks, coming in the wake of problems with secondary arms-control
measures and new Soviet complaints of continuing U.S. aid to Afghan
rebels, Gorbachev set a conciliatory tone, telling Reagan that
``important tasks lie ahead.''
   ``You and I are conscious of our two people's longing for mutual
understanding, cooperation and a safe world,'' said Gorbachev,
speaking through an interpreter. ``This makes it incumbent upon us
to discuss ... the major aspects of disarmament.''
   Reagan told his Soviet counterpart that U.S.-Soviet relations
have improved since their first meeting, in Geneva in November
1985, saying ``we have taken our work, step by step, and I have
come here to continue that work.''
   Inside the Kremlin, Gorbachev seemed to gently tweak Reagan
about the president's many speeches and jokes about life in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Mr. President, you and Mrs. Reagan are here on your first
visit to the Soviet Union, a country which you have so often
mentioned in your public statements ... Let me add another to your
collection, `It is better to see once than to hear a hundred
times.'''
   Reagan had his own proverb for Gorbachev.
   Speaking of the gradual progress in superpower relations over
recent years, and noting that differences remain, Reagan, speaking
first in Russian, told Gorbachev: ``Rodilsya, ne toropilsya,'' or
``It was born. It wasn't rushed.''
   ``Mr. General Secretary, we did not rush. We have taken our work
step by step, and I have come here to continue that work. We both
know it will not be easy.''
   Sitting down with Gorbachev for a picture-taking session at the
outset of their first meeting, Reagan was asked whether he intended
to lecture the Kremlin leader about human rights.
   ``I have no intention of trying to be a teacher,'' he replied.
   The Reagans spent three days in Helsinki, Finland, recuperating
from jet lag and preparing for their historic five-day visit to
Moscow.
   Reporters shouted questions as Reagan posed briefly with Gromyko
and other members of the arrival party here.
   ``We're getting along just fine,'' Reagan said.
   As reporters continued to yell questions, Gromyko turned to
Reagan and said, ``They want to know in advance everything.
   Reagan then shook hands with a host of dignitaries, including
Yuri Dubinin, currently the Soviet ambassador to Washington, and
paused briefly while standing under the Soviet flag bearing the
hammer and sickle. Reagan stood before march Soviet troops,
swinging their legs in the traditional Russaian military goose-step
fashion.
   Reagan's chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr. arrived in Helsinki
on an overnight flight from Washington, bringing with him the newly
ratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF).
   Baker carried two bulging briefcases into the VIP lounge at the
Helsinki airport, where he waited to link up with Reagan for the

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's
statement Sunday at the opening of his summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mr. General Secretary, Mrs. Gorbachev.
   Mr. General Secretary, thank you for those kind words of welcome.
   We've traveled a long road together to reach this moment, from
our first meeting in Geneva in November 1985 when I invited you to
visit me in Washington and you invited me to visit Moscow.
   It was cold that day in Geneva and even colder in Reykjavik when
we met the following year to work on the preparations for our
exchange of visits. We faced great obstacles, but by the time of
your visit to Washington last December, although we still had to
grapple with difficult issues, we had achieved impressive progress
in all the areas of our common agenda, human rights, regional
issues, arms reduction and our bilateral relations.
   We signed a treaty that will reduce the level of nuclear arms
for the first time in history by eliminating an entire class of
U.S. and Soviet independent range missiles. We agreed on the main
points of a treaty that will cut in half our arsenals of strategic
offensive nuclear arms. We agreed to conduct a joint experiment
that would allow us to develop effective ways to verify limits on
nuclear testing.
   We held full and frank discussions and planted the seeds for
future progress.
   It is almost summer and some of those seeds are beginning to
bear fruit thanks to the hard work we have both done since our last
meeting, including monthly meetings of our foreign ministers and
the first meeting of our defense ministers.
   We have signed the Geneva accords providing for the withdrawal
of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the first withdrawals
have begun. We and our allies have completed technical arrangements
necessary to begin implementing the INF treaty as soon as it enters
into force.
   For the next major step in arms control, reductions in U.S. and
Soviet strategic offense arsenals, our negotiators in Geneva have
produced hundreds of pages of joint draft treaty text, recording
our areas of agreement as well as those issues still to be resolved.
   Our new nuclear risk reduction centers have begun their
transmissions of routine notifications to reduce the risk of
conflict. Our scientists are installing the equipment for our joint
experiment to verify limits on nuclear testing. Our experts have
held broad-ranging discussions on human rights and important steps
have been taken in that area.
   We have greatly expanded our bilateral exchanges since we signed
our agreement in 1985. I hope you'll agree with me that more of our
young people need to participate in these exchanges, which can do
so much to lay the basis for mutual understanding in the next
generation.
   I could go on. The list of accomplishments goes far beyond what
many anticipated. But I think the message is clear: Despite clear
and fundamental differences and despite the frustrations that we
have encountered, our work has begun to produce results.
   In the past, Mr. General Secretary, you've taken note of my
liking for Russian proverbs. And so as not to disappoint anyone on
this visit, I thought I would mention a literary saying from your
past, another example of your peoples' succinct wisdom.
   ``Rodilsya, ne Toropilsya'' _ It was born, it wasn't rushed.
   Mr. General Secretary, we did not rush. We have taken our work
step by step, and I have come here to continue that work. We both
know it will not be easy, we both know it will not be easy. We both
know there are tremendous hurdles yet to be overcome.
   But we also know that it can be done because we share a common
goal, strengthening the framework we have already begun to build
for a relationship that we can sustain over the long term, a
relationship that will bring genuine benefits to our own peoples
and to the world.
   Thank you and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   After paying tribute to the nation's war dead
in a traditional Memorial Day ceremony, a brass band will wend its
way through a pioneer cemetery Monday to salute a 19th century
madam called ``the hooker with the heart of gold.''
   ``It's tongue-in-cheek,'' said ceremony chairman Larry
McNichols. ``It's certainly not a part of the formal program.''
   McNichols' mother for years brought a yellow rose to mark Anna
Wilson's grave as part of a tradition begun by those who had
benefited from the madam's charitable donations.
   McNichols and several friends rekindled interest in the generous
woman he calls a ``soiled dove.'' The Prospect Hill Preservation
Brass Band has played in her memory each Memorial Day since 1980.
   The 25-piece band will visit Miss Wilson's grave after the
traditional Memorial Day observance at Prospect Hill Cemetery,
which sits on a hill near the old Oregon Trail where thousands of
pioneers pushed their way west past Omaha.
   Miss Wilson ran the city's highest-priced house of ill-repute
for about 30 years. She retired from the business in the mid-1890s,
investing her money in real estate.
   Miss Wilson died in 1911, soon after giving her former house of
prostitution to the city for use as a hospital. Her will left an
estate valued at $1 million to be divided among the city,
hospitals, a mission, children's charities and the cemetery.
   The madam-turned-philanthropist is buried among some of the
leading citizens of her time _ judges, doctors, politicians,
ministers and brewery barons.
   ``Everybody that was anybody is buried in that cemetery,'' said
Louise Baumann, president of the cemetery foundation.
   Details are sparse on the early life of Miss Wilson, born the
daughter of a Baptist minister in Georgia in 1835. She achieved
notoriety soon after arriving in Omaha in 1867, the year Nebraska
became a state.
   ``The first territorial capitol was between Douglas and Farnam
on Ninth Street, and Anna Wilson's establishment was right around
the corner from it,'' McNichols said.
   Miss Wilson met riverboat gambler Dan Allen in 1871. They lived
together, unmarried, until he died 1884, and they are buried
side-by-side under a large stone slab.
   The Wilson house of prostitution was one of several in the
city's old red-light district, a few blocks from the Missouri River
adjacent to what is now downtown Omaha.

<TEXT>
   It's 2 a.m. in Moscow and Peter Jennings ought to
be asleep, but he isn't. He's taping the evening news for ABC.
   In daylight hours, ABC's Pierre Salinger wanders around the
Hotel Rossiya with shirttail out; CBS's Charles Kuralt dashes
upstairs to file a story; columnist Roland Evans looks despairingly
for the CNN studio so he can interview Soviet spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov. And the gofers _ go for this, go for that _ are
everywhere.
   Like invading armies, the television networks have moved in,
bringing an entourage of hundreds and a mountain of
high-technology. Their beachhead is the Hotel Rossiya overlooking
Red Square and the Kremlin.
   And the toughest negotiations of the summit may have preceded
President Reagan's arrival here Sunday. The networks convinced
Soviet authorities to improve the lighting of Red Square for a
backdrop on the evening newscasts.
   Virtually every big-name network personality is vying for summit
air time.
   CBS's Dan Rather wants to put the summit in the context of
changes under way in the Soviet Union; ABC's Jennings did some
man-on-the-street interviews; Tom Brokaw of NBC has the only
terrace anchor station, and CNN is the only network shown in Soviet
hotels.
   The networks have brought their own satellite dishes, microwave
transmissions, walkie-talkies, telephones, electrical generators,
copying machines, Fax machines _ and, in some cases, shipped in
their food.
   ``Be Careful _ Radio Radiation,'' reads a sign in front of three
giant satellite dishes outside the Rossiya.
   ABC offered to provide its staff with smoke alarms at the
Rossiya, a 3,000-room hotel where more than 30 people were killed
in a fatal fire in 1977. It even has a daily newsletter for its
people, entitled ``Moscow Newsletter.''
   Uniformed Soviet officials pace up and down the Rossiya's halls,
where rooms are packed with televisions, monitors and other gear.
On the fifth floor, the networks built outdoor booths so reporters
can conduct interviews with the Kremlin wall and St. Basil's
Cathedral as a backdrop.
   NBC said it plans to broadcast its Nightly News live, while ABC
and CBS plan something called ``tape live,'' which provides a
slight delay. That's the middle of the night Moscow time.
   Thus the lighting of St. Basil's took on added import for the
networks. They entered into negotiations with the Kremlin, Moscow
city officials and Gostelradio, the Soviet broadcast network, and
the lighting crisis was resolved satisfactorily, said William Lord,
executive director at ABC-TV.
   Each network has about 100 people in Moscow, including
Russian-speaking American students who have been recruited to serve
as everything from office gofers to interpreters.
   But for all the trouble and expense, network executives say
serious summit scoops may be difficult to come by in the Soviet
Union, where bureaucrats and officials aren't as sensitive to the
demands of television.
   ``They are less responsive in terms of time,'' said Joe Angotti,
an NBC executive producer. Added CBS executive producer Lane
Vernardos: ``When in Rome, do as the Romans do does not work for
television.''
   With their own technology, television is able to transmit
directly to a satellite, and then back to the United States. ``We
are independent of the Soviets,'' Lord said.
   But while the American broadcasters, along with their European
and Japanese counterparts, have tried to stay clear of the Soviets,
network executives say the people at Gostelradio have given them
unprecedented leeway.
   ``They really want to cooperate and they are trying to be
flexible,'' said NBC's Angotti.
   Television reporters say the Soviets essentially have kept to
their pre-summit pledge that journalists ``can talk to anybody they
wish.'' They've interviewed dissidents, took trips outside Moscow
by train and talked with students at Moscow State University.
   ``People are more willing to talk about more than they have been
before,'' Rather said.
   No one wants to say how much money they're spending on the
summit, but Tom Bettag, a CBS producer for the nightly news, thinks
it's going to be worth it.
   ``We've made a heavy commitment because other news is likely to
be slight,'' he said. ``Congress is on the Memorial Day vacation,
and there is a hole before the primaries so it will be extremely
quiet back home.''

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Denounce Vietnamese Withdrawal from Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas denounced as
``stinking and deceitful'' an announcement by Vietnam that it would
pull 50,000 troops from Cambodia this year, according to a
broadcast made available Sunday.
   A communique released Saturday by the Khmer Rouge military
command said Hanoi actually was shifting its troops around Cambodia
in a frantic attempt to counter escalating guerrilla attacks.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978, is fighting a
coalition of three resistance groups including the communist Khmer
Rouge. On Thursday, it announced a partial pullout of 50,000 troops
to be followed by a total withdrawal in 1990.
   Vietnam says it has made annual withdrawals since 1982, but the
United States says the only genuine pullout was in November, when
20,000 troops were withdrawn.
   The United States estimates Vietnam still has 120,000 to 125,000
troops in Cambodia and says the other troop movements were only
rotations.
   Vietnam and the pro-Hanoi regime in Cambodia said better
security in the country made possible the Vietnamese reduction
scheduled to begin next month.
   But the Khmer Rouge communique, broadcast over the clandestine
Khmer Rouge radio, said Vietnam this month has been ``moving troops
back and forth from one battlefield to another aimlessly like a
frightened monkey'' to withstand guerrilla strikes. It called the
claim ``stinking and deceitful.''
   ``There is no sign that the Vietnamese enemy is preparing to
withdraw 50,000 troops from Cambodia,'' the communique said. ``This
is more shameless propaganda to deceive world public opinion.''
   The communique cited details of what it claimed to be Vietnamese
troop movements in recent months.
   Western analysts regard Khmer Rouge claims with suspicion and
most are not verified by independent sources.
   On Saturday, China also said the Vietnamese claims of troop
withdrawal were deceptive.
   The Khmer Rouge is the most powerful of three rebel groups in a
coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Announcements of the
Vietnamese withdrawal have sparked some fears that the Khmer Rouge
could return to power.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnamese
invasion. Millions of Cambodians were killed or died of starvation
or disease in the regime's attempt to impose radical agrarian
communism.

<HEAD>Six Dead in Assassination Attempt; Three Indian Soldiers Slain In
Ambush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sinhalese extremists opened fire with
automatic rifles at the home of a politician and killed six people,
including the politician's 10-year-old daughter, police said Sunday.
   In northern Sri Lanka, Tamil rebels ambushed a convoy of Indian
troops and killed at least three soldiers, residents said.
   The politician, K.W.R. Dharmasena, his wife and three supporters
were injured in the assassination attempt late Saturday night, said
a police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance
with police regulations.
   He said the dead included Dharmasena's daughter and his father.
The other victims, all men, were relatives of Dharmasena, he said.
   The attack occurred in the town of Homagama, 12 miles southeast
of Colombo.
   Earlier Saturday, an opposition party candidate and two of his
supporters were shot to death by suspected Sinhalese nationalists
in the town of Natala, 65 miles northeast of Colombo.
   They were the latest in a series of attacks blamed on the
People's Liberation Front, an underground group of nationalist
Sinhalese opposed to an accord signed last July to end violence by
Tamil separatists.
   The Tamil ambush in the northern district of Vavuniya killed
three soldiers and wounded at least five other Indian troops, said
residents who spoke on condition of anonymity. They did not know of
any rebel casualties.
   There was no comment from the Indian government.
   At least 50,000 Indian soldiers have been deployed in Sri Lanka
to disarm Tamil rebels who renounced the peace accord. India, which
as a large Tamil population of its own, sponsored the accord. The
plan calls for Tamils to lay down their arms in exchange for the
creation of district councils.
   Sinhalese extremists contend the pact makes too many concessions
to the Tamils, who are fighting for a separate homeland.
   Dharmasena is a candidate from the governing United National
Party for elections scheduled next Thursday.
   At least 19 candidates have been killed by the Sinhalese front
in the past two months, and there have been 12 assassination
attempts on candidates.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
military.

   A bomb exploded in a Moslem mosque in
this northern town early Sunday, damaging its interior and
shattering windows of neighboring buildings. Police said no one was
injured.
   Police said a gasoline bomb was tossed into another mosque in
the area 15 minutes later, sparking a fire that was immediately
extinguished.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
bomb was placed at the mosque's entrance.
   About half of Komotini's 35,000 residents are Moslems. The town
in the province of Thrace is about 35 miles west of the Turkish
border.
   The attacks came two days after political cooperation talks
ended in Athens between senior Greek officials and a Turkish
delegation led by Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
   Relations between the two countries have improved since premiers
Andreas Papandreou of Greece and Turgut Ozal of Turkey met in
Davos, Switzerland, in January.
   Another meeting between the two leaders is scheduled in the
Greek capital June 13.

   At least five people have died and
thousands have been forced to flee their homes because of flooding
in Bangladesh's northeastern districts, government officials and
news reports said Sunday.
   Last summer, more than one-quarter of the nation's 105 million
people were forced to flee the worst flooding in 70 years.
   This year, heavy rains and the annual snow melt from the
Himalaya mountains have sent the Surma and Kushiara rivers in the
northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj over their banks.
   Government officials in Sylhet, 100 miles northeast of Dhaka,
said Sunday that three people died when their house was washed away
and that two others drowned.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least 30,000 people have been marooned. Thousands of others made
their way to relief camps and were being aided by local Red Cross
officers and government agencies.
   The government-owned Bengalai-language Dainik Bangla newspaper
said at least 500,000 people had been driven from their homes
during the past week of rain and flooding.
   Thousands of acres of tea plantations and rice paddies were
reported inundated. Rice is a staple food in Bangladesh.
   Some market towns in Sunamganj District were reported under two
feet of water.
   Schools in both districts have been closed, and some have been
converted to relief centers for the homeless, the officials said.
   The government officials said flights were disrupted at the
airport at Sylhet on Saturday.
   Last year, two months of serious flooding killed about 1,500
people and destroyed thousands of acres of crops.

<TEXT>
   President Najib on Sunday convened
Afghanistan's first Parliament in 15 years with a call for Moslem
guerrillas to lay down their arms immediately and take legislative
seats held open for them.
   He said he would not concede any territory to the guerrillas,
who have been fighting his Soviet-backed government for a decade.
   In a 20-minute speech interrupted seven times by applause from
members of the Parliament, Najib continued his efforts to protray
himself as no longer the leader of a one-party state.
   The Parliament was elected April 14 as part of a government
effort to widen its base. It consists of the House of
Representatives and a 158-member Senate and replaces the
Revolutionary Council as Afghanistan's law-making body.
   The guerrilla groups called the elections a farce.
   Najib's People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan holds only 46
seats _ or 25 percent _ of the 184 occupied seats in the House of
Representatives. But virtually all the rest are held by groups or
individuals with ties to the government, according to foreign
observers.
   Two former guerrillas hold what the government calls
``opposition'' seats.
   There are 50 vacant seats that Najib says have been left open
for the guerrillas if they stop fighting. The vacancies are for
electoral districts which are either controlled by the guerrillas
or are the scenes of heavy fighting.
   ``We are ready to listen to the views of the opposition,'' Najib
said, speaking in the Pushtu language. ``We are ready to receive
them in Kabul.''
   A translation was provided in English for foreign diplomats and
journalists.
   The Parliament was convened in the ornately columned,
gilt-ceilinged star palace in the foreign ministry compound. The
legislators, some in turbans and robes, others in Western attire,
were brought to the compound in buses guarded by soldiers.
   Inside the palace, no shooting was heard during the opening
session, but each day, artillery booms around Kabul, which sprawls
on a plain around the bases of several hills.
   Najib said the signing of an accord last month providing for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan ``opened new doors for
peace in Afghanistan,'' but he said it ``does not mean overnight
peace.''
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have not halted their battle despite
the start of the Soviet withdrawal May 15, and they say they'll
keep fighting as long as Najib, a former secret police commander,
remains in power.
   Rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent since
Soviet troops started withdrawing. The Kabul Times reported that
five people were killed in rocket attacks Friday.
   The Parliament opened with a black-bearded clergyman intoning
verses from the Koran, and Najib prefaced his speech with ``in the
name of Allah, the merciful and almighty.''
   The Afghan president spoke of his desire for a ``neutral and
non-aligned nation,'' but he also spoke of continued friendship
with the Soviet Union. He said his government wanted a ``mixed
economy and foreign investment so that all Afghans in their shops
can carry out their work and be sure of their future.''
   The last Parliament met in 1973, the year King Zahir Shah was
ousted in a coup by his cousin, Mohammad Daoud. Daoud was
assassinated five years later in a coup that installed a
Soviet-style government.

<HEAD>Tom Hayden Discusses His Life and Politics at Book Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California legislator Tom Hayden, the
former radical protest leader, said at a booksellers' convention he
has revised his thinking about the death penalty.
   While being questioned about his recently published book,
``Reunion: A Memoir,'' Hayden was asked Saturday if he's withdrawn
his opposition to the death penalty.
   ``I've come to a kind of tortured conclusion that I'm not going
to lead a fight to repeal the death penalty,'' said Hayden, a
Democratic Assemblyman who represents Santa Monica.
   ``We live in a society in Calfornia that is very open and very
violent,'' Hayden said. ``People who commit murders are generally
in prison about eight years and then they are back on the streets.
Until that is corrected, I'm not going to oppose the death
penalty.''
   Hayden, who is married to actress Jane Fonda, was at the 88th
annual convention of the American Booksellers Association to
promote his book, published by Random House.
   In ``Reunion,'' Hayden looks back at the political turbulence of
the 1960s as the beginning of his disillusionment with government,
then follows through to a renewal of his faith in government
growing out of the Watergate scandal.
   ``It's a story that began as a history and it became more
personal as time went on because I was searching for truth about
the '60s and about my youth,'' Hayden said.
   Hayden said he believed in the 1960s that America was drifting
toward a police state.
   But after Watergate, ``I had to try to understand that many of
the people who had tried to put me in jail had failed and were
going to jail themselves.''

   Democrats were elated with the photo, buried
in the B-section of The New York Times, of a crane installing media
booths in the hall that will host the party's convention this
summer.
   ``It's the appearance of motion ... Things looked like they were
screwed up and now it looks like things are happening,'' party
spokesman Mike McCurry said, only half in jest as he referred to
the convention's public relations debacle of a week earlier.
   McCurry quickly added that the Atlanta convention plans are in
fact on track, following a press walkthrough two weeks ago that
left media representatives with a sinking feeling that things were
nightmarishly behind schedule.
   The party is scurrying to undo the perception that their July
18-21 presidential nominating convention will be a logistics
disaster, and moving to keep that perception from becoming reality.
   By way of damage control, convention Chairman Don Fowler rushed
out a letter to all media organizations promising the staff is
``vigorously pursuing appropriate action'' to respond to questions
that went unanswered at the walkthrough.
   He promised a press packet June 1 to include such information as
a critical vendor list, for necessities like furniture and
utilities. Such a list went out about a month earlier at the
party's 1984 convention.
   Written materials and informed staff members were on hand to
reassure the press at a second walkthrough a few days later that
their concerns are being handled on such matters as housing,
vendors and ``turnaround credentials'' that allow reporters to give
their pass to a colleague when leaving the floor.
   Emphasis is being placed on the fact there will be an increase
of 10 to 15 percent above 1984 numbers of media credentials issued.
   Convention veteran Wally Podrazik, who has handled media
logistics in past years was brought on board the day of the first
walkthrough, and this weekend will be joined by Cynthia Myers to
help with media arrangements.
   The person responsible for the media-tour foul-up was ousted,
and McCurry, who headed the Democratic National Committee press
office, has assumed overall responsibility as communications
director for both the party and the convention.
   ``We're in a lot better shape than many people suspect,''
McCurry insisted.
   He and others involved with the convention say the basics _
housing, transportation and credentials _ are more or less
arranged. But the staff members knowledgeable on those matters were
not at the first media tour on May 16.
   ``It is fair to say we did not put our best foot forward in that
walkthrough,'' said convention press secretary Ruth Berry.
   The presidential campaigns of Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson,
however, say they are having no problems as they embark on their
own convention preparations.
   ``All the things we feel we need to do are getting done,'' said
Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Jackson logistics manager John O'Leary said he has had nothing
but cooperation, and ``It's basically a wide open door of
information'' from the convention officials.
   But O'Leary, a veteran convention staffer who managed the hall
for the 1984 convention in San Francisco, also said he sees the
Atlanta operation as comparatively behind schedule even in light of
his observation that ``Democratic conventions are inherently
complicated disorganized functions.''
   ``I wish they would have picked up a greater number of
experienced people earlier,'' said O'Leary. ``The convention will
happen. It's just a question of how much pain and grief will be
suffered and by whom.''
   He noted the drumbeat of concerns being voiced about the size of
the Omni basketball arena, which will seat 11,000, compared to the
15,000 seating capacity in 1984 at the Moscone Center Hall.
   The Democrats have solved the problem _ providing comparatively
more total seating _ by using the Georgia World Congress Center,
across the street from the Omni, for media workspace, spillover
viewing areas via large screens, and office and reception rooms.
   But that does not mean that spectators and party bigwigs are
going to be happy being relegated to watching the convention from
across the street.
   The Democrats are doing a hard sell to make the WCC seem an
attractive alternative. There, said McCurry, people can sprawl out
in comfort instead of being squished in the crowded Omni, and ``be
handed a refreshment by a young Democrat.''
   ``We are going to be agressively promoting the World Congress
Center as a place to hold meetings and briefings and press
conferences,'' he said.
   As for the Omni, everyone sighed with relief last week when the
Atlanta Hawks were edged out of the National Basketball Association
playoffs. That assured they would not tie up the Omni convention
hall until late June.
   ``Thank God the Celtics beat the Hawks,'' said Marcia Hale, in
charge of Dukakis campaign convention arrangements.
   The Omni is now available, but an access problem remains for the
World Congress Center which is booked with a trade convention until
the first of July.
   Because of that, the media trailers, cables and arrangements
that normally would be done over six or seven weeks will have to be
completed in just over two weeks, said Jeff Gralnick, vice
president and executive producer of special programming for ABC
News.
   Gralnick was philosophical about the foul-up, noting the
Republican convention in New Orleans has had no such problems, but
that, ``It's axiomatic that Republicans are more organized than
Democrats.''

   Former City Councilman Lee Cooke handily
defeated incumbent Mayor Frank Cooksey in his bid for a second
three-year term, besting the mayor by more than 15 percent of the
vote in a weekend runoff.
   Turnout for Saturday's election was put at about 20 percent by
City Clerk Elden Aldridge, who said: ``It's a lower turnout than
anything we have had in a number of years. I would say it's lower
because of Memorial Day weekend and people scattered here and
there.''
   With all the vote in, Cooke had 36,985 votes, or 58.4 percent,
to 26,308, or 41.6 percent, for Cooksey.
   Cooke, 43, a former president of this capital city's Chamber of
Commerce, captured 40 percent of the vote in the May 7 non-partisan
primary to advance to the runoff against Cooksey, 54, who ran
second in the field of eight with 32 percent.
   At issue in the campaign were the city's sagging economy and
rising taxes and utility rates.
   Austin was caught in an economic downturn several months into
Cooksey's first term and ``fairly or unfairly the business
community regarded him as their mortal enemy,'' said Dean Rindy,
Cooksey's media adviser.
   ``Frank had the misfortune to get elected mayor of Disneyland
just when the power got cut off,'' Rindy said.
   During the campaign, Cooksey tried to emphasize his
accomplishments, many of them in the environmental area, such as
the passage of bonds to clean up sewage discharge and the
implementation of a watershed ordinance.
   Cooke, meanwhile, blamed the downturn in the economy on Cooksey
and said the City Council, with Cooksey in the lead, was not doing
enough to keep the budget in line and attract businesses to Austin.
   He is reported to have spent $364,000 on his mayoral bid to
$272,000 by Cooksey.

   Mother Teresa says she would
like to build a hospice for AIDS patients in Vancouver similar to
facilities she has started in the United States.
   ``Our brothers and sisters suffering from AIDS are the people
that need very tender, loving care,'' the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
nun told reporters Saturday at Vancouver International Airport.
   She said she was in Vancouver ``to help the poorest of the
poor.''
   But whether the Catholic archdiocese would support her plan was
not immediately clear.
   Archdiocese spokesman Rev. William Mendenhall said the
establishment of a Catholic hospice would have to be discussed
between Archbishop James Carney and Mother Teresa.
   ``She said she would like to care for them, but I guess the
final aspects of her motion will be between her and the
archbishop,'' said Mendenhall.

   Chicago music fans may love their football
Bears, but in Colorado, the Broncos don't seem to have the same
appeal.
   A Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra concert that was to have
featured members of the Denver Broncos football team manhandling
the baton had to be canceled after only 40 advance tickets were
sold.
   The concert, patterned after a similar event in Chicago, had
been scheduled Saturday at the University of Colorado Events Center
in Boulder.
   Billed as ``The Denver Broncos Classical Rock Concert,'' it also
was the first scheduled Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra concert to
be canceled in 32 years, said orchestra general manager Jim Hanifin.
   He thought he would have a box-office smash when he heard that
20,000 tickets were sold to watch Chicago Bears football legend
Walter Payton conduct an orchestra in Chicago.
   So he set up the concert in which the 100-member orchestra would
play hits from the Beatles, Star Wars and Bruce Springsteen in full
orchestration, with members of the NFL's American Football
Conference champions on the podium.
   Among the Broncos who had agreed to participate were Vance
Johnson, Ricky Nattiel and Mark Jackson _ known as the Three Amigos
_ and Keith Bishop and Steve Watson. Proceeds were to benefit the
Broncos Youth Foundation's efforts to combat substance abuse.
   ``I am at a total loss to understand where we messed up,''
Hanifin said. ``If Steve Watson can't draw 15,000 women, there's
something wrong.''
   Hanifin said he'll contact a Denver polling firm to conduct a
survey to find out why the show didn't attract a crowd.

   CBS reporter Harry Reasoner returned to
Iowa to marry a New York health insurance executive in a private
ceremony.
   Reasoner, 65, a regular on the news show ``60 Minutes,'' married
44-year-old Lois Harriet Weber in a 25-minute ceremony Saturday
before about 30 people, mostly family, at the United Church of
Christ.
   ``I'm happy to be back, but I`m not sure when I'll be back
again,'' he said as he posed for photographers for a few minutes.
   Reasoner, dressed in a gray suit and red tie, said he and his
new wife would leave Sunday for a honeymoon in Colorado before
returning to his home in Westport, Conn. Ms. Weber wore a
calf-length pink dress.
   ``Growing up in Humboldt gave me a built-in defense against
critics who accuse major media organizations of having an East
Coast liberal bias,'' Reasoner said before the ceremony.
   A private reception was held after the wedding.

   Elizabeth Condon and Victor Novikov,
separated for more than eight years by the Soviet government, were
married on the eve of the summit between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Condon, who teaches Russian and French in the Woburn public
schools, said, ``It's rather nice'' that the wedding Saturday
coincided with the summit in Moscow.
   Condon, 45, of Lynn and Nokikov, 56, an unemployed research
chemist from Moscow, had planned to marry in the Soviet Union in
1979, but Soviet officials blocked the wedding.
   Condon for years was denied visas to visit the Soviet Union and
Novikov was not allowed to emigrate. But the couple learned five
days before the December 1987 summit in Washington that Novikov
could come to this country. They were reunited in New York City on
March 26.
   ``They resolved us at the last one,'' she said of the 1987
summit, ``and we're sort of resolving ourselves at the beginning of
this one.''
   When Novikov arrived in the United States on a three-month visa,
he wanted to marry Condon right away. However, she wanted time to
assess their relationship. Earlier this month, Condon said, they
decided to marry.
   The two were married by a justice of the peace before 40 of
Condon's friends and relatives at the home of her aunt.
   They met two decades ago on one of Condon's then-frequent visits
to the Soviet Union.
   After a honeymoon in New York, Condon said, Novikov plans to
begin learning English and find work.

   President Reagan's arrival in Moscow was big news
around the world, but thousands of this city's residents seemed
oblivious to the historic occasion as they basked in the glorious
spring weather.
   As Reagan's plane touched down in the early afternoon Sunday,
the Arbat, a cobbled pedestrian walkway about a mile long, was
crowded with people strolling, watching the street artists and
standing in line to buy ice cream, shish-kabobs, sundaes, soft
drinks and juice.
   Even the military officials seemed relaxed as they sauntered
along the walkway, carrying walkie-talkies as they mingled with
pedestrians. Some sat on wooden park benches in the middle of the
walkway, which had been decorated with freshly planted flowers.
   Crowds on the walkway, lined by 16th century houses, were larger
than those gathered at the foot of the nearby street leading to
Spaso House, the home of U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock, where Reagan
and his wife, Nancy, are staying.
   Although Soviet television broadcast the arrival and Reagan's
meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev live, the televisions in the
window of an electronics store showed cartoons. Another TV set in a
crowded snack bar featured a video of Tina Turner gyrating on stage
to the tune ``Get Back.''
   The Arbat is Moscow's version of Montmartre with scores of
street artists drawing portraits in charcoal and oil, where
bystanders often crowd around to watch the progression of the work;
artists line the street with their work, glow-in-the-dark oil
painters, a few restrained nudes and landscapes.
   Other forms of entertainment on the Arbat are a lone scale, with
people lined up to find out their weight and a children's show with
large stuffed farm animals _ and a live chicken. The brown bear
held a paper summit friendship flag with the stars-and-stripes and
the hammer and sickle.
   Some residents took advantage of Sunday to shop. As usual, there
were lines to purchase anything from an ice cream cone to a portion
of red sauercraut to a clump of radishes. In some stores, there are
two lines: one to pay for an item, the other to pick it up.
   One popular speciality store served two types of pate, sausage,
potato salad and sandwiches.
   And Soviets apparently aren't adverse to physical shoving when
they want to get out of a store or a jam-packed subway car.

   The White House advance team handling Nancy Reagan's schedule
visited the Moscow pet market, but decided it wasn't the kind of
thing the first lady needed to see on her maiden trip to the Soviet
Union.
   The outdoor market is a fascinating slice of Soviet life: a huge
area where people sell dogs, cats, birds, fish, mice, lizards,
hamsters, snails and every kind of animal equipment from dog
brushes to aquarium cleaners.
   Held every Saturday and Sunday, the market is definitely not the
cleanest place in Moscow, nor the quietest. Debris from stalls that
have been torn down litter the area, and the dirt floor was covered
with sawdust. All the while, the animals carry on the racket of
barking, meowing and tweeting.
   The Russians carry their pets to the market all kinds of ways.
Newborn kittens peer out of gym bags or sleep in cardboard boxes,
and puppies play in playpens generally the habitat is children.
   Birds seem particularly popular. ``People buy them because they
are beautiful,'' said the man hawking his white pigeons. One
sellers stuffed at least 20 green, yellow and blue parakeets into a
cage.
   The animals, while plentiful, are not cheap. A Siamese kitten
cost about $64; a pug went for $640.

   Summit-time means souvenir time, and Soviets are no different
from Americans when it comes to hawking items to commemorate the
occasion.
   The Soviets are fans of znockki, lapel pins used to decorate
outfits. Summit pins are a hit, and one of the most popular
varieties _ costing less than a dollar _ shows an American flag and
a Russian flag forming a ``V.'' ``Mockba-Moscow 1988'' is the
inscription.
   At the Hotel Mezhdunarodnaya, site of the international press
center, American-made summit tee-shirts sold like hot-cakes at $20
each. The salesgirl said she had sold about 500 in two days.
   The price didn't deter an Italian reporter who bought eight,
charging them to his American Express card. ``What are you going to
do?'' he said, explaining his family wanted the souvenirs.
   ``They won't go on sale,'' said one man from the American
Embassy, who didn't want to be quoted by name. ``There are no
specials in Russia.''
   Black sweatshirts with ``perestroikia'' on them, and white ones
with a summit designation, were on sale at the Hotel Rossiya, home
to many television journalists. They sold for 35 rubles, about $56.
   A European journalist said he ignored the price; he planned to
get a higher rate for his rubles by trading hard currency on the
black market.

   The summit press center is located in a modern hotel complex
built in 1980 as an international trade complex. The facility is
much like the one the Americans set up at a hotel in Washington for
the U.S.-Soviet summit last December. It has banks of telephones
and telex printers.
   Americans and Soviets officials hold press conferences on
everything from arms control to the printing of a new book in a
cavernous room where reporters sit at long tables, many typing at
computers.
   Reporters use their press passes as collateral to get earphones
that provide simultaneous translation in English, Russian, Spanish,
French, and German.
   Soviets waiters sell cheese, salami and ham sandwiches, for a
fee, as well as instant coffee _ no milk or cream. Pepsi is
dispensed for free, but at one point it ran out.
   Tables with a range of pamphlets and books on the Soviet Union
are available for free. The White House also has a press office at
the center, while the U.S. Information Agency has its own hideaway.

<HEAD>Computerized Piano Can Create `Perfect' Performance</HEAD>

   Is it live? Or is it Bosendorfer?
   A rocket scientist and a robotics expert using a 9-foot piano
have teamed up to create an instrument that can record every
flicker of a virtuoso's finger _ and then improve on it.
   The Bosendorfer 290 SE Imperial Grand looks like a piano next to
a computer. But behind the keyboard, optical sensors, tiny electric
motors and three linked computers form the guts of a frighteningly
accurate musical instrument.
   Invented by a Wayne Stahnke, a scientist from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., the Bosendorfer is played like any piano. Inside,
the instruments are recording even microscopic motions.
   Once the pianist walks away, a punch of a few computer buttons
brings forth the performance just played, depressing the piano keys
and pedals exactly as the musician did. But the Bosendorfer can
also improve on the performance.
   ``In its most straightforward mode, the piano `listens' to a
live piano performance, `remembers' that performance note for note
and then reproduces that performance _ on the very instrument upon
which that performance was played,'' said John Amuedo, a recording
engineer who worked on artificial intelligence projects at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The potential for the $100,000 instrument _ a sort of player
piano for the computer age _ was immediately apparent to pianist
Frederick Moyer and composer-producer Gunther Schuller, who are
collaborating on the first recording using the Bosendorfer.
   Because the piano records its own performance not with
microphones but with tiny optical and electronic sensors, the
sometimes-disturbing background noise that can crop up at a live
performance has no impact on a recording made on the Bosendorfer. A
subway car could clatter through the concert hall and it wouldn't
matter.
   Once a performance is over, the hall could be cleared and the
performance could be played amid silence. Or the piano could be
shipped to a recording studio where the keys could be punched to
bring forth the performance with all its spontaneity and energy but
none of the background noise.
   With the push of a few computer keys, the handlers of the
Bosendorfer can correct the tiniest of errors _ mistakes inaudible
to the human ear but visible among the numbers and symbols on the
computer terminal.
   ``It raises a kind of moral aesthetic question as to how perfect
you want to make your recording,'' said Schuller. ``You can make it
so perfect that it becomes almost inhuman.''
   In March, Moyer performed Mussorgsky's ``Pictures at an
Exhibition'' and several short pieces by Mendelssohn at Wellesley
College. Afterward, Schuller and Amuedo went to work on the editing
and found on the computer screen the inevitable tiny errors that
even the best of pianists make.
   Moyer's performance, the first cassette disc using the
Bosendorfer, is to be released this fall on GM Recordings.
   Amuedo defends the editing capabilities of the instrument as
merely improving techniques already widely used by recording
engineers. Record producers edit recordings heavily, even live
recordings, he argues. The Bosendorfer merely makes the process
easier and cleaner. Nor, he said, is the idea of a note-perfect
recording anything new, as anyone who has heard a player piano
knows.
   Using existing techniques, a pianist could play a passage
beautifully but make one mistake. Correcting the error would
require tossing out the well-played section and replaying it. With
the Bosendorfer, engineers merely have to plug in the correct note.
   Schuller also sees the Bosendorfer as an unparalleled teaching
tool. Pianists can listen to their own playing exactly as it sounds
on the piano. And the computer can slow down a performance without
affecting the pitch of a note, allowing pianists to judge their own
execution of rapid passages.
   Amuedo is unconcerned the Bosendorfer will kill the market for
live performances, with all their errors. A tiny mistake passes
unnoticed in a live performance, he said. On a record that is heard
several times, it can become an annoyance.
   ``No amount of editing is going to salvage a musically bad
performance,'' Amuedo said. ``When Vladimir Horowitz gets up and
plays, he makes lots and lots of mistakes and yet still people pay
$20 and $30 to hear him play because he makes music out of those
mistakes.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adviser Says Americans Reject Soviet Arms Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A senior adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev charged at the start of summit talks Sunday that the
United States had rejected a pair of Soviet proposals aimed at
clearing the way for drastic reductions in long-range nuclear
missiles.
   The accusation came as Gorbachev welcomed President Reagan to
the Moscow summit with an appeal to end nuclear testing and
preserve the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which would limit
the president's Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense
system.
   Reagan responded that U.S. and Soviet negotiators are making
progress toward a treaty reducing strategic weapons by as much as
50 percent. Citing other joint efforts to ease East-West tensions,
the president said that ``our work has begun to produce results.''
   Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, told reporters that American negotiators had rejected
Kremlin proposals to ease the two countries' impasse over Star Wars
and verify limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles.
   The two issues are among the main obstacles to the proposed
START or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty being negotiated by U.S.
and Soviet experts in Geneva. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
dismissed any attempt to link Star Wars to progress on a START
agreement.
   National Security Adviser Colin Powell held out little hope of
completing a treaty before Reagan leaves office next January.
   Velikhov, who has advised Gorbachev on the Star Wars issue, said
the Americans had rejected a Soviet proposal to discuss what types
of testing could be permitted under the 1972 ABM accord.
   That treaty limits each side to a missile defense at one site.
The joint statement issued after the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in
Washington last December said both sides would be allowed to test
``as required.'' The United States said that allows tests of
potential Star Wars weapons but the Soviets disagree.
   Velikhov said that ``within the framework of the December
statement, we need to settle some technical questions.'' But he
charged that ``the Americans want to destroy the treaty.''
   If the United States deploys ``a nationwide defense, it will
violate the (ABM) treaty, and jeopardizes effort to cut strategic
offensive weapons,'' Velikhov said.
   The two sides also agreed in December to negotiate ceilings on
submarine-launched nuclear missiles, but not to include them in the
6,000-warhead limit proposed for the strategic weapons treaty.
   The Soviets, said Velikhov, have proposed monitoring the
presence of nuclear warheads on submarine-launched cruise missiles
using devices to detect neutron and gamma-ray emissions.
   American officials have rejected that idea. They say it would be
too easy to bypass such devices and that they oppose allowing
Soviet inspectors to board American submarines for on-site
verification of any limits on the missiles.
   Gorbachev told Reagan that ``it is incumbent on us to discuss
constructively the main aspects of disarmament: the set of issues
related to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive arms, while
preserving the 1972 ABM treaty, problems of eliminating chemical
weapons, reductions in armed forces and conventional armaments in
Europe, cessation of nuclear testing.''
   U.S. officials have repeatedly rejected Gorbachev`s appeals for
an end to nuclear testing, and refused to join an 18-month Soviet
testing moratorium.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said on NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press'' show that there could be a fifth summit meeting before
Reagan leaves office next January, but ``only if the two sides
reach agreement in START talks.''
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief of the Soviet general staff,
said the two countries might be able to strike a START deal by the
end of Reagan's second term.
   ``My own personal opinion is that we've covered more than half
the ground,'' Akhromeyev said in an ABC-TV interview here.
   Powell said Reagan ``would certainly like to see the START
treaty completed during his term. The broad outlines are there. ...
We're now down in the trenches working out the very difficult
issues having to do with verification'' and cruise and mobile
missiles.
   ``I would like to see some progress this week and progress is
possible, but there is a lot of hard work ahead,'' Powell said.
   Georgi A. Arabatov, a Soviet government adviser on American
affairs, said on ``Meet the Press'' that Gorbachev ``will welcome
any step towards agreement and if there is an opportunity to have
an agreement before the term of President Reagan expires, he would
be very glad.''
   Powell said agreement on a joint verification experiment for a
nuclear test ban, which seemed doubtful Saturday, ``may be back in
the cards'' for signing at the Moscow summit.
   Carlucci, in an interview with Cable News Network, said
``progress is being made'' also on a peaceful nuclear explosives
treaty, although Powell said it wouldn't be ready for signing at
the summit.

   Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis said in an
interview broadcast Sunday that the Soviet Union's economic
problems led Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to another summit
with President Reagan.
   Dukakis, the front-runner for his party's presidential
nomination, said that Gorbachev is probably the first Soviet leader
``to recognize that Communism is a failure, at least the way it's
been practiced in the Soviet Union.''
   ``Unless the Soviet Union begins to devote significantly more
resources to its domestic economy ... and less to the military,
than they're going to become a third-rate economic power,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor, who was interviewed by the BBC last
week while he campaigned in California, said ``most thoughtful
observers agree that it is the very serious condition of the Soviet
domestic situation that has been largely responsible'' for
Gorbachev's involvement in the summit.
   ``I think that is the driving force behind this, the recognition
on his part that they're falling further and further behind,
they're losing the economic race, the technological race and that
they cannot be a great nation unless they significantly reduce the
amount of resources they're putting into the military,'' he said.
   Dukakis holds a commanding lead over Democratic rival Jesse
Jackson in the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
And in recent opinion polls, Dukakis leads likely Republican
nominee George Bush.
   If he wins in November, Dukakis said there would be ``some very,
very significant differences'' in his foreign policy from that of
President Reagan.
   ``For one thing, I think we've got the best opportunity for
meaningful arms control and arms reduction we've had in our
lifetimes,'' he said.

   A painting depicting a grinning President Reagan
in blue jeans and cowboy hat astride a white horse is among the
troublesome summit issues that advisers to Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be trying to untangle.
   Soviet authorities confiscated the painting by Louisiana artist
George Rodrigue, which had hung briefly in a private Cajun food
restaurant in Moscow that is serving gumbo and fried catfish to
visiting U.S. government officials and journalists covering the
summit.
   The Soviets also took away a painting showing Gorbachev in a
yellow suit holding a red Soviet flag, with the Kremlin and a
peasant family in the background. Officials said they will not
return the art until they make sure Reagan is not insulted by his
portrayal as a cowboy.
   ``The Soviets don't understand American art. They just don't
know how to read this,'' said Rodrigue, a drawling, boot-clad
cowboy born in Lafayette, La. ``They don't appreciate that this is
an individual's artistic interpretation, something not permitted
here.''
   Rodrigue said that although the Soviets removed both paintings,
it was the one of Reagan _ not of Gorbachev _ that concerned them.
   The Reagan painting, copied for Republican Party posters, was
presented to the president in New Orleans in 1986 and will be on
exhibition until it is given to him permanently when he leaves
office next January, the artist said.
   The painting was displayed briefly in a restaurant that John D.
Folse, a Cajun chef and owner of Lafitte's Landing Restaurant in
Donaldsonville, La., was allowed to open here for the duration of
the summit.
   Folse said the flap over the paintings was not the only
bureaucratic complication he has encountered. He said the 14 tons
of food he shipped here from Louisiana caused confusion among
Soviet customs officials, who apparently had never seen crayfish or
oysters.
   ``We expect we are going to diplomatically work out this issue
of the paintings before the summit ends,'' Folse said. ``The
Soviets are making lots of changes with perestroika, but we can't
expect them to adapt to American art or American food overnight.''

   A third battle of Manassas is brewing, this
one over a shopping center complex being built near where the Union
and Rebel forces clashed in 1861 and again in 1862.
   Neither the outrage of preservationists, the pleas of Civil War
buffs nor 166 signatures on congressional legislation has been able
to stop bulldozers from plowing ground on the project.
   Construction crews already have begun to lay access roads and
prepare the property for sewers. They expect to start construction
on the first section of 560 townhouses and detached homes in 60
days.
   The developers say the section is not part of the land
considered sacred by historians. But local preservationists argue
that even if the hill from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
directed troops has not yet been touched, the excavation work
should stop until Congress has had time to act.
   The National Manassas Battlefield, about 30 miles from
Washington, is cherished for its bucolic surroundings where
visitors can easily imagine what Civil War troops saw in 1861 and
1862 during two of the South's important victories _ the battles of
Manassas, or as Northerners say, the battles of Bull Run.
   But the Washington metropolitan area is one of the nation's
fastest growing regions, and any land around the 4,500-acre
historic park not owned by the government is vulnerable to
surburban sprawl.
   As for the 600 acres adjacent to the park where Lee's troops
gathered and battlefield hospitals were located, Hazel-Peterson Co.
plans to go ahead with construction unless stopped by Congress,
said Robert C. Kelly, spokesman for the firm, the most prominent
development company in northern Virginia.
   A few weeks ago, Reps. Robert Mzarek, D-N.Y., and Michael
Andrews, D-Texas, started action to stop construction by
introducing a bill that would have the interior secretary take
possession of the land for park expansion.
   It quickly got the approval of at least 166 members of the House
who signed on as co-sponsors, but did not win over the three
congressmen whose districts comprise northern Virginia. All are
Republicans and all are well-acquainted with the wealthy Hazel
family and its involvement in local GOP politics.
   In fact, not one of Virginia's 10 members of Congress had signed
on in support of the Mzarek-Andrews bill or entered into the debate
in any way.
   Last week, that changed and suddenly there was new hope for
historians that the bulldozers would be idled.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., whose district is near the battlefield,
introduced a bill that would enable the government to acquire the
land through ``legislative taking,'' a process that is faster than
that proposed by Mzarek and Andrews. Wolf's bill also provides for
highway construction to relieve traffic congestion threatening the
park.
   Mzarek and Andrews quickly gave their support for the plan, and
immediately signing on as a co-sponsor was Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va.,
a longtime friend and partner in some business ventures with John
``Til'' Hazel, who runs Hazel-Peterson Co.
   Supporting development are county officials who anticipate
increased tax revenues.
   ``We are pleased and happy the project is being built,'' said
Robert Noe, Prince William County executive before Wolf introduced
his bill. ``The greatest hope for stability in the tax base is
economic development and a regional mall is the catalyst for the
kind of economic development communities need.''
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel also has opposed congressional
intervention, saying the land would cost the government too much.
   Hazel-Peterson spokesman Kelly said his firm bought the land for
between $10 million and $12 million. Hodel said it probably would
cost the government $70 million to acquire it.
   ``Not only is the cost high, but it will not solve the problem,
since the proposed mall could simply move further down the road,
either imposing a traffic burden on the park or requiring that land
also to be purchased,'' said Hodel in a letter to Rep. Morris
Udall, D-Ariz., chairman of the House Interior Committee.
   ``Development is going to occur all around the battlefield
whether it is us or someone else,'' said Kelly. ``This land is not
for sale. We don't want it taken and we are proceeding with
construction.''

   A woman listening to records in her living

pushed through the wall by her husband's out-of-control car, police
said.
   Ora Lee Byrd, 68, died instantly in the freak accident Saturday,
they said.
   Her husband, Joe, was parking the car when his foot slipped off
the brake and hit the accelerator. The car went through the garage
door, hit a freezer kept inside the garage and propelled it through
the wall, police said.
   The freezer fell on Mrs. Byrd, who was sitting on a couch on the
other side of the wall, police said.

   Pope John Paul II named 25 new cardinals
from 18 countries Sunday, including prelates from Lithuania and
Hong Kong in a move to bolster the Roman Catholic Church in the
Soviet Union and China.
   Two Americans, Archbishops James A. Hickey of Washington and
Edmund C. Szoka of Detroit, were on the list.
   The new ``princes of the church,'' who will be formally elevated
at a June 28 Vatican session, bring the number of cardinals to 161.
   Four new cardinals come from Italy, two each from the United
States, Brazil, Spain and India, and one each from Canada,
Mozambique, Colombia, Australia, Hungary, Cameroon, Austria,
France, West Germany, Mauritius, Hong Kong, Switzerland and
Lithuania.
   Hickey, 67, in a statement in Washington, said he was ``truly
honored, very humbled and deeply grateful'' to be chosen. He said
he would work with ``all those of good will ... to build a more
just and caring community.''
   Szoka, 60, told a news conference in Detroit that he's ``deeply
moved and honored'' and will ``carry on the same functions whether
I'm cardinal or not.''
   In announcing the appointments at the end of a Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica, John Paul noted that the new cardinals come from
every continent, reflecting the ``universality'' of the church's
860 million followers.
   Most of the new appointees were heads of large dioceses or
Vatican departments traditionally held by cardinals.
   Vatican officials described as especially significant the naming
of cardinals for Lithuania, the Catholic stronghold in the Soviet
Union, and Hong Kong, a British colony that reverts to Communist
Chinese rule in 1997.
   ``These were courageous appointments,'' Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro told reporters. ``These are not symbolic choices
but options for the future.''
   As Lithuania's first publicly named cardinal, the pope chose
Vincentas Sladkevicius, 68, the apostolic administrator of
Kaisiadorys who was appointed president of the Lithuanian epispocal
conference in April.
   From 1963 to 1982, he was ``impeded'' by Soviet authorities from
performing his religious duties and was virtually confined to his
residence, according to the Vatican.
   Sladkevicius becomes the second resident cardinal in the Soviet
Union. Julijans Vaivods of Latvia was elevated by John Paul in 1983.
   At least 2 million of Lithuania's 3.5 million people are
estimated to be Roman Catholics. The pope, who has frequently
expressed his desire to visit his flock in the Soviet Union, has
publicly disclosed that at least on two occasions he has been
refused permission to travel to Lithuania.
   The pope moved to bolster the church in China by elevating John
Baptist Wu Cheng-Chung, the 63-year-old bishop of Hong Kong. There
has been no resident cardinal in China since the Communists took
over in 1949.
   China cut ties with the Vatican in 1957 and established a
breakway Catholic church, which claims 3 million members. An
unknown number of other Catholics remain secretly loyal to the
pope, and several are imprisoned for their religious practices.
   The two U.S. appointments bring to nine the number of American
cardinals.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, 52, was considered for
promotion but passed over in what Navarro acknowledged was a
``great exclusion'' for the American church. The spokesman said
Mahony was not included because of his young age and was likely to
become a cardinal at a later time.
   Named as the first cardinal in Mozambique, a Marxist country
that the pope will visit during his September tour of southern
Africa, was Alexandre Jose Maria dos Santos, archbishop of Maputo.
   The Rev. Hans Urs von Balthasar, a Swiss theologian highly
regarded by the pope, was the only non-bishop among the 25 new
cardinals.
   In addition to voting in a papal conclave, cardinals advise the
pope, serve on special Vatican commissions and act as spokesmen for
the church in their countries.
   The number of cardinals under the age of 80 and therefore
eligible to vote for a new pope will now number 121 _ one more than
the limit set by church rules. The Vatican offered no immediate
explanation. However, two of the cardinals will turn 80 this summer.

   About two dozen Soviet Jews waving posters and
yellow Stars of David outside the Kremlin walls urged President
Reagan on Sunday to make a summit appeal to Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev for relaxation of curbs on Jewish emigration.
   Elsewhere in the Soviet capital, Armenians beseeched Reagan to
bring up their demands for control over land in a neighboring
republic. ans also called on Reagan to bring up their demand for
control over land in a neighboring republic.
   ``We Demand Freedom of Emigration,'' read a poster held by Sasha
Ostroverkh, 7, who wore a Mickey Mouse T-shirt and was the youngest
of the Jewish protesters who gathered at the Lenin Library one
block from the Kremlin.
   Sasha's father, Vladimir, said his family has been trying to
emigrate since 1979. The government says Ostroverkh had access to
state secrets while working as a social psychologist for the
Communications Ministry.
   A few policemen kept their distance and made no attempt to
disperse the demonstrators. But workers, who normally take Sunday
off, noisily sandblasted the library steps and sprayed the
protesters and reporters with clouds of dust.
   ``A lot of refuseniks live a horrible life. Their secrets are
older than they are,'' said Ostroverkh, 42, holding up his left
hand on which he had written a prayer in Hebrew.
   He said he wanted to emigrate to Israel so ``my son can be
religious, not study things like `grandfather Lenin was good
because he made the Jews work on Sabbath.'''
   Sergei Diky, 38, who also has been refused permission to
emigrate since 1979, held a poster which read: ``We Welcome the
Summit and Hope for a Dramatic Turn in the Fate of Refuseniks.''
   ``You can only talk to my government from a firm position,'' he
said.
   ``This government is used to living not in a humane or moral
way, but in their own way,'' said Diky, whose brother and sister
emigrated to Boston in December.
   ``I hope Mr. Reagan will be strong enough not to surrender to
those who are against us,'' Ostroverkh said.
   Reagan plans to meet Monday with a group of refuseniks and
Soviet human rights activists at Spaso House, the official
residence of the U.S. ambassador where the Reagans are staying
during the five-day summit.
   Soviet authorities reportedly have made it difficult for some of
the group to see Reagan.
   According to Alexander Ogorodnikov, a Russian Orthodox activist
in Moscow, police removed two Lithuanian activists, Nijole
Sadunaite and Antanas Terleckas, from a Moscow-bound train Friday
night in their republic's capital of Vilnius.
   The following night, however, the two were told there had been a
mistake and they were allowed to travel to Moscow on Sunday for the
meeting with Reagan, Ogorodnikov said.
   Roald ``Alec'' Zelichonok, a Leningrad Jew refused permission to
emigrate for more than 10 years, said a KGB officer warned him
Thursday night he would face ``administrative measures'' if he went
to Moscow for the Reagan meeting.
   On Saturday, Ogordnikov said, police pulled five Ukrainian
Catholics off a train destined for Moscow and put on another train
headed back to Lvov. The five had hoped to meet Reagan even though
they had not been invited to Spaso House.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Armenians gathered Sunday at
Vagankovskoye Cemetery in northwest Moscow and later at downtown
Pushkin Square ``to call on Reagan to take up our issue in his
negotiations,'' one of them said.
   Armenian painter Koryun Nahabidyan said that in their speeches
and posters, the demonstrators welcomed Reagan to the Soviet Union
and demanded that the government turn the Nagorno-Karabakh region
over to the Armenian republic.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan, has been the
subject of street rallies in Moscow and the Armenian capital of
Yerevan since February.

   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, out for a
pleasant Sunday stroll, won cheers and applause in the city's
showcase Arbat mall during a chaotic 10-minute episode in which
grim-faced KGB agents roughed up members of the crowd and the press.
   The agents knocked over a fruit stand as they steamrolled
through the crowd.
   The Reagans seemed stunned by the tumultuous scene and at times
appeared to be jostled themselves. The president and first lady
were completely encircled by KGB officers who locked arms in a
tight circle, using elbows and shoulders to spew people out of
their way.
   Nancy Reagan stopped the procession at one point to rescue Helen
Thomas, the White House correspondent for United Press
International who was complaining loudly about the rough treatment.
``She sort of put out her hand and pulled me in'' to the
presidential party, Miss Thomas said.
   Tumult or not, the shirt-sleeved crowd of Sunday shoppers loudly
cheered and applauded the president and first lady. Reagan shook
hands with onlookers who managed to get close enough.
   At one point, the president and Mrs. Reagan climbed atop an open
carriage and waved to the crowd, drawing widespread cheers.
   The unscheduled excursion occurred an hour after Reagan
completed his first round of summit talks at the Kremlin with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It had been widely rumored that Reagan would have a surprise
event Sunday evening, but his destination was not announced until
after his motorcade left the U.S. embassy residence, where he is
staying, en route to the shopping area known as the Arbat several
hundred yards away.
   ``It was a very heartwarming welcome, indeed. They all seemed
very friendly,'' Reagan said. He said he was not surprised. ``I
have always heard that the Russian people are very friendly and
outgoing.''
   The KGB, which has primary responsibility for Reagan's security
here, was not informed of the walk until minutes before the
president and first lady set out from the embassy residence,
officials said.
   In some ways, the event was similar to Gorbachev`s unscheduled
stop in a crowd in downtown Washington during the summit last
December. To the delight of onlookers, the Soviet leader left his
limousine and shook hands in the crowd. While there was an air of
excitement, there was none of the turmoil that marked Reagan's
event.
   When Reagan and his wife stepped from their armored car, people
nearby broke into smiles and began cheering. Word of their arrival
spread quickly, and people began surging toward the party to get a
look.
   ``Somebody must have spread the word in advance,'' Reagan said
later.
   The KGB agents seemed to panic at the crowd's reaction and began
thrusting people out of the way. U.S. Secret Service agents
appeared startled and pushed people with more force than they
usually exert, though significantly less than the KGB.
   Mutual Broadcasting reporter Peter Maer said he was punched in
the stomach by a KGB officer, picked up and thrown over a barricade
about the height of a bicycle rack.
   A television sound technician said his jacket pocket was ripped
off by the KGB, and a photographer said he was punched in the back.
   Another photographer said his camera was broken, while a
colleague complained he was bear-hugged and choked by his camera
straps.
   ``General, tell your men to stop,'' White House assistant press
secretary Mark Weinberg shouted repeatedly at the KGB officer in
charge of the security detail.
   American reporters tried to warn Soviets with children to stay
back from the chaos. A fruit stand was overturned as agents pushed
past, running and jumping over obstacles to catch up with the
president.
   Standing on the sidewalk outside the nearby U.S. embassy, the
KGB officials were first briefed on the Reagans' plans and
immediately held hurried consultations and sent agents down the
street to the Arbat.
   During the Reagans' walk, members of the presidential party,
including spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and deputy chief of staff
Kenneth Duberstein, were shut out from the circle around Reagan.
   The scene calmed when the Reagans departed the market, electing
to walk down the street back to the embassy instead of riding in
their limousine.
   Reagan, chatting briefly with reporters, said he was pleased by
the friendly reception he received from Soviet citizens as his
motorcade drove into Moscow on his arrival from Helsinki, Finland.
Thousands of people lined the route, and American and Soviet flags
were suspended over the city on ropes attached to blimps.

   President Reagan considered a private visit with a
prominent refusenik family Sunday, according to U.S. sources who
said the idea was scrubbed when word came that it could hurt the
family's chance to emigrate.
   A honey cake was baked and waiting at the apartment of Tanya,
Yuri and Vera Zieman. The Ziemans talked excitedly of how water
trucks washed their street clean and workers had daubed fresh paint
on their apartment building _ signs that the Soviets were aware of
plans for a Reagan visit.
   But the Reagans never came.
   After 11 years of waiting, it was another disappointment.
   ``When we started to apply to emigrate, I thought it would not
be easy for us,'' sighed Tanya as she gazed at the crowd on the
street. ``The one thing I didn't want to attract is publicity, the
mob, like this.''
   A U.S. official who asked not to be identified said White House
planners scrubbed consideration of a Zieman visit after the Soviets
passed word that the Ziemans would never leave the country if
Reagan went to their home.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied Sunday there ever
were definite plans for the Zieman visit, saying only that a number
of sites were scouted for potential Reagan trips.
   The Ziemans will be among the refuseniks, the term given to
those refused permission to emigrate, meeting with Reagan on Monday
at the Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's home where the president
is staying.
   Human rights is one of the most contentious issues on the agenda
for Reagan's five-day Moscow summit with Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who has vehemently rebutted Western criticism of Soviet
human rights policies.
   Last week, the Kremlin abruptly canceled one of Monday's two
planned meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev. The discussions had
been scheduled to take place between a Reagan visit to a Moscow
monastery and his meeting with dissidents and refuseniks.
   The Ziemans are Moscow Jews who in 1977 first sought permission
to emigrate. Several other long-term refuseniks have been granted
such permission in recent months, but an estimated 2,000 Soviet
Jews have had applications pending.
   The Ziemans have been notified that they cannot leave because
Yuri, a computer specialist, would be a risk to Soviet security.
They were alerted to a possible visit by the Reagans last week,
when U.S. scouting officials came to their home.
   And they were not the only expectant parties: Soviet officials
had cleaned up the neighborhood right up to patching the road and
driveway right in front of the apartment. Local militia and
plainclothes agents patrolled the area.
   The Reagans' failure to show clearly disappointed the Ziemans
and about 300 curious residents who gathered outside their
apartment building, alerted to something unusual by the heavy
police presence.
   After the Ziemans applied to emigrate, Tanya lost her job as an
English professor and Yuri lost his as an advanced computer
specialist, working as a hospital plumber until ill health forced
him to stop last fall.
   Their elder daughter, Galya, got out of the Soviet Union last
year, apparently because authorities did not realize from her
married name of Khatutsky that she was a member of the Zieman
family. She now lives in Boston, Mass., campaigning for her
family's emigration.
   With her perfect British-accented English, curly hair and
cherubic cheeks, daughter Vera, 12, charms the many foreigners who
visit the Ziemans' three-room apartment. The presidential couple
reportedly became interested in the Ziemans' case after Vera wrote
to the Reagans in English on April 4 asking for their help to
emigrate.
   Yuri, who is suffering from hepatitis and an undiagnosed
condition that gives him double vision, lay on the sofa and
discussed his hopes for Reagan's Moscow visit.
   ``If not this visit, I don't know what will help me,'' he said.
``I think many refuseniks are expecting good news now.''
   Hopes traditionally run high amid dissidents and would-be
emigres in the Soviet Union when prominent Western politicians
visit, since the Kremlin traditionally solves several or even a few
dozen human rights cases during such meetings.
   On Sunday, very few of those who gathered on the street outside
knew the Ziemans or that they are refuseniks. They just knew
something unusual was happening.
   But one elderly lady was convinced Reagan would never show.
   ``There aren't enough security around,'' she said. ``If the
president was coming, there would be KGB in every doorway.''

   Long before they arrived in Moscow, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa were the talk of the small city where
he began his rise to power. Here, based on interviews with
acquaintances, are scenes from the lives of the young Gorbachevs.

   Raisa Gorbachev, professor of
Marxism-Leninism and wife of the local Communist Party chief, was
visibly piqued. For days, gossip had been spreading that she had
spent a small fortune on a fur coat.
   ``When will these rumors stop that my coat cost 12,000 rubles?''
the petite brunette from Siberia asked co-workers at the Stavropol
Agricultural Institute one day. ``It was only 608 rubles.''
   The long-ago incident, recalled by a former dean of the school
where Mrs. Gorbachev taught, could have happened today. As the wife
of the Kremlin leader, Mrs. Gorbachev has been criticized by some
Soviets who maintain she embraces Western materialism.
   It was in the provincial Russian city 850 miles south of Moscow
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa began their rise to
the top of the Kremlin hierarchy.
   The Gorbachevs lived here for 23 years, following their
graduation from Moscow State University in 1954.
   Residents remember seeing the stocky balding Gorbachev _ then
the regional party boss _ jogging some mornings along the
poplar-shaded streets or in the park opposite his one-story 19th
century home at 109 Dzherzhinksy Street.
   The couple frequented the regional art museum when it held shows
from the Hermitage, the Tretyakov or other celebrated Soviet
galleries, according to Boris A. Bendik, then museum director.
   Those who knew Gorbachev in those early years say his
flesh-pressing, street-corner brand of politicking took shape in
Stavropol, as he made his way up through the party ranks in this
city of 300,000 people set in the green, rolling hills north of the
Caucasus Mountains.
   ``He was everywhere, visiting all the stores and enterprises to
see what their problems were,'' said Tatyana I. Bessyonova, manager
of Stavropol's largest store, the Central Universal Store. ``He
listened to people's problems, and gave them advice about how to
change things.''
   The man who would make ``glasnost,'' or openness, an official
policy knew by name almost all of the journalists from
Stavropolskaya Pravda, the local party newspaper, and would often
brainstorm with them, recalled editor-in-chief Boris G. Kuchmayev.
   ``He'd come and see us and say, `Hello, fellows, what's up?'''
Kuchmayev said. ``He talked out loud about his thoughts, what he
had seen. He didn't order us to print things, but led by example.''
   One day when Gorbachev was addressing workers at the
Electoavtomatika electronics plant, the microphone failed.
   ``Other officials would have crushed bones because of that,''
said plant director Yevgeny Kuznetsov. ``Not Mikhail Sergeyevich.
He pushed aside the microphone and said, `Fine, comrades, it will
be more informal this way.'''
   For 18 years, Mrs. Gorbachev, the Siberian-born daughter of
railroad workers, taught Marxist dialectics and historical
materialism at the agricultural institute, working on the second
floor of a 19th century building where girls of good family were
once taught by Russian Orthodox priests.
   By all accounts, she was a bright, hard-working teacher who
demanded much from her students, and also from herself.
   Every year, Mrs. Gorbachev taught 180 students in the elements
of Marxism-Leninism, delivering lectures in a room with
hospital-green walls decorated with large portraits of Descartes,
Kant, Hegel and other philosophers.
   She was paid 320 rubles a month, about $500.
   Mrs. Gorbachev was once grabbed by a guard after she entered the
institute. He had mistaken her for a student, and wanted her to
leave her coat in the student's cloakroom, recalled the former
dean, Mikhail P. Chuguyev.
   ``Mikhail Pankratovich, when are people going to recognize the
fact that I work here and am not a student?'' Chuguyev recalls her
saying.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, working at a beaten wooden desk now decorated
with a single rose in a vase, taught philosophy from the ancient
Greek times to the present. Her courses were mandatory for economic
majors.
   ``She was respected greatly because she was the best prepared
... The rest of us went to her lectures to see how they should be
done,'' Chuguyev said.
   Gorbachev himself entered the institute as a part-time student
in 1962-68, working towards a degree as an ``advanced
agro-economist,'' a speciality important for someone keen on rising
in the party hierarchy in the farming region of Stavropol.
   ``He asked for no special treatment, and was interested in
pursuing the truth to the very end,'' remembers Alexander D.
Kamensky, dean of part-time students at the institute and a friend
of the Gorbachevs for decades.
   One day, in the midst of a four-hour chemistry experiment,
Gorbachev was whisked away by a limousine on urgent party business.
   But he returned later in the day, telling Kamensky, ``I want to
finish the experiment by myself and see the results.''
   Gorbachev was born in 1931 to a peasant family in Privolnoye, a
village on the black-earth steppes about 100 miles north of the
Stavropol regional center.
   With his Moscow University law diploma in his pocket, he
returned to Stavropol in 1954 as an intern in the prosecutor's
office. But he was snapped up by the Komsomol Communist youth
league, and began a career that included stints as local Komsomol
leader, party boss for the city of Stavropol and party chief for
the Stavropol region, an area about the size of South Carolina.
   When Gorbachev was named regional party chief in 1970, Raisa
Gorbachev went to her superiors at the agricultural institute, and
asked not to be named head of the philosophy department, a
promotion for which she had been in line.
   ``People will say that I've been promoted because of my
husband,'' she told her co-workers. ``Not because of what I've
done.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev and Reagan Open Fourth Summit; Clash on Human Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, welcomed to the Soviet Union by
appreciative crowds and Kremlin pomp, began his fourth summit
Sunday with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The leaders immediately clashed
over human rights, setting the stage for what one U.S. aide called
``tumultuous conversations.''
   In receiving Reagan, Gorbachev told his guest their previous
meetings have shaken loose the ``enemy images'' of old stereotypes.
He thanked Reagan for having traversed ``the great distance that
lies between our two capitals, to continue our political
dialogue.'' He noted that Reagan was finally visiting ``a country
which you have so often mentioned in your public statements.''
   Reagan, who once spoke of the Soviets as an ``evil empire,''
made clear that serious differences remain.
   ``We've traveled a long road together to reach this moment,''
the American president told Gorbachev as they began the first of
their talks. But he added, ``We both know it will not be easy'' to
surmount obstacles standing stubbornly in the way of a pact to
slash long-range nuclear weapons stocks.
   Instead of signing a treaty to cut strategic arsenals by 50
percent, which both sides had hoped would come at this meeting, the
two leaders will ceremoniously exchange the final, ratified copies
of the treaty they signed at their last meeting in Washington: a
far simpler agreement to scrap all medium-range nuclear missiles.
   As the Reagans retired for the evening, working groups of
specialists in the major areas of U.S.-Soviet relations began
separate negotations on outstanding issues with the understanding
they would report any progress as the leaders' talks continue.
   Despite elaborate preparations by Soviet work crews and security
forces, the White House abandoned an unannounced plan for the
president and his wife, Nancy, to visit the home of a Jewish family
whose 12-year-old daughter appealed to the Reagans for help in
getting permission to leave the country.
   Instead, they toured the historic Arbat district by carriage
before retiring to Spaso House, the nearby U.S. ambassador's
residence where they are staying during the trip. Crowds at the
Arbat, roughly treated by frantic KGB security officers, cheered
and applauded the Reagans.
   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. said the leaders
discussed human rights and Afghanistan ``frankly and with a good
deal of energy'' during their first meeting, which lasted 1 hour,
11 minutes, about 20 minutes longer than scheduled.
   The White House aide said, ``Based on what we've seen so far,
(subsequent talks) are going to be tumultuous conversations.''
   ``They strike sparks off each other pretty well, and they did
today,'' Baker said.
   A senior American official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said human rights ``was one of the issues over which
the two leaders differed, but not the only one.''
   The same source said Afghanistan also was discussed. The Soviet
Union has indicated in recent days it might halt its troop
withdrawal if Pakistan doesn't stop supplying arms to Afghan rebel.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters after the
first meeting that the United States assumes the Soviets will abide
by their agreement, signed in Geneva, to pull their forces out of
the Asian nation.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
characterized the opening round of talks as businesslike and
cordial, but he offered few details.
   Gerasimov charged Reagan does not have a ``concrete
understanding'' of the human rights issue in the Soviet Union and
objected to others lecturing Soviets on how to conduct their
affairs.
   Reagan's position ``is based on the past and does not take into
consideration what is happening today,'' the spokesman said,
apparently referring to Gorbachev's somewhat more tolerant
emigration policies and ``glasnost,'' which permits broader but
still limited criticism of Soviet officialdom and society.
   The Foreign Ministry official said his government knew about its
drawbacks. ``We are trying to correct'' them, Gerasimov added,
``but we don`t like it when someone else is making us feel like a
pupil.''
   During a picture-taking session at the outset of his first
meeting with Gorbachev, Reagan was asked if he intended to lecture
his counterpart on human rights. ``I have no intention of trying to
be a teacher,'' he said.
   Gerasimov said Gorbachev, searching for ways to continue the
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, suggested the superpowers
might launch a joint manned mission to Mars or participate in an
international conference or seminal on human rights. The United
States has been cool to both Soviet initiatives in the past.
   Baker, discussing the failure to reach agreement before the
summit on nuclear testing and other pacts nearing completion, told
NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that their not being signed in Moscow
``underscores the careful and prudent way the administration is
approaching this. Detail can kill you _ literally _ if you don't
get it right.''

<HEAD>French Journalist Returns Home; Report Says Italian To Be Freed</HEAD>

   A French journalist returned home to Paris on
Sunday after nine months in ``absolutely deplorable conditions'' in
an Afghan jail. A newspaper said an Italian journalist jailed in
Afghanistan would soon be freed.
   Alain Guillo was convicted on spy charges and sentenced to 10
years in prison in January. He was pardoned Friday and freed
Saturday.
   The French Communist Party newspaper L'Humanite made available a
report from its Kabul correspondent saying that Italian journalist
Fausto Biloslavo ``may be freed within two or three days.''
   The report was for Monday's edition of the newspaper.
   Guillo spent part of his detention with Biloslavo, who was
arrested in July and sentenced to seven years in prison. Guillo was
arrested in August after entering Afghanistan with guerrillas who
are fighting the Soviet-backed government.
   ``The conditions of detention were rough, absolutely
deplorable,'' Guillo, 45, told reporters at Charles de Gaulle
Airport early Sunday.
   It was ``nine months of complete isolation,'' except for rare
visits from the French charge d'affaires, he said.
   ``But it was nothing compared to the others. There is an Italian
journalist, Turkish, Iranian, Pakistani prisoners. Their life is a
real hell. They have no contact with their families. They are cut
from the world.''
   Guillo is an independent photojournalist who often worked for
the Sygma agency covering the 10-year-old civil war in Afghanistan.
   The secretary-general of the French Foreign Ministry, Gilbert
Perol, stressed that obtaining his release should not be construed
as an element of political negotiations with Afghanistan.
   Guillo's liberation was accompanied by ``no conditions, no
commitment of any sort,'' Perol said. ``We have settled the Guillo
case. Period.''
   Kabul Radio said Friday that the release followed a written
request from French President Francois Mitterrand to Afghan
President Najib and expressed hope for improved relations.
   France maintains relations with Afghanistan but has made clear
it does not support the government.
   Guillo is the sixth Frenchman jailed in Afghanistan since 1979.
In each case, a pardon was eventually granted.
   Guillo was captured August 28 while traveling with members of
the Afghan resistance on his ninth reporting trip to the country
since 1979. His arrest was announced in September.
   On Jan. 4, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage
and subversive activities.
   ``For 15 days, they (Afghan police) hesitated between killing me
on the spot and arresting me formally,'' he told reporters Saturday
in New Dehli, where he stopped en route to Paris. ``They would have
blamed the killing on the mujahedeen.''
   The Afghan rebels call themselves mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
   Guillo called his trial ``pure comedy and a travesty of
justice.''
   In a televised interview with French journalists earlier this
month, Guillo said he would never ask for a pardon because he was
not guilty and considered himself a hostage.

<TEXT>
   Rose Cipollone's husband has spent five
years fighting to get three cigarette makers to pay for his wife's
lung cancer death. Very soon, he and the tobacco industry will have
the answer in their landmark court battle.
   Testimony in the product liability trial is over, and after
closing arguments this week, the jury will begin deliberating
whether the $22 billion-a-year tobacco industry should be held
responsible and pay its first dollar in damages.
   The four-month federal court trial has been monitored closely by
both the industry and health groups, with both sides fighting for
the attention of the nation's 50 million smokers.
   A verdict against the companies could clear the way for other
lawsuits totaling millions of dollars in potential damages.
   To date, plaintiffs have not won a single cigarette liability
case of the dozen or so that have gone to juries since World War
II. Many other suits have been dismissed or withered in the face of
defense efforts by the well-financed tobacco industry. But about
100 others are pending.
   ``Once the first case is won, then the tobacco folks ought to
pack up their bags,'' said John Madigan, director of governmental
affairs for the American Cancer Society.
   Tobacco lawyers see little chance of a loss here, and years of
appeals are almost certain if there is one.
   But for some anti-smoking forces, a victory already has been
won. The case produced hundreds of previously secret internal
corporate documents introduced as evidence and now available for
litigators working against the tobacco industry.
   ``They show that the cigarette companies had knowledge of the
problems with their products long before the general public was
aware,'' said Mike Davis, an Austin, Texas, lawyer who has 13 suits
pending.
   Meanwhile, at least five bills are pending in Congress placing
stricter limits on the industry. The documents have garnered
support for them, said Madigan.
   After the lawyers' closing arguments, the case will go to six
jurors chosen by lot from among the 11 who have heard the
testimony. But they will consider few of the claims in the original
complaint filed by Antonio Cipollone in 1983, a year before his
wife died at 58.
   Most of Cipollone's legal claims have been stripped away by
defense efforts. But the fundamental issue appears straightforward:
free will vs. corporate responsibility.
   To the defendants, Philip Morris Co., Lorillard Inc. and Liggett
Group Inc., Mrs. Cipollone was an intelligent, strong-willed woman
who knew the risks as she made a conscious decision to smoke.
   To her husband, Mrs. Cipollone was the unwitting victim of a
broad conspiracy that used the advertising and public relations to
confound the public on the dangers of smoking.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin threw out a number of
liability claims, but he also said the jury can consider whether
there was a ``tobacco industry conspiracy, vast in its scope,
devious in its purpose and devastating in its results.''
   The completion of the case comes as a relief to Cipollone, a
64-year-old retired cable splicer whose tearful testimony about his
wife's dying moments stirred courtroom observers.
   Most of documents at the core of the case were introduced as
evidence for Cipollone by a Harvard Medical School physician and
economist qualified as an expert on the history of tobacco company
research.
   The exhibits include:
   _Handwritten notes by a Morris research director in the 1970s
saying an industry-funded research group's program was ``designed
so that results cannot harm us.'' Morris attorney Charles Wall said
that the writer was hypothesizing, and that the research was
conducted objectively by independent scientists.
   _A 1968 draft memo by another Morris research executive citing a
``gentleman's agreement'' not to do biological research on smoking
and health. Wall said no such agreement existed, and noted that
some companies did do such research.
   _A 1972 industry trade group executive's memo saying the defense
against critics of smoking included ``creating doubt about the
health charge without actually denying it.'' Wall denied such a
strategy and said the industry merely wanted to publicize the other
side of a controversy.
   Whatever the documents say, the companies contend, they have
nothing to do with Rose Cipollone.
   First off, their expert medical witnesses testified that smoking
is not a proven cancer cause. And in any case, they argued, Mrs.
Cipollone's lung cancer was not the type associated with smoking.
   Cipollone's attorney, Marc Z. Edell, presented experts
contending there is proof of the cancer-smoking link, pointing to
numerous scientific findings and the U.S. surgeon general's reports.
   Both sides called marketing and advertising experts to testify
about the messages Mrs. Cipollone received on the effects of
cigarettes. Experts disputed whether she was addicted to smoking.
   The jury heard testimony from top company executives,
researchers and family members. And finally, through depositions,
from Rose herself, a daughter of Italian immigrants who said she
sought to ward off cancer with prayers to St. Jude, the patron
saint of people in desperate trouble.

   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq on
Sunday dissolved the National Assembly, fired his prime minister
and accused the lawmakers of failing to maintain law and order in
Pakistan.
   Zia made the announcement at a news conference minutes after the
ousted prime minister, Mohammad Khan Junejo, returned home from a
tour of China, South Korea and the Philippines.
   Zia also disbanded Junejo's 33-member Cabinet.
   The action could plunge the country into a new political crisis.
Junejo, 56, was heading the first civilian Cabinet after eight
years of martial law imposed by Zia in July 1977.
   The National Assembly and Junejo's Cabinet were scheduled to
remain in office until 1990. They were elected in December 1984.
Junejo was appointed prime minister in March 1985.
   Zia, an army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1977,
told reporters that legislators' inability to maintain law and
order and failure to bring about an Islamic society led him to
disband the Assembly and Cabinet.
   He said the country's Constitution and the Senate _ the upper
house of the Parliament _ would stay intact.
   Zia said that according to the Constitution, elections should be
held within 90 days. He said a caretaker government would be
announced Monday. In a major policy change, he said political
parties will be permitted to propose their own candidates to
contest the assembly seats.
   In the 1984 elections, political parties were not permitted to
field candidates. That led opposition parties to boycott the vote.
   ``The National Assembly has failed to realize the objective for
which it was elected,'' Zia said. ``The prime minister has ceased
to be the prime minister from today, because the National Assembly
has been dissolved.''
   Zia and Junejo generally had got on well, but political
observers had started sensing a divergence of views on domestic
policy issues, particularly the role that political parties should
play in the country.
   Zia is opposed to giving political parties any immediate role,
but Junejo formed his own Pakistan Muslim League party two years
ago.
   Opposition political parties became active following the
formation of Junejo's party.
   These parties include Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party, a
particular source of annoyance to Zia. Bhutto is the daughter of
the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose civilian
government Zia toppled in July 1977.
   Zia said he had watched with concern that ``law and order had
broken down to an alarming extent.''
   ``There was enormous damage to life and property. ... The
country's Islamic ideology and integrity were unsafe,'' he said.
Public morality has deteriorated to an ``unprecedented level,'' Zia
added.
   In the past two years, hundreds of people have died in ethnic
violence in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city.
   Zia said that he had repeatedly reminded Junejo to improve the
law and order situation and to speed up the process of
Islamization. But he said Junejo took the view that he had to go
along with the wishes of the Assembly, which favored a gradual move
to Islamism.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev engaged President Reagan in a
lighthearted battle of Russian proverbs at their summit reunion
Sunday, and made pointed reference to Reagan's past enmity toward
the Soviet Union.
   At the start of Reagan's first visit to what he once called an
``evil empire,'' Gorbachev challenged his guest to learn more about
the Soviet Union and its people.
   ``You, Mr. President, have traversed the great distance that
lies between our two capitals to continue our political dialogue,''
the Soviet leader said in a welcoming speech. He noted that Reagan
was finally visiting ``a country which you have so often mentioned
in your public statements.''
   Reagan said the steady improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations and
more frequent meetings between superpower leaders was the result of
patience. Then he reached for a Russian proverb to put his thoughts
into words.
   ``Rodilsya, ne toropilsya (It was born, it wasn't rushed),''
Reagan said, reading from a notecard.
   The president initiated the exchange of proverbs at his
Washington summit meeting with Gorbachev in December, when he
referred to the quandary of arms control negotiations. ``Doveryai,
no proveryai (trust, but verify),'' he said.
   Greeting Reagan on Sunday in the Kremlin's opulent St. George's
Hall, Gorbachev took note of his guest's fondness for literary
references.
   ``Aware of your interest in Russian proverbs, let me add another
one to your collection,'' he said. ``It is better to see once than
to hear a hundred times.''
   Gorbachev's advice came after an oblique reference to Reagan's
critical remarks in the past about the Soviet Union, which the
president had never visited.
   Reagan aroused the wrath of the Soviet media and government
officials in 1983 when he told an American television audience that
the Soviet Union was an ``evil empire.''
   But Gorbachev and Reagan agreed Sunday that times have changed
since their first summit in Geneva in November 1985.
   ``As we see it, long-held dislikes have been weakened; habitual
stereotypes stemming from enemy images have been shaken loose,''
the Soviet leader said.
   ``Everyone can improve, even in later years,'' U.S. affairs
expert Georgi A. Arbatov said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''
program as he tried to explain why Reagan's views of the Soviet
Union had changed.
   On the eve of his arrival here, Reagan said in a Soviet
television broadcast that he could not have conceived of visiting
Moscow during the early years of his presidency.
   ``I think there is a difference between this general secretary
and other leaders of your country that I've met with in the past,''
Reagan told the state-run broadcast service. ``No, I could not have
foreseen your present leader.''

   For most of the members of the Writers Guild of
America, the 2{-month-old strike has been a stressful time of
picket lines, union meetings, no paychecks and lost creative
opportunity.
   For the writers of ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' being on
strike has been, well, not that different from going to work.
   ``We sleep till noon,'' said head writer Steve O'Donnell, ``get
up, drink some coffee, go down to the Writers Guild, see if
anything's going on, then we go home. But now, during the strike
....''
   Until one-liners earn them money again _ which should be soon,
since ``Late Night'' has reached a tentative independent agreement
with the guild _ the show's writers have been offering them in
magazine pieces or interviews with reporters looking for that
missed-monologue angle on the strike story. The show has been in
reruns since the strike started March 7.
   O'Donnell, joined by ``Late Night'' staffers Jeff Martin, Randy
Cohen and Maria Pope, reminisced Friday about a typical day of work
at the show.
   ``We come down to beautiful, almost-landmark Rockefeller Center
at 9:30 or 10 and linger until it's quite dark outside,'' said
O'Donnell. ``It's hand-to-mouth. We're usually working on the next
day's show, if not that day's show, the day of the broadcast. So
that's why we're not too worried about stockpiling things up.
Sometimes our days are not too miserable, because sometimes a lot
of our writing consists of a sentence. Something like ...''
   Martin: ```Let's go up and talk to our audience.'''
   ``Perfect,'' says O'Donnell. ``See, then we knock off and go get
the thickest steak in town. ... Or other times, it will just be a
phrase, a concept, a man, a plan, a canal, Panama.''
   Martin: ```Dave says something funny.'''
   O'Donnell: ```Dave takes bullhorn to window and tries to get
pedestrian to bring him up a hot dog.' Then we look at each other
and say, `That's it, that's it. Who's for dessert?'''
   But now, there are picket lines to walk.
   ``There is like just a minimum of actual union activities,''
said O'Donnell. ``We go picketing once a week.
   ``I think people passing by as they see these writers in their
not-very-solid-looking picket lines, I think they have a series of
thoughts _ the first is, do writers have a union? And then, do they
work that hard? And then perhaps the last stage is, wait a second.
TV writers get paid plenty!
   ``I don't think a lot of people understand the strike wasn't for
more money, it was to keep royalties from being cut back.''
   ``Wait a second,'' said Cohen, ``it wasn't for more money?''
   ``What the hell have we been doing?'' said Martin, who has been
playing golf.
   But seriously.
   ``We certainly support the guild,'' said O'Donnell. ``If it
wasn't for them, we'd certainly be in bad shape. But the actual
issues in this strike do not pertain to late-night comedy writers.''
   ``It's a nice little vacation,'' said Martin.
   But life on strike means missing important events in the life of
``Late Night.''
   Just that morning, the local papers were splashed with
Letterman's smiling file-photo face next to headlines about a
``mystery woman'' driving his car who told officials at the Lincoln
Tunnel, where she didn't have the toll, that she was ``Mrs. David
Letterman.''
   ``Usually Dave has to go on a murder spree to make the front
page of the New York Post,'' said Martin. And he recommends, ``if
you're going to steal Dave's car, please, please have correct
change.''

   Communist Party chief Bosko Krunic
said Sunday that Yugoslavia's political stability has been shaken,
and he warned of major social upheavals as a result of the
country's economic crisis.
   But Krunic rejected a multi-party system and other radical
reforms in a speech to about 800 Communist Party delegates meeting
to find ways of dealing with Yugoslavia's social and financial
problems.
   ``We are, I should say, in the epicenter of the crisis with
economic stagnation on the brink of a recession, a high inflation
that threatens to run away, and ever sharper social problems and
political dissatisfaction,'' said Krunic.
   Yugoslavia is saddled with a 170 percent inflation, a $21
billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate.
   The three-day conference comes halfway between two party
congresses and follows rumors of an attempted military coup to
suppress dissent in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most advanced republic.
Slovenia this month filed an unsuccessful motion in the federal
Parliament requesting the removal of Premier Branko Mikulic.
   ``A society which enters such a crisis ... cannot emerge from it
without profound changes,'' said the party chief. ``Social
upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave.''
   The government launched an emergency economic program on
Saturday, including an almost 24 percent devaluation of the
ever-weaker national currency, the dinar, hefty price hikes and
wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
   Krunic said these measures ``are not easy at all, but are
causing and will cause many shocks, clashes of interest, great
social problems.''
   The austerity package was expected to further erode sagging
living standards, which have already dipped by one-third since
1980, and set off a new wave of social unrest. Sporadic worker
strikes have flared in various parts of the country to protest of
the belt-tightening moves, which were announced several weeks ago.
   ``The stability of the political system has been shaken,''
Krunic told the delegates.
   Conference documents pledge a separation of party and state
administration, curbs on red tape and more openness.
   In a draft document circulated before the meeting, the party
membership is called ``to end the party's impotence and inertia and
oppose bureaucratic and static rule which is believed to be the
main cause of numerous deformations and failures.''
   The document demands that the party ``abandon its leadership
role and (instead) act as a leading force in society, whose major
goals are freedom, democracy and the material well-being of the
people.''
   But Krunic rejected changes toward a multi-party system and
other radical reforms as a way of regaining control of the economy.
   He made clear that the Communist Party intends to continue its
one-party rule and a system of self-management that provides for
limited worker power-sharing in managing companies.
   The party chief asserted it was the historic mission of Yugoslav
Communists ``not to permit the blind forces to gain the upper hand
or changes which, regardless of intentions, would objectively mean
abandoning self-management.''
   Krunic claimed that recent calls for a new constitution and a
reshaping of the political system according to Western models ``are
in fact counterrevolutionary.''
   He said the current system ``must keep the gates tightly shut''
to solutions leading to a dogmatic, Soviet-type system, on the one
hand, or to a Western-type, multi-party democracy, on the other.
   Krunic also revealed the party was exposed to pressures from
``the bourgeois right wing, which pulls toward restoration of the
capitalistic relationship and bourgeois democracy''
   He said such changes of the political system ``would lead us to
national conflicts, which are known from the past.''
   Neverthless, Krunic said one of Yugoslavia's most important
tasks was the establishment of a free market for capital and
workers, which is a highly controversial topic among Yugoslav
Communists. For some party officials, he said _ referring to the
dogmatic party wing opposed to a free-market economy _ such an
innovation is tantamount to ``anarchy'' and the abandonment of
socialism.
   Krunic said the view, espoused by many party hard-liners, that
use of foreign capital for increasing industrial production was a
threat to socialist ownership, was unacceptable.
   Compounding Yugoslavia's economic problems are unresolved ethnic
tensions in this mostly-Balkan nation, whose republics range from
the southern Serbian province of Kosovo _ with its 85 percent
Albanian population _ to northern Slovenia, which borders on
Austria and Italy.
   In an open letter published Thursday, 22 Slovenian officials,
including government members, journalists and other intellectuals,
demanded a thorough explanation of this spring's rumored military
coup, which they called the ``crudest violation of assured rights
of citizens and of the current constitution'' of Yugoslavia.
   The government said the coup rumors were false.

<HEAD>Soviet Jews Demand That U.S. Link Deals To Jewish Emigration</HEAD>

   Soviet Jewish activists urged President Reagan
on Sunday to drive a hard bargain for free Jewish emigration when
he meets with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   ``The Soviets will not be persuaded by mere words,'' Yuli
Edelstein, a former Soviet labor camp inmate, said during a rally
for Soviet Jews attended by about 200 people in Jerusalem.
   Edelstein and other activists demanded that the United States
link trade agreements and scientific and cultural exchanges to the
level of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union.
   The activists also described Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,''
or openness, as a public relations stunt that has not led to real
improvements for Soviet Jews.
   ``More than 2 million Jews remain in one big labor camp _ the
Soviet Union _and the door is still closed,'' said Moshe Arens, a
member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet and the
right-wing Likud bloc.
   Arens called on Reagan to use the level of Jewish emigration as
a test for Soviet sincerity on other issues, such as arms control.
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner said in a telephone interview that ``we
have seen very few (Soviet) changes,'' but added that Shamir was
satisfied with Reagan's efforts.
   U.S. officials have said the plight of Soviet Jewry would be on
the summit agenda. Reagan was to meet Monday with a group of
prominent ``refuseniks,'' Soviet Jews denied permission to emigrate.
   Refusenik Zeev Dashevsky told Israel army radio in a telephone
interview from Moscow that he viewed his scheduled meeting with
Reagan as a sign that the president assigned importance to the
issue.
   ``We want to tell him that even though positive things have been
done in the past two years, basic problems remain and the situation
is not good at all,'' said Dashevsky, who has been denied an exit
visa for the past 11 years.
   Moscow has released several prominent Jewish activists from
prisons and labor camps in the past year. Last year, 8,011 Jews
left the Soviet Union, the highest number since 1981.
   The Soviet Union severed ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle
East war during which Israel captured territory from Moscow's Arab
allies.
   In the past year, the Soviets sent a consular delegation to
Jerusalem, and approved a reciprocal visit by Israeli diplomats.

   Some politicians in Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres' left-leaning Labor Party fear that a newly chosen slate of
dovish candidates could cost them the national elections in
November.
   Their concern was triggered by a meeting of the party's Central
Committee on Thursday in which more than half of 29 candidates
chosen to run for parliament favor making more concessions to the
Arabs for peace than the party has advocated in the past.
   The party's dovish turn appears to contradict a recent shift in
Israeli public opinion polls, which show a majority support
right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his allies in
espousing a tougher stand toward the Arabs.
   ``I am definitely worried by the change. The fact is, more doves
than expected were elected, and this will harm us very much in the
elections,'' Agriculture Minister Aryeh Nehamkin said.
   Those on Labor's new slate include several peace activists and a
former ultra left-wing legislator, Lova Eliav, who has had contacts
with the PLO and has advocated a full Israeli pullout from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The latest public opinion poll, taken this month and published
May 13 by the Yediot Ahronot daily, showed Labor and allied parties
winning 59 seats. The Likud and its allies were predicted to win 61.
   After Israel's last elections, in 1984, the Labor and Likud
parties formed a coalition in which Labor's Peres served as prime
minister for the first two years and Likud's Shamir for the past
two years.
   Political analysts say Israelis' swing to the right reflects a
hawkish public mood stirred by the six-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The analysts say that the Labor infighting could further damage
the party's electoral image by presenting a confused picture to the
public.
   ``With such a fractious and contradictory slate it will be
difficult to formulate an attention-grabbing campaign to compete
with parties either to the left or the right,'' wrote columnist Dan
Margalit in the Haaretz daily.
   The doves and hawks in the Labor Party are divided over how to
implement a plank in its platform which calls for giving up some
land occupied in the 1967 Middle East War in exchange for peace
with Arab states.
   The hawks favor a formula which would leave Israel with the
Jordan River Valley, a stand unacceptable to Arabs. They also
completely reject negotiations with the PLO.
   Labor's newest candidates have a more lenient approach to
territorial compromise and some favor talking with the PLO if it
officially recognizes Israel.
   ``I think that Labor is back where it should be, on the road of
looking for peace, that peace has a price and you don't get it
without compromising,'' said Russian-born Lova Eliav, 66.
   He predicted a tough Israeli election campaign over the peace
issue.
   ``People are extreme, dangerously so. I think it's time for
voters to choose a party that wants to take the road for peace,
even if it's a very, very uphill road,'' he said.

<HEAD>L.L. Bean heiress, Party Insider Seek GOP Congressional Nomination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN O'QUINN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heiress to Maine's most famous modern
fortune and one of the Republican establishment's favorite sons are
vying for the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic incumbent
Joseph E. Brennan, a former governor, for his House seat.
   On June 14, Republican voters in Maine's 1st Congressional
District will choose between businesswoman Linda Bean-Jones, a
granddaughter of L.L. Bean, and Edward S. ``Ted'' O'Meara, the
executive assistant to the state's popular senior senator, William
S. Cohen. Both candidates are making their first bid for public
office.
   With a campaign fund 10 times the size of O'Meara's, Bean-Jones
is far better financed, partly because she has loaned her campaign
$168,000. Much of that war chest has been spent on television
advertising, which emphasizes her links to the sporting goods
empire founded by her grandfather and plays down her background as
a conservative publisher and activist.
   ``I'm prepared to spend whatever it takes to win,'' she said.
   O'Meara is little known outside GOP inner circles and is
counting on support from Republican regulars to win next month's
primary. But he has been hampered by a tradition of neutrality in
primary campaigns, which has limited the activities of some of his
natural allies, including Gov. John R. McKernan, U.S. Rep. Olympia
J. Snowe and even Cohen himself.
   Publicly, however, O'Meara is undaunted.
   ``Never once did I ask them for an endorsement,'' O'Meara said.
``I never had any expectation of it. I never wanted to put them in
the position of having to get involved in the primary.''
   The GOP primary winner will face Brennan, a former two-term
governor, in November's general election for his 1st District seat,
which represents 563,073 residents in an area about the size of
Connecticut. Brennan, who was elected to the House in 1986 as he
concluded eight years as governor, is unopposed for the Democratic
nomination.
   Also unopposed in the primary is Snowe, who is winding up her
fifth term as the 2nd District incumbent. The Democrats have lined
up former state Sen. Kenneth Hayes, who teaches at the University
of Maine in Orono, to challenge her in the general election.
   Bean-Jones, 46, is perhaps best known as founder of the
ultraconservative Maine Paper, a weekly publication which folded in
1982 after three years.
   She also played a role in the successful campaign to defeat an
Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution, and traveled to
an arms control meeting in Geneva to support President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Her focus on issues has changed since announcing her candidacy.
Now she refers to herself as ``the private sector candidate'' who
wants to eliminate many small-business regulations. She is against
higher taxes and abortion, but favors helping women on welfare find
jobs by providing day care, and she said she approves the expanded
use of nuclear power.
   Since becoming a candidate she also has adopted her family
surname, saying, ``I cherish the connection. It embodies what I am
today.''
   O'Meara, 36, is a seasoned organizer, having worked on several
gubernatorial and congressional campaigns. He was an aide to Snowe
before taking a position in 1981 with Cohen, for whom he has served
as campaign finance director. He now is in charge of the senator's
six offices in Maine.
   O'Meara said he favors reductions in the federal deficit, is
pro-choice on abortion, favors the Equal Rights Amendment and wants
action, not further study, to curb acid rain pollution.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet press said Sunday that President Reagan
had made a ``turnaround'' on East-West relations in the past three
years, resulting from a fresh look at changing world realities
rather than a reversal of his staunch anti-communist views.
   One commentator said the Soviet Union has high hopes for
Reagan's fourth summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but
another said progress will depend largely on whether Reagan's
approach is ``realistic and constructive.''
   Soviet television pre-empted regular programming for a live
broadcast of the president's arrival at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport
and his initial meeting with the Soviet leader in St. George's Hall
in the Kremlin.
   An expanded, 90-minute version of the evening news program
``Vremya'' devoted a full 52 minutes to the summit, rerunning much
of the welcoming ceremony at the airport and the speeches by both
leaders. It also carried more than two minutes on Nancy Reagan's
tour of the Cathedral of the Assumption conducted by Raisa
Gorbachev, giving rare prominence to the wife of a Soviet leader.
   ``Vremya'' carried a lengthy interview with Gorbachev adviser
Georgi Arbatov, a member of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee and director of the Institute of U.S.A. and Canada. He
dismissed past anti-Soviet speeches by Reagan as ``propaganda.''
   ``I didn`t see in them any serious political topics,'' Arbatov
said. ``It was what is called in America `public relations,' and in
many cases, of course, unconvincing propaganda.''
   ``Vremya'' also took to the streets for public opinion on the
summit. Many people spoke of hopes for peace and lessening the
nuclear threat, although one man scolded the United States for
raising human rights issues.
   ``They should report on their own human rights problems before
discussing ours,'' the unidentified man told the ``Vremya''
interviewer.
   State-run newspapers printed traffic restrictions that will be
in effect until Reagan leaves the Soviet capital on Thursday.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda printed Reagan's official
portrait and biography in the bottom right corner of its front
page, as is customary for visiting heads of state.
   Tass, the official news agency, said that ``the biographies of a
son of a shoe dealer from Illinois and a son of a peasant from the
Stavropol region represent ... the essence of the two opposite ways
of life.''
   Said Tass: ``This is going to be a meeting of two fundamentally
different social systems with their own values, ideals and
priorities. The relations between them determine to a large extent
the fate of the whole planet.''
   In a separate dispatch, Tass diplomatic correspondent Vadim
Biryukov wrote:
   ``Just three years ago, there was hardly anyone who could
imagine that the 40th American president, known for his
anti-Communist views and power approaches to the solution of
problems on the international scene, would be the high
representative of the United States that would sign a Soviet-U.S.
intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty and moreover, bring to the
Soviet capital the first document on nuclear arms reduction in
history, ratified by the U.S. Senate.''
   ``Does it mean that the American leader has changed his views?''
Biryukov asked.
   ``Perhaps it would be more correct to describe this turnaround
as a result of understanding the fact that the world has changed
and that the interests of our countries are changing. And the
president has probably taken a fresh look at the existing realities
without giving up his known views.''
   Biryukov said the Soviet Union ``pins its most serious hopes''
on the summit meeting.
   Pravda said summit progress depends largely on ``how realistic
and constructive'' is Reagan's approach.
   Biryukov wrote that since the December summit talks in
Washington, the United States has not allowed any progress toward
agreement on the Reagan's Star Wars plan for a space-based shield
against nuclear attack. The Soviets regard the Strategic Defense
Initiative as a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

<HEAD>Political Stars Wrong For Reagan-Thatcher Meeting, Astrologer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Britain's leading astrologers says the
stars are wrong for this week's post-summit meeting in London
between President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Reagan, an Aquarian, and Mrs. Thatcher, a Libran, ``enjoy a
marvelous cerebral relationship'' with all the right ingredients to
get things done, but this isn't the week to do them, said Russell
Grant, president emeritus of the British Astrological Psychic
Society.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said Sunday
it commissioned the forecast from Grant.
   Grant said Reagan's meeting with Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday and
Friday, with Mercury starting to go backwards through the planetary
system, comes during a ``very unstable period.''
   The president flies to London after his meeting in Moscow with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``If he has got an astrologer advising him, I would have steered
clear of this period more than any other time in the year,'' Grant
said.
   ``You could reach an agreement today, and in a month's time
people could renege on it,'' he said. ``What is going on at the
moment is so volatile and so unpredictable that you really cannot
stand by what is said.''
   But the astrologer said the intuitive powers of Nancy Reagan, a
shrewd Cancerian, could be ``invaluable'' during the president's
London visit.
   He said Queen Elizabeth II, a Taurus who is having a tea for the
Reagans at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, would also be a positive
influence.
   Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology made headlines around the
world this month when former White House Chief of Staff Donald
Regan published a book alleging that the first lady's astrological
advice affected the president's schedule.
   The president has denied this.

   A soul food restaurant it isn't, although
some patrons might wonder about souls wafting through the rooms of
a soon-to-open eatery converted from a funeral home.
   ``I have not encountered any negative reaction from the local
people about it,'' Phil Robbins, co-owner of the new restaurant,
The Gables, said recently. ``The local folks have dropped in and
they seem to be very excited about it.''
   Robbins, 47, one of three owners of the former Jacoby Brothers'
Funeral Home, said holding part-time jobs as a cook when he was
younger in order to supplement his teacher's salary piqued his
interest in restaurants.
   So April 29, Robbins, and two other Alton High School employees
_ one a school teacher and the other a custodian _ bought the
building for $65,500.
   Though reaction has been positive, at least one local restaurant
owner wonders whether eating at The Gables, set to open in
mid-June, will be hard to swallow.
   ``I could see where it might raise some questions. Some people
it might bother if they're kind of squeamish anyway,'' said Lori
Schneider, who manages Grandmother's Kitchen. She says eating at
the restaurant wouldn't bother her.
   Judy Goforth, the local postmaster, said: ``This business about
a funeral home doesn't seem to be a big deal because the town's so
small, there's probably nobody in the funeral home more than five
times a year.
   ``In a small town,'' she explained, ``you go to the funeral ...
the church and somebody has a big meal afterward.''
   And anyway, she added, ``The majority of the people will be
tourist types. The ones who live here aren't the superstitious
type.''
   The white-frame building with spacious rooms was built around
1900. It has been home to Grafton's mayor and the village dentist
and was converted to a funeral home about 15 years ago.
   The 2,500-square-foot restaurant will hold about 200 customers.
Robbins says The Gables menu will be moderately priced and feature
seafood and chicken.
   He expects most patrons will be tourists visiting the
Mississippi River town of 1,000 about 30 miles northeast of St.
Louis.
   Robbins said the he plans to include a brief history of the
building on the menu, including its funereal past. And he stressed
that Jacoby Brothers' was only a ``viewing parlor,'' and mortuary
work was done elsewhere.
   ``I think we'll get over our hurdle _ if there's any hurdle at
all,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A nine-month-old girl, who officials say is the
first infant ever to receive a second heart transplant, remained in
critical condition early Sunday, a nursing supervisor said.
   Kiersten Jones, of the Dallas suburb of Flower Mound, received a
new heart during 4{ hours of surgery at Children's Medical Center
on Saturday. Her body rejected the first transplant, which she
received April 12.
   She was in critical condition in the hospital's intensive care
unit, where she was expected to remain for three or four days, said
nursing supervisor Victoria Baxter.
   A spokeswoman at Loma Linda University Medical Center in
California, where the first infant heart transplant was performed
in 1985, said Jones was the first infant to undergo a second
transplant.
   ``Unless I'm missing something, that would be a first,''
spokeswoman Anita Rockwell told the Dallas Times Herald. ``We've
kept up with these things, and we'd know if there was another one
out there.''
   ``The operation went well. But the doctors said it will require
a few days to fully evaluate her condition,'' said Barbara
Portmann, spokeswoman for Children's Medical Center.
   Kiersten is the daughter of Shields and Debra Jones of Flower
Mound. Seven months ago, she was diagnosed as suffering from
idiopathic cardiomyopathy, a deterioration of the heart muscle.
   The transplant was performed by Drs. Hisashi Nikaidoh, R.P.
Cochran and William Steves Ring, who has performed more than 100
heart transplants since 1984.
   Jones' operation in April was the first infant heart transplant
in Dallas.
   There have been 37 infant heart transplants in the United
States, including Jones' second operation. Twenty-one babies are
still living, including Baby Moses, who received the first
transplant at Loma Linda.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS VINCENNES IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of
this super-sophisticated warship says its presence in the Persian
Gulf gives U.S. officials many new options, including reducing the
number of Navy vessels.
   ``I think that it really gives the tactical commanders here in
the gulf an opportunity to pick and choose as they see fit,'' Capt.
Will C. Rogers III said in an interview on the bridge of the
9,400-ton Vincennes.
   The Vincennes on was on its first trip north through the gulf.
   Its arrival in the waterway was part of an extensive turnover in
the Navy's gulf-based force planned for the next several days. At
least 10 ships are involved in the rotation, announced by the
Pentagon in April.
   The San Diego-based Vincennes is the first of the Navy's
billion-dollar Aegis missile cruisers to be deployed as a member of
the Middle East Force operating in the gulf.
   The Aegis system is an array of powerful radars and missile
weaponry linked with computers to enable a single ship to manage a
widespread battle, carrying out dozens of radar surveillance and
firing missions at the same time.
   U.S. officials have not explained why the Vincennes, designed
primarily for carrier battle group defense in the open ocean, is
being assigned to the gulf, where its long reach and massive clout
would appear to exceed any current threat posed to the Navy's
convoy escort operations or U.S. interests.
   Some Vincennes officers and crew members say privately they are
puzzled by the deployment. The ship was abruptly pulled out of a
naval exercise off California. After less than four days in port to
prepare, it made a 13,000-mile high-speed dash to the Arabian Sea
in 32 days.
   The Vincennes' varied capabilities can make it the equivalent of
several other warships in a combat situation, Rogers said Saturday.
   ``It can be a force multiplier. On the other side of the coin,
because of these capabilities, to manage an area as large as the
Persian Gulf, virtually as far as its surveillance capabilities, it
can be a force reducer as well,'' he said.
   Asked whether the Navy was considering a cut in the 17 warships
it has in the gulf, Rogers said that was ``above my pay grade, but
there certainly is an option there.''
   Iran and Iraq both have attacked neutral ships during the
``tanker war,'' a four-year spinoff of their 7{-year gulf war. More
than 500 commercial vessels have been damaged, several have been
sunk and more than 300 seamen have died during the tanker war.
   Rogers, who earlier described Iran as a ``low-level threat'' in
the gulf, said the armed speedboats used by Iran to raid neutral
shipping, usually in reprisal for Iraqi air attacks, cannot be
disregarded.
   ``Small craft are always difficult targets, and a dedicated
attack by anyone who wants to press it home is a difficult problem
to deal with, regardless of the capabilities of the defender,'' he
said.
   Rogers said his ship would stay alert, but ``at the same time I
don't want to give the impression that we're leaning forward on our
toes to get a major conflagration started here, because that's not
the case at all.''
   U.S. policy in the gulf recently was expanded to allow Navy
ships to intervene in attacks on vessels not flying the U.S. flag.
Iran has carried out four such raids since then, but U.S. officials
say no American warships were close enough to get involved.
   Rogers, a native of Fort Worth, Texas, said the Vincennes,
despite its high-tech radar and weapons, is as vulnerable as other
warships to mines, ``and that basically is where our prime concern
is.''

   The valedictorian at St. Bernard High
School was a bit wistful at last week's graduation as he recalled
some of the problems his class faced at one of the parish's
single-sex secondary schools.
   During freshman year, the boys in his class had to cope with
intimidation from upperclassmen, Joseph Zanco said.
   ``In our sophomore year, we had another problem to deal with _
females. They were everywhere but in the school,'' he said.
   Zanco's successor will be spared that lament because next year
the four high schools in St. Bernard Parish in suburban New Orleans
will go co-educational for the first time in a generation.
   The change was sparked by a lawsuit won last year by a parent
last year who wanted his son and daughter to attend the same school.
   Hilbert Wall's suit said his children were victims of
discrimination because they weren't being taught the same things.
Calls to Wall's home went unanswered Sunday.
   Court-ordered racial desegregation of New Orleans schools helped
lead to the sexual segregation of St. Bernard's high schools 22
years ago.
   The parish was a magnet for so-called ``white flight'' from the
inner city, and the population boom strapped the school board's
budget. To economize, school officials decided to split high
schools by sex, building sports stadiums at boys' schools and home
economics labs at girls schools.
   ``At the time, we thought we were doing the taxpayers a
service,'' Davies said. ``It all went off quite well. In those
days, there weren't many boys trying to be cheerleaders. And being
a secretary was still thought of as a job for girls. So there was
no reason to have a big stenographic lab for boys _ they just
weren't going to sign up for it.''
   School Board President John Lane said the reversion to
co-education won't be cheap. A no-frills conversion _ modifying
bathrooms, adding extra equipment and duplicating courses _ will
cost the board about $300,000, he said.
   ``Financially, it's going to be devastating this year,'' Lane
said. ``But the staff is ready. And the kids are ready.''
   Henry Smith, a supervisor with St. Bernard Parish schools,
looked forward to the change. ``It teaches kids to socialize
better. And it's my personal observation that students tend to
behave a bit better,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Woos Environmental Support In New Jersey; Prepares For
Meetings With Black Supporters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELMAR, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis wooed environmentalists Sunday while campaigning in advance
of New Jersey's primary and prepared to meet with black supporters
to plot a national strategy for the fall.
   The Massachusetts governor, apparently confident of a win here
June 7, made only two public appearances, taking a boat cruise with
environmentalists before heading to a barbecue.
   As the S.S. Miss Belmar prepared to head out into polluted ocean
waters, Dukakis told a small gathering at the docks that as
president he would forcefully direct cleanup programs.
   ``I'm going to do everything I can as president of the United
States ... to make sure that our oceans and our rivers and our
coastlines are what they ought to be,'' Dukakis said.
   He said a strong federal environmental policy is particularly
needed in areas like New Jersey, which blames much of the pollution
in its waters on neighboring New York.
   Ironically, the Reagan administration appointee who heads the
Boston EPA office had to get a court order to speed up the Dukakis'
administration's cleanup of Boston Harbor, the nation's filthiest
harbor.
   ``Nobody is without sin,'' Dukakis said, conceding he was wrong
to delay the cleanup, which will cost more than $3 billion.
   While aboard the boat, members of local environmental groups
showed Dukakis a harbor chart marked in areas polluted by sewage,
sludge and trash dumping. Less than a mile off one public beach a
brown film covered the water, which was strewn with floating
garbage.
   ``It's pretty disgusting,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis denounced the dumping of raw sewage into waterways and
said the nation's trash-disposal problem could be eased with vastly
expanded recycling and conservation programs. He also spoke in
favor of new, biodegradeable plastics made from corn and other
crops.
   Dukakis, who hopes to lock up the Democratic nomination with
wins in New Jersey and California on the final primary day, also
attended three private receptions, a gathering with Hispanic
leaders, an environmental forum and a reception for a state senator
running for Congress.
   He was to return home to Boston Sunday night and meet Monday
morning with about 60 black supporters from across the country
before attending local Memorial Day services..
   Dukakis has conceded the black vote to rival Democrat Jesse
Jackson throughout the primary season. In recent weeks, however, he
has begun to actively seek black support, which is seen a critical
in order to defeat the expected GOP candidate, Vice President
George Bush _ particularly in closely contested Southern states.
   Jackson also was in New Jersey on Sunday, while Bush was
conducting private meetings with advisers at his summer home in
Maine.
   Polls have shown Dukakis with a wide lead over Jackson here.
   Dukakis was to return to New Jersey later this week before
heading back to California to campaign through primary day. He also
plans to make stops in Montana and New Mexico, which also hold June
7 primaries.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Syrian troops with automatic
weapons patrolled the slums of south Beirut on Sunday, and a
leading Shiite Moslem cleric pledged to work for the release of
foreign hostages believed held there.
   ``Although I possess no great means of pressure, I shall exert
continuous efforts to resolve the question of the hostages,''
Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, was quoted as saying.
   ``I am viewing the hostages' issue from both humanitarian and
Islamic standpoints. It is hurting our credibility,'' the Beirut
daily Ad-Dijar quoted Fadlallah as saying in an interview published
Sunday.
   Fadlallah has made several such pledges in the past three years.
Although Hezbollah, or Party of God, has publicly denied
involvement in the kidnappings, the group is widely believed to be
an umbrella for underground factions that are holding the hostages.
   In Damascus, an informed Syrian source said the hostages were
not part of a Syrian-Iranian deal under which the Syrian army
intervened Friday to halt a three-week battle between rival Shiite
militias that killed 300 people and wounded 1,000. The source spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Syria's information minister, Mohammed Salman, said Saturday
that ``there is no timetable for the release of the hostages.''
   Salman said Syria was seeking to establish a central authority
in Lebanon, ravaged by 13 years of civil war.
   ``Unless we reach that, there will not be presidential
elections,'' he said, warning of a constitutional vacuum after
President Amin Gemayel's term ends in September.
   A Syrian command source said Saturday that Syrian soldiers would
remain outside the Hay Madi district, which harbors the main
barracks of the Hezbollah.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, were
believed to be held in the Hezbollah barracks. The hostage held
longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   A Lebanese security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Syrian deployment around Hay Madi would stop kidnappers
from moving ``the hostages from one place to another.''
   The Syrians, armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers, moved into the south Beirut suburbs after the
fighting between Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Amal militia.
   During the fighting, Hezbollah seized control of more than 90
percent of the 16-square-mile enclave from Amal.
   Salman said Saturday that Syrian troops would withdraw ``within
a few days'' and leave security in the hands of Lebanese police.
But on Sunday Salman said he meant that they would be withdrawn
gradually and only as the security situation allowed.
   He said Syrian troops will remain stationed at eight points on
the perimeter of the area and be on constant alert to move in
``when security demands or when requested by the Lebanese security
forces.''
   He also said the Syrians have no plans to disarm either Amal or
Hezbollah.

<HEAD>Party Leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia Meet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Communist Party leaders of the southern
republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia met Sunday and discussed ways
to lessen the tension between their ethnic groups, the Tass news
agency reported.
   Tass said Abdul-Rahman Vezirov of Azerbaijan and Suren
Arutyunyan of Armenia, who were selected to their posts May 21,
visited factories in both republics.
   ``They examined the issues of stepping up economic and cultural
relations and educating working people in a spirit of
internationalism,'' Tass said.
   Internationalism is a Soviet buzzword for tolerance of other
ethnic groups, and the Tass reference indicated that the two
leaders discussed the tense relations that earlier this year
erupted into violence in which at least 32 people were killed.
   Armenians are demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh, an area of
Azerbaijan whose population is predominantly ethnic Armenian, be
annexed to Armenia.
   Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of
the Armenian capital of Yerevan in mid-February. Three days of
rioting broke out at the end of February in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait. Officials said 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were
killed.
   Unrest began to rise again in recent weeks, and on May 21 top
Communist Party officials held meetings in both Armenia and
Azerbaijan. Armenian party leader Karen Demirchyan and Azerbaijani
leader Kyamran Bagirov were fired.
   Vezirov was the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, while Arutyunyan
had been Armenia's first deputy prime minister.

<HEAD>Problems Pile Up After Only Launderette Closes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVINCETOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat of ring-around-the-collar
looms for this popular summer resort, whose only coin-operated
laundry has been closed since September and whose nearest
launderette is 26 miles away.
   ``I have one friend I allow to use my washer and I limit it at
that,'' said Robin Watson, an aide to Town Manager Bill McNulty.
``But I know 10 who'd like to.''
   The town's elderly have already felt the inconvenience, McNulty
said. But this community at the outer tip of Cape Cod has its
population of 4,000 increase to 45,000 during the summer. That has
McNulty worried.
   ``I foresee a serious impact on the town's economy and vitality
if there isn't some remediation,'' McNulty said.
   Kenneth Eldredge closed the laundry in September after his
septic system failed. State officials gave him three choices: Haul
out the waste water by truck, build a treatment plant for about
$300,000, or close. He closed.
   Since the nearest coin-operated laundry is 26 miles away in
Orleans, two women may clean up because of Provincetown's problem.
   Jean LeBlanc, 35, and Linda Ersoy, 29, began their laundry
service, Wash Day Blues, two years ago. They get up each morning at
4, load a van with about 500 pounds of dirty laundry and drive 32
miles to Chatham to wash it.
   They charge $1.35 a pound for the service, and a $2 fee for
pickup and delivery. Regular, year-round customers get a better
price and don't pay for delivery.
   Their work day ends about 6 p.m., but may extend to 11 p.m. when
the summer season gets into full swing.
   ``People think there's great money in this, but then they find
out it's a lot more work for the money you make,'' said LeBlanc.
``Other people have started laundry businesses, but by midseason
they say, `Goodbye.'''

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded nine Arabs in
clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Sunday, and
about 60 Palestinians were treated for tear gas and rubber bullet
injuries, hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank, classes resumed for about 70,000 Arab junior
high school students. Sunday marked the second stage of Israel's
plan to reopen 1,200 schools shut nearly four months ago because of
the Palestinian uprising.
   Israeli officials have said they are reopening schools because
the uprising, which began Dec. 8, has quieted.
   A militant Jewish settler said her car was stoned by about 150
schoolgirls near the West Bank town of Qalqiliya and that she had
to fire into the air before the army rescued her.
   Daniella Weiss, a leading figure in the Gush Emunim (Bloc of the
Faithful) settlement movement, criticized the army for reopening
the schools. ``There is no justification for allowing them to go
back to regular studies because they are becoming a terrorist
force,'' she told Israel radio.
   The worst violence was in the isolated West Bank village of
Jaba, north of Nablus. Military sources and hospital officials said
troops wounded seven Palestinians with live bullets.
   Israel radio quoted Arab reports as saying an Arab woman died in
the clash but the army denied the report.
   The sources said the clash occurred when protesters blocked the
road to Jaba with stones and threw rocks at a patrol trying to get
in. The soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets but opened fire
with live ammunition after the protesters refused to disperse.
   In the West Bank village of Bazzariya near Nablus, an officer
shot and wounded an Arab villager after the man attacked him with a
cement block at a roadblock set up by protesters, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip, a 29-year-old man was in serious condition at
Shifa Hospital after being shot by Israeli troops who fired on
stone-throwers in the Shati refugee camp, hospital officials said.
   On Saturday night, youths threw stones and firebombs in nearby
Jabaliya camp, and Israeli troops responded with tear gas and
rubber bullets, Arab news reports said. About 60 people were
treated for injuries at the camp clinic.
   A taxi was set ablaze in the West Bank city of Ramallah and
rocks were thrown at passing cars.
   At least 198 Arabs and two Israelis have died in the six months
of unrest.
   In the West Bank, about 300 middle or junior high schools
opened, a week after classes resumed in elementary schools and
kindergartens. High schools are to reopen next week.
   At one middle school for girls in El-Bireh, the principal showed
a reporter damage that she said was done by Israeli soldiers who
used the school as a headquarters. She spoke on condition that her
name and the name of the school not be used.
   In one room, obscenities about Arabs were written on walls in
Hebrew with an orange crayon. The Star of David and the word
``Israel'' in Hebrew also were scrawled on several classroom walls.
   Samira Mustafa, a mother of two teen-age daughters, said parents
were worried about Israeli soldiers stationed near Palestinian
schools.
   ``It's quiet now. Why are the soldiers outside the schools?''
she asked. ``They want the boys and girls to throw stones at them.''
   A young girl in a school uniform was asked if she thought
reopening schools signaled quieter times. ``I don't think so,
because even the uprising people want us to go back to class,'' she
said.
   A spokesman for the military government in the West Bank said
that the government is expected to free from prison dozens of
youths ages 14 to 18 who were arrested in demonstrations and want
to return to classes.
   ``This is a goodwill gesture on our part,'' said spokesman
Olivier Rafowicz. ``We think it could help in a kind of
normalization.''

   Raisa Gorbachev wishes American women and their
families ``peaceful and clear skies over our planet'' in a message
the Soviet first lady sent to Time magazine.
   ``The more we learn about the life of the peoples of our
countries today, their concerns and their aspirations, the sooner
we will have a better understanding of one another,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev wrote.
   The magazine said Mrs. Gorbachev sent the unsolicited message
after learning that Time was preparing an article on contemporary
Soviet women.
   ``I retain warm memories of the meetings I had with American
women in Moscow and Washington in December 1987,'' Mrs. Gorbachev
said. ``Quite a number of differences stand between us. But I feel
that they in no way hinder discussions of any problems that are of
concern to us: how to preserve peace, how to make the life of every
individual on Earth worthy of our times.''
   The letter went on to describe Soviet women's contributions to
the history of their country, ``marked by striking selflessness and
self-sacrifice, by boundless kindness and charity.''
   ``Our women know the price of war and peace. They are ardent and
convinced champions of peace,'' Mrs. Gorbachev wrote.
   ``Today the Soviet woman is proud of her participation in
`perestroika,' in the renewal of society. There are grounds for
this. Perestroika is distinguished by a vigorous social policy.
This is very important for improving people's everyday life and
family life and for the upbringing of children.''
   The letter concludes: ``I sincerely wish the readers of Time,
all American women and their families peaceful and clear skies over
our planet, and happiness.''

   Dave Simon hopes his company's ``Belle
of Wisconsin'' will one day be listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as the world's largest hunk of Cheddar cheese.
   Belle, measuring 5 feet, 10 inches tall and 20 feet long and
weighing 40,060 pounds, was unveiled this weekend in Little Chute
and Madison, where it was transported in a tailor-made Cheesemobile.
   The cheese, manufactured by Simon and his 35 employees at
Simon's Specialty Cheese, was the product of 7,000 cows. It two
days' worth of milk production from 60 dairy farms. It will be cut
into one-pound blocks and sold in about a year.
   Depending on how quickly it ages, the colossal cheese should
retail at about $150,000, according to the Wisconsin Cheese Makers
Association.
   ``We never had any problems. When we were taking it out of the
cooler, though, we only had one-sixteenth of an inch of clearance
on both sides as it came through the doors,''said Gary Romenesko,
sales manager at Simon's.
   Belle should set a new Guinness record, surpassing the
34,591-pound ``Golden Giant'' displayed at the 1964 World's Fair by
the Cheese Maker's Association.
   The cheese will tour the United States, stopping at grocery
stores, state fairs and special events along the way, according to
its creators.

   A 300-pound piano dangling 200 feet in
the air from a helicopter came down and went thud, crash, kapow,
bang.
   But there were no sour notes in those sounds as 300 friends of
the late John Cameron ``J.C.'' Young used $2,000 of the money left
to them in Young's will to have the musical instrument dropped from
the sky Saturday in his honor. A big party was scheduled afterward.
   The crazy event was just the sort of thing Young would have

student at the University of Washington, according to his friends.
   Jerry Reed, who described himself as Young's drinking buddy from
Sausalito, laughed heartily at the sound of the crash.
   ``It's the kind of thing he loved,'' said Reed. ``I think he
would have thought it was wild. Life was a crazy experience for
him, and he had his foot to the floorboard.''
   Young, who owned several shops that sold foam furniture, died

   Although their wedding appeared
traditional, Bryan Hill and Sohn-Ho Sohn traveled an unlikely road
to marriage.
   The two former pen pals were married Saturday at St. Sebastian's
Congregation Church in this southeastern Wisconsin community.
   Hill, a Sturtevant native stationed at the U.S. Air Force base
in Cocoa Beach, Fla., said marriage was the last thing on his mind
when he began writing to Sohn in South Korea five years ago.
   ``Through the letters, I learned about her,'' Hill said. ``We
didn't start out intending to get married.''
   Hill said he began writing Sohn in 1983 to help her learn
English. Sohn is a cousin of Hill's best friend's wife.
   The couple did not meet until 1986 when they spent two weeks
together. Hill said the short encounter convinced him Sohn was the
one to marry.
   ``My friends call me the last of the great romantics,'' Hill
said.
   ``We started by explaining each other's countries and sending
maps,'' he said. ``She would send poems and I'd send back poems and

<HEAD>Baker: Meese Could Hurt Bush's Presidential Prospects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said
Sunday that President Reagan still has confidence in Attorney
General Edwin Meese III but believes Meese's legal problems could
harm George Bush politically.
   Baker said Reagan ``certainly doesn't have a closed mind'' about
Meese, but the chief of staff added: ``It would take an
extraordinary event to shake that confidence that the president
still has in the attorney general.''
   Baker, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' was questioned
about reports that Vice President Bush would like to see Meese
leave the Justice Department, and said that while Bush's opinions
carry weight in the administration, ``the president must decide
these issues himself.''
   Baker acknowledged Meese's problems could hurt Bush's election
prospects, but added that ``the show isn't over yet,'' noting that
independent counsel James McKay has yet to report the results of
his investigation of the attorney general's financial dealings.
   ``Let's give Meese his opportunity to rebut whatever
allegations, if any, are made in the McKay report before we make a
final judgement on its ultimate political impact,'' Baker said.
   Asked if Reagan shares Baker's judgement that Meese's woes could
hurt Bush politically, Baker said: ``Oh, I think so _ for the
moment and to some degree. But I think that he too would urge you
to wait and see how all this unfolds and develops.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis wooed New Jersey environmentalists
Sunday while rival Jesse Jackson continued his attacks on the
Reagan administration's drug policy as the primary campaign headed
into the final stretch. Republican George Bush, vacationing in
Maine, again met with advisers to map out his November strategy.
   With the four remaining primaries just over a week away, the two
Democrats spent their Memorial Day weekend campaigning in New
Jersey, which has 109 delegates at stake. All told, 466 delegates
are up for grabs on June 7 in California, New Mexico, Montana and
New Jersey.
   Dukakis is within striking distance of the 2,081 needed to
nominate with 1,711 delegates. Jackson has 984 delegates.
   Front-runner Dukakis, who leads Jackson in recent New Jersey
opinion polls, took a boat cruise with environmentalists and also
attended three private receptions.
   Dukakis inspected polluted waters off Asbury Park, N.J.. saying:
``It's pretty disgusting.''
   He promised to work aggressively to direct environmental cleanup
programs, but acknowledged that his own state's efforts to clean up
dirty Boston Harbor had gotten off to a slow start.
   While the candidate campaigned in New Jersey, the British
Broadcasting Corp. televised a taped interview with Dukakis in
which the Massachusetts governor said the Soviet Union's economic
problems led Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to another summit
with President Reagan.
   Dukakis said Gorbachev is probably the first Soviet leader ``to
recognize that communism is a failure, at least the way it's been
practiced in the Soviet Union.''
   ``Unless the Soviet Union begins to devote significantly more
resources to its domestic economy ... and less to the military,
than they're going to become a third-rate economic power,'' he said.
   Dukakis, who was interviewed by the BCC last week while he
campaigned in California, said ``most thoughtful observers agree
that it is the very serious condition of the Soviet domestic
situation that has been largely responsible'' for Gorbachev's
involvement in the summit.
   Jackson, meanwhile, renewed his criticisms of the
administration's decision to negotiate with Panamanian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who faces charges of drug trafficking.
   ``They're negotiating with Noriega for silence,'' Jackson told a
breakfast fund-raiser in Newark, N.J. and church-goers at the New
Hope Baptist Church.
   The Democratic candidate suggested that Reagan tried to work out
a deal to force Noriega from power to silence him before the Moscow
summit with Gorbachev.
   Jackson said Bush would like to see Noriega silenced before the
general election in November.
   With the last round of primaries approaching, Jackson was
acknowledging that his campaign was nearing its end.
   ``When the race is over June 7, life goes on June 8,'' he said,
but added: ``We should never forget this campaign.''
   He also noted that Bush has been raising the drug issue, and
suggested that his own emphasis on the issue was responsible for
the vice president's interest.
   ``Bush has thanked me but he should ask me how to do it because
he doesn't know how,'' Jackson said. ``Now that I've set the
agenda, I want to work out the plan.''
   Bush, who is spending the week at his vacation retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, met with his close advisers Sunday to
continue mapping his strategy for the November election.
   The likely Republican nominee's showing in recent opinion polls,
in which he trails Dukakis in a one-on-one match-up _ in double
digits in some surveys _ has advisers worried about his prospects.
   Bush met with Republican Govs. John Sununu of New Hampshire and
James Thompson of Illinois on Saturday to plan how to depart from
some Reagan administration policies.
   ``The vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his
own agenda,'' Thompson said after the meeting. ``I don't think
there was any doubt about that at all.''
   Sununu said ``the domestic side is going to be one of the strong
points of the Bush campaign and the Bush presidency'' in contrast
to what he said were ``management failures of the Dukakis
administration'' as governor of Massachusetts.
   In response to Sununu's comments, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach
said: ``If there weren't jobs in Massachusetts for the people who
lived in New Hampshire, the New Hampshire unemployment rate would
practically triple.''

   Men firing submachine guns kidnapped a
newspaper executive and former Conservative presidential candidate
Sunday and killed his bodyguard.
   Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, 69, the son of former President Laureano
Gomez, was seized as he left church.
   The abduction came during a wave of leftist guerrilla violence,
including the kidnapping of three mayors-elect of small towns, two
ambushes that left seven soldiers dead, and guerrilla attacks on
two towns and an oil pipeline.
   Gomez's family issued a statement confirming the kidnapping.
Some radio stations reported the family said Gomez had been
wounded, but the statement did not say that. The statement appealed
for medical attention for Gomez in case he had been wounded.
   An anonymous person claiming to be one of the kidnappers called
the Bogota radio station Todelar. Then a voice sounding like Gomez
said in Spanish, ``Oh, oh, I'm dying.''
   Todelar played a recording of the telephone call.
   President Virgilio Barco, on a state visit to Portugal, said in
a statement that he ordered all government security forces to
search for Gomez.
   Gomez was leaving the church across from the British Embassy on
a broad, tree-lined street in the northern part of the Colombian
capital when the kidnappers jumped him.
   ``I had said goodbye (to Gomez) and had walked maybe 15 steps
when I heard the sound of submachine guns,'' said a former federal
senator, Alfonso Palacio.
   ``I hit the ground and then I saw four men pushing him into a
car,'' Palacio said in an interview with radio station RCN.
   Gomez's only bodyguard was hit by 14 bullets and died in a
hospital, police said.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the abduction of Gomez,
director of the Bogota morning daily El Siglo. In editorials, Gomez
has consistently called for ``a country free of guerrillas.''
   Leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads, drug traffickers
and other criminals all have been active in kidnapping and killing
public officials in the last five years.
   Gomez last ran for president on the Conservative party ticket in
March 1986 and was defeated by Barco, the Liberal Party candidate.
   Gomez' son, Mauricio Gomez, who was the director of a television
news program, fled to Madrid last year after he received kidnapping
threats. He is still living in Madrid.
   An army colonel, a captain and three other soldiers were killed
in an apparent guerrilla ambush Sunday near San Vicente in the
northern state of Santander, the police said in a communique.
   A lieutenant and a soldier were killed in another ambush in the
northern region of Urba, RCN quoted the national police as saying.
   The mayors-elect were kidnapped Saturday in towns in the
northern state of Bolivar. They are Andres Castro of Pinillos,
Antonio Morato of Rio Viejo and Henry Cosio of Barrnaco de Loba,
the police said.
   A leftist guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, claimed
responsibililty, police said. The mayors-elect were to have taken
office next Wednesday.
   Two months ago 16 mayors were kidnapped by leftist guerrillas
who lectured the mayors to do more for the poor and then let them
go.
   Leftist guerrillas Saturday attacked Carcasi, 220 miles
northeast of Bogota, and Majugual, 280 miles north of Bogota, the
police said.
   Guerrillas firing mortars, rocket propelled grenades and
automatic assault rifles stormed the police station in Carcasi, a
statement from the national police said.
   Two policemen were killed, three were wounded and three were
captured, and the police station was reduced to rubble, the
statement said.
   The guerrillas left pamphlets saying they were members of the
National Liberation Army, which follows the communist ideology of
Cuban president Fidel Castro.
   Another guerrilla group, the Maoist People's Liberation Army,
attacked the police station in Majugual and tried unsuccessfully to
rob the town's only bank, but the police repulsed the attackers,
the statement said.
   The National Liberation Army blew up the country's main oil
pipeline again Saturday, another police statement said.
   The pipeline takes oil from the big Canon Limon field on the
Venezuelan border in the northeast state of Arauca. Occidental
Petrolem, Royal Dutch Shell and the Colombian state oil company,
Ecopetrol, operate the field.
   Several yards of the pipeline were destroyed in the explosion
and thousands of gallons of oil were spilled before pumps could be
shut down, police said.
   The 500-mile pipeline goes to Covenas, a port on Colombia's
Caribbean coast.
   It was the 26th time this year that the guerrilla group has
attacked the pipeline. The group says it will continue the attacks
until foreign oil companies' operations in Colombia are
nationalized.

<HEAD>Turkish Cypriots Burn Effigy of U.N. Commander After Fatal
Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 600 Turkish Cypriots rallied Sunday
to demand the removal of the Austrian commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force on the divided island after a U.N. soldier
killed a Turkish Cypriot.
   Protesters burned an effigy of Maj. Gen. Gunther Greindl, the
commander of the 2,300-man U.N. force, and carried banners calling
him a murderer.
   The rally followed a religious service in a mosque in Famagusta
in memory of Hussein Kafa. The 57-year-old farmer was killed May 21
in the village of Pyla, the only place where the Turkish Cypriots
and Greek Cypriots still live together.
   Officials of the U.N. force said Kafa crossed into the
peacekeeping force's zone of operations in the village, claiming he
wanted to mend a wall around his farm.
   They said that when two Austrian soldiers ordered him out of the
buffer zone, he drew a pistol and fired at them. The soldiers fired
back three pistol shots, killing Kafa instantly.
   Rauf Denktash, president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state
in the northern third of the island, charged after the shooting
that Greindl ordered Austrian troops to harass Kafa and held him
responsible. Greindl denied the allegation.
   At the end of the rally, Kafa's three daughters left a black
wreath at the Austrian base.
   The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into Greek and
Turkish sectors since 1974, when Turkey invaded the island in the
wake of an Athens-backed coup.
   In another development, Kenan Atakol, head of the foreign and
defense ministeries of the self-proclaimed Turkish state, accused
the peacekeepers of negligence in the shooting death of a Turkish
soldier by Greek Cypriot police on Saturday.
   Cpl. Yusuf Sanli was shot after he tried to rape a Greek Cypriot
woman, fatally shot a national guardsman and wounded another,
officials in the southern Greek sector said.
   ``The village where the killing took place is in the buffer
zone, which should be under the control of the U.N. force,'' Atakol
said at a news conference. ``They should not have let the armed
Greek Cypriots enter this region.''
   About 30,000 Turkish soldiers are based in the Turkish sector.
The village, Atheniou, is near the green line that divides the
sectors.
   Greek Cypriot police moved into the village southeast of Nicosia
several hours after the guardsmen were shot and fatally shot the
soldier when he tried to open fire at them.
   ``There is negligence on the part of the peacekeeping forces,''
Atakol said. ``Had they informed us before the operation launched,
death of the two soldiers would have been avoided.''
   He said Sanli might have crossed the line by mistake and tried
to hide or ask for food. ``My investigation shows that he was a
good-mannered, disciplined and religious person,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Sister Anne Neylon swapped her nun's habit
for racing gear Sunday and rode Sweet Divine to victory in an
unusual charity horse race on the banks of the River Boyne.
   The Derby it wasn't.
   But as seven sisters swept along the track, the 8,000 spectators
in a field at Trim 30 miles from Dublin shared excitement matching
anything the racegoers at Epsom will experience Wednesday during
Britain's most prestigious race.
   Michael Regan, who organized the race to benefit the convents'
chosen charities, had predicted, ``We'll have more nuns than `The
Sound of Music.''' Sisters from more than a dozen orders around the
country, dressed in their black and white habits and veils, cheered
as fervently as any other track fans as their favorites set off on
the one-mile course.
   The racing nuns wore jodhpurs and safety helmets.
   The horses, all borrowed from local owners, received temporary
names with an ecclesiastical flavor.
   But despite morning prayers, things didn't go perfectly.
   Sister Olive Irwin, a convent boarding school cook, had to
scratch when her mount Nun Sense died a few minutes before the
start.
   A horse called Mother Superior, to be ridden by Sister Sebastian
Kennedy, didn't show up at the course at all.
   Sister Annunciata McAuley tumbled off her 5-1 chance Sound of
Music 20 yards out of the starting gate.
   Eighty yards farther on, Sister Fiona Pryle from the nearby Good
Shepherd Convent was left sitting on the track when Vatican Calling
decided she was too much for him.
   Two more sisters hit the dirt around the back of the course
before the runaway leaders, Sister Ann Neylon and Sister Patrick
McDonnell, came back into sight in a neck-and-neck race.
   Sister Ann, a 25-year-old Daughter of Charity from Dublin, won
by a neck over Sweet Divine, the 6-4 favorite, edging out
5O-year-old Navan Mercy Convent schoolteacher Sister Patrick on
Devil's Bit.
   Bookmaker Michael Fitzgibbon had worked out the odds beforehand
by studying the nuns rather than the horses as the ladies arrived
at the course.
   ``It's one race where I am relying entirely on the weight of the
jockeys for my judgment,'' he said.
   ``There are some hefty sisters there who will never stay on
board,'' he predicted accurately.
   Sister Ann, a stablehand before she took her vows, gave credit
for her win to the prayers of her sisters.
   ``They were praying all week for me back at the convent,'' she
said.
   Sister Ann's $1,857 first prize goes to her favorite charity, a
Dublin inner-city youth project. A local school is to benefit from
sponsoring the event.

<HEAD>Historian Predicts Probe Will Blame Soviets For World War II
Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dissident historian predicted Sunday that a
joint Soviet-Polish investigation will determine that Soviet, not
Nazi German forces, were responsible for a World War II massacre of
thousands of Polish soldiers.
   ``I think the new commission will determine we are to blame,''
Roy A. Medvedyev said in a telephone interview.
   The Soviet government has for years blamed the killing of more
than 4,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest on Nazi occupation
forces. But on May 11, the Soviet newspaper Literary Gazette
published the first hint that Moscow would accept the version of
Western historians.
   Western scholars say the massacre in the forest near Smolensk,
250 miles west of Moscow, was carried out in April 1940 by the NKVD
_ the Soviet state security and police force headed then by
Lavrenti Beria, the dreaded henchman of dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   ``I have seen German protocols which said that Soviet bullets
were found in the exhumed bodies,'' the Literary Gazette quoted
Soviet historian A. Latshev as saying at a Moscow symposium of
Polish and Soviet historians and filmmakers.
   Latshev said the ``blank spot'' of the Katyn massacre could no
longer be tolerated.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, under his policy of
glasnost, or openness, has encouraged historians to uncover the
truth about historical events that were formerly distorted or
banned from discussion. The policy has led to sensational
admissions of repressions under Stalin.
   Last year, Gorbachev and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
signed an agreement on ideological cooperation that stressed the
necessity for a more truthful history of Polish-Soviet relations. A
Soviet-Polish commission was set up to investigate ``blank spots''
in the two countries' relations.
   Radio Moscow, in a report Thursday monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp. in London, said a wreath-laying ceremony was
held at a recently renovated monument at Katyn to ``the Polish
officers shot dead by the Nazis in 1941.'' But the report went on
to say that version of the massacre was now being reconsidered.
   Relatives and families of the executed Polish officers will,
under new rules, be allowed to visit the memorial, the broadcast
quoted Smolensk regional official Alexei Orlov as saying.
   In 1944, a Soviet commission stated that the officers were
killed by Germans, but in the early 1950s, a U.S. investigatory
commission blamed the Soviets.
   Mevedyev said times have changed and that ``the Poles insist on
an objective investigation.'' He predicted the result will be a
finding that Stalin and Beria were responsible.

<TEXT>
   Drag racing fans pelted police
with rocks, beer cans and bottles and nine people were arrested in
clashes with police that forced the closing of Bonneville Raceway
on its biggest night of the year.
   Dozens of spectators got cuts, scrapes and police dog bites in
brawling that broke out about 8 p.m. Saturday, but only two were
treated for minor injuries, authorities said.
   West Valley City Police Chief Dennis Nordfelt said three
officers were treated for injuries caused by flying rocks and
glass. ``Practically every officer that was there got hit, or
kicked, or hit with a projectile, including myself,'' he said.
   The melee began after two off-duty West Valley police officers,
working as track security, tried to arrest an unruly spectator and
forced him to the ground, Norfelt said.
   The officers were jumped by other fans and called for
assistance. They were joined by six or seven other officers with a
dog unit.
   Violence then erupted in waves between an angry crowd of 500 to
1,000 spectators and about 75 officers, including officers from
adjacent Salt Lake City, the Salt Lake County sheriff's department
and state Highway Patrol.
   Most fans apparently were not aware of the fighting until police
ordered the track closed for safety reasons about 8:30 p.m. and
tried to clear the area, inciting the mob further.
   The disturbance was the worst ever at the annual ``Fox Hunt''
drag race, typically the raceway's most raucous and popular event.
This year's race drew contestants from around the West and 10,000
to 12,000 spectators.
   Dick Godfrey, owner of the raceway, said Saturday that police
were to blame for responding overzealously to an isolated problem
involving only a few fans.
   ``If they (police) had waited 45 more minutes the race would
have been over and we would not have had this problem,'' Godfrey
said.
   Nine people were arrested on charges of public intoxication,
disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, assault and resisting arrest,
he said.
   Nordfelt said law enforcement officials met Sunday with Godfrey
and plan further meetings this week to seek ways to eliminate
similar problems in the future.

   A stunt pilot was killed before thousands
of people at an airshow Sunday when his biplane crashed and skidded
into a lake, authorities said.
   The plane crashed at Mountain Shadows Lake at 10:45 a.m. after
the pilot failed to steer out of a dive, authorities said.
   The pilot's body was recovered from the lake shortly after noon,
said Bob Newman, a trooper with the Texas Department of Public
Safety. His name was withheld ending notification of relatives,
Newman added.
   The plane hit the ground 250 feet from the banks of the private,
man-made lake about 15 miles east of El Paso, where thousands had
gathered for a Memorial Day weekend air show and hot air balloon
festival, Newman said.
   ``He had just completed doing a loop and he came out of the loop
headed west, but he took it too low,'' Newman said. ``He hit the
ground and skidded ... about 11 feet into the lake and sank in 18
feet of water.''
   Terry Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, gave no immediate details of the crash.

<HEAD>Survey Says 1,267 Western Firms In South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,267 companies from 20 Western
countries are doing business in South Africa but 188 companies from
seven countries have pulled out, according to a survey published
Monday.
   The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions survey said
Britain led the field with 374 companies still operating in South
Africa. It said the United States led the countries that pulled out
with 134 companies.
   The Brussels-based confederation is the largest trade union
organization in the non-communist world, with a membership of 87
million workers in 97 countries.
   Activists have urged Western companies to withdraw from South
Africa to pressure the government to end apartheid.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's system of traditional and
legalized racial segregation, the 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Confederation Secretary General John Vanderveken said in a press
release that the report was ``clear evidence of the triumph of
corporate greed over morality.''
   He derided the claim often made by investors in South Africa
that their presence could be an instrument for reform. ``Cheap
labor is what brings them to South Africa, not a desire to restore
social justice,'' Vanderveken said.
   The report was particularly critical of companies such as the
British Tyre and Rubber Co., which it said are failing to respect
internationally agreed minimum standards on wages and working
conditions.
   It also blamed some British companies for claiming to have
pulled out of South Africa but having retained substantial
interests there.
   ``The independent black trade union movement of South Africa is
adamant that economic sanctions remain the best way of bringing
peaceful change to their country,'' Vanderveken said. ``The ICFTU
remains committed to that policy.''
   Following Britain, countries with the biggest number of
companies still in South Africa were West Germany with 333; the
United States, 164; Japan, 103; France, 90; Switzerland, 54; the
Netherlands, 29; Austria, 28; Belgium, 20; Australia, 19; Canada,
18; Sweden and Denmark, 10 each; Italy, seven; Finland and Ireland,
two each; and Spain, Norway, Portugal and Greece with one each.
   Among the countries pulling out, Britain was No. 2 with 26
companies, Canada, 20; the Netherlands, four; France, two; and
Italy and Australia with one each.
   The labor organization said several of the 333 German companies
in South Africa were involved in the armaments industry. Among
those listed were BMW and Volkswagen, whose South Arican
subsidiaries were making armored cars, and a subsidiary of AEG
Telefunken, the electronics company, which makes switch gears for
armored cars.
   Among U.S. companies in South Africa were MGM, Twentieth Century
Fox and Pan American. French firms included the tourist company
Club Mediterranee and the pharmaceutical and chemical company
Rhone-Poulenc. The Dutch airline KLM and the electronics giant
Philips have subsidiaries in South Africa.
   The state-controlled Italian petroleum company ENI and Belgium's
leading holding company Societe Generale de Belgique were also
operating there, it said.

   The Army once again postponed the test burn
of a Pershing II rocket motor Sunday and will have to conduct the
test by Tuesday or face a further 30-day delay, officials said.
   The test burn is an important step in imposing terms of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which calls for the
United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate medium-range
missiles.
   Mary Wilson, spokeswoman for the Pueblo Army Depot Activity,
said Army officials were told they have until 5 p.m. Tuesday to
finish the test or it will have to be postponed under the INF
treaty.
   ``After the treaty enters into force, all assets of both
countries covered by the treaty would be frozen for 30 days,'' she
said. ``The test must then be treated as an elimination and done
according to provisions of the treaty.''
   The INF treaty was ratified Friday by the U.S. Senate Friday and
by the Soviet Presidium on Saturday. The treaty is expected to be
formalized by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
during the current Moscow summit and will be in force Wednesday.
   Adverse weather conditions have forced repeated postponements
since the originally scheduled test date of May 20.
   Wilson said an absence of wind led to Sunday's postponement. On
Saturday, instability in the upper winds and a threat of
thunderstorms forced officials to call off the test.
   The Army is aiming for a test burn at about 6:30 a.m. Monday,
Wilson said.
   If the test isn't completed by Tuesday, a Soviet delegation
probably would be allowed to monitor the test under the INF treaty,
Wilson said.
   The test burn is needed to determine the suitability of the
Pueblo site for destroying the Army's 420 Pershing missiles to
comply with the INF treaty.

   Bushy trees and soft earth helped a
17-month-old boy survive a more than 100-foot plunge from the
10th-floor balcony of an oceanfront hotel, authorities said.
   Ryan C. Lee of East Falmouth, Mass., apparently slipped through
a balcony railing at the Marriott Marco Island Resort on Friday
afternoon and hurtled 85 feet before smacking into a bushy sabal
palm.
   He broke through the branches of another tree before landing
headfirst in soft dirt.
   ``I'd say he's real lucky,'' Collier County sheriff's Sgt. John
McGuire said. ``If that had been me, I would have died on the way
down _ of fright.''
   The child was in satisfactory condition at Naples Community
Hospital Sunday night. He suffered a bump on the back of his head,
a black eye and a scratch on his stomach, a sheriff's report said.
   A hospital nursing supervisor declined to give further details.
   Ryan's parents, Paul Lee, 34, a physician, and Sharon Lee, 30,
checked into the hotel about 30 minutes before the accident.
Deputies theorize the toddler crawled to the balcony and slipped
through railings about six inches apart.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers and officials of more than
100 nations Sunday adopted a resolution calling for the elimination
of nuclear arms, the Cuban government news agency reported.
   The resolution, approved during the first day of a special
meeting on disarmament in Havana, the Cuban capital, praised the
superpower agreement to abolish intermediate-range nuclear weapons
as a first step toward nuclear disarmament.
   Foreign ministers of the Third World and non-aligned nations
also sent a message to President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, who are meeting in Moscow, calling for a 50-percent
reduction in the U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals by the end of the
year.
   ``In welcoming the progress made in bilateral (nuclear arms)
negotiations, we reiterate the necessity of encouraging
multilateral talks, especially in the framework of the United
Nations,'' the message said.
   The message was carried by the Cuban government's Prensa Latina
news agency in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
   Introduced by Cuba, the resolution called on the United States
and Soviet Union to adopt a ``program by stages for the total
elimination of nuclear arms. Also, it is imperative that other
states that possess nuclear arms be incorporated in this process,''
the news agency reported.
   The resolution said: ``We are firmly convinced that the treaty
between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination
of their short- and medium-range nuclear missiles and land bases
must mark the beginning of the process that must be consolidated.''
   President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe sent a message to the
ministerial conference saying that although the current climate
favors a political dialogue, the threat of world war continues.
   In his message, read to the meeting by Foreign Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira of Zimbabwe, Mugabe praised the U.S.-Soviet agreement
signed last December in Washington, the first superpower arms
treaty in 16 years.
   The agreement was ratified 93-5 by the U.S. Senate on Friday and
approved unanimously Saturday by the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet.
   Shamuyarira was quoted as telling the meeting that the arms
treaty shows that disarmament is possible and gives hope to
humanity.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal of Bolivia said Latin
American and Caribbean countries should be non-aligned so they can
help bring about disarmament, Prensa Latina reported.
   Cuba's vice president, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, was quoted as
telling the delegates that current international arms expenditures
were almost the same as the $1.2 trillion foreign debt of
developing countries.
   The conference had been scheduled to start on Saturday but was
delayed by the late arrival of some delegates.

   A team from North Carolina State University won a
battle of wits Sunday with students from 15 other schools to win
the national College Bowl championship.
   The questions ranged from science and politics to entertainment
trivia, and contestants were quick to distinguish their sport from
the popular board game Trivial Pursuit.
   ``Trivial Pursuit is about trivia, but College Bowl is about
things you should have learned in college,'' said Mike Barkin, a
25-year-old law school graduate on the team of runnerup Emory
University.
   ``One might think of College Bowl players as eggheads, but
eggheads are the worst college bowl players,'' said Don Reid, who
created the television game show 35 years ago and attended this
weekend's contest.
   ``It (College Bowl) takes someone who is able to participate
quickly in anything in life _ someone who's alive to what's going
on in the world.''
   One question in the final between N.C. State and Emory was: ``On
Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, he works from 9 to 5; on
Wednesdays, from 9 to 1; and on Fridays until early afternoon.
During working hours, he often takes two or three hours to read and
answer his fan mail.''
   Emory's Barkin pushed his buzzer and yelled, ``President
Reagan,'' before the moderator finished reading the question.
   That was correct, but it wasn't good enough to match the points
N.C. State team tallied during the two-day event at the Chicago
campus of the University of Illinois.
   Dan Petrus, a 24-year-old veterinary student at N.C. State who
trains four hours a week with his College Bowl team, said he's good
at the game because ``I remember a lot of facts and I'm able to
recall them quickly.''
   No prizes were awarded, but Petrus said the reward of beating
four-person teams from colleges such as Princeton University,
University of Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Cornell University ``is knowing that you've been able to think
faster and out-think the others _ it's an ego thing.''
   Only six of the 100 contestants were women. One of them, Peggi
Malys, a medical student at Emory, said she likes the game because
it develops, ``mental agility and cultural literacy.''

   About 20,000 workers seeking higher
wages went on strike Monday at Hyundai Motor Co.'s assembly plant
in Ulsan, South Korea's largest automaker reported.
   Officials said the production line at the plant on the southeast
coast stopped at 9 a.m. after the breakdown of the seventh round of
management-union talks that began May 18.
   The union sought an increase of 48 percent, or $183, in monthly
earnings excluding bonuses. Management offered a 25 percent raise,
or $106, officials said.
   They said Hyundai auto workers with five to six years of
experience now earn about $821 a month, including bonuses and other
allowances.
   Hyundai's daily production capacity was listed at 2,700 units,
mostly passenger cars for exports. The company has set an annual
export target of 450,000 cars for this year.
   The officials said the strike would cost Hyundai an estimated
$19 million a day.

<TEXT>
   Former President Siaka Stevens,
who led this West African nation for 17 years, died Sunday at his
home after a brief illness. He was 82.
   ``The government of Sierra Leone and all Peoples Congress Party
regret to announce the death of His Excellency Siaka Stevens,'' the
government said in a statement.
   It said Stevens died at 1:50 p.m. (10:50 a.m. EDT) at his Juba
Hill home in Freetown, the capital. Stevens slipped into a coma on
Thursday, the second time since suffering a stroke in December. He
also had suffered partial paralysis on his left side, his doctors
said.
   There was no immediate word on funeral plans.
   Stevens was one of the few African leaders ever to relinquish
power voluntarily.
   He became prime minister of Sierra Leone in 1968 after a
military coup and assumed the presidency on April 21, 1971, two
days after Sierra Leone became a republic.
   Stevens was president until November 1985, when he transferred
power to his handpicked successor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Momoh, the
armed forces commander.
   On a continent where leaders normally hold power for life,
Stevens was only the fourth black African head of state to retire
from office.
   President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, who led his West African
nation to independence from France in 1960, resigned in 1981.
Amadou Ahidjo resigned as president of Cameroon in 1982 after
governing for the first 22 years of independence.
   Julius Nyerere of Tanzania retired as president in 1985, just
days ahead of Stevens, after 24 years in office, but held onto the
country's most powerful political position, chairmanship of the
governing party.
   Stevens, described in ``Who's Who in Africa'' as ``a bluff,
friendly, approachable, pragmatic socialist'' was born Aug. 24,
1905.
   He had made a name for himself and secured a following as a
trade unionist when the British still ruled Sierra Leone.
   As British rule came to an end, Stevens refused to join a
three-party coalition that was to assume power. Instead, he formed
the opposition All People's Congress.
   Stevens was on the sidelines on April 27, 1961, when Sierra
Leone became independent and Sir Milton Margai became the country's
first prime minister.
   Margai died a day after the third anniversary of Sierra Leone's
independence and was succeeded as prime minister and head of the
governing party by Sir Albert Margai, no relation.
   Stevens' party won the March 1967 general elections, but shortly
after Stevens was sworn in as prime minister, he and other
officials were arrested by the chief of the army.
   After a month of infighting among the military that saw power
change hands at least three times, a military-led National Interim
Council took control and returned the leadership of the country to
Stevens' civilian government.
   He survived two coup attempts, in September 1970 and March 1972.
   Stevens was among the first voices in what has become a chorus
of protests in Africa over the lending policies of the
International Monetary Fund, which normally demands that would-be
borrowers cut subsidies, devalue their currency and take other
unpopular measures.
   Stevens called such moves ``political suicide.''
   Sierra Leone was in an economic crisis at the time of Stevens'
retirement. There were chronic shortages of fuel, food and foreign
exchange and the coastal nation of 5 million people had a
reputation as a paradise for smugglers.
   Stevens' relations with President Momoh, his former protege,
became strained after an unsuccessful coup plot early in 1987. The
former vice president and 17 others were convicted of treason in
the abortive attempt.
   No charges were brought against Stevens, but several of those
convicted were his close associates.
   Britain subsequently refused Stevens a visa.
   The coup plotters were sentenced to death. Their appeal is now
before the high court.

   Soul singer James Brown says he loves
his wife but thinks it's time to end his recently contentious third
marriage, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``I'm going to divorce her. I love her very much, but I just
want to be by myself,'' Brown was quoted as saying in the
Spartanburg Herald-Journal. ``It will be done as soon as the papers
go through.''
   Brown, 55, known as the Godfather of Soul, has been married to
his third wife Adrienne, 38, for four years. They live in Aiken.
   ``I just need a lot of girls,'' Brown was quoted as saying. The
newspaper said he did not say if he was interested in another woman.
   The singer would not say why he and his wife have fought
recently, and would not discuss other charges filed against him in
recent months.
   Brown was arrested in April and charged with assault with intent
to kill for an incident in which he allegedly beat his wife with a
pipe and shot into her car.
   Earlier this month, Brown was arrested after a car chase near
his home and charged with possession of the hallucinogen PCP, which
he said belonged to his wife.
   Mrs. Brown has been charged three times in recent months with
possessing PCP. She also has been charged with setting fire to
Brown's hotel room in Bedford, N.H., on May 10.

   The moderate nationalist coalition
Convergencia i Union led elections Sunday to retain its majority in
the 135-seat Catalonian regional parliament.
   With 61.5 percent of the votes counted, the party of regional
government President Jordi Pujol lost two seats and kept 70.
   Regional government spokesman Augusti Bassols said the party won
46 percent of the ballots counted in the northeastern autonomous
region.
   ``We have to be very satisfied, after governing eight years, to
once again retain the absolute majority in the Catalonian
parliament,'' Pujol said.
   The Catalonian branch of the Spanish Socialist Party won 29.7
percent of the votes to retain its 41 seats.
   The Socialists control the national Parliament in Madrid and
hold majorities or govern in coalitions in 10 of the country's 17
regional parliaments.
   The Communist-oriented coalition Catalonian Initiative won 7.4
percent of the vote and nine seats, up three seats from 1984. The
conservative Popular Alliance won 5.2 percent, falling to six seats
from 11 seats.
   The Republican Left party won 4.2 percent of the vote and six
seats while the centrist Democratic Social Center of former Prime
Minister Adolfo Suarez, running for the first time, obtained 3.8
percent of the vote and three seats.
   Bassols said turnout was about 60 percent of the 4.5 million
eligible voters in the autonomous region, which includes the
provinces of Barcelona, Tarragon, Lerida and Gerona.
   The campaign, characterized in the local and national press as
``boring,'' revolved more around the personalities of the
57-year-old Pujol and his 47-year-old Socialist rival, Raimon
Obiols, than on substantive issues.
   Since 1980 Pujol has been the undisputed leader of center-right
Catalonian nationalism, which has been a potent force since the
turn of the century in the region known for its industrial and
commercial prowess.
   In the 1960s, when dictator Gen. Francisco Franco was in power
in Madrid, Pujol went to jail for defending democracy and
Catalonian language and culture.
   Pujol has jousted periodically with the central government for
greater regional autonomy, guaranteed to all 17 regions by Spain's
1978 Constitution.
   Like the other regions, Catalonia depends on revenues collected
by Madrid for its budget.
   Since Spain returned to democracy in 1977, Catalonians have
tended to vote left in national elections and center or right in
regional balloting.

   Rebels said Sunday they killed 56
government soldiers and destroyed two tanks in a six-hour battle
following an attack on a supply convoy near the central town of
Cuemba.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, said in a statement distributed in Lisbon that its forces on
Friday attacked a convoy that was carrying supplies to Angolan and
Cuban soldiers in Cuemba.
   UNITA claims government forces are using Cuemba in central Bie
province as the base for an offensive aimed at recapturing the
rebel-held town of Munhango on the strategic Benguela Railroad.
   The rebels said an army battalion that came to the aid of the
convoy also fell into a UNITA ambush.
   UNITA said eight rebels were killed and 18 wounded.
   The rebels, supported by South Africa and the United States,
have been fighting since 1975 against the Soviet- and Cuban-backed
Angolan government.

   With two principal dancers from Leningrad's
Kirov Ballet in starring roles and the American Ballet Theater
company in top form, a full-length performance of ``La Bayadere''
made for an electric evening.
   Altynai Assylmuratova and Farukh Ruzimatov are the first Soviet
dancers to guest with American Ballet Theater.
   ``La Bayadere'' was first performed in Russia in 1877. It was
staged and choreographed, after Marius Petipa, for American Ballet
Theater by Natalia Makarova in 1980. Miss Makarova, who was a Kirov
Ballet dancer before she defected to the West, at that time danced
the part of Nikiya, the temple dancer or bayadere.
   On Saturday night, Ruzimatov danced the role of the warrior
Solor, who falls in love with the bayadere, performed by Miss
Assylmuratova. Then the Radjah introduces Solor to his daughter to
be his bride and Solor falls for her beauty.
   When Ruzimatov entered the stage, he was a coiled spring _ a
slim, lithe man about to burst with energy. An entrance of such
contained excitement has seldom been seen since Rudolf Nureyev was
young. Ruzimatov lived up to that promise with his turns in air,
the elevation of his jumps and the beauty of his technique.
   Miss Assylmuratova has splendid technique also, and her duet and
solo dancing dazzled. However, she seemed tense instead of
conveying freedom as she flew across the stage. One expects her to
relax more for her second performance. Also, she didn't convey the
acting part of her role as Ruzimatov did his.
   Susan Jaffe danced the Radjah's daughter. She held her own in
what must have seemed daunting company.
   Victor Barbee was very effective as the High Brahmin who also
loves the bayadere and whose mime gestures help move the plot.
Johann Renvall was the third act's bronze idol and did his solo in
a dignified way instead of making it look silly.
   The second act, in the Kingdom of the Shades, is all of ``La
Bayadere'' usually seen in this country. Its soothing beauty rests
on the corps de ballet's being able to move in unison and to hold
long, difficult balances. On Saturday night, Ballet Theater's corps
de ballet was exquisite.

   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, out for a
pleasant Sunday stroll, won cheers and applause in the city's
showcase Arbat mall during a chaotic 10-minute episode in which
grim-faced KGB agents roughed up members of the crowd and the press.
   The agents knocked over a fruit stand as they steamrolled
through the crowd.
   The Reagans seemed stunned by the tumultuous scene and at times
appeared to be jostled themselves. The president and first lady
were completely encircled by KGB officers who locked arms in a
tight circle, using elbows and shoulders to spew people out of

   A senior adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev charged at the start of summit talks Sunday that the
United States had rejected a pair of Soviet proposals aimed at
clearing the way for drastic reductions in long-range nuclear
missiles.
   The accusation came as Gorbachev welcomed President Reagan to
the Moscow summit with an appeal to end nuclear testing and
preserve the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which would limit
the president's Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense
system.
   Reagan responded that U.S. and Soviet negotiators are making
progress toward a treaty reducing strategic weapons by as much as
50 percent. Citing other joint efforts to ease East-West tensions,
the president said that ``our work has begun to produce results.''

   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev toured Kremlin
churches Sunday, holding hands and dismissing their reported feuds
as ``rumors,'' but when talk turned to religious activities, the
Soviet first lady abruptly cut the conversation short.
   While President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev squared
off over human rights inside the Kremlin's Great Palace, the two

an attempt to put to rest the stories about the tense relationship
that emerged from their last meeting at the Washington summit.
   ``We've gotten along very well every other time,'' a smiling
Mrs. Reagan said in response to queries about the supposed frosty
relationship.
   The Soviet first lady, true to the forthright style she
displayed at the White House, chimed in at length and insisted that
she considered such reports frivolous.
   ``Rumors have it, and there was a question, that there is some
misunderstanding between myself and the (president's) wife,'' she
replied through an interpreter. ``... I would like to say, I think
it's not serious.''

   At times, Carlos Salinas de Gortari sounds
too much like a reformer to be the presidential candidate of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico since

   The 40-year-old candidate preaches democratic reforms and clean
elections as he campaigns not so much for the office, which he is
certain to win, but to regain his party's lost credibility.
   Salinas de Gortari, whose thick black moustache and balding head
feature prominently in political cartoons, is described by those
close to him as a pragmatist, influenced strongly by his Harvard
education.
   Before his nomination last fall as a candidate in the July 6

austerity programs that have prevailed in Mexico since 1982.

materials retailer by asking for a special shareholders meeting to
rescind a takeover defense provision.
   The group also criticized a compensation plan for Payless' 24
top officers if they lost their jobs because of a change in the
company's ownership. The plan, which had not previously been
disclosed, was ratified earlier this month by Payless' board of
directors, Payless spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said Friday.
   The investor group is led by New York-based takeover specialist
Asher B. Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a privately
owned competitor of Payless that also is based in Kansas City.
   Payless has about 200 stores in 25 states.
   The group owns 9.9 percent of Payless' stock, or 3.34 million
shares, and has said that it might attempt a takeover of the
company.
   The group disclosed its intentions May 19 when it said that it
controlled 7.6 percent of Payless' stock. It has spent about $70
million since then to increase its holding in the company.
   The investor group requested the special shareholders meeting in
a letter sent to Payless late Friday. The letter asked that the
meeting be held within 90 days.
   David Stanley, chairman and chief executive of Payless, has said
that a takeover by the Edelman-Sutherland group would not be in the
best interest of the company.
   Payless adopted its takeover defense May 12, the same day it
ratified the executive compensation plan. The provision essentially
increases the cost of a takeover.
   Financial analysts have said the takeover could cost as much as
$1 billion.
   The investor group has asked that three amendments to Payless'
bylaws be submitted to a vote by shareholders.
   In addition to the amendment rescinding the takeover defense
provision, another amendment would allow shareholders to vote on
any takeover offer made to the company that had the approval from
holders of at least 10 percent of Payless' stock. The third
amendment would require any further takeover defenses to be
approved by holders of at least 50 percent of the shares.

<HEAD>Residents of Illinois Town Endure Stench to Stock Nation's
Cupboards</HEAD>

   The smell of success stinks, say some
residents of this east-central Illinois town whose canneries supply
food that stocks the nation's cupboards.
   Each spring residents await the return of noxious fumes that
waft off water used to process beans and corn at two local
canneries that support the town's economy.
   ``I just tell people it only hurts your nose, it doesn't hurt
your lungs,'' said Hoopeston Chamber of Commerce official Rose
Buck. ``That's the smell of success.''
   Millions of gallons of the contaminated water are sprayed
irrigation-style onto nearby fields until winter weather arrives.
Warm temperatures release the vapors and winds carry them around
and into the town of 6,400 residents.
   While canning company officials say special equipment has
helped, the odor leaves many breathless.
   ``There is nothing more offensive than the bean water,'' said
Hoopeston City Councilman Willis Bird, who farms near the ponds
sitting along Illinois Rts. 1 and 9. ``You don't get used to it.
You just hope you're not in that field too long.''
   But the putrid smell _ best described as rotting vegetables _
represents money in the bank for the townspeople.
   Two century-old Hoopeston canneries _ owned by Pillsbury-Joan of
Arc Canning Co. and Stokely USA Inc. _ employ hundreds of local
residents and pump millions of dollars into the area's economy.
Thousands more migrant seasonal workers are hired each year to help
with the fall harvest.
   ``If we don't have that smell, we would be in trouble,'' Bird
said, adding that most Americans probably don't realize what
Hoopeston endures to keep canned goods in the nation's grocery
stores.
   ``They don't even know where a can of beans comes from. They
don't know where milk comes from, or how much work is done to keep
the beans clean,'' he said.
   Nine types of beans come into the Pillsbury-Joan of Arc plant
dry and must be washed and then soaked and softened in water. Most
of the water is then discarded.
   The rehydrated beans, including kidney, garbanzo and black-eyed
peas, are sold to consumers nationwide under the Joan of Arc and
other labels, and used in chili sold by the Wendy's hamburger chain.
   Plant Manager Gary Kortkamp of Pillsbury-Joan of Arc says the
company invested in a $1 million, state-of-the-art water
reclamation facility three years ago that eliminated much of the
odor.
   The system strains the larger bean parts out, then pumps the
water into tanks where microscopic organisms eat much of the
remaining bean matter.
   ``I'm talking about a relative smell,'' Kortkamp said. ``On a
scale of one to 10 we have improved it to an eight or nine.''
   But some odor remains, Bird said.
   ``After they have processed it two or three times, then it gets
into that big lagoon out there. Then they spray it into the air and
it gets a little rank,'' he said.
   In the fall, fumes from water used to process sweet corn
contribute to the odor problem. Pungent corn water then is sprayed
onto fields north of town.
   Stokely sells the corn and a variety of other canned goods under
its label.
   While the scent might annoy some vistors, many long-time
residents say it's all in the nose.
   ``That doesn't stink,'' a Hoopeston policeman said when asked
about the smell. ``I've lived here all my life and I'm used to it.''

<HEAD>Rawlings Getting Out Of Helmet Business</HEAD>

   Rawlings Sporting Goods Co. has announced that
it is getting out of the football helmet business, citing increased
liability and ``skyrocketing'' insurance costs.
   The company will continue to manufacture football equipment from
the neck down and will also continue to make non-competitive
replica helmets, Rawlings spokesman M. Scott Smith said Friday.
   Rawlings' departure from the helmet business leaves only two
major U.S. manufacturers _ Riddell Sporting Goods Inc. of Chicago
and A.H.I. Corp. of Litchfield, Ill., Smith said.
   ``Rawlings has explored options to make it practical and
profitable to remain in the helmet business, but can no longer
justify the manufacture of competitive football helmets,'' Smith
said.
   Litigation involving head and neck injuries was the major factor
in the decision, Smith said. In the past 15 years there have been
about 25 helmet liability cases tried in court and verdicts have
been granted totaling around $46 million, he said.
   Since 1980, the total has been $39 million.
   Rawlings made its competitive helmets at Ava, Mo. The helmets
were one-piece shells of polycarbonate plastic.
   Most of the company's sales of competitive helmets has been to
high schools and colleges, Smith said.
