   A weeklong storm caused heavy flooding in
central Cuba that killed four people and forced about 10,000 to
evacuate their homes, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported.
   An agency dispatch from Havana, the Cuban capital, said
Wednesday that flooding occurred in the provinces of Cienfuegos,
Sancti Spiritus, Villa Clara and Ciego de Avila.
   It said the storm produced power outages and paralyzed
transportation.
   The dispatch, monitored here, said the four victims were all
from Cienfuegos, which was hit the hardest. It said rescue crews,
using helicopters and amphibious vehicles, evacuated about 10,000
people from their homes Wednesday and moved them to higher ground.

   Perhaps the most important thing Ronald Reagan
gave Mikhail Gorbachev this summit was the statement that he no
longer thinks the Soviet Union is ``an evil empire.''
   As a bonus, to Gorbachev's delight, the renunciation came
``within the walls of the Kremlin, next to the czar's gun.''
   Reagan's characterization of this vast communist nation in a
March 1983 speech unleashed a torrent of comment in the Soviet
media at the time, the start of a deep freeze in superpower
relations symbolized by the break-off of Geneva arms talks in
November that year.
   In a nation that craves international respect, Reagan's
criticism was taken as an intensely personal slight.
   His retraction of the comment in remarks Tuesday to reporters at
the Kremlin was duly remarked upon by Gorbachev at an unprecedented
Moscow news conference on Wednesday _ a session televised across
the Soviet Union, with excerpts repeated on the evening news.
   ``Within the walls of the Kremlin, next to the czar's gun, right
in the heart of the evil empire,'' Gorbachev beamed, Reagan had
responded ``No'' when asked if the Soviet Union still deserved the
appellation.
   ``We take note of this,'' added Gorbachev, speaking not just for
himself, but for the communist leadership of a nation of 280
million people.
   It was just weeks after Reagan branded the Soviet Union an
``evil empire'' that the Soviets launched one of their most
ambitious efforts to counteract what they see as malicious American
propaganda about a nation of which they are raised to feel
supremely proud.
   On April 25, 1983, then Soviet leader Yuri V. Andropov invited
Maine schoolgirl Samantha Smith to visit his country and see for
herself that his people do not want war.
   In July, Samantha, then 11, came to Moscow and was given a
topflight tour of the Soviet Union, visiting Moscow and Leningrad,
and spending four days with Soviet kids at an elite camp for Young
Pioneers on the Black Sea.
   Loaded down with 17 suitcases of presents from Soviets who
warmed to her bright smile, Samantha left Moscow and delivered the
judgment Moscow wanted to hear _ that the Soviets ``are almost just
like Americans.''
   Similar, but less lavish, efforts are expended when American
peace groups visit the Soviet Union.
   Since Reagan came to power, these groups have come ever more
regularly to ``the evil empire,'' promoting peace and friendship
with the Soviets and joining Moscow in denouncing the U.S.
president for pushing Star Wars and strengthened Western defenses.
   With arms talks dead throughout 1984 and cultural contacts at a
virtual standstill, these groups were almost the only Americans
that Soviets got to see _ and they made sure to put on their best
show.
   The Kremlin, which has long financed a finely tuned, expensive
system to train some of the world's premier athletes, even gave up
on the chance to prove Soviet prowess that year at the Olympics.
Moscow boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles extravaganza that in so many
ways epitomized the glitzy, we-feel-good-again spirit of Reagan's
first term.
   In January 1985, arms control talks resumed again. In March
1985, Gorbachev came to power, promoting ``new thinking'' in
foreign policy and doing a rapid image makeover on Kremlin
politicians.
   The new leader and his wife Raisa had wowed Fleet Street on a
trip to London in December 1984, astonishing Britons used to dour,
dumpy Russians with their lively manners, good humor and handling
of the press.
   With a sure touch sometimes attributed to Gorbachev ally
Alexander Yakovlev, now a Politburo member but once a student of
North American ways as ambassador to Canada, Gorbachev has
successfully projected a new image.
   Reforms at home, greater openness to the outside world and
improved relations with the United States have given the new image
substance, adding up to an act that apparently has changed Reagan's
mind about the Soviet Union somewhat.
   And Gorbachev can show his home audience that his efforts to
mend relations with the United States _ criticized at first by
hardliners _ have paid dividends.
   The Geneva 1985 declaration he signed with Reagan at their first
summit committed Reagan to saying that ``a nuclear war must never
be fought and cannot be won.''
   The now-ratified INF treaty removed the danger of Pershing 2
missiles reaching Moscow in eight minutes from Western Europe.
   With the Moscow summit, the Soviet Union is no longer ``the evil
empire,'' even in Reagan's book.
   As the president himself explained it, that description belonged
to ``another time, another era.''

<HEAD>Reagans Treated To A Night On The Town, Moscow Style</HEAD>

   The Reagans did up the town, Moscow-style, on
their last night here, taking in the ballet at the opulent Bolshoi
Theater, dining with the Gorbachevs at a dacha owned by the
Communist Party and strolling through a moonlit Red Square.
   With summit business over, President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev seemed in good spirits Wednesday night, moving
their seats closer together in the ``Royal Box'' the Soviet and
American first couples shared at the Bolshoi and briefly clasping
one another's waists as they left the ballet.
   But their wives, who ruffled one another's feathers earlier in
the day during a visit to Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, appeared cool
to one another and did not speak.
   After their private dinner at the Communist Party-owned country
home on the outskirts of western Moscow, the Reagans, holding
hands, made an impromptu stop at Red Square, walking on the
cobblestone plaza between St. Basil's Cathedral and the Kremlin.
   Reagan described his Soviet evening on the town as ``wonderful
... very warm and hospitable.''
   He said the couple stopped at Red Square ``because Nancy hasn't
seen it. We're leaving tomorrow and I didn't want her to miss it.''
   The Reagans leave this morning for London, where they will spend
a day before returning Friday to Washington.
   In the six-tiered, gold and red Bolshoi on Sverdlov Square, the
audience of about 2,000, most of them Soviets, applauded the
Reagans and the Gorbachevs both at the ballet's beginning and again
at its end. The dancers also ended their performance by clapping
for the leaders and their wives.
   Reagan and Gorbachev waved back at the audience, both grinning
broadly.
   The Reagans appeared to enjoy the hour and a half of ballet. It
was the first night of pure entertainment on their schedule, which
had previously included official dinners complete with political
toasts and journalists.
   But even the last evening included a touch of patriotism.
American and Soviet flags hung on either side of the ``Royal Box''
at the rear of the theater, and the orchestra played national
anthems from both countries before the ballet began.
   Reagan mouthed the words of the American anthem while Nancy
Reagan held her right hand at her heart.
   The Reagans and Raisa Gorbachev used opera glasses to watch the
Bolshoi Ballet perform excerpts from ``Sleeping Beauty,'' ``Swan
Lake'' and ``Romeo and Juliet.'' The last excerpt was performed by
Nine Ananiashvili and Andris Liepa, winners of a 1986 world ballet
competition in Jackson, Miss.
   The Bolshoi Theater, founded in 1776, was the first permanent
theater in Moscow, and its ballet and opera companies gained an
international reputation in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Tickets cost about three rubles (five dollars) but are nearly
impossible for Soviets to obtain without contacts in the theater or
luck enough to receive an allocation at their jobs.

<HEAD>Yanks Beat Reds, 15-2, in Historic Baseball Matchup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a match marked more by good will than athletic
prowess, Johns Hopkins University capitalized on eight errors by a
team of Soviet engineers to take a 15-2 victory in the first
baseball showdown between the superpowers.
   Before the historic game, played at the Lenin Komsomol
Automobile Factory stadium, the Johns Hopkins team presented the
Soviets with souvenir T-shirts, and both sides clasped hands and
hugged as Western reporters in town for the summit meeting crowded
around. President Reagan, busy elsewhere, was unable to throw out
the first pitch.
   A public address announcer chattered away about the rules of
baseball, even during play, to a crowd just learning about the
sport. But the 300 or so fans still seemed to enjoy the game,
cheering lustily when the Soviet team from the D.I. Mendeleyev
Institute of Chemical Engineering did well and whistling in
derision when it botched a play.
   Johns Hopkins struck immediately in the first inning when
leadoff batter Tom Finegan doubled off the left field fence and
scored on two successive wild pitches by Alexei Koshivoy.
   The Blue Jays put the game out of reach in the third inning,
while leading 2-0, when first baseman Dan Durocher walked, advanced
to second on a Koshivoy wild pitch and scored on a single by second
baseman Andy Bernstein.
   After two successive errors loaded the bases, third baseman John
Horner hit a drive that eluded centerfielder Alexander
Krupenchenkov and Horner came all the way home to make the score
7-0.
   The Soviets didn't get a base runner until the fourth inning and
scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings on errant
pickoff attempts.
   ``It was not our best game,'' said Leonid Korneyev, the Soviets'
third baseman.
   The Soviet Union began its baseball program in 1987, in
anticipation of baseball becoming an Olympic sport in 1992. A
national squad played a team from Nicaragua last summer, but lost
by scores of 22-0 and 30-2.
   Earlier this week, the Johns Hopkins players spent several
practice sessions teaching the Soviets the finer points of the
game, and although the Blue Jays praised their competitors' desire
and athletic abilities, they expected the game to be a bit of a
mismatch.
   ``They made some outstanding plays out there,'' said Johns
Hopkins Coach Bob Babb. ``But they still have problems with routine
ones.''
   Finegan, a senior from Garden City, N.Y., praised the Soviets'
athletic ability, but noted that ``baseball is a unique sport. You
need to have skills that are more refined. They also have not seen
pitchers that are more refined.''
   Johns Hopkins alumnus Max Flaxman, a Moscow-based businessman,
was responsible for bringing the Soviets together with the Blue
Jays, who had a 26-12 record this year. He had heard the Soviets
were seeking an American squad for some exhibition games, and
suggested the Johns Hopkins team.
   The Soviet media publicized the game, and several newspapers ran
stories that caught the spirit of good will.
   A front-page article in Tuesday's editions of the newspaper
Sovietsky Sport carried the headline: ``When the score doesn't
count.''

   Music poured from the front-seat tape
deck. Anatoly Kalinin snapped his fingers to the beat, and his
friends passed around cigarettes and pictures of their wives for
the visiting Americans to see.
   This wasn't an impromptu gathering of youth on the Arbat
pedestrian mall, but an assemblage of the usually staid gray-suited
security agents who guard Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Relaxing during a two-and-a-half hour wait for President Reagan
and his wife to finish dinner at a Communist Party-owned dacha
outside Moscow, a dozen security men bantered with their American
counterparts, showing off the Zil limousines they travel in and
joining in an American betting pool on when the Reagans would
emerge from the walled compound.
   ``At exactly 12 midnight!'' contended an agent identified only
as Yevgeny, arguing with an American agent who insisted that Reagan
never stays out that late.
   ``I'm not just taking a guess, I'm providing you with
information,'' Yevgeny stated knowingly.
   The American stuck by his 11 p.m. estimate, challenging, ``We'll
see whose intelligence is better.''
   Some of the security detachment had accompanied Gorbachev to
Washington in December, but the agents who had never seen America
showed the most curiosity about life in the other superpower. They
compared housing costs, divorce rates and the vastly different
attitudes toward smoking in their countries.
   The Zil tour was impressive for the journalists, who acted as
translators between the security squads. The sleek black limos are
usually seen flashing past at 60 miles per hour on the broad avenue
that leads from this parklike estate to the Kremlin.
   ``This costs 100,000 rubles ($167,000 at the official exchange
rate) here,'' one of the Soviets offered with an aim to impress
that would rival any car salesman. ``It's got genuine Karelian
birchwood lining on the doors and all around the windows.''
   One of the Americans, who did not want to be identified, said
that the Soviets were a little tense on the first day of Reagan's
visit, but that the two groups quickly became accustomed to working
together on their nearly identical tasks of protecting the leader.
   ``Discipline is discipline and surveillance is surveillance,''
Yevgeny explained, when asked how the two teams worked together.
   The nattily dressed agents from both superpowers took turns
posing for souvenir pictures.
   Floodlights blinked and a telephone call to the guard shack
outside the compound at 10:40 p.m. alerted both teams to the
presidential party's intended departure, causing moans from the
bettors who had guessed the party would break up later.
   The agents instantly snapped to attention, with the Soviets
diving into the limousines and escort cars and the Americans
climbing into their wagons.
   The entourage got back to business so quickly that the head of
the American security detachment had no chance to collect his bet
winnings. His guess of 11 p.m. was only six seconds off the mark.

<HEAD>Mrs. Reagan `Rolls With Punches' In Uncertainties Of Raisa
Relationship</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan has ``learned to roll with the
punches'' when dealing with the uncertainties of meeting Raisa
Gorbachev and has achieved more balance in their relationship, the
first lady's spokeswoman says.
   The clear impression left after the two strong-willed women
squared off in a Soviet art gallery Wednesday was that Mrs. Reagan
has become far more assertive in dealing with the outspoken Soviet
first lady.
   President Reagan and his wife fly to London today after wrapping
up their summit activities here with a farewell visit to the
Kremlin and a meeting with U.S. Embassy employees. They return home
Friday after the London stopover.
   For the first time, Mrs. Reagan acknowledged during a tour of
the Tretyakov Gallery's icons that the frosty relationship, the
focus of months of intense media scrutiny, is real.
   ``A Mexican standoff,'' the first lady said with a shrug, when
asked how the relationship stood.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, later
observed, ``They are from two totally different worlds.''
   Under a veneer of politeness, the two first ladies engaged in an
intense competition for the spotlight.
   ``I want to say something. I want to say something now, OK?''
Mrs. Reagan insisted sharply one point as Mrs. Gorbachev attempted
to stop reporters from questioning the American first lady.
   Mrs. Gorbachev backed away, but pointedly looked at her watch as
the first lady chatted with members of the White House press corps.
   When Mrs. Gorbachev tried to break in again and start the
gallery tour, Mrs. Reagan rebuffed her and returned to her
conversation with reporters.
   On the surface, things were pleasant enough, but the delicately
arched eyebrows and strained smiles told a far different story.
   Instead of strolling hand-in-hand as they had at events earlier
this week, the two women apparently had decided to show more of
their true feelings.
   It brought to mind a similar encounter during the December
summit in Washington, when Mrs. Gorbachev dominated a White House
tour by seeking out the press with lengthy commentaries on history,
art and political life, as Mrs. Reagan was left trying to get her
long-planned tour under way.
   During Wednesday's session with reporters, Mrs. Gorbachev and
her Soviet aides kept changing the arrangements for the event,
White House aides said.
   Instead of meeting Mrs. Reagan as planned by the outside door of
the gallery, Mrs. Gorbachev had come to the special vault where
they were to view the art and talked at length with the press corps.
   Mrs. Reagan has learned to be flexible with the Soviets at Mrs.
Gorbachev's events, Mrs. Crispen said.
   ``She's learned to roll with the punches,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   Noting that Mrs. Reagan has spoken out more in Moscow than she
did at the December summit, Mrs. Crispen said she believed they now
had ``more balance'' and equality in their relationship.
   Not surprisingly, the first lady said that her five days of
exposure to the glories of Russian art and architecture won't
change her mind about the Soviet system.
   ``We have two different ways of living, two different
philosophies,'' she said. One day earlier, Mrs. Reagan had termed
the Soviet system a ``more controlled'' society than the United
States.
   Asked if she'd become a convert to communism during her stay
here, the first lady gave a hearty laugh, saying, ``Oh, no!''

   Hallmark Cards will stop making
graduation cards that emphasize drinking, following protests by a
California chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the company
said Wednesay.
   Diane Wall, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City-based card
manufacturer, said the company decided Tuesday ``to discontinue
manufacturing and shipping alcohol-related graduation cards.''
   The controversy started last week in Huntington Beach, Calif.,
when Edison High School parents showed MADD officals a card
depicting a refrigerator filled with Coors beer and a single egg.
   ``Don't go to graduation without a good breakfast first,'' the
card reads.
   Another card suggests that graduates wear loose-fitting gowns so
they can ``hide at least two bottles of champagne underneath.''
   ``How can a company, which advertises, `When you care enough to
send the very best, send Hallmark,' produce cards which encourage
alcohol and drunken driving?'' asked Janet Cater, director of the
Orange County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   Ms. Cater said Tuesday's decision was insufficient because the
cards are still available in some stores. However, Ms. Wall said
graduation season is coming to an end and ``most of the cards will
come down very shortly.''
   Ms. Wall said she did not have exact figures on the number of
graduation cards that had reference to alcohol.
   ``Hallmark offers about 600 graduation card designs, and less
than 1 percent deal with alcohol-related subject matter,'' she
said. ``It is a very small percentage.''
   She said the complaints that spurred the company's action came
primarily from Orange County, Calif.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Western diplomatic source says 28 refusenik
cases have not been resolved, contrary to information from Soviet
Jewish leaders that the cases were cleared for emigration as a
result of meetings between U.S. and Soviet officials.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Jewish
leaders had evidently misunderstood the situation.
   The confusion arose over a meeting between Assistant Secretary
of State Richard Schifter and a group of six refuseniks Wednesday
morning.
   Refusenik scientist Yuli Kosharovsky showed reporters a list of
400 names that he said had been submitted to Schifter on Saturday
for discussion with Soviet officials at meetings during the Moscow
summit.
   He said Schifter told the group that 28 of the cases had been
solved in the meetings taking place during the Moscow summit
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But the Western diplomatic source said later that no cases had
been solved.
   Other refusenik sources said more than a dozen families from
Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev had received permission to emigrate in
the past 10 days.
   Moscow refusenik Bella Gulko said the Boris Weinshtock and Iosif
Pilmenshtein families of Moscow had received permission to emigrate
this week.
   Refusenik Sergei Mkrtchyan, who demonstrated daily in downtown
Moscow with his wife and year-old daughter last week, said he was
summoned to the Moscow visa office on Saturday and was told he
could leave the country on Monday.
   Mkrtchyan said he knew of three Kiev families who also had
received permission to leave the country.
   About 40 other refuseniks, many of them accompanied by their
children, held a peaceful, half-hour demonstration Wednesday within
sight of the Kremlin, waving banners demanding that they be allowed
to emigrate.
   An agency helping Jewish emigres said in Geneva on Wednesday
that the number allowed to leave the Soviet Union reached 1,145 in
May, a seven-year high.
   The May figure was the fourth straight monthly increase and
brought the total for 1988 to 4,547, said the Intergovernmental
Committee for Migration.
   More than 8,000 Jews were permitted to emigrate in 1987, a sharp
increase from previous years but far below the peak of more than
51,000 in 1979.

<TEXT>
   The relationship has never been more special. So
it is only natural that President Reagan is visiting Margaret
Thatcher, his ideological soulmate and closest foreign ally, to
tell her about the Moscow summit.
   Reagan's two-day visit, another boost to the British prime
minister's prestige on the international stage, comes six months
after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev stopped off to confer with
her en route to the Washington superpower summit.
   Today's is Reagan's third and probably last visit as president
to a prime minister of whom he said recently, ``We're very good
friends and it is a friendship I treasure very much.''
   He will confer with Mrs. Thatcher at her No. 10 Downing St.
residence, dine there tonight and make a speech Friday on East-West
relations before returning home.
   For Reagan, the British Conservative Party leader has been a
sometimes costly, occasionally reproving but super-loyal friend.
She rarely criticizes him.
   Asked in Parliament about revelations about astrology in the
White House, all she would say was: ``I come under Libra, which is
a very balanced sign.''
   The Anglo-American bond, rooted in a common language, heritage
and alliances in two world wars, is the cornerstone of her foreign
policy.
   She stood alone in backing the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya;
followed Washington out of UNESCO in 1985; was the first to deploy
U.S. cruise missiles in Europe in 1983, and last year, when the
superpowers agreed to remove the missiles, she put aside her
reservations and gave the deal a ringing endorsement.
   When other European leaders in the 16-nation NATO alliance
sometimes grumble about U.S. domination, Mrs. Thatcher's response
is blunt.
   ``She's the largest, most prosperous nation in the world, and
let's be thankful she has taken a leadership role,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said in a radio interview in March. ``None of us can substitute for
it. We could all help with it.''
   Her U.S. policy draws opposition taunts of ``Reagan's poodle,''
to which she retorts: ``I don't think I would make a very good
poodle. I might be more a sort of bulldog.''
   However, some analysts see her as having subtly moved into a
prime role in NATO, using both her special influence with Reagan
and, more recently, her good relations with Gorbachev to exercise
power.
   Elected to office 18 months before Reagan and recently
re-elected for an unprecedented third consecutive term, 62-year-old
Mrs. Thatcher is the senior stateswoman of the Western world. She
shares Reagan's hostility to communism and belief in free markets.
   She fervently believes nuclear weapons are peacekeepers. After
Reagan flirted with the idea of a non-nuclear world at the 1986
summit at Reykjavik, Iceland, Mrs. Thatcher sped to Washington to
make sure he didn't carry disarmament too far _ without consulting
his allies.
   At her instigation, NATO leaders held a special summit before
Reagan's latest meeting in Moscow with Gorbachev. She said the aim
was to demonstrate Western unity and show ``that the president is
always seen consulting his NATO allies.''
   There have been some disagreements.
   In 1982, when Reagan sought to withhold U.S.-originated
technology from a Soviet natural gas pipeline, Mrs. Thatcher
ordered British companies to fulfill their contracts despite the
threat of U.S. sanctions. Reagan backed off, after Mrs. Thatcher
complained publicly she felt ``deeply wounded by a friend.''
   A year later, Mrs. Thatcher criticized the U.S.-led invasion of
Grenada to overthrow Marxist coup leaders in the former British
colony, saying ``You just don't walk into countries like that.''
   More recently, she has chided the United States about its budget
deficit, making disapproving comparisons with her own stringent
policies which have produced a budget surplus.
   But she has never shied away from backing the United States in a
crisis, even when it has left her isolated.
   She says she has never forgotten that Reagan put his entire
Latin American policy at risk to support Britain in the 1982
Falkland Islands war against Argentina.
   In April 1986 she braved uproar in Parliament for allowing
Washington to use British-based bombers in the raid on Libya, when
other European allies had refused to help.
   She declared, ``I believe friendship is two ways.''

<HEAD>Eugene McCarthy Running For President At 72</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eugene McCarthy, whose presidential
candidacy two decades ago helped galvanize opposition to the
Vietnam War, has placed himself in the running again this year at
the age of 72.
   ``This year the one thing we have to do is shake up the
two-party system, and that's what I hope to do,'' the silver-haired
McCarthy told reporters and onlookers Wednesday near Independence
Hall. ``There is no real choice between Democrats and Republicans.''
   McCarthy dismissed the expected Republican nominee, Vice
President George Bush, and his likely Democratic opponent,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``There are two kinds of people who don't make good
presidents,'' he said, ``vice presidents and governors.''
   The former senator, whose anti-war campaign in 1968 helped bring
down President Lyndon B. Johnson, is running this year on the
Consumer Party ticket.
   In McCarthy's first campaign, fellow Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey
won the Democratic nomination and Republican Richard Nixon won the
election.
   McCarthy also tried for the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1972 and ran as an independent in 1976. This time he hopes to be
on the ballot in at least 30 states.
   McCarthy said his latest candidacy was not a futile gesture.
   ``Sure I've lost before, but I didn't feel I wasted my time, and
I expect to have a significant impact,'' McCarthy said.
   Max Weiner, who founded the Consumer Party in 1967 in
Philadelphia, said: ``We think both the Democrats and Republicans
have failed the country, and that we are an alternative, not a
spoiler. We'll give the voters an alternative. Millions don't want
to vote for anyone, and we think that McCarthy will attract them.''
   The party has about 4,000 members, almost all in Pennsylvania.
Its platform calls for guaranteed jobs for all Americans, sharp
reductions in the military budget, passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment and provision of affordable housing for everyone.
   The party's most successful candidate to date has been Weiner, a
1987 candidate for Philadelphia City Council. Weiner won 21 percent
of the vote, which was not enough for a seat.
   The party affiliated itself with the campaigns of Citizens Party
candidates Barry Commoner and Sonia Johnson in the 1980 and 1984
presidential campaigns.
   Lance Haver, chairman of the Pennsylvania Consumer Party, said
McCarthy would be formally nominated at a convention in
Philadelphia late this summer. No date was announced.
   Haver said that he expected Florence Rice, who founded the
Harlem Consumer Education Council based in New York City, to be the
party's vice presidential nominee. But McCarthy, who says the vice
presidency should be abolished, said he expected there would be
different running mates in different states.

<HEAD>FBI Agent Says Judge Hastings Leaked Wiretap Information</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX7</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three major investigations in the Miami area
broke off in 1985 when wiretap information was allegedly leaked by
U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings, an FBI agent told a House
subcommittee conducting impeachment proceedings against the judge.
   ``There is nothing to lead me to believe that it could have been
any other source than Judge Hastings,'' agent Christopher Mazzella
testified Wednesday before the subcommittee on criminal justice.
Mazzella said the three investigations into labor racketeering and
public corruption had to be ended for fear of endangering the lives
of undercover agents and informants.
   He said Hastings approved a 30-day wiretap on July 15, 1985, and
received ``progress reports'' on it every seven days.
   On Aug. 15, the FBI applied to Hastings for an extension of the
tap, attaching an affidavit containing references to Dade County
Mayor Steve Clark and a man named Kevin ``Waxy'' Gordon, who was a
target of one of the probes.
   Mazzella, who was in charge of the probes, said the
investigations became tainted when Clark told Gordon of information
he said he received from Hastings. Gordon surmised that the only
way anyone would know the information was from a wiretap.
   Mazzella said the cases involved the local longshoremen's union
in zoning code cases in Hialeah and police selling drugs in North
Bay Village. He said the wiretap was involved in all three cases.
   Hastings, who still sits on the federal bench in Miami, has not
had a chance to rebut the allegations before the subcommittee. He
refused to discuss the case Wednesday with reporters outside the
hearing room.
   Mazzella said he could not find any statement to a law
enforcement officer in which Hastings either confirmed or denied
the allegations. The agent said reporter Bryan Duffy of the Miami
Herald told the FBI he discussed the allegation with Hastings on
March 25, 1986, but that Hastings did not say whether he was the
source of the leak.
   The impeachment proceedings against Hastings stem from a bribery
case in Florida involving Washington attorney William Borders.
   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe for
Hastings in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted
racketeers.
   In a separate trial in 1983, Hastings was acquitted of the
bribery conspiracy charges. But a five-member panel of the
Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Florida,
concluded there was convincing evidence that Hastings actually took
part in the bribery scheme and then attempted a cover-up by lying
under oath and manufacturing evidence.
   The panel's findings were endorsed unanimously by the Judicial
Conference of the United States, the chief policy-making body of
the federal judiciary, and forwarded to House leaders in March 1987
with the advice that ``consideration of impeachment may be
warranted.''
   The judiciary subcommittee must determine whether Hastings
committed the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that warrant
impeachment. If Hastings is impeached by the House, the Senate will
conduct a trial to determine whether he should be removed from
office.

<HEAD>New Radars Will Sharpen America's Weather Eye</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America will turn a sharper eye to the weather
in the next few years with the installation of a snazzy new radar
system jointly funded by a quartet of federal agencies.
   The new radar will allow meteorologists, for the first time, to
see the formation of tornadoes before they reach the ground. They
also will be better able to pinpoint the landing site of
hurricanes, predict floods and measure the flow of wind, weather
scientists say.
   The first Next Generation Weather Radar installation is under
way at Norman, Okla., with as many as 175 to follow by the
mid-1990s, officials of Unisys, the private company building the
system, reported Wednesday.
   The National Weather Service, Federal Aviation Administration,
Air Force Air Weather Service and Naval Oceanographic Office are
anteing up $450 million for the new system, dubbed NEXRAD.
   Under development for eight years, the first system was tested
at a Unisys facility in Connecticut before the Oklahoma
installation, expected to be operational in thefall.
   Oklahoma, one of the nation's leading areas for tornadoes, will
test the new radar's ``unique capability to identify rotating wind
patterns within storms,'' according to Kurt Merl of Unisys.
   While current radar detects only the amount of moisture in the
air, the new one can follow its movement.
   Thus, an operator seeing wind rushing away from him, right next
to a severe gust heading toward him, will recognize the signature
of a rotating movement, the first sign of tornado development, said
Les Lemon, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
researcher now directing the radar development program for Unisys.
   Radar tests have shown that movement can be seen in mid-level
clouds, before the twister reaches down for the ground. This means
warning time could be expanded to ``tens of minutes,'' Lemon said.
   Currently the National Weather Service issues a tornado watch
when conditions exist which could spawn a tornado, but ground
spotters have to spot the tornadoes to issue actual warnings.
   The new system could cut false alarms in half, Lemon added.
   NEXRAD will replace a 30-year-old radar system that provides
only limited weather data.
   Merl said the NEXRAD installations also will be coupled with
on-ground rain gauges to measure precipitation for forecast areas
where flooding is likely, a system that should improve warnings in
flood-prone areas.
   In addition, Lemon noted that the system will be able to measure
the winds within hurricanes within its 145-mile range.
   With that information, meteorologists will be better able to
predict the course of hurricanes to give warnings about where they
will strike land, and also to estimate the wind and surge of sea
water being pushed ahead of the storm.
   The system's 28-foot radar dish, enclosed in a fiberglass dome,
draws a profile of the air from the surface up to 70,000 feet every
six minutes, Lemon explained, providing detailed information even
in clear air. Many radars cannot detect clear air movement, only
air with water vapor or dust or some other debris to reflect the
signal.
   The radar uses the Doppler effect, which depends on a change in
frequency in a radio wave. The pencil-thin wave is sent out at a
constant frequency, and bounces back off clouds, moving air, dust
or whatever it strikes. There is a subtle change of frequency in
signals bouncing off something coming toward the radar compared to
things moving away.
   It's the same principle that causes a police or ambulance siren
to have a slightly lower pitch when the vehicle is driving away
from listeners than it does when coming toward them.
   Merl also said research is under way for short-range Doppler
radar systems at airports to detect local wind shears, sudden
shifts in wind speed and direction that have caused several
airplane crashes in recent years.

<HEAD>GAO Says Air Force Inventory Accuracy Problems Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force's inability to keep track of its
huge equipment and supply inventory has resulted in excessive
purchases costing ``billions of tax dollars,'' a senator says.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, on Wednesday released a report by the
General Accounting Office concluding that the accuracy of Air Force
inventory records continues to be a problem despite improvements in
inventory control.
   The report also said the Air Force continues to have difficulty
determining the causes of inventory inaccuracies and that physical
security of the supplies needs to be improved.
   Glenn, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
said Air Force supply items and repair parts are worth more than
$21 billion.
   ``While many of these parts are essential to keeping our planes
in the air, poor inventory control has resulted in excessive supply
purchases costing billions of tax dollars,'' said Glenn. ``The Air
Force needs to straighten up and fly right when it comes to
inventory management.''
   The GAO study was based on audits of the Air Force Logistics
Command headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near
Dayton, Ohio, and air logistics centers in San Antonio, Texas;
Sacramento, Calif.; and Ogden, Utah.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the Air Force's
adjustment policy allows inventory records and on-hand supplies to
remain out of balance by as much as 10 percent and $4,999.
   ``Air Force item managers continue to adjust inventory records
without performing adequate research to identify the primary cause
for discrepancies,'' the GAO said. ``The risk in this policy is
that the records may be erroneously adjusted, possibly resulting in
apparent shortages of needed items which are actually on hand, or
excess procurements.''
   The GAO also said the physical security at the Air Force centers
in San Antonio, Sacramento and Ogden needs to be improved to lessen
the risk of theft.
   It said the storage buildings at Sacramento and Ogden are not
separately surrounded by security fencing and that privately owned
and contractor vehicles are permitted to park right next to
warehouses at all three centers.
   Jack Katzen, a deputy assistant secretary of defense at the
Pentagon, said there have been steady and significant improvements
in inventory accuracy at the Air Force, with accuracy rates
approaching 95 percent.
   ``While these improvements are commendable, the department
recognizes that problems still exist that require continued
dedication and vigilance,'' Katzen said in a March 17 letter to the
GAO. ``The department is pursuing its aggressive action plan to
continue improving the process.''

   A long-held industry axiom that a jetliner can
fly many years beyond its initial design life if maintained and
inspected properly is coming under closer scrutiny, say some
participants in a three-day conference on aging aircraft.
   It is only one of many technical issues being debated by more
than 350 aircraft design and maintenance experts meeting at the
FAA-sponsored conference that began Wednesday.
   The participants represent airlines, aircraft manufacturers,
government and aviation safety groups. All were brought together
because of an increased concern about the safety of older jetliners
since the in-flight breakup of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing
737 in April.
   A 20-foot section of the plane tore away at 24,000 feet and a
flight attendant was swept to her death, although the pilots
managed to land the aircraft safely.
   Aloha Airlines officials have said repeatedly that they followed
all required inspections on the jetliner.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said that until the federal
investigation into the incident is concluded, he could not say
whether Aloha violated any FAA requirements in connection with the
plane.
   But McArtor said during a break in the conference Wednesday that
a key question that must be resolved in the coming months is
whether to continue the current philosophy that relies heavily on
inspections or shift the focus to a system of mandatory repairs or,
at some point, mandatory aircraft retirement.
   In the case of Aloha, inspectors from both the airlines and the
FAA failed to detect the cracking and corrosion that is believed to
have caused the breakup.
   ``I think we might find that the procedures are adequate, but
I'm not convinced the procedures are being done with as much
discipline as we might expect,'' McArtor told reporters.
   He said the conference is likely to spawn additional, private
sessions among industry experts in the coming months on aircraft
design, the human pitfalls in the inspection process and whether
new federal requirements might be needed.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., one of several congressmen to address
the industry group, said that the Aloha incident demonstrates ``the
inadequacies of the FAA's maintenance inspection system.''
   Glickman suggested that the FAA must increase its research and
development programs on aging aircraft and that the agency should
buy old jetliners to determine how long they can be considered to
be safe.
   ``Only by answering the question `How long can airplanes really
last?' will we be able to put into place guidelines which could
save thousands of lives,'' Glickman told the conference.
   John Enders, an aviation consultant for the Flight Safety
Foundation, suggested in an interview that the Aloha accident will
prompt increased debate over ``whether the economic life of an
airplane'' should remain as dominant a factor as it has been in
determining when a plane should be taken out of service.
   Before the Aloha accident ``generally there was a feeling that
you can fly a plane indefinitely'' as long as it is properly
maintained and inspected, said Enders, suggesting this philosophy
may be changing.
   But William Hoover of the Air Transport Association, the airline
trade group, reiterated that with proper maintenance and
inspections aircraft ``can fly safely throughout their economically
useful life.''
   The Aloha plane was one of the oldest Boeing 737s in service and
had accumulated nearly 90,000 takeoffs and landings.

   Oliver North brought his unabashedly
patriotic message to California on Wednesday, lending his
conservative star status to the congressional campaign of an old
White House buddy.
   North, the former Marine lieutenant colonel who faces federal
conspiracy charges for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, sounded
themes of freedom, military might and family values in urging
election of conservative Republican Dana Rohrabacher to the state's
42nd Congressional District.
   ``Freedom is not free, it must be won, preserved and defended,
again and again,'' North told a cheering crowd of about 100 at a
late-morning rally at a hangar at Long Beach Airport.
   He urged voters to return a conservative majority to Congress
that will support continued military spending, saying, ``Freedom is
only as strong as its defenders.''
   North, sporting his trademark crew cut and gap-toothed grin and
attired in a civilian gray suit, ignored about a dozen sign-toting
protesters who shouted at him as left the hangar and got into a
waiting car.
   was making his first campaign appearance ever and his second
formal public speech since the Iran-Contra hearings, said
   Rohrabacher spokesman Robert Rule said North was to attend
fund-raisers for Rohrabacher in Los Angeles and Pasadena, then
address a $250-a-person dinner for Rohrabacher at the Spruce Goose.
   Participants were invited to donate $1,000 to attend a reception
next door on the ocean liner Queen Mary and have a picture taken
with North.
   He was set to spend Thursday campaigning for Christopher Cox, a
candidate in the 40th Congressional District Republican primary.
Cox, 35, of Newport Beach, was senior associate counsel for
President Reagan from 1986 to this year, when he resigned to seek
election.
   The front-runner in the crowded 42nd District race, Orange
County supervisor Harriet Wieder, denounced North's visit as a
``mercenary'' effort on behalf of Rohrabacher, 40, whom North knew
as a special assistant and senior speechwriter for President Reagan
from 1981 to 1988.
   ``Rohrabacher is just snuggling up to Ollie and president,'' Ms.
Wieder said. ``What does Ollie North know about issues in this
congressional district?''
   At a news conference before North appeared Wednesday,
Rohrabacher rejected suggestions that voters might react negatively
to a man facing criminal charges. ``I think that if people in the
district consider that Ollie North is for me, maybe they should be
too,'' he said.
   The candidate said he doubted voters would object to support
from North, who was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of
conspiracy to defraud the government for his role in selling arms
Iran and using the profits to support the Contra rebels in Marxist
Nicaragua.

<HEAD>EPA Asbestos Training Program Falls Down On Job, Witnesses Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government program aimed at training
contractors to remove deadly asbestos from public schools is
turning out inexperienced people who can still get by with shoddy
work while scoffing at health concerns, witnesses told a House
subcommittee.
   ``We cannot feel confident about the current state of contractor
accreditation,'' Emil DeVito, president of Fidelity Environmental
Insurance Co., said in a letter to Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Government Operations subcommittee on environment,
energy and natural resources.
   DeVito said his Princeton, N.J., company has refused to insure
30 of the 105 government-accredited contractors seeking coverage.
   The accreditation program was set up by Congress in 1986 in
response to widespread reports that untrained people were doing
removal work, frequently making a bad situation worse by improper
procedures that filled the air with asbestos fibers that cause lung
cancer.
   The 240 instruction centers around the nation are turning out
some 2,000 inspectors and contractors monthly who are certified by
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The 1986 law requires that school districts hire only certified
firms and at least begin asbestos removal work by July 1989. EPA
estimates that some 30,000 schools could need asbestos work.
   Synar said the testimony could strengthen efforts of a sizable
number of lawmakers and local school boards to amend the law to
delay the mandatory asbestos removal beyond July 1989.
   Bill Kitchen of the Johnstown, N.Y., school board told the
subcommittee's hearing Wednesday that when he took an EPA-approved
course, he encountered lackadaisical attitudes and instructors who
questioned the proven dangers of asbestos fibers.
   DeVito said the background of many course instructors ``is
flimsy at best.''
   He said there is no requirement that a contractor have any
experience, meaning anyone can get into the removal business after
five days of training.
   Even if the training is good, DeVito said, there is no guarantee
that contractors will not try to boost profits by cutting corners
because they know EPA and the states cannot inspect all removal
work.
   ``The programs are not tough enough,'' DeVito said. ``As a
result of the weaknesses with EPA's accreditation of contractors,
FEIC is essentially accrediting every contractor and approving each
job the company insures.''
   Kitchen said students at the course he took joked about health
concerns and made comments like ``we're going to be laughing all
the way to the bank.''
   ``The courses themselves do not approach the subject matter in a
serious way,'' he maintained.
   Kitchen said one principal lecturer questioned health concerns
about asbestos and that students were given an EPA publication that
``espouses the (asbestos) industry viewpoint that there is a safe
level of exposure'' to a substance that health experts say has no
safe level.
   Asked by Synar to comment on DeVito's letter, Assistant EPA
Administrator John Moore described it as ``disquieting.''
   Susan Vogt, deputy director of the EPA's office of toxic
substances, said that while the agency audits an accreditation
course once, ``it is an unfortunate fact'' that EPA lacks the
manpower to do continued monitoring.

   Dutch psychic detective Peter Hurkos, who
helped authorities seek clues in the Manson family murders and the
Boston Strangler case, died of a heart attack Wednesday, his
publicist said. He was 77.
   Hurkos, who had part of his cancerous right lung removed in
April, had just left his doctor's office when he was stricken in
the hallway of a medical complex near Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
said publicist Barbara Silver.
   He was best known for helping authorities in the 1969 Manson
family murders of actress Sharon Tate and supermarket owner Leno
LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary.
   Hurkos reportedly told authorities the person responsible for
the murders was a bearded man named Charlie, according to ``The
Psychic World of Peter Hurkos'' by Norma Lee Browning, published in
1970.
   The book also detailed Hurkos' involvement in the Strangler case
of 1964, which later was made into a movie starring Tony Curtis.
   Hurkos refused to budge from his position that a man he picked
as the Boston Strangler was the killer and that confessed strangler
Albert DeSalvo was not, the author wrote.
   ``He was very helpful in any of the police things that he worked
on. Why did he go into it? Because he could felt that he probably
could contribute.'' Ms. Silver said.
   Hurkos reportedly became psychic in 1941 after falling from a
ladder and suffering a brain injury. On regaining consciousness, he
realized he had ``an ability to pierce the barriers that separate
the past, present and future,'' his biography states.
   Hurkos said he was able to see things by touching objects. ``I
see pictures in my mind like a television screen. When I touch
something, I can then tell what I see,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bill Restricting Company Lie Detector Tests Clears House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation that would significantly reduce
the number of lie detector tests administered by private companies
now needs only Senate approval to go to the president for signature
into law.
   The House voted 251-120 on Wednesday in favor of the conference
report, a compromise version of differing bills passed earlier by
the two chambers. Senate approval would send the legislation to the
president.
   The Office of Technology Assessment estimated that about 2
million such tests were administered last year, and that 90 percent
were administered by private employers, mostly to job applicants
but also to workers under investigation.
   The accuracy of test results has been questioned, and so has the
competency of some examiners. Twenty-two states prohibit the tests
in the private sector, and 19 regulate their private use.
   The legislation would permit private sector testing of
applicants for only two types of jobs.
   Those applying for security guard positions could still be
tested, and so could prospective employees who would have direct
access to the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of
controlled substances.
   The bill also has several provisions to protect the rights of
workers subject to tests.
   The bill would prohibit an employee from being discharged,
dismissed, disciplined, discriminated against, or denied employment
or promotion solely on the basis of the test, or solely for refusal
to take the test.
   To take action against the worker, an employer would have to
have additional supporting evidence.
   Questions on religious or political beliefs could not be asked,
and all questions would have to be submitted to the examinee in
writing before the examination. The examinee could end the test at
any time.
   An employer could test an employee during an investigation
involving economic loss or injury to the company.
   However, the employee would have to have had access to the
property that is the subject of the investigation, and the employer
would have to have a reasonable suspicion that the worker was
involved in the incident.
   Before the test began, the worker would have to be given
specific information about the incident under investigation.
   Only the federal government would be permitted to administer
tests to those employed by, assigned to, or detailed to the
nation's intelligence agencies and to FBI contract employees.
   Qualification standards would be set for examiners, who would
need a license granted by the state, if one was required. The
examiner also would have to maintain a $50,000 bond.
   The legislation would take effect six months after it became law.

<HEAD>Navy Forecasting Job Losses at Eight Public Shipyards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is forecasting new job reductions at
its eight public shipyards, where employment already has dropped 9
percent since 1985.
   An unpublished naval planning document shows that the Navy is
projecting a 21 percent cutback in employment at the yards between
now and the end of fiscal 1991.
   The job figures are only estimates, and are subject to change
because of schedule shifts, new work or other factors.
   The May 11 document, obtained this week from congressional
sources, projects employment requirements based on ship repair and
modernization assignments for the 1989, 1990 and 1991 fiscal years.
The Naval Sea Systems Command document resulted from a recent ship
scheduling conference sponsored by the systems command, which
oversees the eight yards.
   Overall, employment in the yards would shrink from about 71,100
now to 64,050 in the fall of 1989. The workforce then would shrink
further to 57,150 the next year and 56,400 the year after that. The
current 71,100 figure includes about 4,000 temporary and part-time
employees.
   The systems command, in a statement in response to a reporter's
query, said the Navy has neither published employment projections
nor announced layoffs.
   ``However, shipyard employment figures are routinely reviewed
and working documents are prepared to determine what employment
levels are necessary to meet fleet operational requirements,'' the
statement said.
   ``Exact naval shipyard employment figures will not be determined
until the budget process is completed for fiscal year 1989 and
beyond,'' it said.
   The eight yards have already seen their collective workforce
trimmed by 7,000 from the 78,100 who were employed in January 1985.
The Navy said those reductions were prompted in part by a declining
number of ship overhauls.
   Some yards would see their workforce dip and then swell again,
under the projections of the May 11 document.
   For example, employment at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in
Bremerton, Wash., is estimated to dip from 11,400 to 8,500 by the
fall of 1990, before climbing back to 10,000 the following year.
   Puget Sound spokesman Bruce Andrae said that while he was not
familiar with the working document, the yard was ``pretty well
aware'' of its workload over the next few years.
   ``I think you'll find we're not the only shipyard where you'll
see some rather wide swings in manpower,'' Andrae said. ``You go
down for a couple of years and all of a sudden you've got to make a
dramatic increase. Skilled labor doesn't come easily, and that
presents some challenges.''
   A similar pattern was projected at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in
Portsmouth, Va.
   Employment at Norfolk, whose 12,700 workers make it the largest
public yard, was forecast at 11,350 in the fall of 1989, 9,700 in
1990, and 10,900 in 1991.
   Employment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, now at about
8,700, is projected to decline to 6,800. The yard likely would lay
off 749 temporary workers first, officials said.
   The Long Beach, Calif., shipyard would suffer the least
disruption to its workforce, with its employment remaining between
5,000 and 5,250 during the three years.
   The Mare Island yard in northern California would see its
workforce drop to 10,000 in the fall of 1989, followed by a loss of
another 3,800 workers and then a gain of 1,300 to bring it back up
to 7,500.
   Hawaii's Pearl Harbor Yard, which employs about 6,100 now, would
drop to 4,000.
   Among Eastern yards, Charleston, S.C., would go from about 8,600
to 6,200. The Portsmouth, N.H., yard would remain at about 8,000
workers until 1991, then dip to 5,800 at the end of 1991.

   A woman has given birth to a healthy child
produced from a frozen embryo that was conceived in a laboratory
dish with sperm from her husband and an egg donated by her sister,
doctors said Wednesday.
   The birth in May at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
New Jersey is believed to be the first of its kind in the Northeast
and one of 10 in the world, the doctors said.
   The procedure was used because the unidentified mother, a New
York City woman in her 30s, suffered premature ovarian failure and
was unable to become pregnant, said Dr. Cecilia Schmidt, director
of the Center for Fertility and Reproductive Technology.
   Doctors retrieved several of the sister's eggs using a new
ultrasound procedure that does not require surgery. The eggs were
fertilized in vitro with sperm from the woman's husband.
   After an initial pregnancy attempt failed, the remaining embryos
were frozen and kept at 190 degrees below zero Celsius. One embryo
was thawed three months later and implanted, producing the healthy
baby.

<HEAD>Vice President Shrugs Off Conservative Figures' Influence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said in a published
interview that two of the nation's well-known and outspoken
conservatives are fringe elements whose support isn't necessary for
victory in the presidential election.
   Bush, interviewed by The New York Times at his oceanside retreat
in Kennebunkport, Maine on Wednesday, shrugged off the influence of
Richard A. Viguerie, a writer and direct-mail specialist, and
Howard J. Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus.
   ``There's only one or two that polarize, and Viguerie and Howie
Phillips are two of them; it doesn't matter in terms of total
vote,'' the vice president said in the interview, published in
Thursday's editions of the Times.
   ``There is only a handful of Richard Vigueries out there,'' said
Bush, the all-but certain Republican presidential nominee.
   Asked if he had to do business with Viguerie to win the
election, he said: ``I don't believe that.''
   ``The fact that he (Viguerie) doesn't agree with me on a lot of
things or has opposed me for many years, that doesn't bother me one
iota,'' said Bush. Viguerie, the vice president said, ``gets his
name in the paper by criticizing other Republicans all the time.''
   A Viguerie spokeswoman, Carolyn Melenick, said Wednesday night
that Viguerie would have no immediate comment on Bush's remarks.
Viguerie said last month that he would vote for Bush.
   Bush also told the newspaper he would be meeting soon with
Attorney General Edwin Meese. Bush said over the weekend that the
two had met recently, and Meese said he would not do anything to
harm Bush's presidential campaign.
   The attorney general is under investigation by an independent
counsel, and the Democrats have been using the issue to attack Bush.
   ``I think he's been made aware by the polls and by a lot of
public comment that there is the danger that this matter, if it
stays exactly the way it is, could not only adversely affect me,
but affect others as well,'' Bush said of Meese.
   Bush was also asked if he agreed with President Reagan's
contention, made at the superpower summit in Moscow, that Soviet
bureaucracy, rather than Kremlin policy, was apparently responsible
for delays in granting exit visas, or refusal to grant them at all.
   The newspaper said the vice president did not answer directly,
but said the United States and the Soviet Union have ``fundamental
differences'' on human rights.
   ``There is a long way to go before they have lived up to
provisions of the Helsinki final act,'' he said, adding that the
United States was committed to ``broad, objective standards on
human rights.''

   An explosion about 300 feet
underground in a coal shaft Wednesday killed 31 miners and trapped
26, who were given little chance of survival.
   About 30 rescue workers used large drills early Thursday to bore
through tons of debris in an urgent effort to reach the trapped
miners.
   The explosion scorched the ground on the surface, where eight
men were critically injured. The blast also blew the roofs off at
least three work buildings at the mine, knocked down sheds and
shattered windows.
   Early Thursday, Hessiche Rundfunk radio quoted authorities as
saying 31 bodies had been found, raising by 15 the number of dead
that had been earlier confirmed.
   Twenty-six other miners were still trapped 330 feet below
ground, the Frankfurt-based radio station said. Dieter Wickert, a
spokesman for the company that owns the mine, said the latest
confirmed count he'd heard was 29 dead.
   Rescue authorities could not be immediately reached to comment
on the radio's figures.
   Gottfried Milde, Hesse state interior minister, said 57 miners
were in the shaft when the blast occurred at midday at the mine
near Borken, 70 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   He said there was little hope of finding any others alive. About
one-third of the men were foreigners, including 14 Turks, he said.
   Family members and friends of the missing men went to the mine
and clung to each other for support as they waited.
   ``It's horrible. My husband is down there,'' said Ingrid Henke,
35. ``My daughters aged just 1 and 2.''
   A woman who would not give her name, but said that her husband
was not in the shaft, added: ``All the women in this part of town
are doing their best to comfort each other.''
   Around them was the mangled wreckage of the steel beams, sheds
and fences blown away by the explosion.
   Erwin Braun, head of the Hesse state mining board, said all
indications pointed to a gas explosion caused by a buildup of coal
dust. Radio reports said the accident may have been caused by
detonation of 4,400 pounds of explosives stored in the mine.
   The lignite coal mine belongs to Preussen Elektra of Hanover,
one of the largest West German utility companies.
   Mayor Bernd Hessler of Borken told a news conference 16 bodies
had been found. Milde, the state interior minister, said rescue
workers were leaving the bodies where they found them in the shaft
and moving on to search for others.
   Wives and children watched from nearby as workers rushed to
reach the miners and pump oxygen into the shaft.
   Many family members were crying. Some had brought small baskets
filled with food, a sign they planned for a long night of waiting.
   Dense smoke engulfed the area after the blast at about 12:30
p.m., half an hour before the change of shifts. Hundreds of rescue
workers rushed to the mine and several helicopters were brought in.
   Gerhard Heinz, an engineer, said the explosion occurred at a
depth of between 200 and 460 feet. It critically injured eight
miners on the surface and left the ground scorched.
   Otto Kraft, a miner still blackened from the explosion, said:
``I've never seen anything like it.'' He still appeared dazed.
   Klaus Hausmann, a mine mechanic, said: ``I have no real hopes. I
think we'll have to bury a lot of people.''
   Hausmann said he was working at the pit and saw several
co-workers knocked over.
   Late Wednesday, police spokesman Wolfgang Rudolph said he
doubted earlier reports that a mine shaft had collapsed, hampering
rescue efforts. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, had said there was a collapse and ``this reduces the
chance of finding many survivors.''

   Male Norwegian soldiers can wear an earring
if they wish, a court has ruled.
   The civilian court in Hammerfest, Norway's northernmost town,
recently handed down the decision on a soldier's appeal against a
$48 fine he received last fall for refusing to remove a small
earring, the national NTB news agency reported.
   NTB quoted the Finnmark Dagblad newspaper, published in Tromsoe,
as saying the unidentified soldier challenged a military regulation
stating that only women are allowed to wear ``ear jewelry.''
   The magistrates voted 2-1 that the code was discriminatory. The
two judges voting in the soldier's favor were women, while the male
judge voted to uphold the previous dress codes, NTB reported.

<TEXT>
   Flustered City Council members closed a
loophole in a pornography ordinance after topless dancers began
smearing themselves with transparent grease to slip out of a
requirement that they cover up.
   Before it was amended Tuesday, the ordinance specified what
parts of dancers' bodies had to be covered but didn't say the
covering had to be opaque.
   ``Some of the girls ... were covering their breasts with
Vaseline or grease,'' said Brenda Nichols, assistant city attorney.
   There were reports that other dancers used see-through fabric
and clear adhesive tape to skirt the ordinance. Tuesday's Council
action banned all such clear coverings.
   The Council also amended the ordinance to make sure adult
entertainment establishments are at least 1,000 feet from homes,
schools, churches, parks or other adult businesses.
   The amendment went into effect immediately.
   Those who still want to see strippers can easily cross an
international bridge to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where nude dancing
and prostitution are legal.
   Mike Gibson, a lawyer who represents some of the adult
businesses here, said City Council simply is trying to stamp out
adult businesses in El Paso.
   ``If you comply with the first ordinance they pass, they change
it to make sure no one can comply,'' he said. ``With the new
definition of the type of covering, you might as well set up
outside a swimming pool and charge admission to it.''

   Republican politicians say the Moscow summit
has presented Vice President George Bush with one of his best
chances yet to establish a more separate identity from President
Reagan and reassure conservatives in his own party.
   ``There comes a time and I would say to him this is the time,''
said Eddie Mahe, a GOP political consultant.
   Conservative Republicans were especially displeased with
Reagan's statement Wednesday that the Soviet bureaucracy _ and not
policies of the Soviet leadership _ may be the reason so many
Russian dissidents are barred from leaving the Soviet Union.
   ``I respectfully disagree with the president's statement,'' said
Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y. ``Human rights problems are endemic to the
Soviet system, not just the bureaucracy, but the fundamental nature
of government.''
   ``I think that Bush could reassure conservatives by
demonstrating that he is totally realistic about the Soviets,''
said Roger Stone, a consultant who worked on Reagan presidential
campaigns in 1980 and 1984, as well as on Kemp's unsuccessful bid
for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination.
   At a news conference in Moscow near the close of his summit with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Reagan suggested that problems
Soviet citizens are having getting exit visas were caused by the
bureaucracy rather than government policy.
   ``I just have to believe that in any government some of us do
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' said the president,
apparently at pains to avoid direct criticism of his Soviet hosts.
   Reagan said he thought Gorbachev was attempting to overcome
these bureaucratic barriers.
   Bush took a fairly neutral tack when he was asked about the
president's remarks. The New York Times, which interviewed him
Wednesday, asked him about it, and said in today's editions that
the vice president did not respond directly.
   Instead, he noted that the United States and the Soviet Union
have ``fundamental differences'' on human rights, and added:
``There is a long way to go before they have lived up to provisions
of the Helsinki final act.''
   But the Reagan comments brought quick reaction from human rights
observers as well as other politicians back home.
   ``It's really hard to know where Reagan was coming from on
that,'' said Dawn Mann, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, an independent policy research institute.
``The fact that there still are several hundred prisoners of
conscience is not attributable to bureaucratic snafus.''
   Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., chairman of the Human Rights
subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, defended the
president and said he thought Reagan was trying to be polite.
   ``I can think of no one in Congress or the administration who
feels that Moscow's repressive policies are not the results of the
repressive nature of the Soviet government,'' he said. ``I would
want to give the president the benefit of the doubt.''
   Rep. Gerald Solomon of New York, the senior Republican on
Yatron's subcommittee, said he thought Reagan's approach could help
open the way for loosening of Soviet emigration policy.
   ``That gives wriggle for Gorbachev to react, and without
confrontational demands,'' he said. ``I'm confident that it will
work.''
   But within the political community, the Reagan comments were
viewed far differently.
   Extreme conservatives were apoplectic.
   ``He's certainly become America's No. 1 apologist for the Soviet
Union,'' said Richard Viguerie, who has taken to criticizing Reagan
for being soft toward the Soviets.
   ``Who is he kidding?'' asked Juliana Pilon of the conservative
Heritage Foundation. ``It just isn't true.''
   Mahe said of Reagan's comments, ``Those sentiments would not
really reflect George Bush's sentiments.'' He said they could give
Bush an opportunity to demonstrate to voters an area where he and
the president disagree.
   ``What this provides him is an opportunity to say, well, I
respect the president but I can't find myself in agreement on those
things,'' he said.
   ``I would tell him (Bush), the opportunity is at hand, let's
jump on it,'' added Mahe.
   ``Reagan's clearly trying to be kind to his hosts,'' said Stone.
``But it's an unrealistic position.''

   It was a poignant end to a fine series, but at
least ``St. Elsewhere'' got a polite sendoff in the Nielsen ratings
last week when it got its highest ranking ever, seventh.
   The highly publicized final episode ending with a surprise scene
revealing the whole six years of the series as only the imaginings
of an autistic child. But the ratings were real _ the episode got a
rating of 17.0, matching the rating of the season premiere last
fall, and a share of 29, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   The conclusion of ABC's two-part movie ``Baby M'' improved on
the part one, making the top 10 at fifth with a rating of 17.6 and
a 27 share. Part one, included in the previous week's Nielsens,
ranked 17th.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   CBS got a top-10 performance out of the ``Miss Universe
Pageant,'' which ranked ninth with a 15.6 rating.
   The summer doldrums began to set in last week as the network
schedules filled with reruns. Viewers apparently eschewed
television for the outdoors and dropped the network share of the
audience to 63 from a season-to-date average of 70. Only four the
top 20 shows weren't reruns.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with a 12.8 rating, CBS had
10.9 and ABC 9.8. NBC's season-to-date average rating is 15.7, ABC
13.4 and CBS 13.2.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' continued a winning streak in news,
though the three networks apparently lost early evening viewers to
summer weather, and the race continued to be a virtual three-way
tie. ABC had an average rating of 9.0 and 19 share, the ``CBS
Evening News'' 8.5 and 19, the ``NBC Nightly News'' 8.2 and 18.
   The top 10 prime-time shows were: ``Cheers'' NBC, ``A Different
World'' NBC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Night Court'' NBC, ``Baby M,
Part 2'' ABC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC, ``St. Elsewhere'' NBC, ``Golden
Girls'' NBC, ``Miss Universe Pagent'' CBS, ``Who's the Boss
Special'' ABC.
   NBC's made-for-TV movie, ``Desperado,'' came in 11th, the only
other non-repeat in the top 20.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Bride of Boogedy,''
``West 57th,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Ohara,'' ``High Mountain
Rangers,'' ``Hotel,'' ``Our House,'' ``Probe,'' ``Juarez'' and
``Omnibus.''

Vanderburgh has become the seventh member of his family to graduate
from the U.S. Air Force Academy.
   Four older brothers and two sisters graduated from the academy
and remain active in the Air Force. A fifth brother graduated from
West Point.
   ``It's a very happy day,'' the 21-year-old Vanderburgh said
Wednesday. ``Everybody's really excited.''
   Vanderburgh's father, Richard, was an Air Force fighter pilot
captain in the Korean War. He and his wife, Mary, who attended
Wednesday's graduation, hold civilian jobs at Wright Patterson AFB
in Dayton, Ohio.
   Vanderburgh's younger brother Robert is attending the University
of Dayton, where he is in the Air Force ROTC program. Another
younger brother, Michael, is a high school junior but plans to go
into law enforcement.
   Academy officials did not know immediately whether the family

   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell says a
former E.F. Hutton branch manager didn't try to hide his
involvement in a check-kiting scheme that led to the company's
guilty plea to criminal charges in 1985.
   Bell, a defendant in a defamation suit filed by a former Hutton
branch manager criticized by the report he wrote, disputed the
plaintiff's claim that the check overdrafting was authorized by
company executives.
   While some branch managers said they were authorized by Hutton
superiors to overdraw accounts, plaintiff John M. Pearce never said
that anybody authorized him to do that, Bell testified Wednesday in
U.S. District Court.
   ``I asked him about paying a penalty. He said he didn't think he
should have to pay a penalty because he was a manager and not an
account executive,'' Bell said, recalling his interview with
Pearce, one of eight branch and regional executives cited for
wrongdoing in the former attorney general's report.
   He quoted Pearce as saying: ``Why don't you take it out of my
bonus.''
   Pearce claims that Bell, a private attorney in Atlanta who was
President Carter's first attorney general, negligently ignored
evidence that the check kiting scheme was approved by Hutton's top
management in New York.
   Pearce, who ran branches in Bethesda, Md., and St. Louis, claims
that Bell defamed him in the report and at a Sept. 5, 1985, press
conference held to discus the findings of the three-month
investigation.
   Bell was hired by Hutton after the firm pleaded guilty May 2,
1985, to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud stemming from the
check kiting scheme.
   The company, now part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., agreed to
pay a $2 million fine and reimburse banks for millions of dollars
in interest lost when branch offices wrote checks against money
that had not been deposited in their checking accounts.
   Bell strongly defended his investigation, saying he didn't cite
any top officials for wrongdoing because all he could prove was
that senior executives didn't monitor the activities of branch and
regional offices.
   ``I thought I could catch a high person, but I never could,''
Bell said.
   Bell acknowledged that he was suspicious of high officials,
including former Hutton president George L. Ball. But there was no
evidence that any top Hutton official intentional sanctioned any
check writing practice that was later found to be illegal, he said.
   ``I'm not going to put my name on something charging somebody
with wrongdoing if they hadn't met the test _ if they did not have
the intent to do something wrong,'' Bell testified.
   ``I never found anybody on a high level at Hutton that knew what
was going on,'' Bell said.
   The problem was ``they didn't have any controls at all,'' Bell
said. Hutton ``just letting people go wild, doing whatever they
wanted to do.''
   He credited the investigations he and the Justice Department
conducted with changing overdraft procedures of major corporations.
   Bell's report recommended that Thomas P. Morley, Hutton's
``money mobilizer,'' be relieved of any duties involving the
company's banking activities.
   Thomas P. Lynch, a vice president whom Bell identified as the
chief financial officer, was also forced to resign for failing to
keep adequate controls.

   Director Oliver Stone, here in
preparation for a film version of the musical ``Evita,'' says he's
considering Barbra Streisand, Olivia Newton-John and Madonna to
portray the lead.
   Stone, director of the hit movies ``Platoon'' and ``Wall
Street,'' arrived in Argentina on Wednesday. During his five days
here, he plans to tour the areas where the late first lady Eva
``Evita'' Peron lived, and contact people who once knew her.
   Evita, a little-known actress, became Gen. Juan D. Peron's lover
and eventually his wife. She organized a vast state welfare agency
that monopolized all charitable activity and helped Peron become
known as the savior of the poor. She died of cancer at age 33 in
1952.

   Comedian Jackie Mason, honored with a
Certificate of Appreciation from Mayor Ed Koch, said he hopes the
fast-quipping mayor remains in office so ``he won't compete with me
on Broadway.''
   Mason, who won a Tony Award for his one-man show, ``The World
According to Me,'' said that no matter what happens, Koch runs to
the television station to tell jokes about it.
   ``He's so busy telling jokes, I'm surprised that he has time to
do anything,'' said Mason, who was given the certificate by Koch on
Wednesday for bringing ``laughter to the world.''
   ``He loves monologues. ... He happens to be a good comedian,''
Mason said. ``I hope he stays a mayor, because as long as he stays
a mayor, he won't compete with me on Broadway.''
   That probably won't happen, even though Koch's biography,
``Mayor'' was turned into an off-Broadway play several years ago
and he has appeared on the Broadway stage.
   After his brief Broadway acting debut in March 1986 in ``Singin'
in the Rain,'' Koch said he loved the experience but called it his
first and last time.

   An explosion and fire ripped through
an industrial park Wednesday, killing one person, injuring at least
10 and prompting 2,000 to flee before the blaze was brought under
control, authorities said.
   Two people were unaccounted for hours after the 3:30 p.m.
explosion at Traco Inc., a plastics manufacturer in this industrial
northern Chicago suburb, said Lt. Jack Jordan of the North Chicago
Fire Department. He said he suspected the two were Traco employees.
   The body was found about 11:30 p.m. in the rubble of the
explosion, Jordan said.
   One of the injured was listed in critical condition and four
were firefighters treated for heat exhaustion from battling the
fire.
   ``It shook City Hall, which is about two miles away,'' said
Mayor Bobby E. Thompson, who ordered a precautionary evacuation for
the 2,000 to 3,000 people who live near the Coleman Industrial
Complex, due to potentially toxic fumes.
   The fire was brought under control about 8:30 p.m., but toxic
chemicals burned in the fire included chlorine, polyvinyl chloride
and polystyrene, said Will Flowers, a spokesman for the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Gregory Stevens, 27, of Antioch was hospitalized in critical
condition with facial burns, smoke inhalation and cuts on his head,
face and legs, said Joanne Johnson, spokeswoman at St. Therese
Medical Center in Waukegan.
   Thompson said authorities were asking people within a two-mile
area to close all doors and windows and turn off air conditioners
to avoid possible respiratory injuries.
   Jordan estimated that 2,000 people evacuated their homes but
were allowed to return late in the evening. They were advised to
kept doors and windows shut.
   The mayor said six to 10 businesses burned, but there was no
immediate estimate of damages. The cause of the explosion was not
immediately known.
   North Chicago, with a population of about 47,000, is about 35
miles north of downtown Chicago, and is the home of the Great Lakes
Naval Training Station.

   A cold spell that sent temperatures
plunging to 3 degrees in southern Patagonia has led to the deaths
of at least 11 people, authorities say.
   Winter is still 20 days away in the Southern Hemisphere, but the
cold snap has forced pedestrians in Buenos Aires to don ski parkas

   And heavy snows have already closed several passes in the Andes
mountains between Chile and Argentina.
   On Wednesday, police discovered the 11th victim, a man frozen to
death in this northwestern city.
   In other incidents, authorities said three brothers burned to
death in southwestern Neuquen Province when their stove overheated
and caught fire, two men were found frozen to death in northwestern
Cordoba Province and a middle-aged couple died of asphyxiation when
their heating system failed in Buenos Aires Province.
   On Tuesday, authorities found the bodies of a baby girl and an
elderly man from the resort of Mar del Plata and another man near
downtown Salta.
   Mar del Plata is 250 miles south of Buenos Aires. Salta is 1,000
miles northwest of the capital.

   The mayors of the nation's capital and nearby
Baltimore have renewed their call for a national debate on the
decriminalization of illegal drugs, with Baltimore's chief

   ``I'm not calling for a retreat on the war on drugs,'' said
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who touched off a firestorm of debate
several weeks ago when he first suggested the possibility of
decriminalization. ``I want to fight on the battlefield of the drug
dealers _ money.''
   Schmoke also said that Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who chairs
the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, has
agreed to hold hearings on the decriminalization issue, probably in

who seek help in having children from the nation's test-tube baby
industry.
   ``Frustrated couples, many at an emotional breaking point,

modern medicine,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. at a hearing

   Wyden, chairman of the House Small Business subcommittee on
regulation and business opportunities, cited a recent congressional
study that found more than half of the 169 clinics in the United
States performing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) last year never
produced a baby. A woman's chance of taking home a test-tube baby
is about 6 percent he said.
   The study for the congressional Office of Technology Assessment
also showed Americans spent $1 billion last year to combat
infertility.

   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch, in a May 27 ruling made public

   Gasch said the provision contained in a spending resolution
passed by Congress last December unconstitutionally intruded on the

   ``With a tug of the purse strings section 630 (of the spending
resolution) establishes a precedent unrestrained by discernible

<TEXT>
   Instead of mending nets and readying his
boat for the salmon season, fisherman Kevin Hogan spends these days
gathering petitions, worrying and pondering bankruptcy.
   Hogan, 36, got a costly, first-hand look at the federal
government's ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug program on May 11, when
Customs Service agents seized his new $140,000 fishing boat after
allegedly finding 1.7 grams of marijuana in a crewman's jacket.
   Today, the lanky, bespectacled boat owner is caught in a
standoff with Customs officials, one he says could cost him
everything he's worked for in the past 15 years and is particularly
annoying because of his reputation as an opponent of drugs and
alcohol in the fishing industry.
   ``I stand to lose it all in this deal,'' Hogan said recently
from his tin-sided home on a hillside above Homer. ``Everything,
all $400,000 of my net worth.''
   Under the Reagan administration's ``zero tolerance'' policy,
Customs and Coast Guard officers have seized boats and arrested
people for even tiny amounts of illegal drugs found during searches.
   The policy initially was applied in international waters, but
after an uproar over the seizure of the $2.5 million yacht Ark
Royal, on which less than a teaspoon of marijuana was found in
international waters, the administration decided to apply the
policy outside the 12-mile territorrial limit only to suspected
drug smugglers.
   Customs officials acknowledge that Hogan knew nothing of the
marijuana aboard his vessel, the Hold Tight, but refuse to
relinquish it until Hogan pays a $10,000 fine and fires the
crewman, who is also his nephew Minh Van Le.
   ``It's outrageous. I haven't been charged with anything and here
they've seized my boat, my means of production,'' Hogan said. ``I
cannot believe I don't have any rights in this thing. I don't even
think this would happen in the Soviet Union.''
   More than 1,000 people in this fishing community, located on the
southern Kenai Peninsula more than 100 miles south of Anchorage,
have signed petitions supporting Hogan, a former Homer City Council
candidate.
   The Council last week passed a resolution urging Customs
officials to exhibit ``some sense of proportionality'' in Hogan's
case.
   ``I feel the drug sellers and users should be taken on
strongly,'' Councilman John Kosch said. ``But I don't see the
government telling you who to hire. I'm astounded the government
would try to impose that.''
   John Elkins, acting director of Customs' regulatory procedures
and penalties division in Washington, D.C., wrote in a letter to
the agency's Anchorage office that Hogan was negligent in not
detecting and reporting the marijuana.
   ``It is our view that Kevin Hogan was, as owner and master,
responsible for the actions of crew members,'' Elkins said.
   Hogan bought the vessel in Washington state last November. It
was delivered unfinished Feb. 1 and he says he worked 18-hour days
to get the 40-foot fiberglass vessel ready for a 24-hour halibut
season that started May 23.
   He headed for Alaska with three crewmembers, including his
21-year-old nephew, on May 8. Hogan said he warned the crew about
the zero tolerance program.
   Engine problems forced the Hold Tight to stop briefly in Canada
for repairs. Hogan said when he routinely reported that stop to
Customs agents in Ketchikan, his boat was searched.
   ``I wasn't worried because I thought the boat was clean,'' Hogan
said. But agents found the marijuana, and Le was given a summons.
   ``I don't think it would have gone this far if I had yelled and
screamed and fired my nephew on the spot,'' Hogan said. ``I think
that's what they wanted, but my family has always stood by me, and
I'm going to stand by my family.''
   Hogan said he asked that his boat be released so he could make
the halibut opening. ``They sat on it until the season was over,''
he said. ``I've been working for 15 years to get to that 24-hour
opening and I missed it.''
   That cost him a $40,000 catch he was counting on to pay the
mortgages on the Hold Tight and his old boat, the 32-foot Tonga.
   The seizure could also cost him the $100,000 he expects from the
salmon season, which begins in late June. He says he can't use the
Tonga to fish because he already has accepted a down payment from
people intending to buy it.
   ``I have to fish it one way or another,'' he said. ``I have
bills to pay.''

   Federal Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr.
was listed as stable early today after being hospitalized for heart
problems, a nursing supervisor said.
   Haynsworth, 75, went to Greenville Memorial Hospital on Tuesday
complaining of chest pains, said hospital spokesman Dave Partridge.
   Partridge said Haynsworth had an irregular heartbeat but did not
have a heart attack. He was kept for observations.
   Haynsworth spent the first night in the coronary care unit, but
was moved to post-coronary care. Partridge said he didn't know when
Haynsworth might be released.
   Haynsworth has been on the 10-member 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals since 1957 and was its chief judge for more than 16 years.
He officially retired as chief judge in 1981, but continues to work
as a senior judge.
   Haynsworth was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President
Richard Nixon in 1969, but the Senate rejected the nomination
55-45. It was the first time in 39 years that the Senate refused a
president's nomination to the court.
   In 1983, the federal courthouse in Greenville was named after
him.

<HEAD>Bush Formulating Policies, But Not Spelling Out Specifics Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush will use advice he
aquired in four days of issues talks to help forge policies for his
general election campaign, but advisers suggest he's in no rush to
spell out details.
   A group of economic advisers emerged from a meeting with the
vice president on Wednesday with words of support for his plan for
a ``flexible freeze'' on federal spending, but with few new details.
   The plan, designed to wipe out the budget deficit by 1993,
depends on an optimistic economic outlook and a reduction in
interest rates by at least 2 percentage points, participants in the
session said. It would not raise taxes.
   Bush met on Tuesday and Wednesday with the economists and held a
similar session last Friday and Saturday with domestic policy
advisers. He has also met with some Republican governors and
members of Congress.
   Bush pollster and campaign strategist Robert Teeter said that
Bush found the talks ``very helpful in formalizing his economic
plans'' but is not ready at this time to further define his
positions.
   Bush will hold more such sessions back in Washington, including
ones dealing with education and training programs for dislocated
workers, Teeter said.
   The vice president planned to take the day off today _ with
nothing on his schedule besides a Coast Guard safety check of his
powerboat _ and will return to Washington on Friday. He has been
here at his seaside vacation retreat since last Thursday.
   And one of the chief topics has been finding ways to project an
image apart from his close identification with President Reagan.
   ``I think George Bush's ardent supporters are anxious for him to
step away from the administration so the voters can see him as they
(the supporters) know him'' said Bush staff chief Craig Fuller.
   ``I don't know that that means staking out a lot of different
positions as much as it means trying to communicate to voters the
strengths of George Bush,'' Fuller said.
   Bush's proposal for a modified spending freeze won solid support
from economists who advised him this week, all of whom are Bush
backers.
   ``We all concluded that a flexible freeze is the right way to
go, that is indeed doable,'' said former deputy treasury secretary
Richard Darman, now a consultant with Shearson Lehman Bros. in New
York.
   Darman said Bush would contrast his plan with what he called the
``Massachusetts mirage'' of Michael Dukakis, a dig at the
Democratic front-runner's management of his state's economy.
   Bush's plan depends on a reduction in the budget deficit that is
occuring anyway and a fast-rising surplus in the nation's Social
Security trust fund, and no downturn in economic growth, the
economists conceded.
   Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, who in the past has
advocated tax increases to reduce the federal deficit, told
reporters he's joined the ranks of true believers in the Bush plan.
   If Bush is elected, financial markets will rally on the
assumption that the deficit will be attacked seriously, said
Feldstein, a former chairman of President Reagan's Council of
Economic Advisers.
   ``The markets will respond and bring down interest rates another
notch, 2 percentage points, and that will get us down and get us
within inches of budget balance in 1993,'' said Feldstein.
   Democratic critics, as well as many private economists, argue
that it is unlikely the budget deficit, $150 billion last year, can
be eliminated without some form of new taxes.
   Bush's proposed ``flexible freeze'' would keep overall spending
except for Social Security payments at levels in the budget
approved by Congress for fiscal year 1989, plus inflation.
   The freeze would be ``flexible'' because some spending could go
up, but it would have to be offset by identical reductions in other
areas.
   However, so far, Bush has not provided details on which programs
he would like to cut and which ones he would like to see expanded.
   ``There have to be choices,'' Feldstein said. ``I assume the
vice president is going to wait until he sits down with Congress to
negotiate those details.''
   Bush himself said earlier in the week that he didn't feel any
``compulsion to give 20-point programs on everyting.''
   And New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, a key Bush supporter, told
reporters: ``You will see in the campaign the detailed plans on how
to deal with each of these issues. But the clock will not be set by
those who ask the question. The clock will be set by the
candidate.''

   Their faces red from weeping,
relatives of the victims of the Borken coal mine blast headed home
early today after waiting for hours for news that their loved ones
were alive.
   The news never came.
   By early today, rescue workers had pulled 31 bodies from the
mine after the explosion midday Wednesday, Hessiche Rundfunk radio
reported.
   Another 26 miners were still trapped 330 feet underground and
hopes were dimming that they would be found alive.
   Wives, children and parents of the missing miners gathered at a
mine company building Wednesday night to wait together.
   ``I don't see how anyone could have survived,'' said 60-year-old
Gerhard Hettmanczyk, whose son-in-law Alfred Wiremba was among the
missing. He headed home late Wednesday after waiting several hours
on the mine grounds.
   Others followed Hettmanczyk, weeping or trying to hold back
their sobs.
   At the mine, floodlights illuminated about 300 rescue workers,
who were handling large cables for drills used by teams of diggers
inside. The cables also powered ventilators that were pumping fresh
air into the mine shaft.
   The explosion blew the roofs off at least three company
buildings and kicking up a dark cloud of dust that lingered over
the landscape.
   Strewn over the site were heavy steel rollers from a conveyer
belt blown apart by the blast.
   ``The air is very bad in there,'' said Klaus Hausmann, a
blackened miner who was helping outside. ``Things do not look so
good _ everything is blocked off.''
   ``Naturally we knew that a miner's job can be dangerous. But we
never thought this would happen,'' said Werner Henke, an elderly
man who was waiting near the mine in the house of his son Dieter,
who was among the missing.
   ``Work will go on here after this over,'' said Otto Kraft, a
mine worker who was above ground when it happened. ``But we're
never going to be able to forget this horrible disaster.''

<HEAD>Record Season For Ticket Sales; Production Drops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theatergoers gave their regards to Broadway,
buying a record number of tickets during the 1987-88 season despite
having fewer productions to choose from.
   During the season, which ran June 1, 1987, to May 29, $253
million worth of tickets were sold to more than 8.1 million
theatergoers, the League of American Theaters and Producers said
Wednesday.
   The previous season, ticket sales were $209 million and
attendance hit 7 million for 40 Broadway productions. The 21
percent increase in ticket sales and 16 percent increase in
attendance occurred despite a drop in the number of productions to
32 during the 1987-88 season.
   ``This was a more balanced season between musicals and plays,''
said George Wachtel, the league's research director. ``Last season
we seemed to have three musical megahits _ `Me and My Girl,' `Les
Miserables' and `Starlight Express.' That focused attention on
Broadway and set us up for where we are now.''
   Twelve new musicals opened during the 1987-88 season compared
with 11 the previous year.
   ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical
that opened with a record $19 million advance sale, gave the
biggest boost to the season.
   It was joined by several other strong musical shows including
``Sarafina!'', a surprise hit from South Africa; a revival of the
Cole Porter musical ``Anything Goes,'' and ``Chess,'' a big British
musical that is doing well at the box office despite mostly
negative reviews.
   ``There's a lot of choice on Broadway which is probably why
there are so many people going,'' said Wachtel.
   There were eight new plays on Broadway, down from 13 the
previous season, but of the eight, only one _ ``Serious Money'' _
closed quickly. Five others are still running, including the four
strong Tony nominees for best play _ ``A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee
Blessing, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' by August Wilson, ``M.
Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang and ``Speed-the-Plow'' by David
Mamet.
   ``The eight plays that have opened this year are the fewest
number in the entire history of the Broadway theater,'' said Rocco
Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway
theaters. ``Granted they are of a high quality. If you feel like I
do that the play is the lifeblood of the Broadway theater, that's a
very worrisome statistic.''
   If production was down, ticket prices were up. The $50 ticket
for a musical is now the norm rather than the exception. A $40 top
ticket for a play on weekend nights is also not unusual with such
productions as ``M. Butterfly,'' ``Macbeth'' and ``Broadway Bound''
charging that amount. The average paid admission, according to the
league, was $31.10, up from $29.86 for the previous season.
   Wachtel was optimistic about the 1988-89 season. Among the
possibilities are several big musicals including ``Legs Diamond''
starring Peter Allen and a revival of ``The Merry Widow'' starring
Cleo Laine, as well as two Neil Simon comedies.
   ``In terms of attendance, I think we will do very well because
the last three weeks have been extraordinary,'' Wachtel said. ``We
have the momentum to keep going. A lot of that may be tourism, the
weakness of the dollar. The pickup we usually get from tourism
during the summer is happening earlier.''
   Landesman said he wants to see theatergoers attending more than
just the big musical hits like ``Phantom'' or ``Les Miserables.''
   ``I'd like to see more people spread out among more
productions,'' said Landesman. ``Because the producing situation is
so tough now, a lot of things don't go to Broadway unless they are
proven or established. You want to have a situation where there are
a lot of things going on _ some good, some bad and some ugly.''

<TEXT>
   With opening arguments in former Gov. Evan
Mecham's criminal trial just hours away, the Arizona Supreme Court
was deciding today whether to let them begin.
   Attorneys for Mecham and his brother, Willard, made a
last-minute bid Wednesday for dismissal of charges that they
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The high court was asked to otherwise return the charges to a
state grand jury or delay the trial so the justices could consider
the matter further.
   The court was expected to issue a decision before today's
scheduled start of opening arguments in Maricopa County Superior
Court.
   The Mechams' attorneys argued Wednesday before the Supreme Court
that the grand jury that indicted the pair Jan. 8 was lied to and
was discouraged from calling witnesses or reviewing transcripts of
earlier testimony.
   Assistant Attorney General William Schafer III countered that
the grand jurors were neither misled nor discouraged from seeking
any information they wanted.
   Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon Jr., who presided over the state
Senate trial that resulted in the first-term Republican governor's
impeachment, did not participate in Wednesday's proceeding.
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 because of his Senate
conviction on two unrelated impeachment charges.
   He faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six counts
of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. Willard
Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar
counts and up to 9{ years in prison if convicted.
   Lower courts have refused previous defense motions to dismiss or
remand the charges for a new determination of probable cause.
   Mecham long has contended the $350,000 loan in 1986 from Tempe
developer Barry Wolfson was properly reported as part of a $465,000
lump sum that was listed as a contribution from himself.
   Accountant Roger Brown told a lower court Tuesday he testified
before the grand jury that the $465,000 was the only instance in
which contributions from different sources on different days were
lumped together on financial reports.
   ``That man lied before the grand jury,'' Mecham's attorney,
Michael Scott, told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   Willard Mecham's attorney, Joe Keilp, said there were other
instances in his client's ``primitive, manual bookkeeping system''
where various contributions were lumped together.
   Schafer responded that Brown had said those were contributions
made either from the same source or on the same day. ``There are no
inaccuracies'' in Brown's testimony, he said.
   Keilp argued there was a ``continuous pattern of prosecutorial
manipulation of the jurors, misinstruction, misdirection,
usurpation of power and subtle intimidation of a brand-new and
inexperienced grand jury.''
   He said the jurors were discouraged from reading the more than
500 pages of transcripts of testimony heard by a previous grand
jury.
   Scott told the high court that one juror asked why they had not
heard testimony from Wolfson or Mecham's former chief of staff, Jim
Colter. Another asked how they should go about calling a witness,
Scott said.
   ``Those questions were not answered by the prosecution. They
were deflected,'' Scott said.
   Schafer said no juror specifically asked prosecutors to call any
witness.

   Leonard didn't stand tall when he patrolled
his owner's car lot office, but Reggie Roberts says the 7-foot-long
boa constrictor was the best guard he ever had.
   Somebody broke the office window Sunday, and Leonard is gone.
   ``I'm just 99 percent sure somebody stole my snake,'' Roberts
said Wednesday. ``I don't know why they did it.''
   Roberts, who owns T.R. Roberts Motors, is offering a $100 reward
for the return of his pet reptile.
   ``I won't ask any questions,'' he said. ``I just want my snake
back. I miss the little fellow.''
   He hopes Leonard will be found. The ``Beware! Guard Snake on
Duty'' sign remains posted on the business' door.
   Leonard was kept in a temperature-controlled glass showcase
during the day so as not to scare customers. But at night the
creature, which Roberts describes as ``just a big baby,'' was given
the run of the office.
   Roberts bought the snake, who is about 8 years old, when the
previous owner's landlady objected to Leonard as a tenant. He's had
the snake nearly a year.
   ``I've had him long enough to get good and attached to him,''
Roberts said.

   The California Cuties will take on convicts at
Waupun state prison, but the comedy softball team won't be playing
in drag, officials say.
   ``If they can't do it in men's clothing, in regular clothing,
then we should cancel it,'' state Division of Corrections
Administrator Stephen E. Bablitch said Wednesday.
   The Cuties, four men who usually dress in women's attire for a
seven-inning comedy game, are scheduled to play an inmate team June
15 at the maximum-security prison.
   However, convicted murderer Harlan C. Richards complained,
saying it was ``sick and disgusting'' to have ``transvestite
baseball players in here to entertain us.''
   Jess Palacios, part-owner of the Cuties, said the team would
play in men's clothes if necessary, but the humor would not be the
same.
   ``The comedy part is that they dress up in women's clothes,''
Palacios said. He said the show had no sexual overtones. ``It's

   A Brown University poll found that
nearly half those surveyed believe dealers in ``crack'' cocaine
should be executed.
   About half of the 345 adults contacted in the telephone survey
this spring believed the death penalty would be appropriate for
certain situations.
   The percentages ranged from 47 percent support for the death
penalty for a drug dealer who sells crack to a user to 59 percent
for capital punishment for a person who kills seven people after
being fired from a job.
   Sixty-four percent said they approve of the death penalty, and
only 29 percent disapproved, compared with 43 percent approval and
51 percent disapproval in 1985.
   Rhode Island has no death penalty.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines jumbo jet with 200 people
aboard made a safe emergency landing at Midway Island after a fire
warning light malfunctioned, an airline spokesman said.
   The Boeing 747 jetliner landed Wednesday around 2:30 p.m. HST
(8:30 p.m. EDT) on a flight from Honolulu to Tokyo, said Douglas
Killian, Northwest's manager of public affairs in Tokyo.
   There was no fire and the problem was determined to be a faulty
fire indicator light for the cargo hold, Killian said in a
telephone interview.
   Midway Island, controlled by the U.S. Navy, is 1,150 miles
northwest of Honolulu.
   A mechanic was flying to Midway from Honolulu to install new
fire extinguishers, which were activated when the light went on,
Killian said.
   Flight 9's arrival at Narita Airport was expected to be delayed
by about 16 hours, he said. During the delay here, the 185
passengers and 15 crew members were being accomodated at the naval
station, Killian said.

   Share prices rose across the board Thursday on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange while the dollar also scored a sharp gain
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the exchange's
main barometer, gained 165.45 points to close at 27,869.36, 0.59
percent higher than Wednesday's close.
   The dollar also rose 0.33 yen to end the day's trading at 125.68
yen.
   ``The situation in New York is encouraging investors,'' said a
broker at a major securities firm who requested anonymity. ``But
investors' concern over inflation and rising interest rates also
remains strong, and it is keeping share prices from skyrocketing.''
   Earlier in the day the index soared to 27,930.58 points, but
profit-taking by investors brought the index back down, traders
said.
   Volume on the first section was 1.3 billion shares. Securities
and marine transports were being sought, while banks were weak.

and fingers about a month ago and called a family doctor, whom she
did not identify.
   ``He and I felt at that time it was just stress,'' she said,
adding that her symptoms worsened in recent weeks.
   A preliminary diagnosis Mrs. Dukakis received in California last
week indicated she has two herniated cervical disks in the neck
area. She was in California campaigning for her husband.

<HEAD>Mental Health Advocates Sue Dukakis, Say Budget Cuts
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mental health advocates have filed suit against
Democratic presidential front-runner Gov. Michael Dukakis and his
top budget officer.
   The suit, filed Wednesday with the state Supreme Court by the
Alliance for the Mentally Ill contends that spending cuts ordered
to balance the state budget were unconstitutional and would delay
community placement of state hospital patients.
   Dukakis, whose state budget problems have become an issue in his
presidential campaign, has said the past three years have seen
``the most significant expansion in the history of the state'' in
spending for the mentally ill.
   No hearing date was set.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who suspended his
bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in April, says he
won't try to sway actions at the Democratic National Convention
next month.
   ``I would hope that the platform would reflect the kind of
approach I've recommended,'' Gore said Wednesday on a swing through
his home state.
   ``I think there has already been a shift toward the center on
the part of the other candidates (Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson) as a result of our campaign.''
   Gore, 40, still holds a block of about 400 delegates to the

   Gov. Terry Branstad and Sen. Charles
Grassley, often at odds with each other, say they will join forces
to run George Bush's Iowa presidential campaign.
   Branstad and Grassley formally announced their decision at a
Statehouse news conference Wednesday, saying that gives the vice
president a chance at carrying the state in November though ``we
know it won't be easy.''
   ``We can carry Iowa in November,'' Branstad said.
   ``There should be no doubt any more'' that the state's
Republican Party is united after an often-fractious campaign for
the Feb. 8 precinct caucuses, said Grassley.
   Grassley was a prominent backer of Kansas Sen. Bob Dole during
that caucus campaign, while Branstad was neutral.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Yeltsin Faces Review For Leadership Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev says his former protege,
Boris N. Yeltsin, will be summoned to explain why he criticized the
ruling Communist Party's No. 2 man, Yegor K. Ligachev, in
interviews with Western news media.
   ``We in the Central Committee must ask Comrade Yeltsin and
request explanations: what is he talking about and what is Comrade
Yeltsin after? It means his opinion differs from that of the
Central Committee of the party,'' the Soviet leader said Wednesday.
   Gorbachev's remarks continued an unprecedented public airing of
discord in the Soviet leadership, which tries its best to present a
unified image on domestic and foreign policy.
   The comments were a sensation not only for the foreign reporters
who solicited them at a news conference, but also for the millions
of Soviets who watched the session live on Soviet television and on
tape late at night.
   Asked about Yeltsin's call for Ligachev's resignation in a
British Broadcasting Corp. television interview Monday, Gorbachev
said:
   ``As for Comrade Ligachev and his resignation: no such problem
exists either in the Central Committee or in the Politburo, and
that's it. You may proceed from this assumption.''
   Yeltsin, 57, was ousted as Moscow party boss in November and
from the ruling Politburo in February after he made an angry speech
during a meeting of the party's 300-member policy-making Central
Committee.
   In an unexpected twist, Yeltsin told ABC News on Tuesday and CBS
News on Wednesday that he had not called for Ligachev's resignation.
   ``I simply said that in the style of work of Comrade Ligachev,
there are certain aspects with which I disagree,'' he told CBS.
``That is true particularly on the social problems. And that was
it. And there was no talk of his (Ligachev's) departure.''
   He added: ``Comrade Ligachev is in the Politburo and I'm
convinced he will stay in the Politburo, undoubtedly.''
   In the BBC interview, Yeltsin said Ligachev should step down
``because processes in the party are too slow, because the party is
still lagging behind, because the process of democratization is not
developing ... and Comrade Ligachev is the main person
responsible.''
   Gorbachev forcefully sought to quell rumors of friction between
himself and Ligachev, believed to head a conservative faction on
the Politburo. Ligachev, 67, oversees Communist Party ideology.
   Responding to a question from a British journalist, Gorbachev
said Wednesday that he had neither seen the interviews nor read a
text of them.
   ``We plan to talk with Comrade Yeltsin because he is a member of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party,'' he said.
   Gorbachev offered some details of the Oct. 21 Central Committee
meeting at which Yeltsin gave a speech leading to his ouster.
   Besides Yeltsin, 27 other committee members spoke, said
Gorbachev, and ``the opinion of all 27 speakers was that the
generalizations made by Comrade Yeltsin regarding the Central
Committee, its secretariarat and the Politburo were wrong, and his
statement was recognized as being politically erroneous.''
   The towering, white-haired man was fired Nov. 11 as Moscow party
chief, removed Feb. 18 as a candidate, or non-voting Politburo
member, and stripped May 4 of his job on the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, the country's parliament.
   His current post is first deputy chairman of the State Building
Committee.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev have sent their Geneva representatives agreements on a
couple of thorny issues to serve as a catalyst for framing an arms
treaty they were unable to write at the summit.
   One settles part of the dispute over cruise missiles carried on
airplanes, the other sets the stage for keeping track of elusive
mobile missiles.
   The two weapons would be part of a Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START) to reduce overall U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals
by 30 to 50 percent. How to verify that no weapons were hidden and
retained is one of the hard-to-resolve issues still on the table.
   The ``substantial additional common ground'' cited in a windup
summit communique included counting all existing long-range
air-launched cruise missiles as nuclear weapons and distinguishing
between bombers that carry them and those that do not.
   On mobile missiles, the two sides agreed to restrict them to
designated territories so they could be counted more easily. But
the dimensions of the areas were not set.
   Edward L. Rowny, the senior U.S. arms control adviser, said
there was a ``lot of room'' before the issues are completely
settled.
   And he said ``we didn`t get anywhere'' on two other problems _
monitoring cruise missiles aboard warships and persuading the
Soviets that the U.S. anti-missile research program can be squared
with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   ``I would hope that before the year is out that we could
eliminate the differences that still exist,'' Reagan said, although
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.
   Gorbachev told reporters ``it is still possible to sign an
agreement in this administration.'' Reagan said, ``Conversations
are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say
progress is still being made or we wouldn't be talking as we are.''
   He has less than eight months remaining in office. And he told
Gorbachev at the outset of their talks that the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative was not on the bargaining table.
   Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched ahead
on other arms control issues.
   They exchanged ratification protocols for the Intermediate
Nuclear Force pact to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles,
which was signed at the Washington summit last December.
   During the summit, Gorbachev and Reagan also signed two lesser
arms control agreements, one requiring at least 24 hours' advance
notification before ballistic missile tests and another to tighten
verification procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to
150 kilotons.
   On the START treaties, U.S. officials said they had restated
opposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles.
   ``It is the position of the United States that such missiles
should be banned unless the United States and the Soviet Union can
reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective
verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear
weapons carried by such missiles,'' U.S. officials said in a
briefing paper for reporters.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has offered to
apologize to Washington if an international forum determines that
an expelled U.S. diplomat was acting within diplomatic guidelines
when he met an opposition leader.
   Lee told Parliament on Wednesday that allegations the United
States meddled in Singapore politics should not be allowed to harm
long-term relations beween the two countries.
   He said his country was ``not condemning the criminal designs of
an enemy, but regretting the misdemeanors of a friend.''
   The tone of Lee's comments contrasted with the often strident
rhetoric in earlier Parliament sessions. Deputy Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong on Tuesday threatened to cut the number of diplomats in
the U.S. Embassy unless Washington mended its ways.
   Lee referred to E. Mason Hendrickson, former first secretary of
the embassy's political section, who the government asked to leave
early last month. Hendrickson was accused of encouraging several
lawyers to run against the governing People's Action Party in the
next general election.
   Washington rejected the allegations, insisting that
Hendrickson's actions were within accepted diplomatic bounds and in
turn expelled a Singapore diplomat of equivalent rank from the
United States.
   On Wednesday, Lee suggested a neutral committee of three experts
in international law be named to determine whether Hendrickson and
three State Department officials ``acted legitimately as diplomats
or whether they have interfered in the internal affairs of
Singapore.''
   If the committee determines that Hendrickson and the State
Department officials were acting with normal diplomatic guidelines,
Lee said ``Singapore will withdraw its protest and apologize to the
State Department.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gong declined to comment on Lee's
remarks.
   Lee said his country's senior diplomats in the United States say
that many State Department officials would prefer this island
republic of 2.6 million people ``move from what they consider to be
an authoritarian political system, based on consensus, to a
pluralistic democracy, based on a multi-party system as found in
the West.
   ``Therefore, State Department officials have criticized
Singapore as not moving forward in liberalizing and democratizing
as in Taiwan and Korea ... I am only too aware of how very
different we are from Korea and Taiwan. Singapore does not have one
race, one language, one culture and nearly one religion. We are
multiracial, even though our 75 percent Chinese were originally
from East Asia.''
   Lee said he took full responsibility for the re-arrests last
month of eight dissidents originally detained a year ago without
charge as well as the arrest of two lawyers involved in the
dissidents' cases, and the ouster of Hendrickson.
   Singapore alleged that Hendrickson and the State Department
officials had dealings with a lawyer, Francis Seow.
   Seow, 59, a former solicitor general and president of the Law
Society, was arrested on May 6. He had been representing several of
the dissidents.

<HEAD>Mom Sees Last Surviving Son Graduate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, Martha Chappel has had the desire
to see one of her four boys make it to graduation day.
   Her wish came true Wednesday night. Her only surviving son,
Willie Jackson, received his ``completion certificate'' from Cold
Spring School, a school for mentally and physically handicapped
children.
   A rare disease, Hunter's Syndrome, killed her three other sons
before they could graduate.
   ``I'm so excited I can hardly stand it,'' said Mrs. Chappel, who
swore never to send her children to an institution after she saw
the life her brother endured in one.
   The fatal, inherited disorder causes mental retardation and
physical abnormalities such as dwarfism, deafness, heart defects
and arthritic joint pain. There is no cure or therapy for the
disease, which affects only males.
   Willie, who also has the disease, is a dwarf, moderately
retarded and deaf in one ear.
   The life expectancy of children with Hunter's is 15 years.
Willie is 18.
   ``He's gone against the odds already. This boy has been so close
to death you could almost see it, but he's so strong,'' said his
stepfather, Waller Chappel.
   Mrs. Chappel's son Adrian died when he was 5 in 1976, followed
by Eddie in 1979 at age 15 and Ernie in 1981 at age 18.
   Graduation day was a big event at the Chappels' white frame
house on the city's west side.
   When Willie arrived home from school Wednesday, his main
interest was the graduation cake.
   ``I want the cake now,'' he repeatedly told his mother after
sitting on the couch, waiting patiently for almost two hours.
   Mrs. Chappel didn't know her first two boys had Hunter's until
after Willie was born.
   ``I kept thinking I'll have a girl and I'll tell her not to have
children. I've always wanted a lot of kids. That's been my goal
since I was little,'' she said.
   Mrs. Chappel is not bitter. She says she feels fortunate in many
ways to have been blessed with four loving boys and caring friends
and relatives.
   ``Willie hugs me and tells me he loves me. They all have taught
me so much,'' she said.
   Because of the disease, Willie has a small esophagus, which
causes difficulty in breathing. He tires easily and can walk only
about a half block at a time, so she sometimes must carry him.
   Willie's future might be brief, but Mrs. Chappel said she'll
continue doing everything she can to make him happy. ``He'll be
home with me until I die or he dies. Willie's time is my time.''
   She hopes he can enroll in a day adult program for the
handicapped so he can continue socializing and being around people.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Ray Blanton, who served two
years in federal prison on conspiracy and extortion convictions,
moved to resurrect his political career by filing to run for
Congress.
   Blanton on Wednesday filed a qualifying petition for the 8th
Congressional District seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Ed
Jones. Blanton became the fifth Democrat in the race.
   The qualifying deadline for all state candidates running in the
Aug. 4 primary or the Nov. 8 general election was noon today.
   Blanton, who represented much of the same west Tennessee area in
the old 7th Congressional District from 1967 to 1973, was governor
from 1975 to 1979.
   In 1981, he was convicted of conspiracy, extortion and mail
fraud in the issuance of 12 state liquor licenses while he was
governor in 1976. He was released from prison in 1986.
   Last October, his citizenship rights, including the right to run
for public office, were restored by state Circuit Judge Harry
Lester.
   U.S. Judge Bailey Brown of Memphis, an appellate judge who
presided at Blanton's trial, granted his December 1987 petition to
vacate the mail fraud counts against him. The former governor is
appealing the conspiracy and extortion counts.
   The other Democratic candidates are Mayor Bob Conger of Jackson,
Charles McCright of Dyersburg, Ivy Scarbrough of Humboldt and state
Rep. John Tanner of Union City. Republican candidates include Dan
Campbell of Memphis and Ed Bryant and Richard Jacobs, both of
Jackson.

   Martin Mull has sent a $75 check to Mayor
William H. Hudnut as atonement for a putdown of the Hoosier capital
attributed to the comedian in a magazine.
   The $75 was prorated from the $1,500 Mull received for the story
in Philip Morris magazine titled, ``Why Baseball is Better than
Football,'' in which the first of his 20 reasons was, ``I'll never
have to go to Indianapolis.''
   Mull, who appears in commercials for a downtown Indianapolis
shopping mall, later issued a tongue-in-cheek apology in which he
said he meant to say Annapolis, ``because who in their right mind
would want to go to Annapolis?''
   Dennis Callahan, mayor of Maryland's state capital, then
demanded an explanation from Melvin Simon & Associates, the
development company that owns Claypool Court mall and uses Mull in
its commercials.
   Simon said he was ``bewildered'' by Mull's statements, that the
comedian did not speak for the company and that his future use in
commercials was under review.
   Meanwhile, the check arrived in the mail Wednesday, and Hudnut
endorsed it to St. Nicholas Youth Center, an Indianapolis
organization favored by Simon.
   Indianapolis is home of the National Football League's Colts but
does not have a major league baseball franchise.

   Jesse Jackson kicked off his final campaign
swing through California with a visit to the Watts ghetto, where he
told a rally, ``I'm a man of the people.''
   ``Where you struggle I will struggle,'' Jackson said to a few
hundred people who gathered Wednesday in Will Rogers Park and
cheered his every phrase.
   In the face of his fading prospects to win the Democratic
presidential nomination, Jackson urged people to vote for him next
Tuesday, the last day of the primary season.
   But Jackson also leaned heavily on his anti-drug, anti-violence
message and themes of hope that go beyond his presidential campaign.
   Today, in what promised to be a dramatic encounter, Jackson was
meeting with members of the rival Crips and Bloods gangs. Campaign
aides said they believed it would be the first time the rival gang
leaders got together.
   ``As a grown man, I will never be afraid of children. I will
talk with you anywhere,'' Jackson told the Watts rally.
   In his speeches Wednesday, Jackson also criticized Reagan's
comments in the Soviet Union about American Indians in which the
president referred to the ``primitive'' conditions in which they
live and said some got rich off oil.
   Jackson called Reagan's remarks ill-informed and ``an affront to
all Americans.''
   Jackson said U.S. policy toward native Americans has lacked a
key ingredient of ``profound and sustained respect '' for them.
   Jackson also said President Reagan made a mistake in saying that
the lack of human rights in the Soviet Union is more a matter of
bureaucracy than policy.
   ``Mr. Reagan is caught up in the romance of Russia, not the
reality,'' Jackson said in response to a reporter's question about
Reagan's characterization of the human rights problem in the Soviet
Union during his fourth summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Jackson said that Reagan's assessment was ``an error in his
judgment.''
   ``The lack of human rights in the Soviet Union, the lack of
freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of immigration is a
matter of policy, it is not just a matter of bureacracy.''
   ``I hope Mr. Reagan will not make anymore errors of that
magnitude,` he told reporters.
   Jackson was spending the night with a single mother and her
three children who live in the Nickerson Gardens housing project of
Watts.
   `I'm going to stay in Nickerson Gardens tonight because I'm a
man of the people,` he said.
   But first he attended a Hollywood fund-raiser featuring Kris
Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Martin Sheen, Helen Reddy, Rita
Coolidge and other performers.
   As Tuesday's primary nears, with California offering the largest
delegate prize in the country, the Jackson campaign is launching
its $700,000 TV ad blitz for the final days of the campaign,
featuring four Spanish-language ads and three English ads developed
for California.
   Some of the ads began airing Tuesday, others will start today.
   Campaign spokeswoman Pam Smith said the campaign has bought
$60,000 worth of TV and radio time for the Spanish ads, hoping to
cut into the popularity front-runner Michael Dukakis enjoys among
California's large Hispanic population.
   Polls in California have shown Jackson far behind Dukakis, who
is on the verge of sewing up the nomination, but Jackson insisted
Wednesday that he can win the state and urged voters not to be led
to thinking their vote won't count.
   Jackson also vowed to go to the Democratic convention in Atlanta
this summer and fight for his platform goals. He said some have
termed his proposals radical, but that ``I'm not going to change my
plan just because you put a label on it.''
   Jackson also said he had telephoned his rival with good wishes
for Kitty Dukakis, who entered a Boston hospital Wednesday night
for tests after a preliminary diagnosis of herniated discs in the
neck area.
   Jackson said he reached the governor instead of his wife, but
said they did not discuss the vice presidency or anything
politically significant.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus May Have Infected Human Ancestors 20 Million Years Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A predecessor of the AIDS virus could have
infected primitive human ancestors more than 20 million years ago
and evolved as modern humans evolved, researchers say.
   A determination of the entire genetic code, or sequence, of an
AIDS virus found in an African green monkey suggests that the virus
did not jump recently from monkeys to humans, the researchers said
in an article published today in Nature, the British scientific
journal.
   Some researchers have suggested that these monkeys may have been
the source of the human AIDS virus.
   A team led by Masanori Hayami of the University of Tokyo found
that the African green monkey AIDS virus differed from the two
known human AIDS viruses in several important respects.
   If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times,
the viruses would be identical or nearly so, said Carel Mulder, a
biologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in
Worcester.
   ``It is impossible that humans were infected in any recent time
with this virus,'' Mulder said in a telephone interview.
   The Japanese researchers and Mulder say that the evidence now
suggests that each species could have its own version of the AIDS
virus.
   Two AIDS viruses have been identified in humans. They could have
evolved in isolated populations in different places, the Japanese
researchers reported.
   Humans and monkeys are descendants of primitive primates that
may have lived 20 million to 30 million years ago. The Japanese
researchers believe that an AIDS-like virus infected those
primitive primates.
   As those creatures evolved into humans and various species of
monkeys, the parent AIDS virus evolved into the different forms
seen today, the researchers speculated.
   No AIDS virus is known in apes, which are more closely related
to humans than are monkeys.
   Dr. Norman Letvin, a primate specialist at the Harvard Medical
School, said of the Japanese research, ``This is yet another piece
of data in support of what I think should now be accepted _ that a
jump of the virus did not occur.''
   Asked why the virus has only recently been observed to cause
disease, Letvin said that it could have existed for a long time
only in isolated populations, and that it might also have evolved
into its present disease-causing form in comparatively recent times.
   The virus that Hayami and his colleagues studied was isolated
from a wild African green monkey obtained in Kenya. Their
determination, or sequencing, of the virus's genetic code shows
that it lacks some genetic material carried by the human AIDS
viruses.
   The two human AIDS viruses are HIV-1, which is almost
exclusively responsible for the worldwide epidemic of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, and HIV-2, which is mostly limited to
West Africa but is now slowly beginning to spread.
   Researchers disagree over whether HIV-2 causes disease.
   The African green monkey virus lacks the so-called ``R'' gene
present in HIV-1 and HIV-2, the Japanese researchers report. In
addition, the African green monkey virus does not appear to make
monkeys sick.
   Researchers are trying to determine the function of the R gene,
Mulder said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today invoked an obscure Russian
proverb in his farewell to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Mr. General Secretary, if you will permit me just one more
proverb,'' Reagan said. ``I think a very old and popular saying you
have here about last Sunday, the day of our arrival, spoke to the
promise we have seen fulfilled at this summit in this Moscow
spring.''
   Then, in halting Russian, the president said, ``Troitsa _ ves
les postroitsya.''
   Literally, the proverb translates into English as ``Holiday of
the Trinity _ and the whole forest will blossom.''
   This is a reference to the old Russian Orthodox holiday of
Trinity, celebrated on the last Sunday in May, and the fact that
birch trees _ a symbol of Russia _ are green then, auguring a good
summer.
   Reagan arrived in Moscow on May 29, the last Sunday of the month.

<HEAD>Kidney-Sharing Successful, Essential, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether they're shipped across town or across the
country, transplanted kidneys work equally well in patients
following surgery, dispelling arguments that widespread
organ-sharing deflates short-term success, experts say.
   ``The main gain is in the long term'' because of the ability to
provide better-matched kidneys for patients, said Dr. Paul
Terasaki, professor of surgery at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
   For patients extremely sensitive to donor organs, sharing is
their only hope for a successful kidney transplant, said Terasaki,
who keeps an international kidney transplant registry.
   ``You can't find a perfect match'' unless you have access to
numerous organs, he said Wednesday at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Transplant Physicians and the American Society
of Transplant Surgeons.
   Some transplant doctors say shipping donor kidneys to the best
possible candidate damages the organs because of the increased
amount of time outside the body. Others, including Terasaki,
contend all kidneys should be shared because of the vastly improved
results when the tissue of the donor and recipient is matched as
closely as possible.
   Since last fall, the nation's transplant centers and organ
procurement agencies have had to share kidneys in which all six
antigens, or genetic markers, have been identified and perfectly
matched with a potential recipient. The so-called ``six-antigen''
organs account, however, for only a tiny fraction of the total
number of kidneys donated.
   Terasaki said he analyzed 6,250 kidney transplants to determine
whether early success rates were compromised by how far the organs
were sent.
   Of the total, 2,338 organs remained in the hospital where they
were procured and 1,422 were shared within 50 miles, Terasaki said.
The remaining 2,490 were sent more than 50 miles away.
   The transplanted kidneys that were not transported at all
functioned immediately after surgery in 85.7 percent of the cases,
compared with 74.4 percent of those shared within 50 miles and 83.5
percent in those sent farther, Terasaki said.
   A year after surgery, the transplanted kidneys were functioning
in 79 percent of the cases that involved no sharing, Terasaki said.
Seventy-eight percent of the locally shared kidneys were working
properly, as well as 76 percent of the kidneys shared over greater
distances.
   Long-term success was considerably better in kidneys that were
shared and transplanted into the best-matched candidates than in
those that were not shared and poorly matched, according to
Terasaki.
   Dr. John McDonald, president of the American Society of
Transplant Surgeons, said Terasaki's findings hopefully will end
the debate over whether kidneys should be shared.
   ``I think the argument not to put kidneys in the patients who
are the best match gets weaker and weaker. I don't really think you
can support that very much longer on scientific grounds,'' McDonald
said.
   About 13,000 people are awaiting kidney transplants in the
United States. Virtually all awaiting are on dialysis.
   About half are considered highly sensitive to transplants
because of a previous transplant, pregnancy, blood transfusion or
other circumstances that result in an unusually large amount of
cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream, said Dr. Lawrence G.
Hunsicker, president of the American Society of Transplant
Physicians. The group includes twice as many women as men.
   As many as a fourth of the approximately 6,500 patients
considered sensitized, in fact, are not because of an antibody
known as IgM that sometimes is misidentified in blood tests as an
anti-transplant substance, Terasaki said. The patients consequently
are passed over for kidney transplants since doctors presume their
chances are poor.
   ``They're waiting unnecessarily,'' Terasaki said.

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Closes At Record High, Dollar Posts Moderate Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices closed at a record high on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today, while the dollar posted a moderate gain
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 165.45
points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 27,869.36. The previous high
for Tokyo's main economic barometer was set on May 17 when the
Nikkei closed at 27,819.98.
   The index skyrocketed in early trading, momentarily touching
27,930.58, but lost momentum after investors started selling shares
for profit-taking toward the end of the morning session, brokers
said.
   ``There is growing concern for inflation and rising interest
rates,'' said a broker at a major securities firm. ``The market
slowed down from late morning to the early afternoon session, but
it regained strength toward the end of the day's trading,'' he
added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume today totaled 1.9 billion shares, with 1.3 billion traded
this morning.
   Meanwhile, the dollar rose 0.33 yen from its 125.35-yen
Wednesday finish to close at 125.68 yen. It had started the day at
125.50 yen and traded mainly between 125.48-125.78 yen.
   Traders said bullishness prevailed in the market throughout the
day, but gains in the dollar for the past four days had investors
worried.
   They added that the U.S. currency's strength against the
Japanese yen has been fueled mainly through profit-taking by
investors.
   `Ahead of the unemployment rate release scheduled for tomorrow
(Friday) in the U.S., market players sold the yen at the current
favorable rate,'' said Hiroaki Shukuzawa of Sumitomo Bank.

<HEAD>Britain Loses `Spycatcher' Case _ And A Heap Of Money With It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government today lost a
two-year court battle to stop a former intelligence officer from
publishing his memoirs in Australia and was ordered to pay an
estimated $900,000 in legal costs.
   In a unanimous decision, the High Court of Australia finally
rejected the British government's attempt to stop publication of
the book ``Spycatcher'' by Peter Wright, a 20-year veteran of the
MI-5 counter-espionage service.
   Arguing that Britain's catch-all Official Secrets Act committed
Wright to life-long secrecy, Britain also sought to seize profits
from sales of the book.
   Unspecified legal costs, estimated by lawyers at more than
$900,000, were awarded to Wright's publisher by the Canberra court,
which upheld lower court decisions that had all favored the
publisher.
   Wright, 73, was delighted and planning a ``quiet celebration''
on his horse farm in Tasmania, said his lawyer, Malcolm Turnbull.
   Britain's deputy high commissioner in Canberra, Malcolm Dougal,
told Independent Radio News after the hearing: ``We still believe
that a crown servant has a duty of obligation, a duty of
confidentiality to the government. We are naturally disappointed.''
   Dougal told the British network that it was up to London to
consider whether to continue the fight in other countries.
   ``Spycatcher'' has been banned in Britain and colonial Hong Kong
by government legal action. Another hearing in the continuing fight
to maintain the ban in Britain takes place before House of Lords
judges on June 13.
   Despite the bans, the book has sold more than 1.4 million copies
worldwide and 250,000 copies in Australia.
   Carol Bennetto, spokeswoman for Octopus Publishing Group, which
controls Wright's publishers, Heinemann, said in London today:
   ``When this all started almost three years ago we were worried
that Peter would never see the fruit of his labors being published
because he has been so ill. It is delightful that he now can.''
   Wright's book, easily available in Britain in U.S.-published
copies, describes how the British intelligence community bugged and
burgled its way around London, snooping on individuals, politicians
and foreign embassies.
   It alleges that right-wing intelligence officers plotted in the
1970s to destabilize the Labor government of then Prime Minister
Harold Wilson.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons that
the book threatened national security, but Wright said he hadn't
revealed any secrets jeopardizing Britain.
   In its ruling, the court said the British government had not
sought to enforce private rights or private interests in a foreign
state.
   It said Britain's primary interest had been to ensure the
continued secrecy of MI-5's operations and to protect national
security.
   The judges said it was tempting to suggest that because of the
close relationship between Britain and Australia an exception
should be made to enable Britain to enforce its law in Australian
courts.
   But, the court said, ``there are no manageable standards by
which courts can resolve such an issue and its determination would
inevitably present a risk of embarrassment in Australia's relations
with other countries.''

<HEAD>U.S. Pregnancy, Abortion Rates Higher Than Many Industrialized
Countries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. women have higher rates of unplanned
pregnancies and abortions than women in many other industrialized
countries, according to a study.
   The study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based
organization that examines fertility issues, also found that U.S.
women relied more on abortion and less on contraception to limit
births than women in most other Western nations.
   U.S. women of reproductive age averaged 2.56 pregnancies and
0.76 abortions, according to the study. Only Greece and Ireland
showed higher pregnancy rates, at 4.33 and 3.23, respectively,
among the nations studied.
   Greece also had a higher abortion rate, 2.24, as did Italy,
0.80. The study, of all countries in Western Europe plus Australia,
New Zealand, Canada and the United States, appears in the current
issue of the institute's Family Planning Perspectives.
   The lowest pregnancy rates were in West Germany, with 1.64, and
the Netherlands, with 1.68. The lowest abortion rates were in
Ireland, with 0.15, and the Netherlands, with 0.18.
   Abortion is outlawed in Ireland and Belgium, although abortions
are still relatively easy to to obtain in Belgium, the researchers
said.
   The study found that 51.2 percent of pregnancies in the United
States in 1983 were unplanned, compared with 31.8 percent in Great
Britain and 17 percent in the Netherlands.
   Many contraceptives used in Europe and elsewhere are not
approved for use in the United States, said Dr. Jacqueline D.
Forrest, vice president for research of the institute. The more
contraceptive choices available, the more likely a woman will find
one that she will use consistently, she said.
   In addition, the study found that U.S. women are less likely to
use birth control pills or intrauterine devices than women in other
developed countries, Ms. Forrest said. These are the most effective
forms of birth control.
   The researchers said some method of contraception was used in
1982 by 54 percent of U.S. women between ages 15 to 44. That level
ranked low, and was similar to that of Portugal and Spain.
   Birth control techniques used by 37 percent of U.S. women
included pills, IUD or male or female sterilization, a ``medium''
level compared with the other countries. That ranking is largely
due to the widespread use of sterilization in the United States for
women older than 30, the researchers said.
   The study used the most recent data available. The U.S. abortion
rates are 1983 figures.

<TEXT>
   Powerful new X-ray beams 100 times
brighter than any ever produced are not the kind your dentist would
use, unless he wanted to look at the atoms in your teeth.
   ``These X-rays are 10 million to 100 million times more powerful
than the ones used by dentists,'' Arthur Bienenstock, director of
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory said Wednesday as he
discussed the breakthrough research.
   The intense, narrow beams achieved by the Stanford scientists,
who worked with researchers from other labs, have enormous
potential for medicine and industry, Bienenstock said.
   ``Scientists will be able to look at the structure of proteins
too small for standard techniques,'' he said. ``The modern era of
genetic engineering arises from our ability to determine atomic
arrangements in proteins.''
   The X-rays also could be used to study chemical reactions as
they occur and surfaces of everyday industrial materials subject to
corrosion or wear and tear. And they could be used to study
superconductors and semiconductors to detect defects at the
molecular level.
   ``Every order of magnitude in the qualities of a light source
results in new, in most cases unexpected, unanticipated science,''
said Herman Winick, deputy director of the lab.
   Synchrotron radiation, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by
electrons forced into curved paths by magnetic fields, is the most
powerful source of vacuum ultraviolet radiation and X-rays.
   The new X-rays, Winick said, approach the performance level
anticipated for synchrotron radiation labs in design and
construction in Europe, Japan and the United States. Scientists at
these labs, which are expected to be operating by 1995, hope to
study the molecular structure of materials and human tissue.
   ``A typical size of an atom is about 100 millionths of an
inch,'' Bienenstock said, ``and these X-rays allow you to see
arrangements on that scale.''
   The team at Stanford, which included the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, the Argonne and Brookhaven national
laboratories, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, achieved the
new X-rays during a 12-day run last December. The results were
reported recently at a meeting of the American Physical Society in
Baltimore.
   The increase in X-ray brightness was reached using a bunch of
electrons whipped at nearly the speed of light around a 1.3 mile
ring. During the December run, the ring was operated at 7.1 billion
electron volts.
   The scientists made the bunch extremely small with magnets that
focused the electrons so the X-rays appeared to be emitted almost
from a single point.
   The electrons were then sent through a wiggly path using magnets
with alternating polarity. Each time the path wiggled the electrons
gave off radiation to produce greater brightness.

   Two workers were missing today after
an explosion and fire at an industrial complex killed one person,
injured 10 others and caused the temporary evacuation of 2,000
residents, authorities said.
   The explosion occurred Wednesday afternoon at Traco Inc., a
plastics manufacturer, and the fire spread to about 20 adjoining
businesses at the Coleman Industrial Complex, said fire department
Lt. Jack Jordan.
   ``You know how roofs blow off in the cartoons? I just happened
to look out my window and the roof blew 120 feet in the air. It
threw parts everywhere,'' said Mitchell Priest, a recruit at the
nearby Great Lakes Naval Training Station.
   The industrial park in this suburb 35 miles north of Chicago
contains several paint and plastics manufacturing companies. The
fire burned toxic chemicals, including chlorine, polyvinyl chloride
and polystyrene, said Will Flower of the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency.
   At one point, 2,000 people were evacuated because of fear of
toxic fumes but they returned by 10 p.m., Jordan said. They were
advised to keep their doors and windows shut.
   The blaze was brought under control about 8:30 p.m., and three
hours later emergency crews discovered the body of an unidentified
man. Two other people, believed to be Traco employees, were
missing, Jordan said.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
   One of the injured was in serious condition suffering from
facial burns, smoke inhalation and cuts at St. Therese Medical
Center in Waukegan, said Joanne Johnson, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Nine others, including four firefighters, had less serious
injuries, hospital officials said.

   President Reagan stopped by one of America's most
hassled embassies today, saluting diplomats and staff who have
lived through a ``spy dust'' scare, Soviet bugging, alleged
security breaches by Marine guards and a fire.
   Amid it all, the blossoming of superpower relations and the
radical changes in Soviet society ushered in by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev have dramatically increased the workload of America's
official eyes and ears in the Soviet Union.
   An American diplomat said the embassy workers were grateful to
Reagan for taking the time to have breakfast with them and their
families.
   ``He has these embassy visits wherever he goes, but in Moscow in
particular he's certainly aware of the unusual difficulties we've
had,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
   The biggest jolt to the comfort and convenience of the folks at
No. 19-23 Tchaikovsky Street came Oct. 22, 1986, when the Kremlin
retaliated for U.S. expulsions of Soviet diplomats. It ordered 260
Soviets to stop cooking, cleaning, driving, translating and
answering phones at the Moscow embassy and U.S. consulate in
Leningrad.
   Diplomats had to do their own driving, cleaning and other
chores. Donna Hartman, the wife of then-Ambassador Arthur Hartman,
took over the gardening at her residence.
   ``We did what we had to do. It wasn't heroic, but it is somewhat
satisfying in knowing we survived it,'' recalled one diplomat who
mopped floors and carried supplies around the embassy for six
months.
   Gradually the embassy has bounced back, becoming a more
efficient operation by necessity.
   The diplomatic staff was cut to make room for American staff
support under a Soviet-imposed personnel ceiling of 225. The
government brought in a Los Angeles-based company, Pacific
Architects and Engineers, to run the embassy. It now has 84 support
employees.
   The diplomat said the arrangement has worked well.
   ``The Pacific Architects and Engineers people meshed in very
well,'' she said.
   But some officials traveling with Reagan say privately that the
embassy diplomats remain overworked, and haven't been concentrating
enough on their main duties: filing cables back to Washington on
what's going on in the Soviet Union. They also complain that the
embassy didn't prepare well enough for the Reagan-Gorbachev summit.
   Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert admits the staff is having
trouble coping.
   ``We need more hands. At a time when U.S.-Soviet contacts are
exploding, the number of hands is limited by other than the
personnel practices of the U.S. government,'' he said in reference
to the Soviet-imposed staff limit.
   The diplomats are feeling under extra pressure since Hartman was
succeeded by John Matlock, who is described by embassy press
officer Michael Hurley as a ``hard taskmaster.''
   The summit itself and the frequent visits by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz have been an extra load on the staff, Hurley said.
   ``These visits prevent us from doing what we're here for:
looking at Soviet society and explaining it to people back home,''
he said.
   In addition to the withdrawal of the Soviet employees, the
embassy has faced these problems in the recent years:
   _In 1985, the embassy annnounced it had found traces of a
chemical dubbed ``spy dust'' that Soviet agents were alleged to be
using to track American diplomats. It turned out the substance was
not believed to be hazardous.
   _Last spring, a scandal erupted over charges that U.S. Marine
guards had allowed Soviet agents inside secret areas of the
embassy. Many of the charges fizzled, but Marine Sgt. Clayton
Lonetree, an embassy guard in 1985 and 1986, was convicted of
espionage for giving the KGB the identities of CIA agents and the
floor plans to the U.S. embassies in Moscow and Vienna.
   _Also last spring, U.S. officials revealed that the uncompleted
$191 million new Moscow embassy office building was riddled with
hidden KGB listening devices. Government investigation panels have
recommended the top floors of the building be stripped off.
   _Fire broke out Feb. 17 in an unoccupied fifth-floor residential
section of the aging main office building. Two U.S. congressmen who
inspected the building in April of last year had called it a
``firetrap and unsafe by accepted standards for general working
conditions.''
   _And, off and on for 25 years, the Soviets have bombarded the
embassy with microwave radiation. Despite intense investigation, no
one in the American government is willing to say whether the
purpose is espionage, interference with U.S. intelligence-gathering
operations, or an attempt to affect the health, minds or behavior
of Americans working in the embassy. Low-power microwave signals
continue to be detected.

   The wife of a clothing store owner was
trying to call her husband about cracks she'd noticed in the walls
and windows when the 136-year-old brick building collapsed around
her.
   Susan Wade, who was the only person in the four-story Larry Wade
Inc. building when it collapsed Wednesday evening, suffered only
bumps and bruises, authorities said. She escaped by crawling
through what had been a storefront display window.
   ``I was talking to my son on the phone, trying to find out where
Larry was when it happened,'' Mrs. Wade said.
   ``I thought I was dead; it's awful to think you're dead.''
   The collapse tore down power lines, sparking a fire that spewed
heavy smoke and forced the evacuation of more than 100 residents
within three blocks of the building in this east-central Ohio city
of 28,500 residents.
   The evacuees, many of whom were taken to an American Red Cross
center, were allowed to go home early this morning.
   Police today said the cause of the collapse had not been
determined.
   Before the collapse, bystanders heard glass breaking in the
building and told police, who notified Mrs. Wade.
   Darlene Massey, who was in a law office across the street, said
she saw Mrs. Wade enter the building.
   Just then, a tractor-trailer rig rolled past and the building
fell apart, Ms. Massey said. The sides of the structure and part of
the front crumbled, while the back wall remained standing.
   ``It's amazing that she's alive,'' Ms. Massey said.
   The clothing store building was built in 1852. There was no
immediate estimate of the cost of the damage. The building was
purchased in 1974 for $37,500, the family said.
   Steve Wade, son of the Wades, said the building contained
offices on the second floor and a basketball court on the fourth
floor. He said the third floor ``didn't have much of anything.''

<TEXT>
   The woman who invaded a suburban school and
fatally shoot an 8-year-old boy dead and wounded six people was
being treated with an experimental drug used to control a
psychiatric disorder, blood tests found.
   Traces of the drug clomipramine _ known by the trade name
Anafrail _ were the only drug that turned up in tests performed in
conjunction with the autopsy on Laurie Dann, Cook County Medical
Examiner Robert Stein said Wednesday.
   It was unclear where she received the drug, but her psychiatrist
at the University of Wisconsin was authorized to dispense it, the
drug manufacturer said.
   On May 20, Ms. Dann, 30, walked into the Hubbard Woods
Elementary School in Winnetka, shot a boy in the bathroom and then
entered a 2nd-grade classroom and shot five other youngsters.
   She fled the school and entered a nearby home where she shot a
20-year-old man who tried to seize the gun. Later, as police
surrounded the house in the posh suburb, Ms. Dann killed herself.
   Gloria Martini, a spokeswoman for Ciba-Geigy Corp., the New
Jersey manufacturer of Anafrail, said tests of the drug were being
conducted with government approval on 1,300 adult patients at 21
centers around the country.
   The company has been selling the drug outside the United States
for treatment of people suffering from ``obsessive-compulsive
disorders,'' Ms. Martini said.
   ``Carried to the extreme, some people spend eight hours in the
shower,'' she said, noting the drug also is used to check
``repetitive thoughts of random violence.''
   Ms. Dann exhibited various symptoms of the disorder during the
last few years. Residents of an apartment complex in Madison, Wis.,
where she once lived said Ms. Dann often rode the elevator for
hours.
   Ms. Martini said the Madison psychiatrist who was treating Ms.
Dann, was participating in tests of the drug at a university clinic.
   She said the drug was effective during the first phase of
testing that ended in December, but statistical reports were still
being compiled.

<HEAD>Italian Journalist Freed From Prison After 6{ Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian journalist convicted of
espionage after entering Afghanistan with anti-communist guerrillas
was freed today after 6{ months in jail, an Italian Embassy staff
member said.
   Fausto Bililavo was granted clemency by President Najib after
President Francesco Cossiga of Italy appealed for the reporter's
freedom.
   Last week, Najib pardoned French photojournalist Alain Guillo
after receiving a similar appeal from President Francois Mitterrand
of France.
   Bilislavo, who worked for the tiny Albatross News Agency, and
Guillo, a free-lancer, entered Afghanistan separately last year
with guerrillas who are fighting the Afghan army and the Soviet
troops supporting the Najib government.
   Bilislavo left Kabul this morning in the company of an Italian
delegation that arrived in the Afghan capital earlier this week to
deliver Cossiga's letter, according to the embassy staff member,
who spoke on condtion of anonymity.
   The noncommercial Italian flight was headed directly to Rome.
The delegation was headed by Bruno Bottai, secretary-general of the
Italian foreign Ministry.
   Both Bilislavo and Guillo had been jailed at Kabul's
Pul-I-Charki prison after being found guilty of spying. Both men
denied the charges.
   Bilislavo, 24, was arrested Nov. 14. He was convicted in March
and sentenced to seven years in prison.

   A federal judge early today denied a request that
he release an anti-communist Cuban-American who was convicted in
this country as a terrorist but is considered a hero by opponents
of Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler rejected Orlando Bosch's
petition for parole after reviewing more than 700 classified and
unclassified documents.
   Hoeveler made no mention of his proposal Wednesday that Bosch be
released from jail and put under house arrest pending a government
decision on whether to expel him.
   The proposal drew immediate opposition from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   The judge said today that the government has a ``legitimate and
bona fide reason'' wanting to expel Bosch. ``The petitioner has
failed to demonstrate that the attorney general has acted in bad
faith,'' he ruled.
   Bosch has been in jail since February, when he returned to the
United States. He fled the country in 1974 while on probation for a
1968 bazooka attack on a Polish ship that had been involved in
trade with Cuba.
   His case now goes to the regional commissioner of the INS in
Dallas.
   Bosch's attorney, Hank Adorno, was expected to appeal Hoeveler's
order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   Bosch remained in custody today without bail at the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami.
   Last week, a chanting crowd of 200 Cuban-Americans gathered
outside the federal courthouse to demand his freedom.
   Hoeveler said Wednesday that his house-arrest proposal might
ensure ``domestic tranquility.''
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Kenny, representing the
INS, said releasing Bosch would ``send the wrong message to the
community.''
   ``Terrorism is terrorism, no matter how long ago it took
place,'' she said.

   Israeli human rights activists
accuse their nation's soldiers of systematic brutality in the
occupied lands and say such tactics are prolonging the
six-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   In one case, an Arab resident of this isolated village said
soldiers pelted him with rocks for two hours last month as he sat
handcuffed in a pit. Two hand-sized spots of dried blood were
visible in the pit several days later.
   In another village, Arabs alleged troops forced them to remove
roadblocks as they tried to evacuate a 15-year-old shot by soldiers
in a clash _ intentionally wasting crucial minutes of the boy's
life. The youth died the same day.
   In a third case, a 70-year-old man claimed troops threw him into
a 12-foot-deep well in his garden and closed the lid. The man, who
suffered sprained ankles and a fractured lower back, said he sat in
two feet of cold water for six hours before being rescued.
   The army said initial investigations proved the allegations in
all three cases to be unfounded, adding that soldiers were cleared
of wrong-doing.
   Army officials acknowledged that some soldiers have brutalized
Palestinians, but described these cases as ``exceptions.''
   Parliament member Dedi Zucker of the liberal Citzens Rights
Movement disagrees: ``There are too many cases to describe them as
exceptions.''
   Such incidents, he said this week, deeply affect the
Palestinians. He quoted an unnamed senior defense official as
telling legislators ``harassment and maltreatment by soldiers''
were to blame for prolonging unrest.
   Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip have
been protesting Israeli rule since Dec 8. More than 200
Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in the upheaval.
   Zucker has asked the Defense Ministry to check 10 complaints,
including three in which troops are accused of beating Arabs to
death in the Gaza Strip. And Israel's Civil Rights Associations
have forwarded 17 complaints, mainly concerning brutality.
   Neither received detailed responses, and the Justice Ministry is
now reviewing army and police investigation methods.
   One widely publicized case occurred May 18 during an army raid
of Arura. Mohammed Awad, 23, said he was arrested and handcuffed in
nearby hills, where soldiers placed him and two other villagers
into four-foot-deep stone pits.
   ``There were about 20 to 25 soldiers who pelted me and the
others with stones,'' he said in an interview at his home. After
two hours, a soldier yanked him up by his hair when he couldn't
stand up because most of his body was covered by stones, Awad said.
   Daoud Suleiman Farradni, a doctor at Ramallah Hospital who
examined Awad later that day, said the man's face, legs and waist
were swollen and covered with bruises.
   Army officials said an initial check showed no wrongdoing by
soldiers, but that an official inquiry was launched after Arabs
filed formal complaints.
   Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank military commander, visited
Arura today, where he questioned two of the Palestinians who said
they were pelted, army radio said.
   The radio said Mitzna declined to comment after he spoke to the
villagers saying ``the appropriate conclusions will be drawn by
army investigators.''
   In another case, Arabs in the West Bank village of Azmut claimed
soldiers on May 16 purposely delayed evacuation of Alaa Edin
Thabet, 15, after he was shot in the neck during a protest.
   Villager Murad Mohammed Amer, 25, was quoted by the liberal
Haaretz newspaper as saying soldiers forced him and others
transporting the youth to remove roadblocks, delaying the group for
15 minutes.
   Soldiers then allegedly took over the car to drive the wounded
youth to a military base near Nablus, where no one paid attention
to Thabet for more than a half-hour, Amer was quoted as saying.
   An army spokeswoman said ``no more than 10 minutes passed from
the time the officer got into the car until an army doctor saw the
boy.'' But she added that the boy was dead on arrival.
   The spokeswoman said Azmut residents told army investigators the
delay was caused while villagers searched for a car to evacuate
Thabet. She denied that soldiers forced those evacuating the youth
to remove roadblocks.
   The third incident took place April 26 in Tulkarem, also in the
West Bank. Subhi Yussef Abed Jarrad, 70, said soldiers threw him in
a well while he was irrigating his garden at dawn.
   Jarrad was interviewed lying on a cot in his home, a brace
around his lower back and a bandage around his right foot.
   A doctor who treated Jarrad said the injuries suggested the man
was thrown because there were no scratches on his skin.
   The army said no soldiers were in the area at the time. But an
official said Jarrad's family was involved in a feud and ``certain
evidence points to young men from another clan.''
   Army officials denied allegations they are not investigating
such claims of brutality.
   ``Many cases are difficult to investigate. There are not enough
facts, not enough witnesses,'' said an army spokeswoman. ``A lot of
Palestinians talk to journalists, but then are not willing to stand
behind the story and to talk to investigators.''
   Some allegations have proved false, as well.
   In one case, relatives of 5-year-old Yasmine Samira Ismael
claimed soldiers threw boiling water on her during a Jan. 13 raid
of the family's home in the Bureij refugee camp in Gaza.
   But Yasmine's mother later told The Associated Press the girl's
cousin accidently dropped the water on her when he became
frightened during the raid.

<TEXT>
   Rain-sodden residents began clearing muck
and debris and repairing flood damage to their homes after a
4{-foot wall of water burst through an earthen dam, forcing about
60 people to evacuate.
   The heavy thunderstorms dropped up to 14 inches of rain on
Comanche on Tuesday and early Wednesday, flooding the north-central
Texas town, briefly shutting down some highways and obliterating
the dam on 100-acre Lake Eanes.
   The town's 4,100 residents were told they could return to their
homes Wednesday morning. The sun came out Wednesday afternoon while
residents picked through the muddy debris.
   ``We've lived here 22 years, and it's never gotten this high
before,'' said Maida Godfrey, 40. ``It came up to the porch only
one other time.''
   The flood emergency was over by Wednesday night, said Hazel
Carouth of the Comanche County Sheriff's Department.
   Mrs. Godfrey pointed to grass and mud stains 4{ feet high on the
white wals of her home, which lies on Indian Creek downstream from
Lake Eanes. She estimated about $30,000 damage to her house.
   Mrs. Godfrey said she and her 18-year-old son, Sheridan, ran up
a hill to the home of Earl Wadelle, Lake Eanes' owner, around 3
a.m., near the flood's apex.
   About two hours later, she said, water surged through the middle
of the earthen dam, which was built in the 1930s. Lake Eanes was
completely drained.
   The dam on Lake Comanche, which is downstream from Lake Eanes,
held but water spilled over its lip, said Duane Ogle, a teacher at
Comanche High School where about 60 residents stayed until the
floodwaters subsided.
   Full damage estimates were not available. As much as $100,000 in
inventory at Comanche Carpet and Tile was ruined by the
floodwaters, said owner Randy Martin. ``I don't know what we're
going to do yet,'' Martin said.
   North along U.S. 377, the floodwaters blocked several
underpasses and bridges with logs and other debris. The driver of a
tractor-trailer rig reportedly swam to safety as floodwaters washed
his truck off the road.

   The woman Donna Rice claimed sold the infamous
picture of her perched on presidential hopeful Gary Hart's lap to a
supermarket tabloid a year ago says she's glad to be out of the
limelight.
   ``After a wild month of May last year, things have been quiet,''
said Lynn Armandt, who was on board the yacht ``Monkey Business''
with Hart and Rice when the photo was taken.
   ``That's in the past,'' she said, declining to talk about the
incident further. She said in an interview in today's Daily News
that she hasn't talked with Rice since then. ``I haven't talked to
Mr. Hart, either.''
   Armandt, who moved from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to New York last
year, said she is selling shoes.
   ``Sometimes (customers) make the connection when I hand them my
card,'' she said.

<HEAD>Sex Offender Submits to Court-Ordered AIDS Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted sex offender could face a more severe
sentence if he tests positive for the AIDS virus after the state
Court of Appeals refused to overturn a lower court ruling requiring
the test, a prosecutor said.
   Steven G. Farmer, a 34-year-old former flight attendant, took
the test Wednesday. He was convicted in April of two counts of
patronizing a juvenile male prostitute and two counts of sexual
exploitation of a minor.
   Deputy Prosecutor Rebecca Roe contended that Farmer knew he had
tested positive for the virus when he had contact with the two
prostitutes, including sexual intercourse with one of them.
   Jurors who convicted Farmer were not told he was believed to
have the virus for acquired immune defiency syndrome, which attacks
the body's immune system and can be transmitted through sexual
intercourse.
   On Tuesday, Court of Appeals commissioner William Ellis upheld a
May 24 Superior Court ruling that Farmer submit to the test before
his sentencing Tuesday.
   Ellis said there was a legitimate concern that Farmer, who is on
court-supervised release, would continue to engage in the same
sexual conduct.
   Defense attorney Michael Iaria appealed Ellis' decision, but a
three-judge appeals panel later upheld the ruling.
   By court order, the test results will not be made public. But
Ms. Roe has said that if Farmer tests positive for the virus, she
would use that information to argue that Farmer's conduct is an
aggravating factor that warrants a 10-year sentence.
   The standard sentencing range is between two years, seven months
and three years, seven months.
   Iaria argued the test would violate a state law barring
mandatory tests for the AIDS virus.
   However, Ellis said the law limits health officials, not judges.
   Joining Iaria's attempt to block the order were the American
Civil Liberties Union of Washington and the Washington State
Privacy Lobby.

<HEAD>Soviet Reporters Nudge Gorbachev Into Talk About Past Taboos
^An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, prodded by Soviet
journalists at his first Moscow news conference, touched on
subjects once taboo _ past Kremlin intransigence at arms control
talks and the pain endured by mothers of Soviet boys missing in
action from the Afghanistan war.
   Gorbachev's meeting with the local press on Wednesday was an
illustration of the effects of ``glasnost,'' or openness, on the
state-run media, which have traditionally served to embrace
official policy and spread it to the masses.
   Soviet newspapers and the journalists who work for them are far
from challengers or adversaries of the Kremlin leadership. But
Gorbachev's encouragement of the Soviet press to take a closer look
at the nation's problems, in hopes of speeding their resolution,
has taken hold and changed the relationship between the press and
the leadership it serves.
   It would have been unthinkable before the current reforms were
introduced in early 1985 for a Soviet journalist to even mention
the war in Afghanistan at such a public forum.
   When a correspondent for the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya
Gazeta rose to address Gorbachev, he asked about the fate of 300
Soviet soldiers reportedly taken prisoner by Afghan rebels and
forced into Pakistan.
   Without as much as a flicker of discomfort, Gorbachev responded
with the sincerity of a concerned father that ``we will do
everything so that our people return home.''
   The most delicate questions were posed by foreign reporters, who
outnumbered the Soviet journalists at the exchange by at least two
to one. The visitors also were allowed the bulk of the hour-long
question-and-answer period, when Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
I. Gerasimov selected two dozen journalists to address the leader
from the sea of 300 observers raising their hands.
   The press conference format was looser and the selection of
questioners more random than at White House press conferences,
where the seating and start of questioning is pre-ordained.
   Gorbachev deftly handled even the most sensitive queries about
his relationship with Kremlin ideologist Yegor K. Ligachev, with
whom he is reputed to be in dispute about the pace of reforms, and
the inflammatory remarks of Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow
party chief who on Monday called for Ligachev's resignation.
   The five Soviet journalists selected to pose questions asked
Gorbachev about Afghanistan, American conservatives hesitant to
improve superpower relations, the shift from Soviet to American
foot-dragging on arms control, the relationship Gorbachev will have
with the next U.S. president and the voice each nation's people
have in forming foreign policy.
   Gorbachev misunderstood a question by USA magazine's Valentin
Berezhkov, a former diplomat and U.S. affairs expert whose
experience dates back to the leadership of dictator Josef V.
Stalin. Berezhkov served as a translator at the 1945 Yalta
conference.
   ``I tried during my latest meeting with media representatives to
talk about the power of conservatives,'' Gorbachev began, but was
interrupted with a whisper from Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   ``You mean you're talking not about our conservatives, but THEIR
conservatives?'' Gorbachev asked Berezhkov, prompting laughter
throughout the auditorium.
   Melor Sturua, an Izvestia correspondent who reported from
Washington until he was expelled in 1983 in a tit-for-tat exchange,
acknowledged in his question that the verification issues being
considered by the Geneva arms negotiators were initially hampered
by the Soviet side.
   Gorbachev agreed with his assessment, and went on to criticize
the current problems as a result of American stubbornness, but
qualified his remarks by warning listeners not to ``spoil your
impressions'' of the summit's overall success.
   The Soviet leader declared the press session _ the first such
meeting here approximating a White House press conference _ a
useful event, hinting that other exchanges could be offered in the
future.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy says his family is
disturbed by the decision to establish a museum in the Dallas
building from which Lee Harvey Oswald is believed to have shot
President John F. Kennedy.
   However, Kennedy, D-Mass., said family members will not try to
block the opening of the $3.5 million exhibit on his brother's 1963
assassination.
   ``The familiy has taken the position that the only memorial
should be the Kennedy Library (in Boston), with its outreach
capabilities in terms of inspiring people to service,'' Kennedy
said Wednesday.
   The Dallas museum is expected to open by Nov. 22, the 25th
anniversary of the assassination.
   Organizers say the museum will allow the thousands of tourists
who visit the site to have access to the former Texas School Book
Depository building.
   Organizer Conover Hunt described the exhibit as ``low-key'' and
said it will not contain ``violent or gruesome artifacts.''
   The sixth-floor corner window from which Oswald was believed to
have fired the shots will be inaccessable, but visitors will be
able to see it through a glass partition, Hunt said.
   ``People are in Dealey Plaza 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
365 days a year and there is no place for them to get
information,'' Hunt said. ``This is especially a problem with our
international visitors. They expect America to have access to its
history, good or bad. They consider it an integral part of a
democracy.''
   Planners expect the exhibits to attract about 500,000 visitors
annually. The museum, called ``The Sixth Floor,'' was organized by
the Dallas County Historical Foundation.
   The Warren Commission determined that Oswald fired at Kennedy
from the sixth floor of what is now the Dallas County
Administration Building.

   The dollar posted modest gains in light European
trading trading today. Gold bullion fell.
   Foreign exchange traders cited improved U.S. trade performance
and firmer interest rates for the dollar's continued climb.
   Activity was muted, however, by the closing of West German
markets for a national holiday and by a scarcity of commercial
orders, they said.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7287 West German marks, up from 1.7255
   _1.4425 Swiss francs, up from 1.4390
   _5.8470 French francs, up from 5.8270
   _1.9384 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9330
   _1,288.25 Italian lire, up from 1,282.50
   _1.2336 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2319
   The British pound continued its steady decline from highs
reached last month. It traded at $1.8165, down from $1.8220.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 125.68 Japanese yen, up from
Wednesday's close of 125.35 yen. In later London trading today, the
dollar reached 125.95 yen.
   Profit-taking on platinum's recent surge pushed gold lower.
   London's main bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $454.60 a troy ounce, down from $456.50 late
Wednesday.
   Gold was bid at $454.70 in Zurich, down from $457.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $455.38, down
from $458.55.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.75 a troy ounce,
down from $6.79.

   Russell DeYoung, the former chairman of the
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., has died at age 79.
   DeYoung, who served as chairman and chief executive officer of
Goodyear from 1964 to 1973 and played a key role in developing the
steel-studded snow tire, died of apparent heart failure Tuesday at
his home in Naples, Fla.
   DeYoung joined the Akron, Ohio-based company after his
graduation from high school in 1927. He later graduated from
college in a company work-study program.
   In the 1940s, DeYoung served as vice president of the Goodyear
Aircraft Corp., presiding over the growth of the unit into one of
the nation's 10 largest wartime producers of airplanes.
   After the war, he was appointed to the parent company and in
1956 was named executive vice president. He was elected company
president two years later.
   After his retirement as chief executive officer in 1973, DeYoung
continued to serve as director and chairman of the board's
executive and finance committee until April 1979.
   In 1973, DeYoung pleaded guilty on behalf of Goodyear _ along
with officers of several other companies _ to making illegal
contributions to the 1972 re-election campaign of former President
Richard Nixon. He was fined $1,000.
   Born in Rutherford, N.J., DeYoung graduated from the University
of Akron with a degree in industrial engineering and received a
master's degree in business administration from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   He is survived by his wife, Lois; two sons, Bruce, of Akron and
Ralph, of Kennett Square, Pa.; and a daughter, Janet Mungo, of
Akron.

   Israel's 130,000 unionized engineers,
technicians and humanities and social science graduates went on
strike today, disrupting the country's airports, industrial plants
and universities.
   Israel's state-run radio and television halted broadcasts and
the only station operating was Israel army radio.
   The 24-hour strike of the three unions was announced last week
and started as scheduled at midnight. The Finance Ministry
announced an accord with the unions in the early morning hours, but
the strike was already in motion.
   Some disruptions were reported at Ben Gurion International
airport near Tel Aviv, where airport director Motti Debbie said
``every passenger has to take into account that his departure may
be delayed.''
   The strike shut down plants of the government-run Aviation
Industry, military factories, the high technology industries and
some plants belonging to the Histadrut, the country's largest trade
union federation, army radio said.
   About 1,400 engineers and technicians at the national Electric
Company were on strike, too, said a company official, Rafi
Ben-Sira. He said electricity supply would be maintained.
   Also affected were the national telephone company and the post
service.
   At Tel Aviv University, about 500 engineers and administration
officials did not show up for work, shutting down laboratories and
computers, said spokeswoman Carol Cooke.
   Hebrew University reported a similar situation.
   At night, representatives of the trade unions signed an accord
outlining the framework for trade negotiations in 1988-1989, said
Finance Ministry spokesman Yitzhak Feinberg. He termed the accord
``a real breakthrough.''
   He said it stipulated a unified wage increase for all the
unions, which would then be free to decide how to distribute the
increase to their members. Several major trade unions have already
joined the agreement, he added. The rate of the increase would be
negotiated separately.

   Armenian activists have been protesting around the
clock in Armenia's capital and staging a general strike in a region
in neighboring Azerbaijan that they want annexed to their republic,
an organizer said.
   The Soviet government, meanwhile, canceled a state-sponsored
press trip to Armenia without giving a reason. The ethnic
strife-torn southern region is closed to foreigners.
   And in Geneva, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration
reported that Armenian emigration from the Soviet Union is headed
for an all-time high in 1988 following a new sharp increase in May.
   Regina Boucault, spokeswoman for the committee, said 5,305
Armenians have been allowed to leave since January, including 1,501
in May alone.
   This compares with a total of 6,633 departures in 1980, the
highest total since 1977, when the committee began monitoring the
family reunification program financed by the United States.
   Former political prisoner Georgy Homizuri said by telephone from
Yerevan on Wednesday that demonstrators had for six days staged a
sit-in outside the city's Opera Theater. They are demanding that
Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-dominated region in the neighboring
republic of Azerbaijan, be turned over to Armenia
   Ethnic Azeris are predominantly Moslem, while most Armenians are
Christian.
   ``They have been demonstrating day and night, rain or shine,''
said Homizuri, 46, who was released in February 1987 after spending
four years in a labor camp for his writings circulated in the
intellectual underground.
   Homizuri said the demonstrators want the parliament of Armenia,
the Supreme Soviet, to consider their demand at a June 15 meeting.
   In Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, a general
strike that has shut down mass transit and factories for about a
week continued, according to Homizuri.
   Intourist, the Soviet travel agency for foreigners, advertised a
special trip to Yerevan for reporters covering this week's summit
meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The trip, scheduled from Friday to Monday, was to have been the
first opportunity for foreign journalists to visit the troubled
region since demonstrations and rioting broke out.
   On Wednesday, the official news agency Tass carried a Foreign
Ministry announcement that said the trip was canceled. It gave no
reason.
   Strikes and street rallies began in the region in February and
broke out again recently.
   On Tuesday, Tass said the former party chief in the Azerbaijani
city of Sumgait, where ethnic rioting related to the territorial
dispute killed 32 people in February, had been expelled from the
Communist Party. Also dismissed from the organization was the
former party chief in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost'' has brought more open
discussion of the Soviet Union's problems, but foreign reporters
frequently have found their access to troubled regions cut off,
either through disruption of telephone calls or travel bans.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees Libel Suit Should Be Retried</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporters have an absolute right not to
reveal confidential sources during legal proceedings, the state
Supreme Court ruled in throwing out a $4.5 million libel judgment
against The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   The unanimous opinion filed Tuesday lets stand a Superior Court
ruling that reaffirmed Pennsylvania's Shield Law and reversed a
1983 verdict won by Richard A. Sprague, a lawyer and former first
assistant district attorney in Philadelphia.
   The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling that Sprague's
libel suit against the Inquirer be retried.
   The suit involves several 1973 articles that reported
allegations of Sprague participating in an illegal wiretapping
scheme.
   Other articles raised questions about whether Sprague, as chief
of the homicide division of the district attorney's office in 1963,
extended preferential treatment to the son of former State Police
Commissioner Rocco Urella Sr. in a homicide case.
   Sprague denied both sets of allegations.
   During a six-week trial in 1983, Common Pleas Judge Charles A.
Lord ruled the jury had to disregard any evidence presented by the
Inquirer based on confidential sources.
   Rather than divulge the reporters' sources, the newspapers'
attorneys chose not to present the evidence.
   The Shield Law, enacted in 1937, states that no reporter ``shall
be required to disclose the source of any information procured or
obtained by such person, in any legal proceeding, trial or
investigation before any government unit.''
   The Superior Court ruled in 1986 that the Shield Law gave the
newspaper the statutory right to withhold the identity of its
sources, and ordered a new trial.
   Writing for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Robert N.C. Nix Jr.
said the Shield Law's language ``is in no way ambiguous'' and
agreed with the Superior Court that Lord had committed an error by
barring the Inquirer's evidence.
   However, Nix differed with the Superior Court's broad
interpretation of the law, saying that just because evidence based
on confidential sources is admitted doesn't mean its reliability is
guaranteed.
   ``The plaintiff is free to introduce rebuttal evidence and-or
argue that the record does not disclose any evidence to support the
reliability of the information,'' Nix wrote.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Susan swept across the
northern Philippines and Taiwan today, killing at least one person,
flooding rice paddies and driving families from their homes,
officials said.
   The Red Cross said a 5-year-old boy, Dexter Aquino, was killed
Wednesday in a landslide triggered by heavy rains in Olongapo City,
50 miles northwest of Manila in the Philippines.
   Typhoon Susan's 84-mph winds spawned a freak tornado in Cainta
district outside Manila that destroyed 18 houses today, Red Cross
spokeswoman Teresita Pena said.
   Nine-year-old Dahlia Mabalot fell into the nearby Kasibulan
River when her house was blown away, but she was rescued, Pena
said. He added that several families were also evacuated from three
coastal villages in Cavite province which borders Manila to the
south.
   The tropical depression developed within Philippine waters
Sunday and passed over Batanes province Tuesday. It came back as a
typhoon late Wednesday.
   A Philippines government weather bulletin said that as of this
afternoon, the typhoon's center was 192 miles north of Batanes, the
Philippines' northernmost province, moving toward Japan.
   In Taiwan, the typhoon swept through the southeastern part of
the country today, disrupting highway and rail traffic, flooding
rice paddies and causing power outages, officials said. No injuries
were reported.
   The state-run Taiwan Power Co. said power outages were reported
in 16,000 households in eastern Taitung, the hardest hit county,
where 12 inches of rain fell in a 14-hour period.

   A man arrested on charges of
sexually assaulting a 3-year-old claims to have molested 200 to 300
children in the past 20 years, police said.
   Law enforcement agencies in the Denver metropolitan area are
investigating the claims made by Rodney O. Bailey, 44, police in
this Denver suburb said.
   Bailey was arrested May 19 on charges of sexually assaulting a
girl in a vehicle in his garage April 12 after the child wandered
into the yard where he and his wife were working, police said. He
was freed on $5,000 bail.
   In a statement to police, Bailey, a machine operator for a
bottling company, said he molested 3- to 8-year-old boys and girls
throughout the metropolitan area, mostly in toy departments of
large stores, police said.
   ``He would look for a child left alone, approach them, strike up
a conversation and then fondle them,'' said Detective Jan Brace.
``He estimated between 200 and 300. ... There could be more. That
was strictly an estimate.''
   Police said they believe many of the cases in which Bailey
claims to have been involved never were reported.
   ``It is not unusual that small children wouldn't have told
anyone about these incidents because of fear,'' Brace said.
   Bailey had two previous arrests. In 1979 he pleaded guilty to
sexually assaulting a woman, and in 1981 he was accused of
harassing a 4-year-old girl, records showed. The outcome of that
case could not immediately be determined.

<HEAD>Indian Lung Disease Linked To Asbestos in Silver Making</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of asbestos to make silver jewelry and
whiten moccasins for ceremonial dances is responsible for an
outbreak of a rare form of lung cancer among New Mexican Indians,
doctors report today.
   Doctors from U.S. Public Health Service began an investigation
after finding that the incidence of malignant mesothelioma, a form
of lung cancer associated with asbestos, was 1,000 times higher
than expected at one Indian pueblo.
   Five people, all from the same village, had the disease between
1970 and 1985.
   Dr. Richard J. Driscoll and other researchers reported their
findings in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Four of the victims were silversmiths. The researchers found
that they typically used asbestos mats, which they called pounding
boards, to insulate their work tables against the heat of torches
and molten metal.
   All five also participated in ceremonial dances. Before the
dances, the Indians used asbestos to whiten their buckskin leggings
and moccasins.
   The researchers said efforts have been made to educate Indians
about the hazards of asbestos and to find alternative materials for
silversmiths and ceremonial dancers.

<HEAD>Major Seabrook Investor Votes to Pull Out Of Stalled Nuke Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf pvs, `The action ...' to CORRECT that Shoreham
never went into commercial operation sted never generated

<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUDLOW, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of the fourth-largest investor in
the Seabrook nuclear power plant have voted to pull out, and
opponents of the stalled project say that could spell its doom.
   A plant spokesman said he was confident the project would
survive Wednesday's decision by the board of directors of the
Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., which has an 11.6
percent stake in Seabrook.
   The electrical cooperative's eight-member board voted
unanimously to withhold its June 1 payment of $1.6 million toward
building and maintaining the New Hampshire project.
   The cooperative said the strain the project has put on relations
with Massachusetts has hurt customers. The cooperative comprises 34
municipal electric systems, and supplies power to 28 electric
departments in Massachusetts and eight in other Northeast states.
   The action came less than a week after New York state reached an
agreement with Long Island Lighting Co. to abandon the $5.3 billion
Shoreham nuclear plant, which also has never gone into commercial
operation.
   It ``reflects the bottom-line reality that Seabrook is a
teetering financial dinosaur about to become extinct,'' said Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., a Seabrook opponent.
   ``I believe there's a major funding problem for the project and
it is so grossly uneconomic right now that this may be the end of
it,'' said Bob Backus, a lawyer for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution
League, which has fought the project since its inception.
   Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams disagreed. ``Our detractors have
said from the beginning that each hurdle we face has meant the end
of the project, and each time they have been wrong,'' he said.
``The rest of the owners remain committed and the bottom line
remains the plant is very much needed for New England.''
   However, Seabrook's top three owners indicated that they
wouldn't pick up the cooperative's share. One, Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, has filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law.
   Public Service Company has a 36 percent share. United
Illuminating of New Haven, Conn., has a 17.5 percent piece and
Eastern Utilities Associates of Rhode Island has 12 percent.
   Under a plan approved by the board, the Massachusetts
cooperative plans to ask the other owners to assume its
construction and maintenance costs or to buy its shares outright
under the joint ownership agreement.
   The matter could come to a head in eight months, when the grace
period for overdue bills is up and the other investors exhaust the
money the cooperative has deposited in a prepayment fund.
   General Manager Gary L. Hunt acknowledged that cooperative would
lose the $875 million it has already invested in the plant, which
cost $5.4 billion to build but lacks the approved evacuation plans
required for commercial operation.
   Hunt also acknowledged that the cooperative could be paying off
the bonds issued for the Seabrook investment for the next 30 years.
The cooperative will pay $91 million yearly for its long-term
Seabrook debt in 1989 and $15 million to $20 million annually to
support the idle plant.
   But he said the project was a losing business proposition even
if the plant's license is eventually approved.
   ``The alienation that Seabrook has caused between MMWEC and the
Commonwealth (of Massachusetts) has had adverse consequences for
Massachusetts public power electric consumers.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has refused to authorize tax-exempt
financing for the project, Hunt said.
   Hunt predicted ``serious rate increases for some participants on
top of the participants' already high rate levels caused by
Seabrook.''

   More than a third of 1,023 patients treated at
a hospital for serious accidents used marijuana before being
injured, according to a study.
   Another third of the patients at the University of Maryland's
Shock Trauma Center drank alcohol before being hurt, and 16.5
percent had used both marijuana and alcohol, the study said.
   ``To me, it was rather startling to see that an illicit drug
matched in use by a legal drug,'' said Dr. Carl A. Soderstrom, a
surgeon who headed the research project at the Maryland Institute
for Emergency Medical Systems.
   Patients were unaware of the study, which used blood samples.
The research was reported in the June issue of the journal Archives
of Surgery.
   ``If this is borne out in other studies across the country, it
puts a new slant on the safety of marijuana use,'' Dr. Edward J.
Cone of the Johns Hopkins Addiction Research Center said Wednesday.
   ``There's a common misconception that marijuana is a safe
drug,'' Cone said. ``But the statistics coming out of that study
clearly show that people who are using marijuana are involved in
accidents at a much higher rate than you would expect.''
   Cone said the incidence of marijuana use among the injured was
``phenomenally high.''
   The study showed that 34.7 percent of the 1,023 patients had
used marijuana and 33.5 percent were under the influence of
alcohol. Ninety-two percent of the patients survived.
   About two-thirds of the patients were involved in traffic
accidents. The rest were injured in assaults or falls and other
accidents.
   About 73 percent were men and 58.4 percent were 30 or younger.

   Full telephone service should be restored
Sunday to the suburban Chicago communities affected by a fire May 8
at an Illinois Bell Co. switching station, the utility said.
   Half of the 35,000 customers were back on line last Friday. The
rest will be able to make all local and long distance calls by
12:01 a.m. Sunday, said James Eibel, Illinois Bell vice president
for operations.
   The fire at the switching station here turned into a
communications crisis. Phones in all or part of seven communities
were dead for several days before Illinois Bell gradually restored
local then long distance dialing.
   Hundreds of laborers have worked at all hours to replace
fire-and water-damaged hardware.
   ``This extraordinary effort by all our people involved has
allowed us to move ... quickly to restore customer service
following the worst service outage in our history,'' Eibel said
Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the Illinois Commerce Commission said it has hired
Forensic Technologies International Corp. of Annapolis, Md., to
investigate the fire beginning today.
   ``The staff felt there was a real need for an independent
investigation by a company with proven expertise to determine the
cause of the fire and steps that might be taken to prevent a
similar occurrence,'' said spokesman David Farrell.

<HEAD>Vice President Shrugs Off Influence Of Conservative Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said in an interview
published today that two of the nation's well-known and outspoken
conservatives are fringe elements whose support isn't necessary for
victory in the presidential election.
   Bush, interviewed by The New York Times at his oceanside retreat
in Kennebunkport, Maine on Wednesday, shrugged off the influence of
Richard A. Viguerie, a writer and direct-mail specialist, and
Howard J. Phillips, head of the Conservative Caucus.
   ``There's only one or two that polarize, and Viguerie and Howie
Phillips are two of them; it doesn't matter in terms of total
vote,'' the vice president said in the interview, published in
today's editions of the Times.
   ``There is only a handful of Richard Vigueries out there,'' said
Bush, the all-but certain Republican presidential nominee.
   Asked if he had to do business with Viguerie to win the
election, he said: ``I don't believe that.
   ``The fact that he (Viguerie) doesn't agree with me on a lot of
things or has opposed me for many years, that doesn't bother me one
iota,'' said Bush.
   Viguerie, the vice president said, ``gets his name in the paper
by criticizing other Republicans all the time.''
   ``If he wants to go around attacking conservatives he's going to
dig himself a deeper hole,'' Viguerie said early today in response
to Bush's comments. ``I want all of us to unite behind him and run
a conservative campaign. ... All we want to do is hold his feet to
the fire that Ronald Reagan lit in 1980.
   ``If he doesn't run a polarizing election, he's history. ... If
he doesn't run a campaign to polarize, that polarizes the country
along liberal and conservative lines then he has no chance of
winning,'' Vigurie added.
   Viguerie, who said he plans to vote for Bush, said he thought
Bush was reacting to presssure that he select a conservative as his
vice presidential running mate.
   ``I suspect the vice president doesnt' feel comfortable with
pressure to campaign as a conservative,'' he said. ``I'm sure the
conservatives will be insistent on a conservative vice president
and a conservative platform,'' he added.

   Hurkos was stricken Wednesday in a medical complex near
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after a visit to his doctor, said
publicist Barbara Silver. He had had a portion of his cancerous
right lung removed in April, she said.
   Hurkos helped authorities investigate the 1969 murders of
actress Sharon Tate and supermarket owner Leno LaBianca and his
wife, who were among eight people killed by followers of Charles
Manson.
   Hurkos said he told authorities the person responsible for the
slayings was a bearded man named Charlie.
   Hurkos also worked on the Boston Strangler case, later made into
a movie starring Tony Curtis, and on murders of college students in
Ann Arbor, Mich., Mrs. Silver said.
   Even after Albert DeSalvo confessed to being the Strangler and
was convicted, Hurkos maintained that another man was the killer.
   Hurkos said he became psychic in 1941 after falling from a
ladder and suffering a brain injury. Upon regaining consciousness,
he realized he had ``an ability to pierce the barriers that
separate the past, present and future,'' according to his biography.
   Hurkos said he was able to see things by touching objects.
   ``I see pictures in my mind like a television screen. When I
touch something, I can then tell what I see,'' he said.
   He appeared in the movies ``The Amazing World of Psychic
Phenomena,'' ``Mysterious Monsters,'' ``Now I Lay Me Down to
Sleep'' and ``The Boston Strangler.''
   He was the author of three books, ``Psychic,'' ``The Psychic
World of Peter Hurkos'' and ``Peter Hurkos: I Have Many Lives.''
   Hurkos was born in Dordrecht, Holland, and came to the United
States in 1956 for psychic experiments and lived in the Los Angeles
area about 25 years.
   Survivors include his wife, Stephany Courtney, and seven
children.

   U.S. Ambassador John Kelly's car was hit
in a brief exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a
Christian militia patrol in east Beirut today, but the envoy was
not hurt, police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said only one bullet hit the hood of Kelly's
armor-plated limousine.
   The spokesman said the shooting occurred when Kelly's bodyguards
in two escort cars fired in the air with automatic rifles,
``apparently to make way for the ambassador's convoy'' in a
traffic-jammed street in the Sin Fil neighborhood.
   The ambassador's motorcade was heading for the heavily guarded
U.S. Embassy compound in the suburb of Aukar.
   The police spokesman said Kelly was in a dark blue bullet-proof
limousine driving between the two escort vehicles.
   A militia patrol from President Amin Gemayel's right-wing
Phalange Party, which was in the area, ``opened fire in the air,
too, in an effort to stop Kelly's convoy to check what was
happening,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Kelly's bodyguards fired three bullets at the Phalangists in a
white Mercedes-Benz and the patrol fired back,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Kelly's car was hit by one bullet in the hood and the convoy
continued on its way to the embassy,'' the spokesman added. He did
not elaborate.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``The ambassador and all his escorts are fine.'' He refused
to elaborate.
   In another development, police said three members of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, were wounded in a brief
firefight with rival Shiite Moslem of the Syrian-aided Amal militia
in south Beirut on Wednesday night.
   A police spokesman said the five-minute firefight in the Shiyah
district ended when Syrian troops intervened.
   The clash was the first reported between the two sides since
Syria deployed 2,400 soldiers in Beirut's southern slums on Friday
and Saturday to end three weeks of street battles between the two
militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded.
   Amal accused Hezbollah of provoking the clash and said the three
wounded militiamen were armed with silencer-equipped pistols.
   Hezbollah said Amal militiamen opened fire on the three
``unarmed'' Hezbollahis as they drove to Shiyah to check on their
apartments.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
challenged President Reagan at their windup summit meeting over the
wording of the final communique, and they were ``going at it pretty
heavy until the end,'' White House chief of staff Howard Baker
revealed today.
   Talking with reporters on the president's plane as Reagan flew
from Moscow to London, Baker also pronounced the U.S. delegation
satisfied with the results of the summit, which concluded Wednesday.
   Baker said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further on
arms control, but added, ``We came out just about where it was
predicted we could come out. It would have been nice if we could
have gone any further, but nobody expected us to go any further.''
   Asked why Reagan appeared so fatigued over the past couple days,
Baker said, ``We're all tired, I guess, but most of us are more
tired than he is. I don't think that fatigue played any role in the
summit.''
   ``I'm sure he's tired and I guess he looks tired,'' Baker said
of the president.
   Baker described Gorbachev as a strong leader and said he
demonstrated the same image in private as he did at his nearly
two-hour news conference, where he was feisty and appeared entirely
in command.
   In talks with Reagan, Gorbachev ``goes on at some length but he
does not filibuster. He says what he says and he doesn't back up
and say, `I meant to say so and so,''' Baker recalled.
   ``He comes out of the box saying what he meant,'' Baker said.
   Unlike earlier summits, Baker said that Reagan did not share
with Gorbachev his store of jokes about life in the Soviet Union.
   ``He told him some lawyer jokes and I didn't like that,'' joked
Baker, an attorney.
   He described the scene at the final Reagan-Gorbachev meeting on
Wednesday morning, about six hours before the summit communique was
released to the press:
   ``As the meeting ended, all of us stood up, including the
president and the general secretary, and the president and general
secretary continued to pursue their conversation.
   ``They were going at it pretty heavy and I was proud of the
president. They were face to face and going at it pretty heavy
until the end.''
   Baker explained that at the first meeting, on Sunday, Gorbachev
had given Reagan some papers describing items that he wanted to
discuss over the next three days.
   Baker said the president gave it only a cursory look, and that
Gorbachev quoted a phrase from the documents about ``peaceful
coexistence.''
   Reagan said something like, ``that looks all right to me,'' and
the documents were passed on for review by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and the staff of the National Security Council,
Baker said.
   Gorbachev's document would have put the two leaders on record as
believing that ``no problem in dispute can be resolved, nor should
it be resolved, by military means. They regard peaceful coexistence
as a universal principle of international relations.
   ``Equality of all states, non-interference in internal affairs
and freedom of socio-political choice must be recognized as the
inalienable and mandatory standards of international relations,''
the Soviet draft said.
   At his Spaso House news conference in Moscow Wednesday, Reagan
was asked why he took issue with the ``peaceful coexistence''
language.
   Reagan said that he liked ``the whole tone'' of the draft
language.
   But the president also said that aides studying the draft
communique ``saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in
there that would not achieve the general thought of what was being
proposed.''
   U.S. officials were suspicious about the language, feeling it
was too imprecise.
   The U.S. objections were brought to the attention of the Soviets
early on, and negotiations began at the staff level on alternative
language, Baker said.
   ``And indeed, it was our impression that alternative language
had been agreed to for the departure statement,'' he said. ``And it
was at the last meeting (that) the general secretary came back and
made another run at trying to get his original language in. And the
president held his ground.''
   ``I don't think he (Gorbachev) was playing a trick. I think he
was just making a run for his original formulation,'' Baker said.
   In the end, the compromise language negotiated by the staff _
omitting the words peaceful coexistence _ was included in the
communique.
   Baker said the talks in Moscow were ``more free-flowing'' than
in Washington and that there was ``more energy in the
conversations.''
   ``They talk more freely. When they disagreed they would say so
more quickly,'' he added.

   European newspapers today declared the Moscow
summit a success despite the absence of major advances on arms
control.
   Editorialists applauded President Reagan's performance and his
disavowal of his earlier characterization of the Soviet Union as
``an evil empire.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent a message of thanks to
Reagan after five days of summit talks with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said in a
statement:
   ``With this fourth summit and the signing of the INF
(intermediate-range nuclear missile) treaty, we are facing a
historic watershed in European and international postwar history.''
   ``We have ahead of us a radically changed picture, both in
dialogue and in climate, between the two superpowers. What has
happened now makes new breakthroughs possible in East-West
cooperation,'' Brundtland said.
   Sir Michael Howard, a senior Oxford University historian, wrote
of Reagan in the Times of London: ``It has been a brilliant
performance. ... He is truly a remarkable man, and his place in
history is certainly assured.''
   Also in London, the left-leaning Guardian commented: ``There's a
pretty durable foundation of contact in place.''
   It said: ``When Mr. Reagan, in another era, talks of evil
empires and builds policies based on fear and mistrust, then his
voters, to an extent, share that fear and mistrust, believe that
the Russians are coming to get them.
   ``Such beliefs can't easily be sustained when their front-parlor
screens are filled by those same Russians (not to mention the newly
converted Mr. Reagan) expressing quite other sentiments.''
   Italy's largest newspaper, left-leaning La Repubblica in Rome,
differed with the Guardian.
   ``Things did not go well for Mikhail Gorbachev. ... One could
clearly see he was disappointed, very disappointed. ... The
ideological disparity between the two camps surfaced more clearly
in Moscow than in the previous summits,'' it said.
   In Paris, the leftist daily Liberation said: ``Mikhail Gorbachev
and Ronald Reagan have but very thin concrete results to add to the
essential dossiers of disarmament and regional conflicts.''
   But it said, ``This `routine' summit was nevertheless not
ordinary. Reagan, who just several years ago could be imagined as
Saint George slaying the Red Dragon of the Evil Empire, made a
skillful crossing to Moscow which he was visiting for the first
time.
   ``... Reagan knew how to suppress his first-class anti-communist
image. ... (But) at the end of the summit, the Kremlin chief was
unable to hide the fact that he was waiting for more,'' Liberation
said.
   The conservative Le Figaro said: ``The success of the Moscow
summit is paradoxically that it did not have major results. ...
This rendezvous appears to have confirmed that American-Soviet
relations have found their cruising rhythm...''
   The Basler Zeitung, an independent Swiss paper, said: ``It
ushered in a new kind of coexistence which has deservedly been
celebrated in Moscow...
   ``The old coexistence was ... a highly unpredictable matter full
of political misunderstandings, full of nuclear risks. The new
coexistence is to be different: calculable, solid,
crisis-resistant.''

   A man accused of serving in a pro-Nazi execution
squad that killed tens of thousands of Jews and other civilians in
Latvia during World War II says he will fight a move to strip him
of his U.S. citizenship.
   Valdis W. Didrichsons, 74, concealed his membership in the
Latvian Security Auxiliary Police when he applied for citizenship,
according to a Justice Department complaint filed in U.S. District
Court.
   Didrichsons refused to comment on the case Wednesday except to
describe himself as a retired civil engineer who moved here nine
years ago from Chicago and to say, ``I will fight.''
   His attorney, Peter Berzins, said he didn't know whether
Didrichsons was a member of Arajs Kommando, as the execution unit
was known.
   ``Membership and whether he participated or knew of activity are
two separate things,'' Berzins added.
   The unit, formed to assist in persecuting and killing people
considered racially undesirable or enemies of Nazi Germany,
murdered tens of thousands, said Neal Sher, director of the Justice
Department's Office of Special Investigations.
   The founder, Victor Arajs, died recently in West Germany while
serving a life term for mass murder.
   Assisting in persecution makes a person ineligible to immigrate
to the United States and requires revocation of citizenship. The
denaturalization case against Didrichsons is the first step in a
process that could lead to deportation.
   A native of Latvia, Didrichsons entered the United States in
1950 and became a U.S. citizen in 1956. Latvia is now part of the
Soviet Union.
   Doug Schwartz, manager of Didrichsons' apartment complex, said
Didrichsons lived alone, never caused problems, paid his rent on
time and was ``very gregarious.''
   Didrichsons recently underwent surgery for cancer, Berzins said,
adding that he was awaiting medical records to determine the
seriousness of the illness.
   Berzins said it is difficult to view Arajs Kommando in its
historical setting 45 years later. He noted that in 1941 and 1942,
the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were fighting in what was then a
neutral country that had been occupied by the Soviets.
   ``People pull strings and jump or face execution themselves,''
he said. ``Certainly the free choice of a person at that time is
severely impacted.''
   Konrads Kalejs of Chicago, who is now on trial in a similar
proceeding, and Mikelis Kirsteins of Syracuse, N.Y., who is facing
trial, served with Didrichsons in the auxiliary police unit in
1941, the government said.

   A West German company is seeking
to resell the Cessna airplane that pilot Mathias Rust landed in
Moscow's Red Square a year ago, a Hamburg sports flying club
official said today.
   Karlfriedrich Giesie, deputy manager of the Hamburg air club,
said Azuma Royal Cosmetics of Munich had placed advertisements for
the plane in various newspapers. The company had bought the plane
from the club for $88,000.
   The Soviets allowed the Hamburg air club to fly the plane back
to West Germany last October, and the club sold it to Azuma Royal.
   ``Now they (the company) are seeking a huge profit on it and
have advertised it for sale in various places,'' Giesie said in an
interview. He estimated Azuma Royal was asking between $150,000 and
$175,000 for the plane.
   The Associated Press tried repeatedly to contact Azuma Royal
officials by telephone today for comment, but no one answered the
phone. Today was an official holiday in Bavaria.
   Rust, now 20, flew unimpeded over Soviet territory from
Helsinki, Finland, and landed in Red Square on May 28, 1987.
   On Sept. 4, Rust was found guilty of illegal entry into the
Soviet Union, violating international flight regulations and
malicious rowdyism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp.
   Rust remains in a Moscow prison, where the Soviets have
permitted his parents and brother to visit him on several occasions.
   One advertisement, which appeared in the May 15 editions of the
Welt am Sonntag newspaper, read: ``Most Famous Airplane To Sell. Do
you want the only airplane to land on Red Place-Moscow on 28th May
1987? Mathias Rust's Cessna 172 will be sold in best conditions.''
   According to Giesie, the Cessna is now parked in a hangar at a
small airport near the city of Uetersen, 15 miles northwest of
Hamburg.

   A 5-year-old whose right arm was torn off by
a farm conveyor belt remained in critical condition today after an
unsuccessful attempt to reatttach the limb, officials said.
   ``Regrettably, the injury was so severe, with so much
destruction of the tissue, that it was not possible to rejoin the
extremity,'' Dr. Thomas E. McKell, vice president of medical
affairs at Tampa General Hospital, said Wednesday. ``It's tragic
for this young boy and this family.''
   Fidencio Jaurequi of Dade City had gone to a barn at Singletary
Farms on Tuesday where his mother was working on a conveyor belt
that sorts cherry tomatoes, according to Earl Singletary, a
co-owner of the 75-acre farm.
   The boy stuck his arm in the machine and got it caught on a
roller, Singletary said.
   The limb was packed by paramedics in ice and a saline solution.
Fidencio and the arm were taken by helicopter to the hospital.
   Three surgeons from the University of South Florida College of
Medicine worked nine hours to reattach the limb before giving up
early Wednesday.
   The family, seasonal farm workers, has no insurance. The
hospital announced a fund was being set up for the boy at a bank.

   A sculptor unveiled his four bronze flying
pigs atop a city bicentennial monument, but to the relief of some,
they're a weathered green, not pink.
   ``I changed my mind,'' artist Andrew Leicester said.
   The green and lean pigs top the entrance sculpture at
Bicentennial Commons at Sawyer Point, a new park near downtown and
along the Ohio River.
   The pigs measure 4{ feet from tail to wing tip. They stand on
their hind legs on bright blue replicas of riverboat smokestacks.
Their wings are spread, and stomachs taut and slim.
   ``They're pigs of the '80s _ very trim,'' said Carol Scott, a
visitor from Connecticut who was among a small group of people to
watch Wednesday's unveiling.
   Three pigs covered with black cloth were lifted into place
Tuesday night by a mechanical lift. The fourth was flown in
Wednesday on a US. Coast Guard helicopter and lowered into place.
   ``There were many, many times I thought they would never make
it,'' said Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts Center,
which commissioned the $600,000 sculpture.
   The artwork contains 17 elements depicting Cincinnati's history
and its river heritage. The pigs celebrate the city's heyday in the
1880s as ``Porkopolis,'' the Midwest's hog-butchering capital.
   Leicester originally planned to cover the bronze hogs with
copper plating to achieve a lifelike rosy color. But there wasn't
enough time, so he opted for bronze's natural patina of green, he
said.
   ``They're more subdued, more traditional _ much more
appropriate,'' said Leicester, who was born in England and lives in
Minneapolis. ``If you want pink pigs, go to a department store, not
an artist.''
   Pink pigs ``would have been too much,'' agreed Don Scott,
another Connecticut visitor and former Cincinnatian.
   Some Cincinnatians had complained the pigs would make the city
look foolish. They flooded local newspapers and City Council with
letters and calls of protest.
   The council tried to settle the dispute in January by conducting
a hearing to air the gripes. Council members donned plastic pig
snouts for the raucous gathering, and one woman even cradled a
piglet.
   But the mediation failed when the council's attorney said the
councilors were powerless because the sculpture already had been
properly approved.

Additional payments by check brought each employee's quarterly

   A Kentucky man whose yacht was
reported to have been rammed by gunboats was quoted as saying the
Nicaraguan coast guard saved his craft from sinking in a storm.
   Stoye Milburn, 53, a painter from Kentucky, was towed in his
yacht by a coast guard cutter to Puerto Sandino, 44 miles northwest
of Managua. He said he and his German shepherd dog were on a
pleasure trip to Costa Rica when he was caught in heavy seas and
rescued.
   ``I was treated like a member of the family (by the
Nicaraguans), like a brother, like a gentleman,'' Milburn said
Wednesday. His hometown was not available.
   He spoke in English in an interview at Puerto Sandino with AP
photographer Mario Tapia, and his words were translated into
Spanish by Nicaraguan navy Lt. Jose Vilchez, the port commander.
   Unconfirmed reports, mostly from radio operators who had
monitored his garbled distress calls, had said that Nicaraguan
gunboats had intercepted and rammed the yacht offshore and arrested
Milburn.
   The U.S. Embassy had asked the Nicaraguan government to
investigate.
   Milburn said the bow of the ship was dented in a collision with
the coast guard cutter during the rescue.
   He said he had left a Mexican port, which he did not specify, on
May 25 and the yacht was five times on the point of sinking when it
was caught in heavy storms. He said he had to send out a distress
call Monday and a Nicaraguan coast guard cutter located and rescued
him two miles off Puerto Sandino and later towed the yacht into
port.
   Milburn said he was waiting for the weather to improve so he
could continue his trip to Costa Rica.

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker says he's looking for office
space near here to begin a new TV ministry, and he may ask for air
time on the PTL network.
   ``We see Pat Robertson settling back into the `700 Club.' We see
Jimmy Swaggart settling back,'' Bakker said Wednesday in front of
his father's house on the grounds of Heritage USA, PTL's Christian
theme park.
   ``The whole gospel message is a message of restoration, and if
it can't happen for the leadership then it can't happen for the
laymen.''
   Bakker has several times in the past said that he and his wife,
Tammy, should have a chance to salvage the failing ministry they
built before his downfall in a sex scandal last year, but PTL
officials have always ruled it out.
   The ministry is up to $130 million in debt, and a reorganization
plan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approval
in Bankruptcy Court.
   Bakker went to Heritage USA on Tuesday to talk with attorneys
and PTL officials on behalf of developer Roe Messner, who claims
PTL owes him $14 million.
   Some of Bakker's longtime supporters gave him a warm reception,
and that energized his efforts to regain control of PTL, said Jim
Toms, one of Bakker's lawyers.
   ``He had not talked with some of these people for 15 months, and
was very encouraged,'' Toms said Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, Bakker told reporters he might try to buy PTL's
assets when they are liquidated, but refused to say where he would
get the money. On Wednesday, Bakker said he intended to open an
office near Heritage USA and go on television to ask for money.
   ``We need a very large space, especially because of the amount
of mailing we'll have to do,'' said Bakker. He said a marketing
firm has told him he has 1 million willing financial supporters.
   ``We'll start over again getting individual air stations,'' he
said. ``We may offer to purchase time on the PTL Network. We
started with one station and we'll start again.''
   Bakker then left for his home in Gatlinburg, Tenn., in a black
Lincoln borrowed from the leader of the Bring Bakkers Back movement.
   Bakker left PTL after charges that Jessica Hahn, a church
secretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with
him. His departure was followed by revelations about a lavish
lifestyle, and he was defrocked by the Assemblies of God.

   Lloyd Haldeman, credited with turning around
the once-struggling Dallas Symphony Orchestra, has been named
president and executive director of the deficit-ridden Florida
Orchestra.
   Haldeman, 55, replaces Marshall Rousseau, who resigned in March.
   ``I see myself as a kind of orchestra rejuvenator,'' Haldeman
said Wednesday. ``The situation here is better than when I took
over Dallas.''
   The orchestra has a deficit of about $600,000 for this year and
an accumulated deficit of $800,000.
   As general manager of the Dallas orchestra from 1974-79,
Haldeman is credited with reviving the organization from
near-bankruptcy.
   Haldeman was general manager of the Cincinnati Symphony
Orchestra and May Festival, the orchestra's summer home, from
1963-71. He also was general manager of the Vancouver Symphony and
the Fresno Philharmonic Orchestra.

   Two former White House aides running
for Congress in California have turned to former Marine Lt. Col.
Oliver North for tactical support.
   North, who faces federal conspiracy charges for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, on Wednesday urged the election of conservative
Republican Dana Rohrabacher to represent the 42nd Congressional
District.
   It was his first campaign appearance since the Iran-Contra
hearing last year, said Rohrabacher spokesman Robert Rule.
Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Reagan, is a
friend from North's days as an aide to the National Security
Council.
   North was to campaign today for Christopher Cox, who is running
in the GOP primary for 40th Congressional District.
   Cox, 35, of Newport Beach, was senior associate counsel for
Reagan from 1986 to this year, when he resigned to seek election.
   North, speaking Wednesday to about 350 people in the hangar
where Howard Hughes' mammoth Spruce Goose airplane is housed,
repeatedly said that American freedoms were being stripped away,
and urged greater support for the Nicaraguan Contras in their fight
against that country's Sandinista government.
   ``Congress decides to send Contras Band-Aids and donuts,'' North
said. ``That's their contribution to democracy, and that's not what
democracy is all about.''
   North also said the conservative political movement is ``being
picked apart, piece by piece, day after day, by a liberal Congress
hell-bent on undoing this president's economical program and
selling out freedom across the world.''
   About $135,000 was raised for Rohrbacher, a former speechwriter
for Reagan, in several North appearances Wednesday, Rule said.
   Protesters showed up at North events throughout the day. While
he attended a reception at the Queen Mary about 20 demonstrators
marched outside, waving placards that read ``No Pardon for Ollie''
and ``Real Heroes Don't Lie.''

   Gov. George Deukmejian found more trouble
in the air than on the ground during a stint as a traffic reporter.
   Deukmejian took to the air Wednesday in an effort to promote his
highway-funding ballot measure with reports of gridlock horror.
   He had to cope with technical problems that included numerous
airwave silences when his helicopter lost contact with the nine
radio and TV stations receiving his reports. However, things moved
along smoothly below.
   ``Traffic is moving well on the nasty Nimitz,'' the governor's
voice crackled over radio stations.
   ``It looks pretty thin at the Bay Bridge toll plaza,'' he added.
   ``Trouble free,'' he muttered a few minutes later, over
Interstate 680 in Concord.
   ``I guess I've been able to work out all the congestion problems
today,'' Deukmejian joked. ``I think they must be aware of the fact
that I'm up here and I've been able to straighten all this
congestion out very quickly.''
   The governor said he still backs Proposition 74, a measure on
Tuesday's ballot that would raise $1 billion for new highways.
   Jeffrey Schaub of Traffic Central, a Hayward company that hires
out traffic reporters to broadcast stations, gave the governor good
reviews.
   ``He's become very proficient,'' Schaub said. ``We'd hire him.''

   A teen-age Arab prostitute shot and killed an
18-year-old Jewish seminary student with a pistol before dawn today
in a park near Israel's parliament building, authorities said.
   Police Chief Yossi Yehudai said the girl's motive was unclear.
The 17-year-old Israeli citizen was arrested later and confessed,
he said.
   In a landmark decision, a court in the city of Ramle convicted
four Israelis of violating a law that bars contacts with the PLO.
   The judges ruled that the four left-wing activists acted
illeglly when they met a 15-member PLO delegation in Costinesti,
Romania, in November 1986.
   Amnon Zichrony, an attorney for the four, told The Associated
Press they were the first people convicted of an Israeli law passed
in 1986 that bars ``unauthorized'' contacts with members of
terrorist groups. Israel considers the Palestine Liberation
Organization a terrorist group.
   Zichrony said his clients, Latif Dory, Yael Lotan, Reuven
Kaminer and Eliezer Feiler, would appeal the decision. They face a
maximum three-year sentence.
   Judge Avraham Baiser rejected defense arguments that the PLO was
not a terrorist organization, saying: ``The acts of terrorism have
not ceased although here and there we do hear some different talk.''
   The Jerusalem attack came a day after Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir warned Palestinian underground leaders to end their
6-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
   The Israeli killed today was the third since Arabs in the
territories revolted on Dec. 8. Army figures say 207 Palestinians
have been killed, 157 of them shot to death by soldiers.
   City police spokesman Rafi Levy described the shooting as a
terrorist attack, apparently related to the uprising in the lands
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   However, he said other motives for the shooting were being
investigated, including insanity.
   Levy identified the victim as Eliezer Shlesinger, 18, a student
at Sha'arei Chesed, a religious seminary near the park where the
shooting occurred.
   The girl, whom police declined to identify because she is a
minor, went to the park with two clients at about 1:30 a.m., Levy
said.
   They encountered ``two seminary students who were there by
chance. She spoke to them and then suddenly took out a pistol and
fired,'' Levy added.
   Shlesinger was hit by five bullets and killed. The other student
was unhurt, but reportedly being treated for shock.
   Levy said a security officer who passed by the park and heard
the shots grabbed the girl as she fled the scene. She later
admitted to the shooting after questioning, he said.
   Yehudai said the girl lived in Jerusalem and spoke fluent Hebrew.
   A fellow student said Shlesinger went to the park with a friend
``to get fresh air after a long day of studying.''
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, was chosen Wednesday
to be his party's candidate to lead the country if Likud wins the
November general election.
   ``Do we still have to prove that we have the power to cut off
every hand that is raised against us? If we haven't proven it
already, we will have to increase the pressure,'' Shamir told party
delegates.
   Also Wednesday, a military source said the army had started to
negotiate with Arab village leaders in the occupied lands,
promising them rewards if they ensure calm.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin meanwhile met with four
Palestinians from the occupied Gaza Strip, his third such meeting
in a week, a defense official said.
   The participants discussed political issues, such as a final
settlement for the occupied territories, during the two-hour
meeting, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities refused to name the Palestinians who participated in
the meeting, saying their lives might be in danger if the
information was disclosed.
   Israel Television said Army officials on Wednesday met with
leaders of several villages near the West Bank town of Jenin.
   The report said leaders of the village of Yamun reached a
cooperation agreement with the army. The report did not elaborate.

   Greeting, comrades! Let's go to the videotape _
of the farm equipment?
   No, it's not the stuff that great Nielsen ratings are made of,
but it's good enough to pull in 150 million viewers a night in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Vremya,'' the Soviet news show, also picked up a few million
American viewers this week thanks to The Discovery Channel, which
ran it each night of the summit meeting between President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Discovery Channel, available on cable in about 32 million
households, supplied a running translation with the newscast. The
show, ``As They See It: Soviet Nightly News,'' was introduced by
Hodding Carter.
   If American viewers were surprised by what they saw, quite
possibly so were Soviets.
   Though stodgy farm equipment stories and use of still
photographs instead of videotape illustrated a continuing lack of
sophistication in Soviet television, there were segments of Monday
night's edition of ``Vremya'' that suggested major changes in
Soviet TV coverage since the advent of glasnost, Gorbachev's policy
of openness.
   For instance, there was a report on a meeting between President
Reagan and dissidents. The fact that it was reported at all was
surprising, though it was described rather snidely by a commentator
as not ``objective.'' He added, however, that the Soviet Union
might learn something about human rights from the United States.
   Other segments included coverage of Nancy Reagan's meeting with
cute Moscow schoolchildren who sang ``It's a Small World After
All.'' The Soviet segment was hardly distinguishable from American
coverage of similar events, suggesting fluff is the same the world
over.
   ``Vremya'' opened with the biggest and seemingly dullest story
of the day, the status of arms negotiations, described by a
stylishly dressed anchorwoman in a droning official commentary.
   Much of the reporting on the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings was
traditional: the co-anchors _ the man and woman do not acknowledge
each other's existence _ read official communiques that included
long lists of those present at official events.
   It hardly was exciting television, but important to Soviets who
closely follow the rising and falling fortunes of various officials
as indicated by their public appearances or disappearances.
   There was virtually no contribution from reporters on the scene,
though there was videotape from a banquet the Gorbachevs threw for
the Reagans.
   Carter explained that much of the banquet coverage was cut
because ``Vremya'' ran 35 minutes longer than its usual 40 minutes
to include the speeches by Gorbachev and Reagan in their entirety.
American viewers would long since have switched to ``Wheel of
Fortune.''
   But in the past, Soviet TV cameras were forbidden to show such
scenes as the flower-decked tables at the Gorbachev banquet. And a
waiter could be seen carrying a bottle of wine, despite Gorbachev's
policy of anti-alcoholism.
   Before Gorbachev came to power, the wives of Soviet leaders were
rarely shown on television. But Raisa Gorbachev was seen
prominently sitting just in front of Reagan at the banquet, reading
from the text of his speech as he delivered his remarks. A later
segment treated her as an important Soviet official in her own
right as she dedicated a statue symbolizing peace.
   While the Soviet and American leaders talked, so did Vladimir
Posner and NBC anchor Tom Brokaw for ``Vremya.'' It is a small
world after all, because as every TV journalist, Soviet or
American, knows, when you're stuck with what is basically a no-news
event, what do you do?
   Interview each other.

<HEAD>Park District Approves Steer Dressing for Rodeo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city has decided it's all right if
steers wear the pants at rodeos.
   Animal rights activists had asked the Livermore Area Recreation
and Park District Board to ban use of electric prods and the steer
dressing event at the Livermore Rodeo.
   ``Odd animal events are the main issue, not the rodeo,'' said
Paul Miller from the Peninsula Humane Society.
   But the board Wednesday decided to allow both the prods and the
steer dressing event, in which cowboys chase steers and try to
dress their hind legs in a pair of blue jeans.
   ``Many rodeo events don't represent what is done on the ranch''
and should be stopped, said Doll Stanley, a member of the Fund for
Animals.
   The standing-room-only crowd at the agency meeting included more
than 100 flag-waving rodeo fans and only a handful of animal rights
activists. The cowboys in the crowd greeted the decision with
cheers.
   ``If I'm ever reincarnated send me back as a rodeo animal,''
said Jack Roddy, a professional rodeo cowboy.
   Kim Baker, 18-year-old president of the California High School
Rodeo Association, said of the activists' efforts: ``This is the
first step and next year it will be something else. It seems
eventually rodeo is just going to die.''
   The two-day Livermore Rodeo opens June 11.

   President Reagan's statement that Indians
were given reservations to ``humor'' them undermines U.S. criticism
of the way the Soviets treat their minorities, an Indian
businessman said.
   ``It's just another one of his scary remarks, another in a long
series of political and mental lapses,'' Walter Bressette, a
Chippewa Indian, said Wednesday.
   ``It belies a real lack of any understanding of American
history,'' said James Schlender, executive administrator of the
Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Commission.
   Reagan, in remarks to Soviet university students during the
Moscow summit, said ``maybe we made a mistake'' in trying to
maintain Indian cultures.
   ``Maybe we should not have humored them in that, wanting to stay
in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said,
`No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us,''' Reagan
said.
   ``If we were just being humored, the joke's on you. Give us our
land back,'' Schlender said.
   Schlender said Reagan's remark focused world attention on
treatment of Indians in the United States. ``Americans are being
judged in the court of world opinion on how fairly they treat
minorities,'' Schlender said.
   Reagan's statement ran counter to U.S. arguments that Soviet
minorities such as Jews and Armenians deserve their own identities,
said Bressette, a leader in picketing last year by the Lake
Superior Green Party in support of treaty rights to hunt and fish
in northern lakes and woods.
   The official U.S. policy toward Indians recognizes and affirms
tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, Schlender and Bressette noted.
   ``It's just one more for the Gipper,'' said Truman Lowe,
University of Wisconsin art professor and former director of
UW-Madison Native American studies.
   Jim Thunder, a former Potawatomi tribal chief who has been
active in Indian affairs, said the United States has been trying
for years to make Indians part of the American culture by stamping
out their religion, language and customs.
   ``Indians prefer to live among one another and to practice our
own religion,'' said Thunder, of Madison.

<TEXT>
   Two senior officials of Hyundai
Engineering and Construction Co. were charged today with hiring a
group of men to kidnap an employee who was trying to organize a
labor union.
   Earlier today, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks at
the headquarters of the giant Hyundai group in Seoul to protest the
kidnapping at the Hyundai subsidiary. No injuries were reported.
   Labor unrest continued at three other Hyundai subsidiaries in
southern Korea. The Hyundai group is one of the largest
conglomerates in South Korea.
   On Wednesday, management locked out 20,000 striking workers at
Hyundai Motor Co. in Ulsan and said there was little chance of
settling a strike for higher wages. The strike began Monday.
   At Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., which makes trains,
management and workers held two rounds of talks today but failed to
end a one-week strike at the company's plants in Ulsan and
Changwon. The talks were held one day after strikers freed one of
the 11 executives they took hostage on Friday.
   ``Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the students
shouted as tey hurled rocks at the Hyundai group's main building in
Seoul, breaking four windows. The students ran away before police
arrived.
   Hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested two
Hyundai Engineering officials, executive board member Choi
Jae-dong, 47, and manager for general affairs Kang Myung-ku, 42,
and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizer
Suh Jung-ui, 34.
   The government prosecutors said they would expand the
investigation to find out whether other Hyundai officials were
involved in the kidnapping.
   Suh was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as he
left a Seoul restaurant where he had met with some officials of the
huge construction company, which is based in Seoul.
   Suh, who worked at the company's Seoul headquarters, returned
home several days later and said he was released after he agreed to
write a letter of resignation addressed to the company.
   Hyundai Engineering denied involvement at the time.
   Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of the
alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in Seoul
and other cities.
   Their leader told police Hyundai Engineering executives offered
him $27,000 to kidnap Suh and persuade him to drop his labor
organizing effort.

<TEXT>
   A reputed leader of a Chicago gang accused
of drug trafficking, extortion and murder has been arrested after a
year on the run.
   Jack Darrell Farmer, a convicted drug dealer placed on the FBI's
Most Wanted List this week, was captured along with his wife,
Pamela, on Wednesday at his home of three weeks, the FBI said.
   Farmer, 35, was wanted for racketeering activities. He is
accused of leading Chicago's Little Mafia, described by the FBI as
a gang of drug dealers, loan sharks and burglars tied to two
murders in Chicago.
   ``They were a vicious group,'' said Bob Long, FBI agent in
Chicago. ``They were well organized. They would set goals they
wanted. And they would use violence, kill somebody or use great
bodily harm if that's what they needed to accomplish their goal.''
   In April 1987, while in his attorney's custody to prepare for
trial, Farmer and his wife tied up and gagged the lawyer and
escaped, said William E. Wells, agent in charge of the FBI office
in Miami.
   Nine FBI agents and eight members of the police SWAT team
surrounded the house rented by Farmer after authorities received a
telephone tip from a co-worker, said FBI agent Lloyd Dean.
   Mrs. Farmer was arrested when she drove away from the house,
Dean said. Fifteen minutes later, Farmer ``bolted from the door
into the arms of waiting FBI agents,'' he said.
   Farmer had worked at a supermarket warehouse in Deerfield Beach
under the name Robert J. Neiwiadomski, authorities said.
   The couple were jailed for an appearance before a federal
magistrate Friday.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini today
appointed Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani acting
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, Iran's official media
reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
move had been proposed by President Ali Khamenei, who is also
chairman of the Supreme Defense Council which determines Iran's
strategy in the war against Iraq.
   Khomeini has held the title of commander-in-chief, but overall
strategy has been determined by Khamenei, Rafsanjani, who is
Khomeini's respresentative on the Supreme Defense Council, and
other leaders.
   Khomeini's decision followed two serious Iranian defeats in the
7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war and major gains by radicals and militants
in two-stage parliamentary elections in April and May that
strengthened Rafsanjani.
   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Cyprus, said Khomeini's decree
said that Rafsanjani was taking over command of Iran's forces at a
time ``when imperialist America, in collaboration with East and
West and the reactionary states of the region, are trying to
confront Islam and Iran and prevent the victory of the Islamic
revolution.''
   The radio said Khomeini noted: ``I hereby want all the dear
people of Iran and military forces to be patient and resistant and
stand against the conspiracies of global arrogance.''
   ``Global arrogance'' is the phrase Iran uses to describe the
United States and its allies.
   Khomeini's move clearly strengthens Rafsanjani's position in the
government and indicates that Khamenei apparently has been edged
out.
   A major shake-up in Iran's military command had been expected
since the Iraqi army pushed the Iranians out of their important
bridgehead east of Iraq's southern port city of Basra in a
lightning assault on May 25.
   The Iraqis recaptured the Faw peninsula, south of Basra, in a
two-day assault April 16-18, driving the Iranians back across the
Shatt Al-Arab waterway two years after they seized the dusty finger
of land.
   Those defeats cost the Iranians their main footholds on Iraqi
soil and were seen as major military setbacks at a time of
political uncertainty in Tehran and apparent economic problems.
   After the loss of Faw, Khomeini replaced the armed forces chief
of staff, Brig. Gen. Ismael Sohrabi, with a little-known officer,
Col. Ali Shahbazi, and promoted him to brigadier general.
   Western military analysts said at the time that ``more heads are
expected to roll.''
   Shahbazi, 42, a regular army officer, has a background in
guerrilla warfare and has commanded armored units.
   Rafsanjani's appointment came as military analysts expected the
Tehran hierarchy to reassess its strategy of attrition against Iraq
following their twin defeats.
   The Iraqis had expected the fighting in both cases to take
several days. But to their surprise, the Faw assault took less than
36 hours and the Iranians were rolled back from their positions in
10 hours.
   Iran's official media has reported tens of thousands of
``basij,'' or volunteers, have been dispatched to the front in
recent days. But there was no clear evidence of any major single
buildup along the 730-mile war front.

   Police said today that Sikh extremists
killed at least 36 people in the Golden Temple before it was
besieged by police, the United News of India reported. Many of the
victims reportedly were tortured.
   Alos today, two more decomposed bodies were removed from the
temple complex, raising to 16 the number of corpses found around
the shrine since the radicals surrendered May 18, the Press Trust
of India news agency reported.
   Police continue to maintain a cordon around the shrine at
Amritsar to prevent militants from returning.
   UNI quoted unidentified senior police sources as saying police
were told of the killings by some of the 200 Sikh radicals and
sympathizers who surrendered during the siege.
   Many of the victims were tortured before they were killed, UNI
said. The extremists said the victims were beaten with iron rods
and whips and that salt was rubbed into their wounds. Electric
shocks also were used, UNI said.
   In some cases, the Sikh extremists extorted money from the
victims' families on the false promise that they would be freed.
The funds went to the Panthic Committee, one of a dozen Sikh
extremist groups operating in Punjab, to buy arms and ammunition,
the news agency said.
   There had been reports for months that people going into the
shrine for worship were being kidnapped and held by militants in
the complex, but the full extent of the problem did not come to
light until after the police action.
   Most of the bodies have been found in a dump next to the Akal
Takht, or the seat of temporal power of the Sikh faith.
   Militant Sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982. Amritsar is the capital
of Punjab.
   The Sikhs, who make up less than 2 percent of India's 800
million people, claim they are discriminated against by India's
majority Hindus. They form a majority in Punjab.
   The radicals have been blamed for killing more than 1,240 people
in hit-and-run attacks in Punjab state this year. In 1987, 1,030
people died.
   The siege of the temple was launched May 9 after militants
inside the complex fired on a police party outside its walls. At
least 46 people were killed in fighting during the 10-day siege,
most of them radicals.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the joint communique issued
at the close of the summit meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   The President and the General Secretary view the Moscow summit
as an important step in the process of putting U.S.-Soviet
relations on a more productive and sustainable basis. Their
comprehensive and detailed discussions covered the full agenda of
issues to which the two leaders agreed during their initial meeting
in Geneva in November 1985 _ an agenda encompassing arms control,
human rights and humanitarian matters, settlement of regional
conflicts, and bilateral relations. Serious differences remain on
important issues; the frank dialogue which has developed between
the two countries remains critical to surmounting these differences.
   The talks took place in a constructive atmosphere which provided
ample opportunity for candid exchange. As a result, the sides
achieved a better understanding of each other's positions. The two
leaders welcomed the progress achieved in various areas of
U.S.-Soviet relations since their last meeting in Washington,
notwithstanding the difficulty and complexity of the issues.
   They noted with satisfaction numerous concrete agreements which
have been achieved, and expressed their determination to redouble
efforts in the months ahead in areas where work remains to be done.
They praised the creative and intensive efforts made by
representatives of both sides in recent months to resolve
outstanding differences.
   Assessing the state of U.S.-Soviet relations, the President and
the General Secretary underscored the historic importance of their
meetings in Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow in laying the
foundation for a realistic approach to the problems of
strengthening stability and reducing the risk of conflict.
   They reaffirmed their solemn conviction that a nuclear war
cannot be won and must never be fought, their determination to
prevent any war between the United States and Soviet Union, whether
nuclear or conventional, and their disavowal of any intention to
achieve military superiority.
   The two leaders are convinced that the expanding political
dialogue they have established represents an increasingly effective
means of resolving the issues of mutual interest and concern. They
do not minimize the real differences of history, tradition and
ideology which will continue to characterize the U.S.-Soviet
relationship.
   But they believe that the dialogue will endure, because it is
based on realism and focused on the achievement of concrete
results. It can serve as a constructive basis for addressing not
only the problems of the present, but of tomorrow and the next
century. It is a process which the President and the General
Secretary believe serves the best interests of the peoples of the
United States and the Soviet Union and can contribute to a more
stable, more peaceful and safer world.

<HEAD>Human Rights and Humanitarian Concerns</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The President and the General Secretary engaged in a detailed
discussion of human rights and humanitarian concerns. The leaders
reviewed the increasingly broad and detailed U.S.-Soviet dialogue
in this area and agreed that it should be conducted at all levels
in order to achieve sustained, concrete progress.
   They noted that this dialogue should seek to maximize assurance
of the rights, freedoms and human dignity of individuals; promotion
of people-to-people communications and contacts; active sharing of
spiritual, cultural, historical and other values; and greater
mutual understanding and respect between the two countries. Toward
this end, they discussed the possible establishment of a forum
which, meeting regularly, would bring together participants from
across the range of their two societies.
   They noted steps already taken to establish the exchange of
information and contacts between legislative bodies, as well as
discussions between legal experts, physicians and representatives
of other professions directly involved in matters pertaining to
human rights, and between representatives of non-governmental
organizations.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Regional Issues</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The President and the General Secretary thoroughly discussed a
wide range of regional questions, including the Middle East, the
Iran-Iraq war, southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, Central
America, Cambodia, the Korean Peninsula and other issues.
   They expressed satisfaction with the April 1988 conclusion in
Geneva of accords on an Afghanistan settlement. Although the
discussions revealed serious differences both in the assessment of
the causes of regional tensions and in the means to overcome them,
the leaders agreed that these differences need not be an obstacle
to constructive interaction between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
   They reaffirmed their intention to continue U.S.-Soviet
discussions at all levels aimed at helping parties to regional
conflicts find peaceful solutions which advance their independence,
freedom and security. They emphasized the importance of enhancing
the capacity of the United Nations and other international
institutions to contribute to the resolution of regional conflicts.

<HEAD>Future Meetings</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The President and the General Secretary, recognizing the
importance of their personal involvement in the development of
relations in the months ahead, instructed Secretary of State
(George) Shultz and Foreign Minister (Eduard) Shevardnadze to meet
as necesary and to report to them on ways to ensure continued
practical progress across the full range of issues. Expert-level
contacts will also continue on an intensified basis.

   Officials today said they did not
know the value of a 16th century Portuguese war ship whose treasure
was found in the Straits of Malacca.
   They denied saying the vessel, sunk in 1512, carried $3 billion
in gold and precious stones.
   News reports had quoted the Chief Minister of Malacca state,
Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik, as saying the treasure aboard the ship was
worth about $3 billion.
   Contacted by telephone, an official in the Chief Minister's
office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the chief
minister had not given any value for the treasure.
   The Star daily quoted the Chief Minister as saying, ``I never
stated the estimated value of the loot. How can we estimate things
we have never seen?''
   Earlier this week Rahim said a foreign marine group had found
the treasure in the Straits of Malacca and the state government was
contacting the federal government to negotiate for bringing up the
treasure of the Flor De La Mar.
   The ship was the flagship of Alfonso d'Albuquerque, who led an
800-strong armada that conquered Malacca in 1511.
   He was taking the booty back to Portugal when it sank.
   He managed to escape to another ship accompanying the Flor De La
Mar, but most of the treasure sank.

   Militant Sinhalese nationalists hurled
bombs and grenades at voters and polling places during provincial
elections today, killing a police officer, authorities said.
   Polls closed with less than half the eligible voters in two
provinces casting ballots, election officials estimated. An
opposition party immediately claimed fraud.
   The policeman was killed and six others wounded in two attacks
on polling places in the village of Mattugama, 35 miles southeast
of Colombo, police said.
   At Dullewa, 65 miles northeast of Colombo, gunmen jumped two
policeman who had been watching a polling place. The assailants
tied the officers to a tree and stole their automatic rifles but
did not harm them, a police spokesman said.
   Late Wednesday, an airman was killed by suspected Sinhalese
radicals who ambushed his car, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The deputy elections commissioner, Lakshman Perera, told The
Associated Press that less than 50 percent of the 3.6 million
eligible voters in the Central and Western provinces cast ballots.
   Results were not expected until Friday.
   The voting for provincial councils, in its second round today,
was called for under last July's peace accord to end the 5-year-old
revolt by militant Tamil separatists.
   The nationalist Sinhalese Liberation Front insists the accord
makes too many concessions to the minority Tamils and opposes the
councils, which are designed to give more autonomy to the provinces.
   Tamils dominate the Northern and Eastern provinces, where
polling has been postponed because of fear of violence by Tamil
separatists.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindu, comprise 18 percent of this
island nation's 16 million people. They claim discrimination by the
mostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population.
   The rest are descendants of Christian colonialists or Moslem
traders.
   On Wednesday, nationalist Sinhalese gangs burned down more than
15 government buildings, torched six buses and three trains and
killed a policeman in a bid to disrupt today's balloting.
   They also put up posters threatening to kill anyone who voted
and any shopkeepers who opened their stores for the next 36 hours.
   The government responded by tightening security and ordering
security personnel to ``shoot on sight'' anyone ``engaged in the
destruction of public property.''
   The voters cast ballots today for 158 lawmakers from 585
candidates fielded by the governing United National Party, the
Liberal Party, Sri Lanka People's Party and Moslem Congress.

<HEAD>Third Test in Month at Nevada Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third announced U.S. nuclear weapons
test in less than three weeks rocked the Nevada desert today and
registered distinctly on seismic equipment atop hotels and casinos
here, 110 miles from ground zero.
   The device buried 2,000 feet below the desert floor was
detonated at 6 a.m. in the fifth such test of the year at the
1,350-square-mile Nevada Test Site.
   The test was conducted within hours of the close of the Moscow
summit, where nuclear testing was among the topics discussed. The
Soviets and the United States formally agreed to monitor each
other's tests beginning this summer.
   The blast had an explosive force of up to 150 kilotons, or the
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The atomic bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima had a yield of 13 kilotons. All tests are listed as less
than 20 kilotons or 20 to 150 kilotons.
   Managers of high-rise buildings in Las Vegas are warned when
tests are expected to reach near the upper limit. Such a warning
was issued Tuesday.
   The blast measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, the equivalent of a
moderate to strong earthquake, at the National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   ``Everything appears normal,'' Energy Department spokeswoman
Barbara Yoerg said as she monitored the blast from a point 31 miles
from ground zero. ``Nothing is coming out of the ground.''
   The success of the underground tests is measured, in part, by
the ability to prevent radiation from leaking into the atmosphere.
   DOE seismic equipment atop the Golden Nugget and Mint hotels in
downtown Las Vegas and the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip
recorded the blast distinctly, said Ms. Yoerg.
   Security guards at several Las Vegas hotels said they did not
feel any motion from the blast, as they often do with large
detonations.
   At the time, Soviet scientists setting up monitoring equipment
at the Nevada Test Site were at Mercury, Nev., 52 miles from ground
zero.

   The wife of soul singer James Brown has
asked a judge to dismiss traffic charges against her on grounds of
diplomatic immunity.
   Adrienne Brown, 38, was charged with driving under the influence
of drugs, speeding and criminal trespass Sept. 3.
   The request for a dismissal, filed by lawyer Allen W. Johnson,
is based on a statement U.S. Rep. D. Douglas Barnard Jr. made two
years ago on James Brown Appreciation Day. ``James is indeed our
No. 1 ambassador,'' Barnard said.
   ``The accused's husband, James Brown, is America's number one
ambassador and as such should have diplomatic immunity and such
immunity extends to his wife,'' said the request filed in Richmond
County court.
   Johnson said he was working under a court-imposed deadline to
file motions in the case and was simply trying to pursue every
possible line of defense.

   Tough-guy principal Joe Clark says six
weeks of filming under way at Eastside High School may produce a
good movie but will never capture his personality.
   ``He's a good actor but I don't think anybody can fully portray
me,'' Clark said of actor Morgan Freeman on Wednesday, the first
day of filming at the inner-city school. ``There's only one Joe
Clark.''
   Clark gained national prominence and praise from the Reagan
administration by roaming the halls of Eastside with a baseball bat
and bullhorn.
   Warner Brothers decided to film his life story, ``Lean on Me''
at Eastside. Clark stands to gain a small percentage of the film's
$10 million cost, but the exact amount was not released.
   Clark called the movie ``a vindication of what I stand for'' and
said his students were holding their ``heads high, their chests are
out and joy bells are ringing in their souls.''

<HEAD>US Cruiser Watches Iranians Board, Escort Cypriot Vessel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. missile cruiser today watched an
Iranian navy frigate stop, board and then escort away a Cypriot
cargo ship apparently suspected of carrying war-related cargo for
Iraq.
   U.S. Navy officials who reported the incident in the southern
Persian Gulf said the Iranian ship, tentatively identified as the
1,540-ton frigate Alborz, was acting within maritime law that
allows for ``visit and search'' in international waters.
   There was no confrontation or exchange of radio messages between
the American warship, the 9,400-ton Vincennes, and either of the
other two vessels, according to Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a U.S.
Navy spokesman. Officials on the Vincennes watched the incident
from two miles away.
   The Cypriot ship, identified by gulf-based shipping executives
as the 10,000-ton cargo vessel Vevey, ``did not request assistance
and did not appear to be in any distress,'' Van Dyke said.
   However, he said it was the closest that any American and
Iranian warships have come to each other in the gulf since April
18, when U.S. ships and aircraft sank or disabled six Iranian craft
in a series of clashes in the southern gulf and the Strait of
Hormuz.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   ``The Vincennes had the others in view as the Iranian frigate
stopped the Cypriot ship, launched a small boat that put a search
party on board and then escorted her off in a northeasterly
direction,'' Van Dyke said.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London said the Vevey was
carrying Italian marble powder and chips to Kuwait and the Saudi
Arabian port of Jubail.
   Lloyd's said the Cypriot vessel ``apparently'' was boarded by
eight Iranians, and was being escorted to Bandar Abbas, a major
Iranian port and naval base in the Strait of Hormuz.
   Tehran considers both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to be allies of
Iraq and frequently attacks ships bound to or from ports in those
countries. It also regularly stops and searches vessels that it
suspects of carrying war-related materiel and sometimes takes the
ships into detention.
   The Vincennes, a sophisticated electronics warfare ship and the
most powerful ever deployed by the United States to the gulf, was
on its first week of patrol duty in the area, some 25 miles
northeast of Dubai.

<HEAD>Summit Ends; Reagan and Gorbachev Bid Farewell</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 2 grafs to move up quotes by Reagan and Gorbachev.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev bade
farewell at the Kremlin today, concluding a summit long on good
will but short of achievement. Gorbachev said they had moved
superpower relations ``from a dangerous track to a safer one'' and
Reagan expressed hope for ``an era of peace.''
   Ending the first visit to the Soviet Union by an American
president in 14 years, Reagan said he had been moved by the
reception he got in Moscow. Gorbachev took the occasion to prod
Reagan to move faster on the issues facing the two superpowers.
   The talks completed the most frequent superpower summits in
history, four in just 30 months, underscoring the dramatic
turnaround in U.S.-Soviet relations since the first meeting in
1985. Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon each had three summits
with their Soviet counterparts.
   Air Force One took off from Vnukovo Airport in a light drizzle
at approximately 11:15 a.m. local time. Reagan arrived at London's
Heathrow Airport just after 11:30 a.m. local time. The president
had meetings scheduled there with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Gorbachev faces, by month's end, the convening of the
first Communist Party Conference since 1941.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who flew separately to
Brussels, Belgium, to brief America's NATO allies, called the talks
``a good, realistic, businesslike summit meeting.'' And Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci flew to Tokyo. An unnamed Japanese Defense
Ministry official quoted Carlucci as saying the United States had
asked the Soviets to urge North Korea to exercise restraint during
the upcoming summer Olympic Games in Seoul.
   The meetings here produced renewed vows by leaders to improve
East-West relations and put into force the first-ever treaty to
eliminate nuclear weapons. But tensions over regional conflicts
lingered, and Reagan and Gorbachev did not advance prospects for a
long-range missile treaty in any substantive fashion.
   The Reagans said goodbye to the Gorbachevs in the same Kremlin
hall where America's first couple was greeted on Sunday. Walking
along the same red carpet in the Hall of St. George after brief
remarks, the four chatted amiably and then parted company a moment
later.
   Raisa Gorbachev presented Nancy Reagan a bouquet of roses in
what perhaps will the last encounter for two first ladies whose
relationship never was warm.
   ``This is an emotional moment for Mrs. Reagan and me,'' the
president said, telling the Gorbachevs he had seen and learned much
about ``this Moscow spring.''
   Reagan said he was impressed with the Soviet people he
encountered.
   ``At first they were curious faces, but as time went on, the
smiles began and then the waves,'' he said, ``And I don't have to
tell, you, Nancy and I smiled back and waved just as hard.''
   Gorbachev thanked Reagan for ``cooperation, openness and a
businesslike approach to the talks that we have had here.''
   But the Communist Party general secretary also said there were
missed opportunities at the Moscow summit.
   ``Our dialogue has not been easy,'' Gorbachev said, ``but we
mustered enough realism and political will to overcome obstacles
and divert the train of U.S.-Soviet relations from a dangerous
track to a safer one. It is, however, so far, been moving much more
slowly than is required... .''
   . ...''
   As Reagan traveled to Great Britain, White House chief of staff
Howard Baker told reporters aboard Air Force One that Gorbachev had
challenged the president at their windup summit meeting over the
wording of the final communique.
   Baker said the two leaders were ``going at it pretty heavy until
the end.'' Among other things, the U.S. side disagreed with some
language in the communique that was used in the context of a
broader embrace by both countries of the concept of ``peaceful
coexistence.''
   Baker said he had hoped the two sides could have gone further on
arms control, but said, ``We came out just about where it was
predicted we could come out. It would have been nice if we could
have gone any further, but nobody expected us to go any further.''
   In an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' Shultz
said, ``We had lots of things that were worked out, and we've had
some very realistic, strong discussion, where we didn't agree, and
that's in the nature of this case. ... I think it's a sign of
maturity and perhaps greater stability, that we can wrangle on
these things and agree on other things.''
   Their work done, on their final night in Moscow, the Reagans
went to the Bolshoi Ballet with the Gorbachevs and dined privately
with their hosts at a dacha in the countryside outside Moscow.
Then, the Reagans took an impromptu stroll through Red Square,
which was brightly illuminated by mobile floodlights brought in by
networks to provide a backdrop for their evening newscasts.
   ``I didn't want her to miss it,'' Reagan said, holding hands
with Nancy.
   Reagan and Gorbachev actually concluded their formal talks
Wednesday _ reporting scant progress on arms control and none on
human rights disputes.
   After five days in Moscow, Reagan will have tea with Queen
Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and dine with Mrs. Thatcher at
No. 10 Downing Street. On Friday, Reagan will deliver a post-summit
speech summing up East-West relations, then return to Washington.
   On his arrival at Heathrow Airport, Reagan was greeted by
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and a light drizzle from
overcast skies. After shaking hands and waving to a small crowd
under the watchful eyes of police guards armed with submachine
guns, the Reagans boarded a helicopter and flew to the Winfield
House residence of U.S. ambassador Charles H. Price II in Regent's
Park.
   Despite the lack of major agreements, Gorbachev called their
meetings a ``blow to the foundations of the Cold War.'' Reagan went
to extraordinary lengths to praise the Soviet leader, seemingly
absolving the Kremlin leadership for erecting barriers to
emigration. He blamed the emigration walls on the Soviet
bureaucracy, saying any government has that kind of problem.
   Arriving today at Winfield House in London, the 35-room mansion
where he will stay, Reagan was asked what he meant in Moscow when
he seemed to blame the bureaucracy for restricting emigration.
   ``I don't think I made it that definite, but that is some of the
problems there, just as there are in our country,'' he replied. ``I
was answering a question, a specific question, that is not to say
that it was not all just a bureaucracy.''
   Asked whether Gorbachev, himself, might be responsible for the
repressive laws, Reagan responded, ``I was trying to put out that
sometimes cases of that kind do not get that far up the ladder.''
   While the two leaders deepened their relationship, the
long-rumored feud between their wives flared into the open.
   Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev dropped all pretense of the
hand-holding relationship that had been portrayed earlier in the
week and competed for the spotlight in a duel that Mrs. Reagan said
ended in ``a Mexican standoff.''

   A lawyer for a former professor suing to become
the fifth woman to receive tenure in Harvard Business School's
history pressed on with the trial today rather than accept a delay
to gather more evidence.
   U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock on Wednesday ruled that
Harvard withheld key documents in the sex-discrimination case, and
he recommended suspending the non-jury trial so the attorney for
Barbara Bund Jackson could question professors who abruptly
withdrew support for her tenure bid in 1981.
   ``My fundamental view is that cases should be decided on the
merits and evidence worth submitting when possible,'' Woodlock said
today.
   But the attorney, Evan T. Lawson, said today, ``We simply don't
have the emotional resources, let alone the financial resources, to
embark on what we see as being an extremely complicated and lengthy
procedure.''
   Closing arguments then began in the trial, now in its eighth
day. Jackson contends that she was denied tenure because of her sex
and that less-qualified men than her received tenure.
   During testimony, a professor said the school's faculty voted
47-7 to support her bid for tenure but two days later backed her by
only 29-27. Tenure decisions at Harvard are submitted to the
faculty to gauge support for the professor; the actual decision
rests with the university president.
   Lawson had filed a motion seeking to sanction Harvard for
failing to provide evidence about the vote under a court order
requiring that the university turn over all documents relating to
Jackson.
   He asked the judge to bar Harvard from using the second vote to
prove its contention that Jackson was denied tenure solely because
her academic performance was below standard. But the judge denied
the request today.
   Suspending the trial would have required testimony from
professors who switched their votes and would have pushed the case
well into the fall, attorneys for both sides said.
   Lawson maintained that testimony by a Harvard professor shows
that business school Dean John H. McArthur lobbied the faculty to
switch votes to oppose Jackson, who began teaching at the school in
1973.
   Jackson resigned in 1984 after she was denied tenure a second
time, in 1983.
   At issue is the question of academic privilege, the right of a
university to keep confidential the names of professors involved in
judging candidates for tenure.
   In recommending suspending the trial, Woodlock said: ``It's a
pattern of limitations placed on proof _ limitations by
destruction, limitations by late disclosure ... and limitations on
proof by this privilege.''
   In her suit, Jackson also alleges the school destroyed documents
requested by her to support her claim that less-qualified men
received tenure from 1974 to 1984. Harvard said the destruction was
inadvertent.
   Harvard attorney Allan A. Ryan Jr. indicated the school might
risk being held in contempt of court and refuse to provide the
names of the professors to preserve their academic privilege.
   The school claims that failing to provide the 1981 votes was an
oversight and that Lawson never specifically requested the results.
   Jackson, 44, now a private marketing consultant, first applied
for tenure in 1981.
   After failing to gain tenure, Jackson was given a three-year
extension on her appointment. She submitted new academic work for
review, but in 1983 was rebuffed again. She sued in 1984.
   Three of the business school's 90 tenured professors are women.
Four women have received tenure in the business school's 80-year
history, the first in 1961.

<HEAD>Soviet-Canadian Skiers Finish 91-Day Trek Across The North Pole</HEAD>

   Soviet and Canadian skiers without vehicles or
sled dogs finished a three-month polar trek from Siberia to Canada
in sunshine and 30-degree temperatures. Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev today praised the skiers.
   A gala welcome awaits the team in Ottawa tonight.
   ``Your journey has added to trust, mutual understanding and good
neighborliness in this world,'' the official Tass news agency
quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   He praised the ``courage, true comradeship and mutual
assistance'' of the nine Soviets and four Canadians in completing
their 91-day, 1,075-mile journey across the North Pole on Wednesday.
   An expedition spokeswoman, Shirley Smyth, said the group sent a
short-wave message after leaving the shifting ice pack and reaching
Ward Hunt Island near Cape Columbia on Ellesmere Island, the
northernmost part of Canada.
   All 13 adventurers who set out March 3 from Severnaya Zemlya
Archipelago, the northernmost point in the Soviet Union, finished
the journey under the leadership of Moscow mathematician Dmitri
Shparo and Canadian mechanical engineer Richard Weber.
   Aided by good weather, they reached the North Pole on April 26
and completed the trek a few days earlier than expected, Ms. Smyth
said.
   Their worst problems were a frostbitten nose for Soviet member
Yuri Khmelevskiy and a toenail lost to the frost by Canadian Dr.
Max Buxton, who provided the emotional highlight of the trip by
proposing to his fiancee by radio message from the Arctic.
   Nancy Burton, a dental hygienist in Ottawa, accepted and will be
waiting for him in the Ellesmere settlement of Eureka.
   In a message to Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the team
said: ``We thank you for your interest in our venture and hope it
has sparked an interest and openness in many Soviets and Canadians
in the unique northern relationship between our two countries.''
   Mulroney, through an emissary in Eureka, said the group
completed the trip in ``spectacular fashion.''
   Fresh supplies were dropped to the explorers five times during
the trip, and each member carried a backpack with essentials such
as a high-protein, high-fat diet of bacon and dried fish to
maintain energy and body heat.
   ``I'm sure they're celebrating now as they do final blood tests
and take final snow samples,'' said Ms. Smyth.

<HEAD>Party Official Calls For Publication of Khrushchev Speech on
Stalin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teacher of Marxism-Leninism today renewed calls
for the publication of Nikita S. Khrushchev's 1956 ``secret
speech'' denouncing Stalin and said it is a secret only from Soviet
Communists like himself.
   ``If the party is keeping secrets from Communists in the pages
of its history that are not state secrets, then it is clear that it
doesn't serve the unity of the party,'' said V. Rusakov, dean of
the Philosophy and Scientific Communism Department at Sverdlovsk
Agricultural Institute, and a member of the party.
   Rusakov's comments appeared in an article published in today's
editions of the Sovietskaya Kultura newspaper. It appeared to be
the latest example in the leadership's campaign to open up the
pages of Soviet history.
   Khrushchev's address to the 20th Party Congress, held three
years after the death of Josef V. Stalin in 1953, detailed the
dictator's actions in the 29 years he served as Soviet leader.
   Western historians estimate that 20 million Soviets were killed
in political purges carried out under Stalin and in the drive to
collectivize agriculture.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics, Stalin's
crimes are no longer a taboo subject, and the name of Khrushchev,
who was ousted as leader in 1964, is appearing more frequently in
the press.
   The call by Rusakov to publish Khrushchev's denuncation of
Stalin is not the first. In October, prominent Soviet scientist
Vitaly I. Goldansky also said Khrushchev's report, known in the
West as his ``secret speech'' because it was delivered behind
closed doors, should be published.
   Rusakov said the text of Khrushchev's speech was leaked almost
immediately in the West.
   ``All the world a long time ago read the `secret' report by N.S.
Khrushchev ... but an overwhelming majority of Soviet Communists
don't know this document, which so radically changed the evaluation
of the development of the party and the state,'' the educator wrote.

   The distributer of ``Avanti'' strollers, sold
nationwide, is offering a kit to repair a design problem that has
resulted in cuts and other injuries to children, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said today.
   The commission said 13 instances have been reported in which
children have had their chin caught between a metal wire guide and
the arm rest, leading to mouth cuts and damaged teeth.
   Involved are ``Avanti'' strollers sold nationally by Peg Perego
U.S.A., Inc., based in Fort Wayne, Ind. The commission said 11,344
of the strollers were sold for $99 each in 1986.
   The company will provide a repair kit to close the gap between
the arm rest and guide wire. To obtain the kit and installation
instructions, consumers can call Peg Perego at 1-800-824-4000 or
write to the company at 3625 Independence Drive, Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Persons needing more information can call the commission at

<HEAD>Tobacco Co. Claims Woman's Cancer Not A Type Linked to Cigarettes</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rose Cipollone had a form of lung cancer not
usually associated with smoking, a tobacco company lawyer told a
jury hearing final arguments today in a lawsuit against three
cigarette makers.
   Lawyers representing Mrs. Cipollone's widower ``must convince
you that cigarette-smoking caused Rose Cipollone's lung cancer,''
not that smoking causes cancer in general, Lorillard Inc. attorney
Robert Northrip argued in the closely watched product liability
case.
   In his summation, he noted the testimony of medical experts for
the defense who said Mrs. Cipollone's cancer bore all the signs of
atypical carcinoid, which they contend is not statistically
associated with smoking.
   Experts for the plaintiff testified Mrs. Cipollone had small
cell carcinoma, which is tied to cigarettes, and argued that
atypical carcinoid also results from smoking.
   Antonio Cipollone accuses Lorillard, Philip Morris Inc. and
Liggett Group Inc. of misleading the public about the dangers of
smoking and contributing to his 58-year-old wife's death in 1984
after 40 years of smoking.
   On Wednesday, Liggett attorney Donald J. Cohn said Mrs.
Cipollone had a right to smoke knowing the risks, and a maker of
her cigarettes has a First Amendment right to say smoking is not a
proven cancer-cause.
   ``Mrs. Cipollone enjoyed smoking, and that was why she continued
to smoke, and she didn't want anyone to tell her not to do it,''
Cohn, who represents Liggett Group Inc., told jurors in the
courtroom packed with about 150 spectators.
   In the U.S. District Court lawsuit against Liggett, Lorillard
Inc. and Philip Morris Co., Antonio Cipollone contends they misled
the public about the dangers of cigarettes.
   If the jury awards the 64-year-old retired construction worker
damages, which are not specified, it would be the first time a
tobacco company has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by
smokers and their families.
   Attorneys for the other companies were scheduled to present
summations today.
   The case, filed in 1983, is one of fewer than a dozen smoker
liability lawsuits to reach a jury, and other lawyers bringing
similar actions say a Cipollone victory could spur a new wave of
litigation. Smoking opponents argue that a defeat for Cipollone
might permanently stifle such lawsuits because of the effort, time
and expense put into the case by his side.
   The case was expected to go to the jury Monday.
   Cohn called Mrs. Cipollone an intelligent, strong-willed person
who ``was used to making decisions for herself and family. ... She
did what she wanted to do.''
   The case rests on ``the simple proposition that if you believe
the testimony of Rose Cipollone and her family, that she smoked
cigarettes because she wanted to and because she liked to, even
though she knew the risks,'' then the jury ``should return a
verdict for Liggett and Myers,'' Cohn said.
   Cohn returned often to her own testimony, given in 1984 and read
to the jury, and noted her response during an interview with an
addiction expert who reminded her of the first Surgeon General's
report on smoking in 1964:
   ```I didn't want to hear it. I liked to smoke. I liked the way I
looked. It gave me something to do.'''
   Cipollone says the companies, through inadequate research and a
failure to publicize what they knew about the dangers of smoking,
should be held liable for damages in his wife's death.
   However, Cohn asserted that the companies had a First Amendment
right to express their belief that smoking has not been proven to
cause cancer.
   ``There was a raging controversy about smoking and health in the
press, and in a free country, people are entitled to express an
opinion, and that was what was going on,'' he said.
   Through a series of pretrial rulings and a major decision last
month by the trial judge, H. Lee Sarokin, most of Cipollone's
claims were cut from the lawsuit.
   The jury must still determine whether each company intentionally
misrepresented claims about the health consequences of smoking and
whether each conspired to do so. As for Liggett, the jury will
consider claims that the company failed to warn the public about
the risks of its products, and whether Liggett violated its
warranty duties.
   Mrs. Cipollone smoked Liggett's cigarettes before 1966, the year
warnings were put on cigarette packs. The courts have ruled that
the warnings pre-empt failure-to-warn claims after that year.
   Both sides presented dozens of witnesses, including company
executives, company researchers, physicians, medical experts,
advertising and marketing experts and Cipollone family members.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis canceled today's debate with Jesse Jackson and was
returning home to Boston to be with his wife who was to undergo
surgery, a spokesman said.
   Dukakis, who flew to California late Wednesday for campaign
appearances and then the debate in Los Angeles, hoped to resume his
schedule by Saturday, said campaign spokesman Mark Gearan.
   Gearan said Kitty Dukakis would be operated on Friday for two
herniated cervical disks in her neck.
   He said there were no other problems beyond the disks. He said
Mrs. Dukakis underwent tests recently while in California and her
doctors in Boston decided an operation was required after reviewing
the results.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital
Wednesday night. She told told reporters at Logan International
Airport as she arrived in town that she had begun to experience
numbness in her hands and fingers about a month ago and called a
family doctor.
   ``He and I felt at that time it was just stress,'' she said,
adding that her symptoms worsened in recent weeks.
   Her husband had resumed his California campaign earlier today,
five days before the state's big primary.
   Dukakis has been campaigning this week in New Jersey, which also
holds its primary on Tuesday, along with New Mexico and Montana.
   The Massachusetts governor is far ahead of Jackson in the
nationwide delegate tally, and is heavily favored to win the
primary here.
   In recent days, however, Dukakis has been engaged in a delicate
minuet with Jackson over his rival's role in the fall campaign.
   Dukakis, who says he won't pick a running mate until after the
final primaries June 7, lauded Jackson's strong campaign.
   ``He's somebody who has done a remarkable job, has great gifts
and great strengths. I respect and admire him a lot,'' Dukakis told
reporters in Boston.
   The Massachusetts governor was questioned about Jackson's role
one day after Jackson said in New Jersey that he felt he had
``earned consideration'' for the second spot on the ballot.
   Asked if that was so, Dukakis responded, ``Because he has done
so well, of course he does.''
   He added that all of the Democratic presidential candidates had
earned the standing within the party to be considered for the
ticket.
   But when asked if Jackson deserved any special consideration by
virtue of having compiled the second-highest number of delegates,
Dukakis answered with a blunt ``No.''
   In a speech on Wednesday, Dukakis stressed his commitment to
expanding opportunities for higher education, calling it a
prerequisite for full participation in the nation's economic future.
   ``We need a president who will end the annual assault on Pell
Grants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students,'' Dukakis
said. ``We need to put our smartest investment bankers and college
administrators to work helping states to create college opportunity
funds.''
   Speaking at the state's newest community college in Boston's
Roxbury section, the traditional core of the city's black
community, the governor called for a new nationwide college loan
program.
   ``We can develop an approach based on the same principles as
Social Security that will keep faith with the next generation,'' he
said.
   Dukakis said his program would provide tuition loans to needy
students. After graduation, students would repay the loans through
payroll withholding, thus ensuring that the governnment would not
be saddled with unpaid loans.

   ``We do have one fatality and possibly more,'' said Sgt. Ron

   If nothing else, the Moscow summit was a public
relations triumph for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Although it produced little progress on arms control, the
Reagan-Gorbachev summit showed the Soviets at their best under the
intense scrutiny of 5,000 Soviet and foreign journalists who
crowded central Moscow.
   Soviet officials were accessible and doggedly spontaneous.
Ever-hovering KGB agents were usually young and well-dressed.
Streets were swept clean and restaurants offered two Moscow
rarities: attentive service and fresh vegetables.
   Even the weather cooperated. It didn't start raining until
President Reagan was ready to leave Vnukovo Airport.
   Veteran Moscow observers said the Soviets, in style if not in
substance, are increasingly emulating the West.
   One little-known reason why the new Soviet image appeals to
Americans is that Soviet officials have frequently but quietly
sought PR advice from Americans.
   U.S. image-makers responded with a variety of suggestions. They
said security agents should wear lighter, less drab colors, and
Soviet officials should favor open-collared shirts instead of ties
and try to be more accessible.
   They also suggested that Soviet analysts establish eye contact
because, as one public relations specialist explained, ``it
connotes trust.''
   ``The Soviets certainly don't want to give Americans the credit,
but there is no denying that some things went off very well because
of both our input and their observance of us at the previous three
summits,'' said John S. Kavulich, chairman of a Washington, D.C.,
marketing firm that has worked with the Soviets since 1986.
   ``Officials from Gorbachev on down weren't running away from the
television cameras, they were stepping up to them,'' Kavulich said.
``The Soviets usually carried off media events with a flair. And
they reinforced the idea that they have a sense of humor.''
   In a move clearly intended to appeal to Westerners, the official
Soviet news agency Tass sold summit T-shirts, buttons, records and
tapes for foreign currency. It was the first time that Tass had
lent its name to a commercial enterprise.
   Some observers suggested the Soviets might even have worked some
magic with the weather, using chemicals to disperse rain clouds as
they did in 1986 for the Goodwill Games and the 1985 opening of the
World Youth Festival.
   There were some glitches. Hours after President and Mrs. Reagan
arrived Sunday for the five-day summit, they took an unscheduled
stroll along Moscow's pedestrian mall on Arbat Street.
   Soviet agents obviously were unprepared for presidential
spontaneity. Forcing themselves between the Reagans and the Soviet
crowd, the agents jostled the president and the startled first lady
as well as journalists and passers-by.
   ``The Soviets knew the Reagans would have some spontaneous event
to match Gorbachev's walk along Connecticut Avenue'' during the
Washington summit in December, Kavulich said.
   ``Agents on the street were told to let the president approach a
crowd of Muscovites if he wants. But apparently, for the agents,
acting as a wedge between Soviets and foreigners was almost a
reflexive action,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, as one U.S. diplomat said privately, ``The Soviets
are probably patting themselves on the back. They went every night
into homes throughout America, and as each night passed, they
became more familiar and more welcome guests.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis cut short a California campaign trip
and canceled today's debate with Jesse Jackson to return to Boston
where his wife faced surgery to relieve neck pain. Jackson was
meeting today with juvenile gangs in Los Angeles while Republican
George Bush relaxed in Maine.
   Bush has been making few public appearances in recent days while
President Reagan has been at the summit in Moscow. However, Bush
did hint in an interview published today that embattled Attorney
General Edwin Meese III could be hurting his candidacy.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson had flown to California Wednesday night
for campaigning in the days leading up to next Tuesday's primary,
the last and biggest delegate prize of the long primary season.
   However, Dukakis was flying right back to Massachusetts after a
single morning campaign appearance today, said spokesman Mark
Gearan.
   Gearan said Kitty Dukakis would be operated on Friday for two
herniated cervical disks in her neck. She had felt pain and
numbness for about a month, he said, and doctors believed it was
``a degenerative condition'' rather than the result of a single
injury.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital
Wednesday night. She told told reporters her symptoms had worsened
in recent weeks.
   Bush was spending a final full day today at his oceanside
retreat in Kennebunkport, and the only order of business was having
his boat checked for safety by the Coast Guard.
   The vice president has been holding strategy sessions with
advisers all week, and one of the key topics has been possible
issues on which Bush will set himself apart from his popular boss.
   Reagan has given his full support to Meese, who is under
investigation by an independent counsel. But Bush, in an interview
with The New York Times, hinted that if Meese's woes continue, the
matter could be a campaign liability for him. The Democrats have
been using the issue for months to attack him.
   ``I think he's been made aware by the polls and by a lot of
public comment that there is the danger that this matter, if it
stays exactly the way it is, could not only adversely affect me,
but affect others as well,'' Bush said of Meese in the interview,
published today.
   Bush said over the weekend that he had met recently with Meese,
and the attorney general had promised not to do anything that would
harm his campaign. Meese said Monday in a Cable News Network
interview, however, that he believed the Justice Department's
record would be an asset to any Republican candidate.
   Bush told the Times he expected to meet with Meese again soon.
   Dukakis, who has an all-but insurmountable delegate lead, has
been beset by questions all week about Jackson's role in the fall
campaign. Both men have said Jackson will play a major but as yet
undetermined part in the expected race against Bush.
   Jackson, campaigning in New Jersey on Wednesday, asserted for a
second day in a row that he has earned consideration as a potential
running mate.
   Dukakis agreed with that, but balked when asked if Jackson, in
view of his demonstrated vote-getting ability, had any special
claim on the No. 2 spot.
   ``No,'' the Massachusetts governor said flatly. But he also said
of his rival: ``I respect and admire him a lot.''
   Jackson, who drew overwhelming black support in the primary
contests, has been stressing that the party needs him in order to
win the general election.
   Party officials appear mindful of that. Democratic National
Committee chairman Paul Kirk announced Wednesday that a 15-member
platform-drafting panel would be headed up by Rep. William Gray of
Pennsylvania, a Jackson supporter.
   However, Dukakis was predicting he could draw ``genuine and
deep'' black support in his own right.
   The governor, who started off the week by meeting with black
supporters, made a campaign-style visit on Wednesday to a community
college in the predominantly black Roxbury section of Boston.
There, he cited a groundswell of black backing for his candidacy.
   ``I sense it,'' he said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, was marching through the Los Angeles ghetto
of Watts, which was torn by riots in the 1960s. ``Where you
struggle I will struggle,'' he told cheering supporters Wednesday
night.
   Jackson was also meetig today with members of the rival Crips
and Bloods gangs. The bloody battles of Los Angeles gangs were
dramatized in the recent movie ``Colors.''
   Campaign aides said they believed it would be the first time the
rival gang leaders got together.
   While Dukakis and Jackson prepared for the primary finale, a
past Democratic presidential contender jumped into the race.
   Former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, whose campaign two decades ago was
a rallying point for opponents of the Vietnam War, announced his
candidacy on Wednesday in Philadelphia. McCarthy, 72, is running on
the Consumer Party ticket in his fourth presidential effort.
   He ran as a Democrat in 1968 and 1972 and as an independent in
1976.
   ``This year the one thing we have to do is shake up the
two-party system, and that's what I hope to do,'' he said.
   McCarthy dismissed the likely Republican and Democratic nominees.
   ``There are two kinds of people who don't make good presidents _
vice presidents and governors,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' economic policies came under fire from the
Bush camp.
   Former deputy treasury secretary Richard Darman, who met with
the vice president on Wednesday, emerged to ridicule the
``Massachusetts miracle,'' the economic boom in his state that
Dukakis frequently cites on the campaign trail. Darman called it
the ``Massachusetts mirage.''

   Government prosecutors Thursday
arrested two senior officials of Hyundai Engineering and
Construction Co. and charged them with paying a group of men to
kidnap a labor organizer.
   The prosecutors said they are trying to determine whether other
Hyundai officials were involved in the kidnapping. The organizer
was freed after several days when he resigned as an employee of the
construction company.
   Earlier Thursday, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks at
the headquarters of the giant Hyundai group in Seoul to protest the
kidnapping at the Hyundai subsidiary. No injuries were reported.
   The arrests and the attack by the students came as labor unrest
continued at three other Hyundai plants in southern South Korea.
The Hyundai group is one of the largest conglomerates in the nation.
   In Ulsan, management on Wednesday locked out 20,000 striking
workers at Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest automaker, and
said there was little chance of settling the strike for higher
wages. The walkout began Monday.
   At Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., which makes trains,
management and leaders of the 4,000 strikers held two rounds of
talks Thursday but failed to end a one-week strike at the company's
plants in Ulsan and Changwon.
   The talks were held one day after strikers freed one of the 11
executives they took hostage on Friday. They were still holding 10
executives on Thursday.
   Strikers at Hyundai Motors want raises of up to $180 a month,
against a company offer of $105. The workers earn an average of
$750 after five years.
   Hyundai Precision on Thursday offered to raise workers' pay $85
a month, but workers stuck to their demand of a $180 increase. They
earn $600 a month.
   ``Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the students
shouted as they hurled rocks at the Hyundai group's main building
in Seoul, breaking four windows. The students ran away before
police arrived.
   Several hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested
two Hyundai Engineering officials, executive board member Choi
Jae-dong, 47, and manager for general affairs Kang Myung-ku, 42,
and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizer
Suh Jung-ui, 34.
   Suh was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as he
left a Seoul restaurant where he had met with some officials of the
construction company, which is based in Seoul.
   Suh, who worked at the company's Seoul headquarters, returned
home several days later and said he was released after he agreed to
write a letter of resignation addressed to the company.
   Hyundai Engineering denied involvement at the time.
   Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of the
alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in Seoul
and other cities.
   Their leader told police Hyundai Engineering executives offered
him $27,000 to kidnap Suh and persuade him to drop his labor
organizing effort.

   A man who fired a shotgun at a drawing by Leonardo

indefinitely in a high-security mental hospital.
   Robert Cambridge, 37, was sent to Broadmoor asylum last December
after being convicted of blasting the priceless artwork on July 17,
1987, in a social protest.
   Judge Richard Lowry of the Old Bailey Criminal Court said after
reviewing a psychiatrict report that Cambridge should remain at
Broadmoor because he was a danger to the public.
   Cambridge blasted a six-inch gash in Leonardo's 450-year-old
charcoal and chalk drawing of the Virgin Mary with the Infant Jesus
and two saints. It is undergoing restoration.
   He said he attacked to demonstrate his disgust with ``political,

<HEAD>Farm Exports Soar to Highest Levels Since 1984</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm exports posted their highest levels in
more than three years in March as the U.S. agricultural trade
balance ran in the black for a fifth straight month, USDA
economists say.
   ``Agriculture is making an important contribution to the trade
balance of the United States,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng said Wednesday in a speech to the National Press Club before
the figures were released.
   He predicted export sales this year of around $33 billion and a
farm trade surplus of perhaps $12 billion.
   Exports in March soared to 14.8 million tons valued at $3.3
billion, compared with 11.4 million tons valued at $2.4 billion the
same month a year earlier. It was the best monthly performance
since December 1984.
   The nation's agricultural trade surplus in March was $1.38
billion, also the largest since December 1984. It was the fifth
straight month that the nation has posted a surplus of $1 billion
or more.
   USDA said fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through March totaled
77.3 million tons valued at $17.8 billion. It said that represented
an increase of 13.6 million tons and $3.3 billion from the same
period last year.
   Soviet purchases have accounted for 68 percent of the volume
increase this year.
   Department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988 exports
totaling 145.5 million tons and valued at $33.5 billion. That
represents an increase over initial estimates. The higher forecasts
are due to additional sales of animal products, as well as wheat,
feeds and fodders and soybeans.
   Animal products are likely to set a record of $5.6 billion,
attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides, skins, red
meats and fats, the department said.
   The department also said exports are likely to be 16 million
tons and $5.6 billion higher than fiscal 1987. It attributed the
bulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitor
nations and the Export Enhancement Program.
   The EEC, established by Congress in 1985, pays exporters in
government surplus commodities to ship American grain overseas.
   Estimated U.S. agricultural imports, meanwhile, were increased
from $20.5 billion to $21 billion. It said imports for March
totaled $1.95 billion, a gain of $35 million, or 2 percent, over
the comparable figure for March 1987. It also was $24 million, or 1
percent, over the February level.
   The volume of imports was virtually unchanged since last year,
with fruit juices, nursery products and alcoholic beverages
actually posting declines, USDA said. It said, however, the lower
dollar raised the overall import bill.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng is
calling on European Community trade negotiators to come up with
their own plan to phase out farm subsidies if they dislike the
American version.
   ``We've been unable to get the European Community even to state
what the outcome should be,'' Lyng said at a National Press Club
luncheon Wednesday.
   He said the United States is not insisting on its plan to phase
out all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 and is ``perfectly
willing to sit down and be involved in negotiations,'' but that
thus far European trade officials have indicated little interest in
such bargaining.
   ``They won't come up with any sort of proposal,'' he said.
   He expressed hope, however, that some progress could be made in
Montreal in December at the midterm meeting of the Uruguay Round of
negotiations aimed at updating the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
   ``We must make this work because the alternatives are so bad,''
Lyng said. He said the current system of subsidies is harmful to
European and American farmers as well as the economies of
developing nations. But he said the United States could not act
unilaterally.
   ``Our farmers are willing to compete with farmers anywhere but
they do not want to compete with the treasuries of foreign
governments,'' he said.
   Lyng also shrugged off European criticism that the United States
has increased wheat production when Europe has been reducing its
own wheat production.
   ``I have been unable to detect any reductions in European
production,'' he said. He said the United States already has idled
acreage equivalent to all of the farmland in France and Spain
together while ``the reductions they are talking about are
pipsqueak when they are compared to our reductions.''
   The administration recently changed the acreage idling
requirement for participants in the wheat program from 27{ percent
to 10 percent.

   U.S. Ambassador John Kelly's car was hit
with one bullet during a brief exchange of gunfire between his
bodyguards and a Christian militia patrol in east Beirut on
Thursday, police reported.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``The ambassador and all his escorts are fine.'' He refused
to elaborate.
   In another development, the Shiite Moslem Amal militia on
Thursday denied it has custody of three American professors and an
Indian professor kidnapped in 1987.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in line
with regulations, said one bullet hit the hood of Kelly's
armor-plated dark blue Chevrolet in an ``accidental exchange of
automatic fire.''
   He said the gunfire occurred around noon when Kelly's Lebanese
and American bodyguards in two escort cars fired in the air with
automatic rifles ``apparently to make way for the ambassador's
convoy'' in a traffic-jammed street in the Sin Fil neighborhood.
   Kelly's motorcade was heading to the heavily guarded U.S.
Embassy compound in the suburb of Aukar, north of Beirut.
   The spokesman said a militia patrol from President Amin
Gemayel's rightist Phalange Party, which was in the area, ``opened
fire in the air too in an effort to stop Kelly's convoy to check
what was happening.''
   ``Kelly's bodyguards fired three bullets at the Phalangists in a
white Mercedes-Benz and the patrol fired back. No casualties were
reported among the Phalangist militiamen,'' he said.
   ``Kelly's car was hit with one bullet in the hood and the convoy
continued on its way to the embassy,'' the spokesman added. He did
not elaborate.
   Hassan Youssef, foreign relations spokesman for the
Syrian-backed Amal militia, said a report by The Times of London
that the four kidnapped professors were believed to be in Amal's
hands was ``untrue and totally baseless.''
   The four are Americans Robert Polhill, Jesse Turner and Alann
Steen, and Indian Mithileshwar Singh. They were kidnapped on the
campus of Beirut University College Jan. 24, 1987.
   The Times also said that Amal leader Nabih Berri had scheduled a
news conference for this week and that ``there is understandable
speculation that this may be to announce the hostages' release.''
   ``Amal's standard policy denounces kidnapping,'' Youssef said.
   An underground faction calling itself Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine claimed to have abducted the four educators
and has demanded Israel free 400 Arab prisoners.
   Fourteen other foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon _ six
Americans, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman
and two unidentified men. Most are believed to be held by Shiite
extremists.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In another development, police said three members of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, were wounded in a brief
firefight with rival Shiite Moslem militiamen in south Beirut on
Wednesday night.
   Another police spokesman said the three Hezbollahis were injured
in a five-minute exchange of fire with members of the Amal militia
in south Beirut's Shiyah district. Syrian troops ``intervened and
brought the firefight to an end,'' the spokesman said.
   The clash was the first reported between the two sides since
Syria deployed 2,400 troops in south Beirut on Friday and Saturday,
ending three weeks of clashes between the two rival militias that
killed nearly 300 people and wounded 1,000.
   Amal, Arabic for Hope, accused Hezbollah of provoking the clash
and said the three wounded Shiite militiamen were armed with
silencer-equipped pistols.
   Hezbollah said Amal militiamen opened fire at the three
``unarmed'' Hezbollahis as they drove to Shiyah to check on their
apartments.

   The Swedish navy detonated depth
charges and anti-submarine grenades off the southern Baltic Sea
coast Thursday in the second hunt this week for underwater prowlers.
   Per Brissman, a defense staff spokesman, said electronic
monitors picked up signs of ``foreign underwater activity'' during
a navy exercise outside Oxelosund, 60 miles south of Stockholm.
   He said the sub hunters exploded several depth charges and
Elma-grenades, a Swedish weapon designed to pierce a 1-inch hole in
a hull to cripple a vessel without destroying it.
   On Monday, the Swedish military set off a mine outside the Musko
naval base south of Stockholm after a warning system indicated a
possible intruder.
   Sweden has not identified the nationality of submarines the
military says have repeatedly snooped in Swedish waters. The last
submarine caught was a Soviet vessel that ran aground outside a
naval base in 1981.

   A flash flood on the Kushiara River
washed away an entire village of more than 200 people, officials
reported Thursday.
   All 46 families were feared drowned when the rush of water swept
through Sengram village Tuesday, but rescue workers continued
searching the banks downstream, said officials in the Sylhet
district near the Indian border 100 miles northeast of Dhaka.
   Thousands of people in Sylhet and the neighboring Sunamganj
district have fled their homes in the past week because of floods
along the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries. Communication with
the region has been difficult because of disruptions in telephone
and rail service.
   Kazi Feroze Rashid, regional relief minister, visited the
affected areas earlier in the week and told Parliament on Wednesday
at least 16 people were known to have been killed.
   Rescue workers and others in the Sylhet area say they believe
nearly 50 people have died, not including residents of Sengram
village who may have drowned.
   Rashid said more than 300,000 people have been forced from their
homes and 400 square miles of crops damaged.
   Floods often occur at the start of the monsoon season in
Bangladesh, a nation of 105 million. Last year, the worst flooding
in 70 years killed at least 1,500 people and displaced about
one-quarter of the population.

   Ryan White, a 16-year-old Indiana boy with AIDS,
went to the head of the class _ to answer fifth-graders' questions
about the deadly disease.
   Wednesday's question-and-answer session at P.S. 87 in Manhattan
was recorded for a television special on AIDS to be broadcast this
fall on the Children's Television Workshop program ``3-2-1
Contact.''
   White, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from a blood
transfusion, assured students, ``You can't get AIDS from sitting
next to someone with AIDS ... or using the same bathroom or kissing
someone.''
   Asked about reaction to his disease _ the White family was
ostracized, their car tires slashed, their house pelted with eggs _
he said: ``It hurt but I tried to ignore the name-calling and stuff
like that. ... I don't want anyone to go through what I went
through.''
   Students said they profited from the session. ``At first I
thought I could get AIDS from just touching someone,'' said
Jessalyn Sanchez. ``Now I know you don't.''
   Added Stephanie Pitsirilos: ``I'll remember that even if someone
has AIDS, you can't judge him.''

   Edwin R. Everett, 31, was charged with burglary and possession

   Everett used a fishing line, hook and sinker tied to a tree
branch to try to lift money from two banks Monday and Tuesday,
Police Chief Ed Taber said.
   Two bags containing $504 in cash and $979 in checks were stolen
from one bank, Taber said. The fishing line and hook snagged in the
other bank's slot, and no money was taken, the chief added. The
stolen money was not recovered.

   The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal
against back taxes and penalties by the Church of Scientology,
leaving in place the 1967 revocation of its tax exemption.
   The high court declined to review lower court decisions
penalizing the group for tax deficiencies in 1970, 1971 and 1972,
holding that large amounts of its monies claimed as tax-exempt went
for private enrichment of Scientology's late founder L. Ron Hubbard
and his wife, Mary Sue Hubbard.
   The U.S. Tax Court had ruled that $3.5 million was deposited in
Swiss banks through a bogus trust in those years, much of it later
removed to a safe on a yacht, Apollo, on which the Hubbards had
taken up residence in the Mediterranean. He died in 1986.
   However, the group continues to function, pressing lawsuits
claiming its ``E-meter'' auditing is religious and exempt from
taxes levied against its income.

   Workers digging feverishly through
tons of debris pulled 12 bodies from a coal shaft rocked by a
fierce explosion and officials said they were certain all 57 miners
had been killed.
   Today, Gottfried Milde, the Hesse state interior minister, said
36 bodies had been found in the shaft. Among those killed was an
18-year-old on his first day at work.
   It was West Germany's worst mining accident in more than 26
years.
   At least 14 of the men trapped were Turkish immigrant workers.
Some of the victims had survived the blast but died when their
emergency masks ran out of oxygen, officials said.
   Family and friends had kept an all-night vigil in this mining
town 70 miles northeast of Frankfurt, waiting for the latest word
on Wednesday's disaster, which officials attributed to a methane
gas buildup.
   Today, rescue workers used extra-sensitive listening devices,
searching without success for any signs of life or tapping.
   ``The chances of finding any survivors have sunk to zero,'' said
Hesse state mining director Wolf Boettcher.
   Erwin Braun, head of the Hesse state mining board, told
reporters today that the explosion was caused by a methane gas
buildup and said he feared none of the 57 miners who were 330 feet
underground during the blast had survived.
   ``Rescue work is being hindered by heavy damage, and rescue
teams can proceed only with oxygen masks,'' he said, explaining
that there was still the danger of a methane gas buildup in the
mine.
   Braun said carbon monoxide levels inside the mine had receded,
but were still severe.
   Some of the dead were found with their miners' breathing masks
on, he said, which means they survived the blast and apparently ran
out of air. The breathing devices provide about three hours' of
oxygen.
   Other miners were killed by the explosion itself and will be
hard to identify because of the extent of their injuries, Braun
said.
   The blast blew the roofs off at least three work buildings at
the mine, knocked down sheds and shattered windows. Eight miners on
the surface were critically injured by flying debris.
   ``My son Dieter is down there. He's been a miner for 20 years,''
said Werner Henke, an elderly man who was waiting overnight at his
son's house.
   ``God let him be alive. He has two small children,'' Henke,
brushing away tears, told The Associated Press.
   In a building not far from the mine shaft, wives and other
relatives of the missing workers were consoling each other, but
even they expressed little hope their loved ones would be saved.
   ``That was an incredible explosion,'' said 60-year-old Gerhard
Hettmanczyk, whose son-in-law Alfred Wiremba was among the missing.
   ``I don't see how anyone could have survived,'' said the somber
Hettmanczyk, who was going home after waiting hours for good news.
   Three rescue workers were being treated at a hospital after
inhaling fumes from carbon monoxide that was released in the blast,
but their lives were not in danger, Mayor Hessler said.
   About 30 rescuers worked inside the mine through the night.
Hundreds of others worked under floodlights above ground, pumping
fresh air into the shaft and acting as support for the rescue teams.
   ``The air is very bad in there,'' said Klaus Hausmann, a
blackened miner who was helping outside. ``Things do not look so
good _ everything is blocked off.''
   Most of the miners in the shaft at the time of the blast were in
their 30s and 40s and some of them were Turks, officials said.
   Some relatives of the missing began leaving the mine area late
Wednesday night as hopes faded.
   About 170 people had been employed at the brown-coal mine owned
by Preussen Elektra of Hanover, one of the largest West German
utility companies.
   The mine is set in a field, with the nearest homes about 500
yards away.

   If you can't park, you may still be able to
drive under new license rules being promulgated in Wisconsin.
   Parallel parking, that nemisis of beginning drivers, has been
removed on a trial basis from requirements for a license, but some
examiners are not pleased, said Dennis Nussbaum, district manager
with the state Division of Motor Vehicles.
   ``Road tests are a lot like mom, apple pie and Chevrolet, and
some people don't like to see changes,'' he said.
   The parallel parking change is one of several designed to ease
the job of license examiners and reduce waiting times for tests,
Nussbaum said. It became effective Wednesday.
   ``We don't think that any of this will affect safety,'' Nussbaum
added.
   Over the years, the state has instituted new tests that
officials say more accurately check skills at such things as
high-speed driving and lane-changing maneuvers.
   ``Most people don't even use parallel parking any more,''
Nussbaum said.
   Nussbaum said the changes would remain in effect at least
through the summer and were made ``because we are in the service
business.''

   Being the ambassador of soul is just as good
as being an ambassador from Seoul, according to a lawyer for James
Brown's wife.
   Attorney Allen W. Johnson has asked a Richmond County State
Court judge to dismiss misdemeanor traffic charges on grounds that
Adrienne Brown has diplomatic immunity.
   Mrs. Brown, 38, was charged with driving under the influence of
drugs, speeding and criminal trespass Sept. 3, 1987.
   The motion is based on a statement U.S. Rep. D. Douglas Barnard
Jr. made two years ago on James Brown Appreciation Day.
   Quoth the congressman: ``James is indeed our No. 1 ambassador.''
   Said Johnson's motion: ``The accused's husband, James Brown, is
America's No. 1 ambassador and as such should have diplomatic
immunity and such immunity extends to his wife, the accused
herein.''
   Brown is more commonly known as the ``godfather of soul''
because of such hits as ``Poppa's Got A Brand New Bag,'' ``Sex
Machine'' and ``I Feel Good.'' Seoul is the capital of South Korea.
   The Browns have recently had several highly publicized fights.
Brown has said he plans to file for divorce.
   Mrs. Brown has pleaded innocent in the traffic case. In
explaining his motion, Johnson said he was working under a
court-imposed deadline and was trying to pursue every possible
avenue of defense.
   Diplomatic immunity is designed to protect officials of foreign
nations while they represent their countries in the United States
and would not generally apply to American citizens.

   Who wouldn't be disappointed if they had a
date with a teen-age rock star and she didn't show?
   You can certainly count Judge Richard Hubbell among the unhappy.
Tiffany, the 16-year-old singer who wants to be independent, just
couldn't make it to a Superior Court session on her guardianship
petition.
   You see, she was in Germany on a promotional tour. First things
first. So instead, she sent her lawyers.
   Well, Hubbell couldn't impose a curfew or cut her allowance, but
he did give her an order _ no more career or travel plans without
court approval.
   ``She simply can't ignore a valid court order,'' Hubbell told
the attorneys representing Tiffany, her mother Jane C. Williams,
and her aunt, Julie Abbas.
   Hubbell issued Tiffany a rain check for June 9, the day she's
scheduled to return from Europe. He set the same deadline for a
report by an independent attorney who is going over the teen-ager's
recording and management contracts.
   The MCA recording star, whose full name is Tiffany Renee
Darwish, ran away from home because she said Mrs. Williams was
hampering her career.
   She is seeking to free herself from her mother's legal custody,
and accused her mother in an emancipation request of ``hindering my
career and jeopardizing my future.''
   Mrs. Williams contended Tiffany's contracts unfairly award most
of $5 million in record royalties, concert proceeds and other
revenue to her manager, George Tobin.
   Wednesday's hearing was scheduled to determine whether Ms.
Abbas, Tiffany's temporary legal guardian, would be named permanent
guardian.

   Everybody at Eastside High School is going
batty over a movie about tough-guy Principal Joe Clark.
   Except Joe Clark. He's not sure actor Morgan Freeman is up to
the role.
   ``He's a good actor but I don't think anybody can fully portray
me,'' Clark said Wednesday. ``There's only one Joe Clark.''
   ``Lean on Me'' began filming Wednesday at the inner-city high
school Clark made famous. Students sought autographs, a teacher got
a part, and school bells interrupted filming.
   Clark, who gained national prominence by roaming the halls of
Eastside with a baseball bat and bullhorn, is being paid a small
part of the film's $10 million budget, but the exact amount was not
released.
   The movie is ``a vindication of what I stand for,'' Clark said.
He said his students are holding their ``heads high, their chests
are out and joy bells are ringing in their souls.''

   After all that Monkey Business last year, Lynn
Armandt has gotten down to business. She's selling shoes.
   ``Sometimes (customers) make the connection when I hand them my
card,'' Armandt said Wednesday.
   The connection involves a yacht trip Armandt took last year to
Bimini with Donna Rice and then presidential contender Gary Hart.
After that jaunt was revealed, Armandt moved here from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
   Hart probably wishes Armandt had moved a bit earlier _ Rice
claims Armandt sold a picture of Rice in Hart's lap to a
supermarket tabloid _ but Armandt didn't want to talk about all
that.
   ``That's in the past,'' she said. ``After a wild month of May
last year, things have been quiet.''
   She said she hasn't talked to Rice since. ``I haven't talked to
Mr. Hart, either,'' Armandt said.

still, Princess Diana wasn't too happy behind bars.
   The princess, opening a new magistrate's court in Lewes, 50

   ``I got the impression she had not been in cells before,'' said
jailer Tom Dowse. ``She said it would be rather claustrophobic and

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Named Head Of Iran's Armed Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Thursday
appointed Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani acting
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces after major military
defeats on land and sea.
   The appointment increased the political power of the man
Iranians call ``the shark.'' Iran's official media, monitored in
Nicosia, reported that Khomeini, who has held the title of
commander-in-chief, gave Rafsanjani ``full authority'' to take over
control of military affairs.
   Rafsanjani's appointment followed a disastrous confrontation
with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf and two defeats on the
battlefield in which the Iraqis drove the Iranians out of their two
main footholds inside Iraq.
   Tehran Radio said in a commentary, ``It is hoped that this
transfer of power will be the beginning of major developments on
the battlefield.''
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said President Ali Khamenei had
asked Khomeini to appoint Rafsanjani as the ``only suitable person
to be assigned this important responsibility ... to manage affairs
... in a decisive manner.''
   Khamenei is chairman of the Supreme Defense Council which, with
Khomeini's approval, decides Iran's military strategy in the war
against Iraq.
   Rafsanjani, 53, is Khomeini's representative on the council and
has long been considered the most powerful figure in Iran after
Khomeini.
   Khomeini's decision to hand over military power to one of his
closest aides raised speculation that the revolutionary patriarch's
health is deteriorating. Khomeini is 87 and has long been reported
to be in poor health.
   Rafsanjani is now well-placed to emerge as the kingmaker in the
power struggle, already under way, that will climax when Khomeini
dies.
   Khomeini has designated Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri as his
successor, but Montazeri does not have a significant power base and
is opposed by many Iranian leaders.
   It is widely believed that Rafsanjani and his allies will be the
power behind the throne in the post-Khomeini era. Big gains by
radicals, backed by Khomeini, in two-stage parliamentary elections
in April and May at the expense of conservatives helped bolster
Rafsanjani's political influence.
   Rafsanjani, nicknamed ``the shark'' because of his political
acumen, is expected to seek to galvanize Iran's military,
dispirited after its defeats, and the nation's 50 million people
who appear to be growing weary of the war.
   ``This appointment is highly significant. We're going to see a
whole new ball game now,'' Hans-Heino Kopietz, a military analyst
with the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies, said in a telephone interview.
   Khomeini's decree said Rafsanjani was ordered to set up a
``general command headquarters and organize the full coordination
of the armed forces, the Revolutionary Guards, the security forces
and volunteer mobilization forces.''
   That suggested an intensified effort to weld Iran's military
forces into a more cohesive force than they have been.
   Deep-rooted rivalry between the increasingly powerful
Revolutionary Guards Corps and the regular army, still tainted by
its links to the late shah, have bedeviled military strategy for
years.
   Rafsanjani is closely linked with the 350,000-man Revolutionary
Guards, known as Pasdaran. Its main commanders, Mohsen Rafiq-Doust
and Mohsen Rezai, are both staunch Rafsanjani supporters.
   Diplomats with contacts in Tehran reported that the relative
ease with which the Iraqis overran the Iranians in the Faw
Peninsula of southern Iraq April 18 and at a bridgehead east of the
port city of Basra on May 25 was a severe jolt to the Iranian
hierarchy.
   Rafsanjani's appointment came as military analysts expected the
Tehran hierarchy to reassess its strategy of attrition against Iraq
following Iran's twin defeats.
   Changes had been expected to accelerate after radicals and
militants, many of them Rafsanjani's allies, made major gains in
the parliamentary elections.
   Khomeini's decree, as broadcast by Tehran Radio, stressed the
need for ``complete unity'' in the armed forces and the need to
reorganize logistics, military-related industry and training toward
``specific objectives.''
   Rafsanjani declared Iran was ``at war'' with the United States
last month after the U.S. Navy sank or disabled six Iranian
vessels, including two frigates, in clashes in the Persian Gulf on
April 18.
   After the loss of Faw, Khomeini replaced the armed forces chief
of staff, Brig. Gen. Ismael Sohrabi, with a little-known officer,
Col. Ali Shahbazi, and promoted him to Brigadier General.
   Western military analysts said at the time that ``more heads are
expected to roll.'' But the Iranians have not announced any other
command changes.
   Khomeini said in a speech read out at the inauguration of the
new Parliament last week that the war would be decided on the
battlefield, not the negotiating table. That indicated the
revolutionary patriarch was determined to avenge the Faw and Basra
defeats.
   U.S. Defense Department analysts said in Washington that Iraq's
victories meant it was now conceivable that Iraq, having gone onto
the offensive after years of static defense, could break the
stalemate in the ground war.

   Eli Lilly & Co. has not closed the door to the
use of its herbicide ``spike'' in a State Department program to
spray South American coca bushes, a House subcommittee chairman
said today.
   Rep. Glenn English, whose House Government Operations panel is
reviewing the battle against illegal drugs, said he spoke to
company representatives after the State Department criticized the
company during a hearing Wednesday.
   He said Lilly officials have objected to use of the chemical
tebuthiuron, known as ``spike,'' because ``they have not done the
proper testing of application by air over a wide section of
countryside. They have no data. They have not seen data from (the)
State (Department), and cannot assume responsibility or liability.''
   Ted McKinney, a spokesman for the Indianapolis-based company,
had no immediate comment on English's statement.
   But he did say that the chemical is applied both by air and on
the ground in the United States.
   He described tebuthiuron as ``a broad-spectrum, soil-applied
herbicide for brush and weed control on non-cropland, pasture and
rangeland.'' The herbicide is ``approved for use in grazing lands,
wildlife openings along ditchbanks, and utility rights of way. It
is safe for humans, livestock, wildlife and the environment when
used according to label directions.''
   English, an Oklahoma Democrat, said:
   ``We will continue discussions. We need to acquire a herbicide
against coca bushes as quickly as possible. At this point, my own
perception is the door is open, discussions will continue, and
hopefully a solution can be found to this particular problem.''
   English's statement was toned down considerably from his comment
Wednesday that Lilly was ``a deserter'' in the war on drugs.
   The congressman later clarified his remarks to say there had not
been proper aerial testing in the coca-producing region of Peru,
where the chemical would be sprayed. He said the area has
considerable groundwater and therefore is much different from the
dry, brush areas where it is used in the United States.
   He added that the company also was concerned that the coca area
in Peru ``may not be in friendly hands, and you may not have a
pilot totally concentrating on the accuracy of spraying.''
   At Wednesday's hearing, Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of
state for international narcotics matters, criticized Lilly for
deciding to withhold the herbicide from the spraying program _ even
though it has been manufactured for more than 15 years, has been
proven safe by U.S. standards, is widely available in this country
and has been sold to the Interior Department.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Wednesday, ``We
think the short-term impact is serious.'' The department wanted to
test the chemical for use in eradicating the coca crop focused
mainly in Peru's Huallaga Valley, she said. The chemical is used in
the United States for clearing brush.
   Mrs. Oakley said Lilly apparently was worried about possible
retaliatory measures by ``traffickers or terrorists.'' The company
also came under pressure from environmentalists who were concerned
about the ecological impact of the herbicide.
   Meanwhile, the subcommittee was told by agencies fighting the
drug war on Wednesday that the effort is troubled by delayed
equipment and financial woes.
   The Coast Guard said its boats and planes often sit idle because
the agency is short of money.
   The Customs Service said the entire U.S. border with Mexico
remains a haven for airborne drug smugglers because of delays in
installing four of five radar balloons.
   Also, Coast Guard surveillance planes have cracks in their wings
and may be grounded this summer. New or modified planes authorized
by Congress have not yet been delivered. Construction of three new
command, control, communications and intelligence centers for the
drug war are behind schedule.
   English blamed the Customs Service for the delays in installing
the radar balloons along the Mexican border to detect airborne drug
smugglers. Only one of the five balloons, called aerostats, is in
operation.
   ``This is a terrible failure,'' he told William Rosenblatt, the
Customs Service enforcement chief. ``You are costing us dearly.
There's no sense of urgency about this. That's the problem.''
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost said his new, fast patrol
boats and many of the agency's airplanes are operating at only 55
percent of last year's levels due to lack of money.
   He said it was ironic that Congress is ready to spend huge sums
for an escalation of the military's role in the drug war, but can't
find $60 million to get his vessels in the water and planes in the
air full time.
   ``Turn me loose and don't give my mission away,'' he told the
committee.
   Rosenblatt blamed the radar balloon delays on problems with site
selection, environmental concerns, competitive bidding and
bureaucratic roadblocks from other federal agencies.
   When he explained how he spent four months seeking competitive
bids for the balloons in an effort to save money, English said,
``In effect, you cost us a heck of a lot of money'' because Air
Force AWACS surveillance planes have had to patrol the Mexican
border to pick up the slack. English said that an AWACS costs
$7,500 an hour to operate.

   The United States rejected Kremlin leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's request to include the words ``peaceful
coexistence'' in a closing summit statement because the phrase is
imprecise and it was a Soviet slogan during the Cold War, U.S.
officials said Thursday.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said that Reagan and
Gorbachev disagreed over use of the phrase, and that the pair was
``going at it pretty heavy until the end.''
   Nikita Khrushchev used the phrase to describe his efforts to
improve relations with the West following the death of Josef Stalin
in 1953, but stuck with it despite the heightened tension of the
Berlin and Cuban missile crises.
   It seems as if there are two dictionaries when the United States
and the Soviet Union analyze the meaning of peaceful coexistence.
   A senior official, who spoke to reorters on condition that she
not be further identified, said that shortly after Reagan arrived
in Moscow last Sunday, Gorbachev handed him a plain white piece of
paper on which were written the following words:
   ``Proceeding from their understanding of the realities that have
taken shape in the world today, the two leaders believe that no
problem in dispute can be resolved, nor should it be resolved, by
military means.''
   The statement continued: ``They regard peaceful coexistence as a
universal principle of international relations. Equality of all
states, non-interference in internal affairs, and freedom of
socio-political choice must be recognized as the inalienable and
mandatory standards of international relations.''
   Reagan liked the sound of the words, but the veteran
Sovietologists who advise him remembered that the Soviets were
proclaiming similar principles in international affairs in the
context of Hungary in 1956, Czecholovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan
in 1979, and that the Soviets countenanced the declaration of
martial law in Poland in 1981.
   Baker, talking to reporters who accompanied Reagan to London
Thursday aboard Air Force One, described the scene at the final
Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, about six hours before the summit
communique was released to the press:
   ``As the meeting ended, all of us stood up, including the
president and the general secretary, and the president and general
secretary continued to pursue their conversation.
   ``They were going at it pretty heavy and I was proud of the
president. They were face to face and going at it pretty heavy
until the end.''
   At his Spaso House news conference in Moscow Wednesday, Reagan
was asked why he took issue with the ``peaceful coexistence''
language.
   Reagan said that he liked ``the whole tone'' of the draft
language.
   But the president also said that aides studying the draft
communique ``saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in
there that would not achieve the general thought of what was being
proposed.''
   U.S. officials were suspicious about the language, feeling it
was too imprecise.
   The U.S. objections were brought to the attention of the Soviets
early on, and negotiations began at the staff level on alternative
language, Baker said.
   ``And indeed, it was our impression that alternative language
had been agreed to for the departure statement,'' he said. ``And it
was at the last meeting (that) the general secretary came back and
made another run at trying to get his original language in. And the
president held his ground.''
   ``I don't think he (Gorbachev) was playing a trick. I think he
was just making a run for his original formulation,'' Baker said.
   In the end, the compromise language negotiated by the staff _
omitting the words peaceful coexistence _ was included in the
communique.

<DATELINE>GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Yale history professor
with a passion for America's national parks told their
superintendents today they are stewards of the world's greatest
university.
   ``I take the national park service of any society as a series of
symbols about what a people chose to take pride in,'' Robin Winks
told 300 National Park Service managers on the second day of an
extraordinary, four-day conference.
   ``These are the testimonials, the building blocks that Americans
believe they have done historically. You begin to get into a heart
of a people by viewing what they have chosen to preserve,'' said
Winks, who has visited 315 of the 342 units of the National Park
system and is a frequent participant in park service training
sessions.
   ``Every superintendent in the National Park system is president
of a small university, keeping the flame of an historical event of
which we are proud,'' Winks said. ``You are stewards over what I
view as the single greatest university of the world.''
   On Wednesday, park managers at the first such conference in 12
years said America's national parks are in better condition than
ever.
   Superintendent Bob Barbee, Park Service Director William Penn
Mott and others agreed that budget constraints have forced them to
find new solutions to old problems, such as deteriorating
maintenance and substandard housing.
   Environmental and citizens' groups have said threats to the
parks include logging, oil drilling, pollution and commercial and
residential development near parks.
   ``I get tired of all this `Chicken Little' stuff,'' Barbee told
reporters. ``We've made a lot of improvements.
   ``There is more control and management of the resources and some
people don't like that because they don't like control, but the
good side of that is ... we are more sensitive to the integrity of
the resources than we have ever been,'' said Barbee, whose park,
Yellowstone, was the world's first national park.
   ``I would contend that in Yellowstone (National Park),
biologically, today we are in better shape than we were 75 years
ago,'' he said.
   He noted that 75 years ago a dairy herd, slaughterhouses,
garbage dumps and other things needed to support staff and park
visitors produced tons of pollution.
   ``As late as 1970, 80,000 pounds of wet garbage _ pizza crusts
and slop _ was available to bears in open dumps. Now there are zero
pounds of wet garbage, the dumps are gone, it's all hauled long
distances out of the park,'' Barbee said.
   He said Yellowstone's physical plant is also in better shape
than it's ever been, even though an estimated $300 million is
needed to repair deteroriated facilities.
   At Grand Canyon National Park, wild burros were once a problem,
said Superintendent Dick Marks.
   ``Today there are no burros in the park, the Big Horn sheep are
making a comeback'' and conflicts between people on the ground and
those making canyon overflights ``are being worked out,'' Marks
said.
   During the far-ranging session with reporters, Mott denied
accusations by critics in environmental groups and Congress that he
may have held back his best professional advice because of
admininstrative opposition.
   ``No one, not even (Interior Department Secretary Donald) Hodel,
has personally throttled me on what I personally feel,'' said Mott.
   The administration's commitment to the parks system was one of
the issues discussed earlier in the day.
   William Horn, assistant secretary of the Interior for Fish,
Wildlife and Parks, said he was tired of ``a continuing drumbeat of
critics claiming the administration is anti-park and committers of
sins.''
   He pointed out that the administration has proposed a $734
million operating budget for the Park Service for the next fiscal
year, compared to $391 million in 1980.
   ``That constitutes the largest operating budget in the history
of the National Park Service and represents 29 percent
post-inflation, real growth over the past seven years,'' Horn said.
   Further, the Park Service employs 16,414 people, the highest
level in its 72-year history, Horn said.
   ``These numbers bespeak a commitment to a first-class national
park system,'' he said.

   Republican conservatives questioned Thursday
what Vice President George Bush hoped to gain politically by
attacking two new-right activists whom he called ``self-appointed
spokesmen'' who have been critical of him for years.
   The objects of Bush's attack _ Richard Viguerie and Howard
Phillips _ said they still hope he defeats Democrat Michael Dukakis
in the fall presidential election.
   ``With George so far down in the polls I was wondering why he
was wasting his time and energy shooting at me instead of shooting
at Mike Dukakis,'' said Phillips, chairman of the Conservative
Caucus.
   ``If he wants to go around attacking conservatives, he's going
to dig himself a deeper hole,'' said Viguerie, a conservative
fund-raiser and former publisher of Conservative Digest.
   Recent national polls have said Dukakis is leading Bush by
margins ranging from six points to 16 points among voters.
   Conservatives have urged the vice president to step up his
attacks on the Massachusetts governor and portray him as a liberal
out of step with the national mood.
   Viguerie and Phillips also have been sharply critical of
President Reagan since he took office more than seven years ago.
They have complained that Reagan has abandoned much of the
conservative agenda.
   Only Wednesday, Viguerie described Reagan as having ``taken
leave of his senses'' for suggesting in Moscow that the problems
Soviet citizens were having emigrating to the West were caused more
by bureaucratic problems than government policy.
   Interviewed by The New York Times at his summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush said of Viguerie, ``The fact that he
doesn't agree with me on a lot of things or has opposed me for many
years, that doesn't bother me.
   ``There's only one or two that polarize, and Viguerie and Howie
Phillips are two of them. It doesn't matter in terms of total
vote.''
   When asked if he needed to court the two new-right activists,
Bush said, ``There are some people that are almost self-appointed
spokesmen that will make a claim for that. I don't feel that at
all.''
   Bush said Viguerie ``gets his name in the paper by criticizing
other Republicans all the time.''
   ``I think it's kind of sad,'' said Rep. Robert Dornan of
California, a conservative supporter of Bush. ``I was hoping he
wouldn't react to their earlier goading. ... I thought the whole
thing was calmed down and we'd all be pulling together on one
team.''
   Dornan said Viguerie was ``absolutely correct'' in urging Bush
to get tougher on Dukakis.
   ``If George doesn't paint Dukakis as the liberal that he is and
establish himself as a conservative then the electorate is going to
opt for a change,'' said Dornan.
   ``It doesn't serve George Bush any useful purpose to attack
people who have constituencies that might support him,'' said Lyn
Nofziger, former White House political director.
   At the same time, Nofziger noted that Phillips ``has been a
vicious attacker of Ronald Reagan over the last seven years.''
   ``He's not running against Dick Viguerie and he's not running
against Howie Phillips; he's running against probably Mike Dukakis
and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball,'' said Nofziger.
   Phillips, asked how much of a following he has, said Bush ``does

   ``Even though I'm not a great fan of the vice president or his

who added that if Bush ``doesn't run a polarizing election, he's
history. ... If he doesn't run a campaign to polarize, that
polarizes the country along liberal and conservative lines then he
has no chance of winning.''

   Image may have overwhelmed substance here this
week, but American officials believe the Moscow summit will be
remembered for building a foundation of openness and trust for
future U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``Military issues are the most important and here, progress was
thin,'' said one American participant in five days of summit talks
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It was uncertain whether arms talks will result in agreement on
a new treaty drastically reducing strategic nuclear weapons before
Reagan leaves office in January. That is the two leaders' condition
for holding a fifth and final summit meeting this year.
   ``But there has been a sea change in atmospherics,'' the U.S.
official said privately. He noted that ``we are talking with them
across the board'' from missile cutbacks to cultural exchanges.
   ``If we are going to build a future relationship, these will be
the building blocks,'' he said.
   Another U.S. diplomat with years of experience in Soviet affairs
said the Americans are ``feeling more confident about the
relationship'' after the summit. He, too, spoke only on condition
he not be identified.
   Kremlin spokesmen made their own upbeat assessment of
glasnost-era summitry.
   ``If someone had told me three years ago that we would have such
relations with the United States, I would have said it was a
fantasy,'' said Georgy Arbatov, head of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute
in Moscow.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said on a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview that ``we do have progress, but we
could have even more.''
   To television viewers, the summit may have seemed designed to
produce scenes of Reagan and Gorbachev clasping hands and grinning
at each other.
   There were some TV images unfavorable to the Soviets _ KGB
agents roughing up the White House press corps a few hours after
Reagan arrived; police sealing off the apartment of a Jewish
activist whom Reagan intended to visit.
   There also were favorable Soviet images _ an aging Reagan
alongside a bright-eyed Gorbachev more than 10 years his junior;
Gorbachev urging a faster pace in arms control negotiations while
Reagan counsels caution.
   Behind the images, U.S. and Soviet aides were busy bargaining
over a far wider range of issues than their predecessors during the
days of East-West detente in the 1970s.
   ``We are finding greater openness than we have in the past,''
said the American official.
   Negotiators made only marginal progress this week on a proposed
treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear
weapons by as much as 50 percent. They talked, too, about two
lesser agreements that would tighten verification procedures under
a 1974 accord limiting nuclear explosions and require advance
notice of ballistic missile tests.
   The two sides also made little headway on resolving differences
over Afghanistan, Central America and other regional conflicts. But
they signed a handful of agreements on minor issues such as
maritime rescue and radar navigation.
   In all the talks, the U.S. official said, the Soviets blamed
past mistakes on ``old thinking'' and tried to use what they called
Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' to make things work.
   Among the summit's little-noticed achievements, in the view of
American participants, was overcoming initial Soviet objections to
a cultural agreement to exchange as many as 1,000 high school
students from each country.
   ``In the past, the Soviets had objected to allowing Soviet
students to stay in American homes and Americans to stay with
Soviet families,'' said one U.S. official.
   He said the exchange students could become of the next
generation of U.S. and Soviet foreign policy experts.

<HEAD>Socialites Meet Socialism In Luxurious Weekend Benefit</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 18th graf, `The guests...' to fix tonight to Thursday
night.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   About 200 capitalists converged Thursday on
Beijing for a weekend of caviar on the Great Wall, boat rides on an
imperial pleasure lake and a display of opulence not seen in this
spartan socialist capital since 1949.
   The participants, from 21 countries, are spending $4,300 each to
enjoy such Western luxuries as a masked ball and champagne
breakfast at sites of past Chinese imperial glory.
   For $5,200 more, 100 of them will spend 10 days touring China's
most famous scenic spots.
   The weekend event, dubbed ``The Return of Marco Polo'' after the
13th century Venetian adventurer, was organized by a French group
calling itself the Committee to Save Venice and the Great Wall,
headed by public relations agent Daniel Vial.
   The proceeds were intended to help restore the Great Wall,
reduced in many sections by weather and war to a heap of stones,
and to preserve the art and architecture of Venice, Italy.
   But Vial said Chinese officials are charging such high fees for
transportation, food, site rentals and services that most of the
ticket receipts will be needed to cover expenses.
   He cited a $54,000 charge by Beijing municipal authorities to
rent a section of the Great Wall for four hours Saturday so the
guests can lunch there on caviar and champagne.
   ``I'm not sure they (Chinese officials) got exactly the concept
of a charity,'' Vial told a news conference this week. ``They
charge us the maximum.''
   The number of high-paying guests also is less than half what was
expected, Vial acknowledged. He said Chinese delays in confirming
arrangements made it impossible to advertise far enough in advance.
   The organizers now say any funds to help the Great Wall or
Venice will have to come from the final event of the weekend, a
Sotheby's auction Sunday of donated modern Western and Chinese art
and rare objects.
   Sotheby's has estimated the 67 items, including a 1777 bottle of
cognac, a pottery jug painted by Picasso and a painting by Deng
Lin, the daughter of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, should fetch
$695,400 to $869,000.
   However, auctioneer Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's
International, said no one is really sure what to expect. It will
be the first auction of Western art in China since the Communist
takeover in 1949.
   The cheapest item in the sale is expected to be a Sevres
porcelain cup valued from $215 to $320 _ about how much an average
Chinese factory worker earns annually.
   Despite uncertainty about how much will be reaped for charity,
plenty of cash wiil flash during the weekend.
   The guests will be ferried about in black Red Flag limousines,
entertained by Chinese acrobats and singers, fed on caviar, French
cuisine and brandy and allowed to party at some of China's most
sacred national monuments.
   They will boat at the luxurious 19th century Summer Palace and
hold a Venetian masked ball and watch fireworks at the Diaoyutai
state guesthouse.
   They will breakfast at the Temple of Heaven, where the emperor
offered sacrifices for a good harvest, dine in the Forbidden City,
the imperial palace in Beijing and watch Chinese and Western
performers Saturday night at the Great Hall of the People.
   The guests gathered Thursday night at the weekend's first event,
a cocktail party in the garden of the glass-plated Sheraton Hotel,
serenaded by Chinese musicians playing ancient instruments.
   An American businessman, asked why he was willing to pay so
much, said with a shrug, ``To have fun.''
   ``We are not in Beijing now,'' said a Frenchman who, like the
American, spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's as if we are in
San Francisco.''
   Organizers said several European and Arab nobility signed up for
the weekend, but most of those at the party seemed to be involved
in business with China.
   Hundreds of police will shield the guests from contact with
ordinary Beijing residents, among whom the main topic of
conversation lately has been 30 to 60 percent increases in the
prices of pork, eggs and sugar.
   Former Foreign Minister Huang Hua, when asked at the cocktail
party if such displays of wealth were appropriate in impoverished
China, call income differences ``an objective reality.''
   ``We are trying to make our country prosperous,'' he said. ``We
need all kinds of help.''

<HEAD>Idaho Man Arrested In Kidnapping and Abuse of Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Utah man has been charged in the
kidnapping and sexual assault of a 6-year-old girl more than a year
ago, and a judge has dismissed charges against a man who had been
convicted of the crimes.
   Thomas C. Headley, 31, of Snowville, was arrested Wednesday and
was being held in the Box Elder County Jail in lieu of $75,000 bail.
   He was to be arraigned Thursday on one count each of aggravated
sexual abuse of a child, child kidnapping and aggravated
kidnapping, all first-degree felonies, said a secretary to Box
Elder County Attorney Jon Bunderson.
   Frank James Harvey, 45, Elma, Wash., was convicted of kidnapping
and sexually assaulting the child and was sentenced to 16 years in
prison, but was released on his own recognizance in January,
pending a new trial after authorities said they had uncovered a new
suspect.
   First District Judge Gordon Low on Wednesday dismissed charges
against Harvey, the judge's clerk said.
   The girl was kidnapped March 24, 1987, from outside a school and
was released the following morning in Malta, Idaho, about 65 miles
away. She told police she had been abducted by a man driving a
four-door blue car with a dachshund in it.
   Harvey was arrested at a rest stop on Interstate 15 near
Corrine. He was driving a four-door blue car with a dachshund in
the back.
   During the trial last August, the girl could not identify Harvey
as her abductor.
   Harvey had contended he was at the Juniper, Idaho, rest stop at
the time of the abduction, and an attendant testified he remembered
seeing a man resembling Harvey shaving at the rest stop at that
time.
   The child picked Headley out of a recent photo lineup, according
to a probable cause statement accompanying the charges.

<HEAD>New Justice Official Looks Forward to Report on Meese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new chief of the Justice Department's
criminal division said Thursday he looks forward to the release of
a report detailing Attorney General Edwin Meese's ties to
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
project.
   ``I think it will be much better for all concerned when that
report is issued, the sooner the better, for the department and for
the attorney general,'' Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., the former U.S.
attorney in Philadelphia, told reporters.
   Independent counsel James McKay will conclude a year-long
invesitgation of Meese by filing a report in the next week of two
with three-judge federal appeals court panel, which is expected to
issue it publicly later this month.
   Dennis said issuing the report ``will be very good because right
now you just have a lot of speculation.'' He said making the report
public will give Meese an opportunity to respond to any allegations
in detail. Meese has said he wants to respond to all the
information in the report to ``clear the air.''
   Dennis, who is in his first week on the job as acting assistant
attorney general said morale in the criminal division is good
despite Meese's legal problems and a wave of departures from the
Justice Department in the past two months.
   ``It's not easy in a situation where you do have controversy and
uncertainty to be without someone to kind of keep the division's
oar in the water,'' said Dennis, a former chief of the narcotic and
dangerous drug section at the department.
   Dennis sidestepped when asked whether colleagues urged him not
to take his new assignment. ``My feeling is basically if there
weren't problems, there'd be no need for lawyers,'' he said.
``That's basically what we do, deal with controversy and problems.''
   Dennis said that since he already knows many people in the
criminal division and is ``a known commodity,'' his nomination
``has done a great deal to perhaps calm any concerns.''
   Dennis said he has spoken briefly to his predecessor, William
Weld, who quit in protest March 29 out of concern that Meese's
continued tenure was hurting the Justice Department's operations,
morale and public image.
   Dennis said he will probably have lunch with Weld soon. In a
recent conversation, he said, Weld didn't say why he resigned,
Dennis didn't ask him why and Weld didn't offer Dennis any advice.
   McKay's report is expected to raise questions about Meese's
ethical conduct that will be examined by the Justice Department's
Office of Professional Responsibility in the coming months, sources
familiar with McKay's investigation have said.
   McKay also has been examining Meese's meetings with regional
Bell Telephone company executives while holding $14,000 in phone
stock and has been delving into a Washington real estate family
providing funds for a job for Meese's wife Ursula and leasing
buildings to the Justice Department.

<HEAD>State Broadcasting Company Says Dukakis Bows To Black Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-run broadcasting
company charged Thursday that pressure by blacks prompted U.S.
presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis to accuse South Africa of
terrorism.
   The accusation by Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee, had no
factual basis and ``was quite openly a capitulation to threats that
black voters' support would depend on his making such a
statement,'' said the South African Broadcasting Corp. in an
editorial.
   It was the latest in a wave of attacks by right-wing and
mainstream news media on U.S. politicians campaigning to toughen
sanctions against South Africa.
   Several commentators have suggested that South Africans should
shift attention to Europe and the Far East and abandon hope of any
constructive U.S. dealings.
   A Johannesburg brokerage firm, Davis Borkum Hare, reported
Thursday that one proposal in Congress would force the sale of $7
billion of U.S.-held shares in South Africa's mining companies. The
report said U.S. citizens held 14.2 percent of all South African
mining shares as of Jan. 1.
   South Africa has developed ``appropriate counter-strategies'' to
combat the African National Congress guerrilla movement, the
broadcast commentary said. A pro-goverment Johannesburg newspaper,
The Citizen, said South Africa ``will be in for a lot of trouble''
if the Massachusetts governor becomes president.
   ``Dukakis has been easily swayed by the likes of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and he will do everything he
can to try and strangle the South African economy,'' The Citizen
said in an editorial Wednesday.
   ``But this son of immigrant parents should know that South
Africans have deep-seated roots in this country that go back more
than three centuries and they will not give in to U.S. demands nor
submit to U.S. sanctions,'' it said.
   Dukakis has accused South Africa of terrorist acts but has not
called it a terrorist state, as Jackson has urged him to do.
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, praised
Dukakis during a recent U.S. trip and endorsed sanctions pending in
Congress.
   Pro-government media have denounced the black cleric, saying he
has no mandate and ignores the harm which sanctions might inflict
on blacks.
   An accurate assessment of black views on sanctions is difficult
to obtain because the 26 million blacks cannot vote in national
elections or referendums, and public advocacy of sanctions is
forbidden under emergency regulations.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper reflecting the views of
moderate business executives, has carried several articles
assailing the U.S. proposals. The sanctions would cut off virtually
all bilateral economic activity, except for trade in certain
strategic minerals.
   The newspaper reported that the proposals include a section that
says the United States should not provide advice to South Africa in
the event of a nuclear accident.

<HEAD>California Governor Insists Vice Presidency Not Possible</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of occasional profiles on vice presidential
prospects</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California Gov. George Deukmejian has
said at least 100 times that he couldn't accept the Republican
nomination for vice president because he would have to turn over
his office to the Democratic lieutenant governor.
   The governor's protests notwithstanding, he remains an
attractive vice presidential prospect as George Bush tries to keep
California, with its 47 electoral votes, in the GOP column in
November.
   ``As I've said many times now,'' Deukmejian said of the vice
presidency a few weeks ago, ``I don't expect even to be asked, but
if I was asked, if I am asked, I cannot accept it.
   ``If I were on the (national) ticket and that ticket was to be
successful, it would mean turning over the entire executive branch
of California state government to the other party, which I'm not
about to do.''
   California voters, who cast separate ballots for governor and
lieutenant governor, have saddled Deukmejian with a Democrat in the
No. 2 spot in state government, Leo McCarthy. McCarthy, however, is
running this year for the U.S. Senate and would not necessarily be
Deukmejian's successor. But that doesn't ease the governor's
problem, because the next person in line is another Democrat, state
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti.
   But Deukmejian continues to fan speculation with comments such
as these to a Texas GOP fundraiser: ``I'm still hoping that
somebody might come along and figure out a way I could be vice
president and at the same time (let) the Republicans hold onto
control of the statehouse in California.''
   The importance to Bush of winning California is enormous, and it
is clear that Bush needs help in the Golden State despite Ronald
Reagan's lasting popularity here. Although California has ended up
in the GOP column in eight of the last nine presidential elections,
a Californian has been on the Republican ticket, either for
president or vice president, in six of those races.
   The most recent presidential election in which there was not a
Californian on the GOP ticket was the 1976 race between Republican
Gerald Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter, in which Ford carried
California by a scant 1.7 percent.
   Although the prospect of Deukmejian turning the California
statehouse over to a Democrat is strongly opposed by state
Republican party leaders, California voters have given pollsters
mixed signals that they would probably be more inclined to vote for
Bush if Deukmejian were on the ticket with him.
   In a late May survey, Mervin Field's California Poll reported
Bush trailing Dukakis by 53 percent to 40 percent. But Field said a
Bush-Deukmejian ticket narrowed that margin only to 51-41 against a
Dukakis-John Glenn ticket, and that a Bush-Deukmejian ticket led
Dukakis-Sam Nunn and Dukakis-Jesse Jackson tickets by 2 and 7
points respectively.
   On the positive side, Deukmejian is the son of immigrant parents
who arrived from Armenia nearly penniless at Ellis Island in the
early 1900s, a background that could help counter the ethnic appeal
of Democrat Michael Dukakis and add a humble background to balance
Bush's image of Eastern wealth and preppiness.
   The 59-year-old Deukmejian's other political assets include a
strongly favorable rating in his home state _ 61 percent positive
to 31 percent negative in a May survey. He has a scandal-free
reputation as a family man and hard-working administrator, and a
political image as a fiscal conservative and law-and-order former
attorney general.
   His most noteworthy achievement as governor was pulling the
state through the crisis of a $1.5 billion deficit inherited from
Democratic predecessor Jerry Brown without a general tax increase.
Deukmejian faces a similar crisis this year, a revenue shortfall
estimated at $2.3 billion over two years. He has been criticized
for his proposed solution, a package of spending cuts, dipping into
treasury reserves and $800 million in new state income tax revenues
that he insists are an ``adjustment'' or ``correction'' and not a
tax increase.
   His greatest liability may be what even his friends concede is a
bland speaking style and image, a problem that also plagues Bush.
   Altogether, Deukmejian, a native of Menards, N.Y., has spent 26
years in public office in California _ 16 in the state Legislature,
where he was Senate GOP floor leader for six years prior to his
1978 election as attorney general. He was elected governor by
93,000 votes in 1982 and re-elected by a landslide 1.7 million vote
margin in 1986.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev stood eyeball-to-eyeball this
week with Soviet journalists who tested the uncharted bounds of
glasnost, and he never blinked.
   Never had a Kremlin leader held a news conference on home
territory until Wednesday, when Gorbachev agreed to take questions
from 300 Soviet and foreign reporters and government officials here
for his summit talks with President Reagan.
   The five Soviet journalists chosen to ask questions were polite
and ideologically acceptable. But they raised issues that could
never have been addressed publicly by Soviet citizens only three
years ago.
   Articulate and in easy command of the occasion, Gorbachev deftly
handled such sensitive topics as war losses in Afghanistan, past
Soviet stubbornness at arms negotiations and the need for a greater
degree of democracy in Soviet society.
   By White House standards, Gorbachev's news conference was windy
_ it lasted two hours _ and disorganized. The order of the two
dozen questions was more random than under the White House formula,
which awards the first query to a wire service reporter at news
conferences that seldom last longer than a half-hour.
   Soviet journalists are still committed advocates of official
policy, but their reporting on the summit and the questions they
asked Gorbachev reflected a freer attitude.
   Gorbachev talked openly about the once-taboo subject of internal
disputes within the Kremlin leadership. He explained his problems
with foot-dragging conservatives until Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze whispered that the Soviet journalist was asking about
American factions that are hesitant about improving superpower
relations.
   ``You mean you're talking not about our conservatives but their
conservatives?'' Gorbachev asked magazine editor Valentin Berezhkov.
   The auditorium erupted in laughter.
   The reporters' questions and Gorbachev's responses would have
been unthinkable before the Soviet leader introduced his reforms in
early 1985.
   When a correspondent for the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya
Gazeta rose to ask Gorbachev about the fate of about 300 Soviet
soldiers reportedly seized by Afghan rebels and held captive in
Pakistan.
   Without a hint of discomfort, Gorbachev responded with the
sincerity of a concerned father that ``we will do everything so
that our people return home.''
   The most delicate queries were posed by foreign reporters, who
outnumbered their Soviet counterparts by at least 2-to-1 and were
allowed to ask the most questions.
   Gorbachev gave a self-assured response even to the most
sensitive questions about his relationship with KreqE@oO__oo@O@Wgor
K. Ligachev, who is reported to be challenging
Gorbachev over the pace of reforms, and the inflammatory remarks of
Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow party chief who called Monday
for Ligachev's resignation.
   Gorbachev did not fully answer some questions, such as whether
the June 28 party conference could prove contentious, but he never
refused outright to respond to a query.
   Melor Sturua, a correspondent for the government newspaper
Izvestia who was expelled from Washington in a tit-for-tat exchange
in 1983, commented during one question that the Soviet side had
hampered negotiations over verification procedures during arms
talks at Geneva.
   The Soviet leader agreed with Sturua's assessment, but
attributed current difficulties to American intransigence.
   Gorbachev told the reporters he had enjoyed the opportunity to
talk with them, hinting that his first Moscow news conference might
not be his last.

   Vice President George Bush says the memories
are still fresh from four decades ago when he played first base for
Yale University in baseball's College World Series.
   Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee, played for the Yale
team that finished second in the series in 1947 and 1948, losing to
California the first year and to Southern California the next.
   He reminisced about the experience _ and recalled a fatally
flawed bit of strategy _ in a recent letter to the Omaha
World-Herald which had asked about his College World Series days.
   The 1988 series begins Friday, its 39th consecutive year here.
The 1947 and 1948 series were in Kalamazoo, Mich.
   The 1948 tournament was ``the highlight of my college baseball
experience,'' Bush wrote.
   ``We had great college pitching,'' he said. ``Frank Quinn was a
real star. He signed right after the '48 season with the Red Sox
for a big bonus. Dick Manville, another pitcher, was major-league
material, too.''
   ``Competition really is great,'' Bush told the newspaper.
``Being part of a winning team is a thrill. Teamwork is very
important. Fitness, of course, matters.
   ``I still clear the head by running two miles, and riding an
exercycle on bad days. I have always loved sports.''
   Bush also recalled some Yale strategy that backfired in 1947.
   ``We walked the eighth hitter to get to the ninth hitter,'' Bush
told the World-Herald. ``That turned out to be their pitcher.
Jackie Jensen, later of Red Sox fame, strode to the plate and hit
one that's still rolling out there.''

   A 2,000-foot TV tower collapsed today,
killing two maintenance workers and apparently trapping a third in
the wreckage, police said.
   ``It's just a tangled pile of metal,'' said C.L. Harlan, a
dispatcher with the Missouri State Highway Patrol in Macon. ``They
are getting cutting torches in there to try and cut it out.''
   The maintenance crew was working at about 500 feet when the
tower as high as a 200-story building gave way around 10 a.m.,
authorities said.
   The bodies of two of the workers were found within an hour of
the collapse, the patrol said. Colony is about 25 miles from the
Iowa and Illinois borders and 200 miles northwest of St. Louis.
   The patrol said the cause of the accident was not immediately
known. Winds were calm when the tower belonging to KTVO in
Kirksville fell, said Kurt Sweeney, station news director.
   The transmission tower went up in September and was one of the
tallest in the nation, visible from more than 30 miles, authorities
said. Jerry Heilman, KTVO general manager, said the workers were
replacing more than 1,000 structural braces.
   ``I can't even venture a guess as to what happened,'' said
Heilman. ``At this point, I don't know why it fell. It was very
tragic that human life was lost.''
   Martha Huber, who lives about a quarter mile from the tower,
said she looked out her window and saw the structure falling. It
did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area but tore down
several trees, witnesses said.
   ``I heard it and it sounded like a jet taking off,'' said Ms.
Huber's sister, Elizabeth Huber.
   The workers were employees of Structural System Technology Inc.
of McLean, Va., and had been working in Colony for several weeks.
   KTVO was off the air following the collapse. An FM radio station
that also broadcast from the tower, KRXL in Kirksville, was working
on reduced power, authorities said.
   The tower was the maximum height allowed under Federal Aviation
Administration rules, said Sharon Scott, public service specialist
for the Federal Communications Commission in Kansas City.

   In the beginning, play was hard work. You ran,
you wrestled, you clambered up cliffs with your bare hands.
   Then came video games. You walked over to the TV, picked up the
joystick and let Donkey Kong climb the wall. Still too much work.
   Couch potatoes, rejoice! The wireless joystick, a device that
will allow you to sit in your La-Z-Boy more than 20 feet from the
tube while playing After Burner, is coming.
   ``It's really the ultimate stick,'' said Carl Eisenberg, head of
U.S. operations of Camerica Ltd., which will market the Freedom
Stick.
   The arcade-style stick bounces an infrared beam around a room,
linking up with a receiver at the television set.
   The manufacturer says the signal is not interrupted when someone
walks by; there are no wires; it is compatible with all game
systems; it works whether it is aimed at the ceiling, the floor, or
up to 90 degrees from the screen.
   This is not the first time such a mechanism was marketed. A few
years ago, a wireless joystick that used radio waves failed because
the signal was easily disrupted, interrupting countless games of
Pac Man.
   Albert Leung, associate professor at Simon Fraser University in
British Columbia, Canada, began developing the technology for the
infrared joystick in 1981, said David Harding, president of
Camerica.
   Leung's research was proceeding apace when the video boom went
bust. Instead of video games, people bought computers with
video-game capabilities.
   But Harding said this has changed in the past year with the
development of cheaper, more sophisticated video games. At the same
time, parents found that computers were expensive playthings and
game sets grew more attractive.
   The Freedom Stick will cost $69.95. Harding and Eisenberg said
video-game makers are working to develop their own versions of the
wireless device.

   ``This absolutely blew my mind,'' Dr. James C.
Caillouette said. ``I thought something awful was happening to me.
Everytime I went into an examining room, I had a patient with
ovarian cyst.''
   Eventually, the Los Angeles gynecologist said, ``the lights
began to go on'' and he concluded there was a connection between an
outbreak of functional _ or non-cancerous _ cysts among his
patients and a new type birth control pill he had been prescribing
for them.
   Sold by three of the six major U.S. pharmaceutical companies
that make birth control pills, the so-called multiphasic pills that
went on the market in 1984 actually were not new chemical
formulations, but rather new packaging of existing drugs in various
strengths.
   Although Caillouette didn't have overall estimates of how many
millions of women are taking the multiphasic pills, he said the
introduction of the pills was accompanied by the most aggressive
marketing program he has seen in 29 years of practice. By 1987, he
said, nine of every 10 new birth control prescriptions were for a
multiphasic.
   Largely through the efforts of Caillouette, the Food and Drug
Administration has ordered the three companies to intensify their
post-market studies of the pills. The agency is airing the issue
before an advisory committee on Friday.
   Specifically, the fertility and maternal health drugs advisory
committee will be asked whether it believes ``it is possible to
determine at the present time if monophasic and multiphasic
formulations of oral contraceptives have different associations
with the occurrence of functional ovarian cysts.''
   The panel also will be asked whether it is willing to express a
preference between monophasic and multiphasic pills. In a
monophasic prescription, the same dosage is taken each day of the
21-day cycle. In a multiphasic, the dosage varies, with a woman
taking perhaps 35 microgram pills on certain days of the month, 20
micograms on other days and 10 micograms on still others.
   The rationale given by drug companies for developing the
multiphasic pills was to minimize any side-effects by providing the
lowest total dosage possible over the one-month cycle.
   It has been presumed, based on studies, that birth control pills
reduce the likelihood of functional ovarian cysts, rather than
increase them. That is why Caillouette was so surprised when it
dawned on him in early 1986 that each of seven patients who had
developed cysts during the previous four months had been taking
multiphasic pills.
   He recalled one patient in particular who had three operations
in three months to remove the cysts ``and we kept putting her back
on the triphasic pill beause she said with the others that she had
breast tenderness, premenstrual syndrome and all of that.''
   ``I believed what I was being told,'' Caillouette said in a
recent interview. ``We knew that with patients on birth control
pills, functional cysts were suppressed. After three surgeries in
three months, the lights began to go on.''
   So Caillouette put that patient and others with cysts back on
single-dosage birth control pills. ``The cysts went away and I
thought, `This is what is supposed to happen,''' he said. ``But
something is going on with these phasic pills.''
   Caillouette, who also is a professor at the University of
Southern California School of Medicine, decided to present his
seven case studies during a West Coast medical meeting ``and
following my presentation, physicians got up from the audience and
presented an additional 11 cases.''
   He published his findings in a medical journal last summer and
began getting still more calls and letters from other physicians
and patients having similar experiences with multiphasic birth
control pills.
   Caillouette said he now knows of 68 cases in which there is a
potential link between multiphasic pills and functional cysts.
   Caillouette said he believes development of the multiphasic
pills was a ``business decision on the part of the three companies
to enter into new patent protection on birth control pills.''
   But rather than develop new formulations, he said the companies
either ``mixed or matched pills that were off the shelf'' or in
some instances merely repackaged pills of varying strength into new
monthly prescriptions.
   ``They came out with a new patent with what they advertised to
the public as a new kind of birth control pill,'' he said. ``I
think it was improper. I think they misled the public _ they misled
the physicians into thinking they had a new mousetrap when in fact
all they were doing was mixing and matching stuff that was off the
shelf.''
   Representatives for the three companies _ Ortho Pharmaceutical
Corp., Wyeth Laboratories Inc. and Syntex Corp. _ all denied in
separate telephone interviews any improprieties in winning approval
of the multiphasic pills and said they were cooperating with the
FDA-ordered reviews.

<HEAD>One-Third of Trauma Victims Used Marijuana Before Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than one-third of the patients at the
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center used marijuana several
hours before sustaining their injuries, a study has found.
   Another third had been drinking alcohol before they were hurt,
and 16.5 percent had been both drinking and smoking marijuana,
according to the study appearing in the June issue of Archives of
Surgery.
   ``To me, it was rather startling to see that an illicit drug
matched in use a legal drug,'' said Carl A. Soderstrom, a surgeon
who headed the research team from the Maryland Institute for
Emergency Medical Systems.
   ``The suggestion is that the use of this drug alone and in
combination with alcohol may be the reason why they got hurt and
ended up hurting someone else,'' Soderstrom said.
   The study, based on leftover blood samples collected from July
29, 1985, to May 8, 1986, provided a ``phenomenally high number of
positives for marijuana,'' said Dr. Edward J. Cone of the Johns
Hopkins Addiction Research Center at Francis Scott Key Medical
Center.
   ``There's a common misconception that marijuana is a safe drug.
But the statistics coming out of that study clearly show that
people who are using marijuana are involved in accidents at a much
higher rate than you would expect,'' Cone said.
   Soderstrom said more studies need to be done, since the
marijuana use rate he detected was four to 10 times as great as the
rate reported in previous studies of car crash victims in Canada
and North Carolina.
   Soderstrom's study is based on blood samples from 1,023 patients
treated at the shock-trauma center. About two thirds had been
involved in car crashes, while the others suffered their injuries
in falls, assaults and accidents.
   About 73 percent were men and 58.4 percent were 30 or younger.
   The results showed 34.7 percent of the patients tested had used
marijuana and 33.5 percent were under the influence of alcohol.
   Soderstrom said that of 393 drivers admitted, 1 in 6 had both
marijuana and alcohol in their systems. More than three-quarters of
those who drank registered blood-alcohol levels equal to or higher
than the 0.1 level commonly used to determine drunkenness.
   Soderstrom said blood sample testing, or radioimmunoassay,
rarely registers positive levels more than four hours after use of
marijuana.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Defends Soviet Human Rights Record

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev stressed
Thursday there will be no changes in his country's human rights
policies despite President Reagan's emphasis on this issue during
the Moscow summit.
   Hours after Reagan left Moscow at the end of the five-day
summit, Gorbachev told several hundred peace activists the Soviet
Union ``will not accept any advice on how we run our affairs.''
   ``We do not need anyone else's model. We do not need anyone
else's values,'' he said.
   Reagan highlighted human rights by meeting with dissidents and
Jewish refuseniks during his visit to Moscow, and by stressing the
issues of freedom of expression and economic creativity in speeches
and his talks with Gorbachev.
   But Reagan also ran into trouble with some refuseniks for
remarks he made later in the visit seeming to absolve Gorbachev of
responsibility for Jewish emigration restricrtions.
   Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist Party leader, told a news
conference Wednesday he was ``not filled with admiration'' for
Reagan's meeting with the dissidents and refuseniks.
   But Thursday, he told the several hundred peace activists
gathered in the circular blue-and-white Sverdlov Hall in the
Council of Ministers building of the Kremlin that he felt the need
to respond further.
   ``We are far from imagining our country perfect in all
respects,'' Gorbachev said. He said that problems which Reagan
mentioned ``do take place, but this is not the situation. This is
not an overall picture of Soviet society.''
   ``I told the president that we have our own view of the human
rights situation in his own country,'' Gorbachev said. He said the
two countries told a working group formed to tackle the problem
that ``we're open and ready for any discussion on this matter.''
   About 4,500 Jews have been allowed to emigrate so far this year
and more than 8,000 left in 1987. Those figures are much higher
than they were in previous years but far below the peak year of
Jewish emigration of more than 51,000 in 1979.
   About 40 peace activists from the United States, Western Europe
and elsewhere praised Gorbachev for his role in completing the
superpower treaty banning medium- and shorter-range nuclear
missiles. Reagan and Gorbachev exchanged instruments of
ratification for that treaty Wednesday.
   ``He's the statesman we've been waiting for,'' said Marty
Coleman of Pasadena, California, who gave Gorbachev a small toy
from her granddaughter to give to his granddaughter Oxana.
   The 57-year-old general secretary laughed and chatted like an
American politician on the stump with others who walked up to the
wooden dias where he sat to present him with a solar-powered watch,
an American Indian peace pipe, a Chicago Bears football team
sweatshirt and other gifts.
   With Gorbachev were two key advisers, Politburo member Alexander
Yakovlev and Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Anatoly
Dobrynin, a former ambassador to Washington.
   The Soviet leader said that in his four summit meetings with
Reagan, ``the content of what we have achieved is immense,'' but
that more progress could have been made.
   He criticized once more Reagan's Star Wars program for a
space-based shield against nuclear attack. ``We should drag the
Americans away from the realm of military space to peaceful
space,'' Gorbachev said.
   The two sides made little progress on that issue during the
summit and it remains one of the main obstacles to an agreement to
cut long-range nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Among the human rights problems the Soviets say exist in the
United States is the situation of American Indians.
   At the request of Russell Red Bear, an American Indian present
at the meeting, Gorbachev autographed a copy of his book
``Perestroika'' for former American Indian Movement leader Leonard
Peltier.
   Peltier was convicted in 1977 of murdering two FBI agents and is
jailed at Leavenworth Prison in Kansas. Peltier insists he is
innocent, and Soviet media cite his case as an example of what they
say are human rights abuses in the United States.
   Reagan, answering a question from a Soviet student, said the
United States may have made a mistake when it ``humored'' Indians
by giving them reservations instead of integrating them into
society.
   Indian representative Anthony Gonzales of San Francisco told
Gorbachev that Reagan's remarks at Moscow State University Tuesday
were ``typical of American racism.''
   Gorbachev told the peace activists that each society must be
able to choose its own course, without outside interference. He
said long experience of Russians and other Soviets with
Christianity is proof that they can understand themselves and their
society without advice from others.

   Four zoo workers have become moms to a
marmoset abandoned by her real mother, and thanks to their tender
loving care, little Eliza seems to be thriving.
   The 2-ounce, 6-week-old pygmy marmoset with the 4-inch tail was
dropped by her mother when she was just 3 days old.
   With two other offspring to care for, the mother Julia didn't
retrieve her thumb-sized baby. But the keepers at Folsom Children's
Zoo rescued Eliza and placed her in an infant isolette to increase
the tiny monkey's chances of survival.
   Nightly, one of the four surrogate parents lugs home the
50-pound isolette and caters to Eliza's hunger every two hours with
a specially mixed baby formula dripped through a syringe.
   Zoo director John Chapo says he expects Eliza will be reunited
with her family in a few weeks. The father, Miguel, and mom Julia
have been in isolation and out of public view since mid-March
during the pregnancy and infancy of the three offspring, Eliza and
two yet unnamed babies.
   Last year the pygmy pair gave birth to triplets, but all three
died, Chapo said.
   This time the zoo didn't want to take any chances. Since only
about 90 pygmy marmosets were in captivity around the world at the
end of last year, according to the international species inventory
system, Chapo said he wanted to make sure all three monkeys
survived.

   These four little piggies aren't going to

bicentennial monument.
   The bronze flying porkers measure 4{ feet from tail to spread
wing tips. They stand on their hind legs on bright blue replicas of
riverboat smokestacks.
   As part of the sculpture at the entrance of the Bicentennial
Commons at the new Sawyer Point park, they celebrate the city's
heyday in the 1880s as ``Porkopolis,'' the Midwest's hog-butchering
capital.
   Three pigs covered with black cloth were lifted into place
Tuesday night by a mechanical lift. The fourth was flown in
Wednesday on a Coast Guard helicopter and lowered into place.
   Some Cincinnatians had complained the pigs would make the city
look foolish. They flooded local newspapers and City Council with
letters and calls of protest.
   The council tried to settle the dispute in January by conducting
a hearing to air the gripes. Council members donned plastic pig
snouts for the raucous gathering, and one woman even cradled a
piglet.
   But the mediation failed when the council's attorney said the
councilors were powerless because the sculpture already had been
properly approved.

<HEAD>Airline Unions Claim Drug Testing Unnecessary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed mandatory drug-testing program for
airline workers prompted sharp criticism Thursday from airline
labor unions, which argued there is no evidence of a problem in the
industry to warrant it.
   The union officials were among witnesses who testified at a
public hearing on a proposed Federal Aviation Administration
regulation that would require a broad range of drug tests,
including random screening of tens of thousands of pilots, flight
attendants and other airline employees.
   Representatives of airline management backed the regulations, as
did administration officials.
   The drug-testing program ``is crucial in our effort to establish
a drug-free aviation system,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim
Burnley, who conducted the hearing with FAA Administrator Allan
McArtor.
   The proposed regulations call for pre-employment tests,
post-accident tests, tests if drug use is suspected and a system of
random tests of employees.
   Burnley and McArtor have repeatedly called for a drug-testing
program in aviation and last year began random testing of
Transportation Department employees in a variety of safety-related
jobs, including air traffic controllers.
   ``We are concerned ... that (the department) may ahve already
decided on the main elements of this proposal'' especially random
testing, said Raymond Woolfolk, representing the 40,000-member Air
Line Pilots Association.
   He said the union is ``uncompromisingly opposed to random drug
testing of pilots'' because no evidence has been shown that such
tests are needed or that they will be able to identify the small
number _ if any _ of drug users in the industry.
   ``To locate that one pilot, many thousands of tests would have
to be given,'' Woolfolk said. ``... Instead of eliminating drug
abuse, (the mandatory testing) will merely spawn resentment,
opposition and litigation.''
   Capt. C.R. Paty of the Allied Pilots Association, which
represents pilots at American Airlines, complained that commercial
aviators are being singled out while private pilots, in whom more
of a drug problem has been documented, are not subject to the
testing.
   ``Regulations are proposed to monitor our conduct, while pilots
in the general aviation sector whose statistics reveal some measure
of drug abuse, are left unregulated,'' Paty said in a written
statement.
   Representatives of flight attendants unions also opposed the
rule, as did groups representing private pilots and air taxi
operators.
   Society's drug problem ``should be dealt with by reasonable, not
intrusive means. Targeting specific, highly visible groups without
cause is not reasonable,'' said Brian Moreau, vice president of the
Independent Union of Flight Attendants.
   The pilot and flight attendant groups suggested that instead of
mandatory random testing, the FAA help the industry develop a
voluntary detection and rehabilitation program for drug abuse
similar to the program the industry for years has used to deal with
alcoholism.
   But the drug-testing regulation received the endorsement of the
Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major airlines.
   ``We support, as we have from the beginning, the goals of the
proposed (testing) rule. ... The justification clearly must be the
protection of public safety.'' said James Landry, the trade
association's general counsel.
   The FAA plans to hold further hearings on the drug-testing rule
in Denver on June 7 and San Francisco on June 9. A final rule is
likely before the end of the year.

   The return of Michael Manley to power in Jamaica
wouldn't mean a repeat of the tumultuous, pro-Cuba policies that
marked his leadership in the 1970s, the Socialist opposition leader
said during a Miami visit.
   Manley, 63, will lead his People's National Party in elections
this year against the Jamaican Labor Party of Prime Minister Edward
Seaga, an ally of President Reagan who has rebuilt the economy
around trade and tourism.
   Polls by Jamaican sociologist Carl Stone, who has accurately
predicted all island elections for 12 years, have consistently
given Manley a solid lead over Seaga, whose no-nonsense style has
overshadowed his economic recovery program.
   Seaga defeated Manley in 1980 with the economy deteriorated and
tensions high over the heavy involvement of Cuba and radicals in
the Manley government.
   But Manley, calling himself more mature and wiser after years of
analyzing his government's failings, has met in recent years with
Vice President George Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, other
U.S. officials and Jamaican and international business leaders to
outline his plans for a new approach.
   ``I think that what happened then was that a situation was
allowed to escalate that should never have happened,'' Manley said
in an interview Tuesday.
   ``We're quite clear we would have diplomatic relations with Cuba
as part of the Third World, part of the hemisphere, part of the
region, etc. But we do not ever intend again to allow the
relationship with Cuba to become internally divisive or a source of
trouble with Washington.
   ``We've had many discussions about this with the State
Department, and I don't anticipate it's going to be a problem,''
said Manley, who blamed U.S. economic hostility and CIA activity
for undermining his government in his 1982 book: ``Jamaica:
Struggle In The Periphery.'' Seaga broke relations with Cuba.
   ``The main problem where Cuba was concerned was that as our
relationship developed and the pressure was put on us, we allowed
ourselves to become irritated and to become defiant,'' Manley said.
   Asked what Cuba can offer his nation, Manley replied: ``Nothing
in any direct sense. Their model of economic development is a
Marxist-Leninist model, and we're firmly rooted in parliamentary
democracy, human rights, rule of law and the private sector. These
are so vastly different it's hard to consider what one can
contribute to the other.''
   Seaga supporters warn that Manley's rhetoric covers up his
continued dedication to leftist principles and the influence of
radicals within his party.
   Manley, though, pointed to increased business investment in
Jamaica in the past year although ``it is almost universally
conceded that, short of a miracle, we will form the government.''
That, he said, shows the private sector is confident about his
commitment to working with it, an area he concedes he handled
poorly during his last government.
   Manley said his economic plan would promote national
self-reliance while ``shifting away from heavy taxation of the
productive side of the economy into the consumptive side; heavy
emphasis on creating new businesses, far more collaborative nature
between private sector and, importantly, revitalization of
Caricom,'' the Caribbean Community, a regional common market of the
former British West Indies.
   Elections are expected any time between July and November.
   Manley said he and Seaga have made progress in ``peace talks''
aimed at avoiding a repeat of the violence that left hundreds dead
in the 1980 election campaign.

   A school bus driver was slain in
front of his 8-year-old son aboard the bus today by a gunman who
then went to a retirement home and shot his former girlfriend and
himself, police and witnesses said.
   The gunman and the woman, an employee at Olds Manor Retirement
Residence, were in critical condition today at Butterworth
Hospital, said spokeswoman Patty Eddington.
   The bus driver had tried to date the retirement home employee,
Sylvia DeLeon, 23, who had recently broken off a relationship with
the gunman, according to relatives.
   The gunman, Jose Gonzalez, 34, had boaded the bus outside his
apartment and fired at bus driver Juan Vargas, 34, three times,
said police Lt. Victor Gillis. Vargas' son, Jose, was the only
child aboard, police said.
   Gonzalez had argued with Vargas about Vargas' relationship with
DeLeon on Wednesday night, said the gunman's sister-in-law, Evelyn
Gonzalez, who lives in an apartment downstairs from Gonzalez.
   Just before the shooting on the bus, Gonzalez gave his
sister-in-law an envelope in which he had written instructions in
case something happened, Mrs. Gonzalez said.
   ``He came down here, gave me a hug and a kiss and said, `I love
you,''' Mrs. Gonzalez said. She said he walked out of the house as
the bus approached. ``When I saw the (bus) coming, I hurried up and
got my husband, but it was too late,'' she said.
   After the first shooting, the gunman drove his car to Olds Manor
and shot DeLeon in a dining room, Gillis said. The gunman then ran
to another room, where he was confronted by police and shot himself
in the head, Gillis said.
   Helen Jackson, housekeeper who was in a room adjacent to where
DeLeon was wounded, said she heard a woman screaming, ``Help me,
help me'' before the shots were fired.

<HEAD>House Vote Sends Bill to Senate for Final Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House today overwhelmingly approved and
sent to the Senate a catastrophic health insurance bill designed to
protect Medicare beneficiaries from the financial devastation of a
prolonged, acute illness.
   The bill, the most sweeping expansion of Medicare in its 23-year
history, includes the program's first-ever outpatient prescription
drug benefit.
   Approval by the Senate is likely after its Memorial Day recess.
Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen has said he will
recommend that President Reagan sign the legislation despite
earlier administration misgivings that the bill is too broad.
   The House voted for the bill 328-72.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, called the plan ``a good, reasonable and responsible
agreement'' and said he expected approval by the president.
   Under the legislation, the out-of-pocket deductible for doctor
bills covered by Medicare _ the amount paid by each recipient
before government aid takes over all costs _ will wind up somewhere
between $1,320 a year and $1,400.
   The hospital benefit is already set: full, 365 day-a-year
coverage after a one-day deductible that rises along with average
hospital costs. The 1988 deductible is $540.
   Once fully implemented in 1993, the new prescription drug
benefit will pay 80 percent of those costs after a $655 deductible.
   By contrast, Medicare now pays no more than 80 percent of doctor
bills no matter how high they climb and only 60 days of full
hospital coverage after a one-day deductible.
   The only prescription drugs now covered by Medicare are a
handful of particularly expensive ones such as anti-rejection
medication for organ transplant patients.
   All of the additional benefits are to be paid for by additional
charges to Medicare enrollees. The charges will be a blend of flat
monthly premium increases deducted from Social Security checks and
an additional, sliding-  scale supplemental premium charged the
estimated 40 percent of the elderly to be subject to federal income
taxes.
   The additional flat premium will start at about $4 a month in
1989, climbing to $10.20 in 1993.
   The so-called supplemental premium, tantamount to an income tax
surcharge, is expected to total an additional $22 a year for each
$150 of income tax owed in 1989, climbing to an additional $42 a
year on each $150 of tax liability by 1993.

   Sinhalese extremists killed a
policeman and wounded nine people in attacks on polling booths
Thursday in an unsuccessful effort to block local elections, police
said.
   Elections Commissioner Chandrananda de Silva said that despite
the violence, about half of the 3.6 million eligible voters cast
ballots in two District Council elections in western and central
Sri Lanka.
   Final results for the 158 seats were expected Friday.
   Opposition politicans charged voting irregularities, and
Chandrananda said the complaints were being investigated.
   The violence was blamed on the Peoples Liberation Front, a group
of nationalist extremists among the majority Sinhalese that
threatened to kill candidates and voters. The front opposes
concessions to minority Tamils fighting for autonomy on the island
nation.
   Police said the extremists killed a policeman and injured six
other lawmen in two attacks on an election site in the village of
Matugama, 35 miles southeast of Colombo.
   A bomb exploded in a polling station in the town of Nuwara
Eliya, 60 miles east of Colombo, wounding two voters and an
election official, said the police officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Officials said armed members of the front also tied up two
policemen and took their rifles at a polling station at Dullewa, 60
miles northeast of the capital. The rebels burned paper ballots but
did not harm them, the officials said.
   The Sinhalese front also was blamed for attacks Wednesday in
which one policeman and an air force member were killed and more
than 15 government buildings were razed. Two Sinhalese extremists
also were killed Wednesday in a shootout with police.
   The violence occurred despite the deployment of an estimated
15,000 police and other security forces in the two districts.
   An Indian-sponsored peace accord called for the creation of the
councils. The accord, signed July 29, called for the minority
Tamils to end their five-year insurgency in exchange for more say
in government.
   The Sinhalese front, outlawed after a failed 1971 coup, contends
that the pact makes too many concessions to the Tamils and has
vowed to block it. It has been blamed for killing more than 300
people since July.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and compose 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population, claim they are discriminated against
by the island's majority Sinhalese Buddhists.
   A Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
rejected the accord. India has sent more than 50,000 soldiers to
the island to quell the Tamil rebellion.
   Four district councils were elected April 28. Another council
will be selected next week in the south. Elections in the north and
east have been delayed indefinitely because of the continuing Tamil
insurgency.

<HEAD>Bakkers May Want To Buy Back Gatlinburg House, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GATLINBURG, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fallen television evangelist Jim
Bakker, just finished with a whirlwind visit to his old PTL
ministry stomping grounds, may want to buy back the Smoky Mountain
retreat he left last year, his attorney said Thursday.
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, spent two days visiting the
television ministry they left a year ago amid a sex scandal, then
drove Wednesday to a house they used here.
   ``Probably the first thing they did was dust off the books.
They've been gone nine months,'' said Ryan Hovis, an attorney with
offices in Rock Hill and Columbia, S.C.
   He said he did not know how long the Bakkers would stay or what
exactly they would do. ``There are some meetings we've got to have
sometime soon in Charlotte (N.C.), so they'll be there for that,''
Hovis said.
   Bakker got a warm reception from some longtime supporters
Tuesday and Wednesday when he visited the Heritage USA theme park
at PTL's headquarters in Fort Mill, S.C., about 150 miles east of
here.
   Bakker, who wants to begin a new television ministry, said he's
looking for a secluded house in the region, wants to open an office
near Heritage USA and may ask for air time on the PTL Network.
   Bakker has several times in the past said that he and his wife
should have a chance to salvage the ministry, but PTL officials
have always ruled it out.
   The ministry is up to $130 million in debt, and a reorganization
plan that calls for sale of much of its assets is up for approval
in Bankruptcy Court.
   On Tuesday, Bakker told reporters he might try to buy PTL's
assets when they are liquidated, but refused to say where he would
get the money.
   Hovis said the Gatlinburg house, which has a 12-foot stone and
wrought-iron security wall and a swimming pool, still belongs to
PTL creditor Roe Messner, a Wichita, Kan., contractor.
   The Bakkers bought the house in 1987 and later deeded it to
Messner, ``But I think eventually they'll want to buy it back,''
the attorney said.
   Meanwhile, a recently formed investment group that is seeking
PTL's assets said it has abandoned efforts to secure a $25 million
letter of credit.
   Family Entertainment America Inc., a partnership of real-estate
developers, mortgage bankers, political strategists and a former
PTL broadcasting executive, is instead seeking partners to raise
cash, said company spokesman Kerry Moody, in Laguna Beach, Calif.
   Bakker left PTL after charges that Jessica Hahn, a church
secretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter. His
departure was followed by revelations about a lavish lifestyle, and
he was defrocked by the Assemblies of God.

   Bob Hope's hands may be more accustomed
to a golf club than a bat, but the comedian is warming up to be a
team captain in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball Classic.
   By the end of the year, the 85-year-old comic will have made
about 80 charity appearances, including Mandrell's annual outing,
which takes place Friday.
   ``This one was an easy decision. Barbara called and asked, and I
said yes,'' he said from his home in Taluca Lake, Calif. ``But I
told her that if I couldn't pitch, I wouldn't play. I told her I'd
just take my ball and go home.''
   The game benefits the organ donor program at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center in Nashville.
   Hope and Mandrell are team captains, selecting players from an
all-star cast that includes Roy Acuff, Erma Bombeck, Lynda Carter,
LL Cool J, Sheena Easton, Morgan Fairchild, Emmanuel Lewis, Keisha
Knight-Pulliam, Ray ``Boom Boom'' Mancini, Meat Loaf, Chuck Norris,
Walter Payton, John Stamos, Lynn Swann, Betty White, Hershel
Walker, Danny White, Mary Hart, Roger Miller, Chuck Woolery and
Oprah Winfrey.
   Sound like a lineup for a Bob Hope special?
   ``I wish,'' he said. ``Barbara can attract them, but she's an
attraction by herself.''

creator of the 41-year-old comic strip, the late Milton Caniff.
   Seventy-eight cartoonists _ including Garry Trudeau of
``Doonesbury,'' Charles Schulz of ``Peanuts'' and Mort Walker of
``Beetle Bailey'' _ signed Sunday's strip, a single panel drawn by
Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Bill Mauldin.
   The strip depicts Steve Canyon and Mauldin's famous GI, Willie,
burying Caniff. The grave is marked with an upright artist's pen

   Here are major recommendations issued Thursday
by retired Navy. Adm. James D. Watkins, chairman of the White House
AIDS commission.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   States should begin to require reporting of HIV-positive
antibody tests and should pass this information on to the Centers
for Disease Control, without patient names.
   Terminology must be selected and used carefully to make the
public more aware of the entire spectrum of HIV infection, from
initial infection to seroconversion to full-blown AIDS.
   Extensive research should be conducted and results widely
disseminated to provide more accurate information on the spread of
HIV into the heterosexual population.
   Additional data on the progression rates from infection to
disease to death are necessary.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PATIENT CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Physicians should begin to more frequently utilize the HIV
antibody test as a diagnostic tool, and incorporate the test and
counseling into the normal range of services offered to patients.
   Funds should be made directly available to community-based
organizations serving the needs of home-bound persons with AIDS,
especially in the area of nutrition, psychosocial and direct care
support.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Health care profession schools should be given incentives to
recruit medical students into specialties that are underrepresented
but needed due to the HIV epidemic.
   The Department of Labor should move expeditiously, within one
year, to develop a permanent and enforceable standard covering
blood-borne diseases, with penalties for noncompliance, to protect
health care and other workers whose jobs involve exposure to blood
and blood-contaminated bodily fluids.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RESEARCH, FDA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Make the development of appropriate animal models for
HIV-related research an immediate and high priority.
   Establish a federally supported computerized network of all
HIV-related research activities to promote greater exchange of
information and data between researchers.
   All approaches to vaccine development should continue to be
explored and developed until one or more are successful.
   Standards for condom safety should be increased and studies
should be conducted to determine the effects of spermicides,
solvents and other lubricants on latex. Studies to determine the
shelf life of latex condoms, with or without lubricants or
spermicides, should be performed, and packaging dated accordingly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PREVENTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   States should adopt strong statutes that protect the
confidentiality of a person's test results and that protect a
person from discriminatory retaliation.
   All state and local health agencies should be adequately funded
to develop HIV partner notification programs without diverting
resources from other sexually transmitted disease partner
notification programs.
   Quarantine or isolation of HIV-infected individuals based only
on HIV status without consideration of an individual's behavior is
not appropriate and should not be adopted by any state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Centers for Disease Control should conduct a 90-day study on the
effectiveness of purchasing paid advertising, in addition to
requesting advertising at no cost, to prevent misinformation about
the HIV epidemic going to the general public.
   State boards of education should mandate that an AIDS education
curriculum with appropriate content for age be offered to all
students at each schooling level (e.g., elementary, middle and high
school) throughout the state.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIETAL ISSUES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse, in conjunction with state
agencies, local drug abuse officials and representatives of drug
treatment providers, should develop a plan for increasing the
capacity of the drug treatment system so that the goal of
treatment-on-demand can be met.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE WORKPLACE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Public and private employers should ensure that their workplace
policies provide HIV-infected employees with the same rights and
benefits offered other employees with other illnesses and
disabilities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LEGAL AND ETHICAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Comprehensive federal anti-discrimination legislation which
prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the
public and private sectors, including employment, housing, public
accommodations and participation in government programs, should be
enacted.
   Each school system should establish a board-developed policy,
with accompanying guidelines, for dealing with an individual with
HIV infection in the school before it is confronted with the first
case.
   The commission recommends ... adoption of federal legislation
that mandates that identifying information obtained by any
provider, laboratory, payor or agency through HIV testing and
counseling cannot be disclosed without the written consent of the
individual (except under certain specific circumstances.)
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE FUTURE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Congress should enact legislation which expands the Public
Health Emergencies provision of the Public Health Services Act to
enhance the authority of the surgeon general when the president
determines and declares public health emergencies in the nation.
   The surgeon general should sit as the principal spokesperson on
the president's cabinet whenever issues related to the public
health emergency are discussed.
   The surgeon general's office should be established as an
independent entity within the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   The surgeon general should construct the administration's budget
requests for the public health emergency in consultation with the
heads of all affected agencies and without clearance of the Office
of Management and Budget before submission to the president.

   Joan Konner, a producer who has worked on Bill
Moyers' programs for public television, has been named dean of the
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, the school
announced Thursday.
   Ms. Konner, 57, will become the fifth dean and first woman to
head the school. She succeeds Osborn Elliott, who stepped down two
years ago. Frederick Yu, a faculty member, has been acting dean.
   ``A thorough, national search was essential in filling this
important post but ... we found the excellence we sought close
by,'' said Columbia President Michael Sovern.
   A 1961 graduate of the school and a university trustee, Ms.
Konner joined The Record in Hackensack, N.J., in 1961 as a
reporter, and moved to television station WNET in New York in 1963.
She worked at NBC News from 1965 until 1977.
   She rejoined WNET in 1977, and was executive producer of ``Bill
Moyers' Journal'' from 1978 to 1981.
   Her programs have won nine Emmys, the Peabody Award and the
duPont-Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism.
   In 1986 Ms. Konner and Moyers formed Public Affairs Television
Inc., which produces all Moyers' programs. Moyers said Columbia
students will be ``as lucky to sit at her feet as I have been to
have her by my side.''

<HEAD>Drought Now Comparable To '30s; Peanuts, Corn, Soybeans Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought has clamped down hard on Georgia farmers,
threatening crops such as peanuts, soybeans and corn, state
officials said Thursday.
   ``This has got to be treated as a major drought, on a a par with
the '50s, the '30s,'' and three other major droughts dating back to
the 1840s, state climatologist Gayther Plummer said Thursday.
   ``All crops and pastures are in a stressful situation. If rain
doesn't come soon, there's a chance we'll be losing the crops,''
said Jerry Midden, agricultural statistician for the Georgia Crop
Reporting Service.
   One after another, governments around Atlanta have tightened
restrictions on outdoor water use, to conserve the dwindling supply
in Lake Lanier, the area's primary water resource.
   The Atlanta area is 5.4 inches, or 23 percent, short on water
for the year, according to the National Weather Service.
   ``The northeastern part of Georgia is running 50 percent of
normal rainfall or slightly less in some places'' for the first
five months of 1988, said Plummer in a telephone interview from his
office at the University of Georgia.
   The southern half of the state ``is adequate to short'' on
rainfall, Plummer said.
   Midden said the latest crop report shows 30 percent of the state
has adequate soil moisture, 52 percent is short and 18 percent is
very short.
   Row crops, such as peanuts, soybeans and corn, are in serious
trouble, Midden said. Lack of moisture causes slow germination and
poor stands. ``They're sitting in the dry soil and withering away.''
   Georgia is the nation's largest peanut producing state, and its
1987 crop was valued at $500 million.
   Tobacco is transplanted early and by now has developed a full
root system, making it more tolerant of the drought, he said. The
peach and winter wheat harvests already are under way.
   Because of dry pastures, Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy
Irvin has gotten permission for farmers to graze livestock on land
set aside under the Conservation Reserve Program of the Food
Security Act of 1985. Normally, that land must lie fallow.
   ``This additional pasture and hay should give our farmers some
needed relief,'' Irvin said Wednesday. Without additional feed, he
said, ``farmers could be forced to sell off their herds, leading to
a shortage of feeder cows later in the year.''
   Plummer said the Southeast goes through a five-year ``W-shaped
drought cycle'' every 25 to 30 years. It's a dry period, followed
by a short wet period, then another dry period, with gradually
increasing rainfall, he said.
   The left-hand bottom of the current ``W'' was in 1986.
   ``Our current drought is not yet as intense as the '54
drought,'' he said. ``The drought is not as deep as the '54, but we
are broader than the '54. The `W' has a broader bottom to it. We
are into this thing a little longer than we have been on the five
previous occasions.''
   He said he expected a wetter period to recur in the early 1990s.
   DeKalb County, in Atlanta's eastern suburbs, on Wednesday became
the latest to tighten water use restrictions, banning outdoor water
use between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and from
midnight Fridays through midnight Sundays.
   ``The water consumption was going up instead of going down,''
said Gus Monroe, deputy director of the water and sewer division.
``We have to do something to slow down water consumption.''

   ``If the party is keeping secrets from Communists in the pages
of its history that are not state secrets, then it is clear that it
doesn't serve the unity of the party,'' said V. Rusakov, dean of
the Philosophy and Scientific Communism Department at Sverdlovsk
Agricultural Institute.
   The article by Rusakov, a teacher of Marxism-Leninism, was
published in Thursday's editions of the Sovietskaya Kultura
newspaper.
   It appeared to be the latest example in the leadership's
campaign to open up the pages of Soviet history and break down the
barriers erected by those who are clinging to the old policy of
guarding and controlling all information.
   Khrushchev's address to the 20th Party Congress, held three
years after the death of Josef V. Stalin in 1953, described the
dictator's crimes in the 29 years he served as Soviet leader.
   About 20 million Soviets were killed in political purges carried
out under Stalin and in the drive to collectivize agriculture,
according to estimates by Western historians.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics, Stalin's
crimes are no longer a taboo subject. The name of Khrushchev, who
was ousted as leader in 1964, is appearing more frequently in the
press.
   The call by Rusakov to publish Khrushchev's denunciation of
Stalin is not the first. In October, prominent Soviet scientist
Vitaly I. Goldansky also said Khrushchev's report, known in the
West as his ``secret speech'' because it was delivered behind
closed doors, should be published.
   The withholding of the information from Soviets was
``ridiculous,'' Rusakov said, since the text of the speech was
leaked almost immediately in the West.
   ``All the world a long time ago read the `secret' report by N.S.
Khrushchev at the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU (Communist Party
of the Soviet Union), but an overwhelming majority of Soviet
Communists don't know this document, which so radically changed the
evaluation of the development of the party and the state,'' the
educator wrote.
   He said the whole nation, not just party members, awaits the
publication of Khrushchev's report, as well as the documents of all
party congresses, conferences and plenums.
   Rusakov said that was necessary for historical research, which
he said was a part of glasnost. He said the documents should also
be put before the public to overcome ``the stereotypes and myths
which were created and indoctrinated into the consciousness of the
people.''
   He called for an accounting of how people were politically
repressed and who was responsible.
   ``This is the sole means to avoid the gossip, rumors and
ill-intended falsification of the internal life and history of the
party,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dies for Gold Coins Missing, Mint Admits</HEAD>

   Dies used to strike the most valuable coin
minted by the government are missing, a Treasury Department
official acknowledged Thursday.
   The Secret Service is investigating the disappearance in January
of 24 dies for the obverse, or front, of 1-ounce gold bullion
Eagles, said Michael Brown, a spokesman for the U.S. Mint. They
were lost or stolen while en route between mints in San Francisco
and West Point, N.Y., he said.
   The Eagle has a face value of $50 but the sales price, currently
$460 to $470, fluctuates with the price of spot gold. The dies,
which are 5-inch-long cylinders the width of a coin, are worth
about $40 each, Brown said.
   He said the missing dies likely would be of little use to
counterfeiters because all were for one side of the coin.
   But Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee that oversees the Mint, branded the loss _ the second
such mishap in two years _ ``unpardonable.''
   In the first incident, 44 dies used to strike the $1 Statue of
Liberty commemorative coins disappeared in April 1986 on their way
to the Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa. Only one was ever recovered.
It turned up last year in the possession of a Canadian coin dealer
at a coin show in Atlanta.
   After the 1986 incident, the Mint began hiring armored cars for
cross-border shipments but continued to use overnight mail services
for delivery within the United States.
   Normally employees of the delivery service sign for the dies at
each transfer point, but Brown said a clerk at the San Francisco
Mint apparently failed to complete a shipping form requiring that.
   ``They were shipped as ordinary freight, as if they were a crate
of oranges,'' Annunzio said in a recent speech on the House floor.
``Someone apparently figured out that a package going from one mint
to another mint would be valuable.''
   Annunzio said he would grill Mint officials on the subject at
budget hearings conducted by his subcommittee later this year.
   ``I intend to find out why security for dies was so deliberately
lax,'' he said. ``Losing dies once because of slack shipping
procedures is inexcusable; losing dies a second time is
unpardonable.''
   Brown said about 75,000 dies are shipped around the country each
year. They are made in Philadelphia and sent to regional mints,
depending on production schedules. Dies used to mint ``proof''
coins for collectors are sent to San Francisco for a special
polishing process.
   Beginning in late April, the Mint began using armored cars for
domestic, as well as cross-border shipments, he said.
   ``I think our record's pretty good. ... Obviously it was a
mistake and we don't like them to happen and we moved quickly to
make sure it doesn't happen again,'' he said.
   The clerk has not been disciplined, Brown said, but ``We're
working on that process right now.''
   However, Annunzio noted that the change in shipping procedures
came three months after the Eagle dies disappeared.
   ``The Mint's foot-dragging on switching to a secure method of
shipping dies is inexplicable,'' he said in the floor speech,
delivered May 25 and first reported in Thursday's editions of The
Washington Post.
   ``Was the Mint trying to pinch pennies? ... Quite frankly I do
not have the answers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   About 130,000 engineers, technicians and
university employees staged a 24-hour warning strike Thursday,
disrupting work at military industries, delaying flights and
slowing down work at government offices.
   The three unions called the strike to press wage demands in
stalled contract negotiations.
   A Tel Aviv labor court ordered the workers back to work, and
union leaders said they would comply at the end of the job action
scheduled for midnight Thursday.
   President Chaim Herzog said the strikers were ``fighting
professional struggles on the public's back, on the back of the
citizens.''
   ``I rise up against this norm, which has become entrenched in
Israel,'' Herzog said on Israel's army radio, the only radio
station operating Thursday.
   The strikers also shut down the government-run television
station. The Bezek telephone company did not make repairs, and the
electric company operated on a reduced weekend schedule, according
to the radio report.
   The strike virtually paralyzed the government-run aviation
industry, military factories, high technology industries and some
plants owned by the Histadrut, Israel's trade union federation, the
radio said.
   At Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, some
disruptions, including flight delays, were reported.
   ``The automatic luggage distributor has failed, and of course
the technicians are not repairing it,'' union leader Moshe
Ben-David told the radio.
   At Tel Aviv University, about 500 engineers and administration
officials did not show up for work, shutting down laboratories and
computers, said university spokeswoman Carole Cook. Jerry Barach, a
spokesman for Jerusalem's Hebrew University, reported a similar
situation.
   Yitzhak Raz, head of the technicians union, said the strike was
a warning to the Finance Ministry to renew stalled wage
negotiations.
   Finance Minister Moshe Nissim, who has maintained strict price
and wage controls to keep Israel's high inflation in check,
responded by saying the strike did not damage to the economy.
   ``This is a one-day strike that was forced on the workers by the
professional unions, and I heard that many workers were
dissatisfied (with the strike call),'' he said.
   The strike came just after negotiations passed a major hurdle,
when unions agreed to end the linkage between wages and economic
indicators, said ministry spokesman Yitzhak Feinberg.
   Such linkages in the past have been blamed as contributing to
high inflation rates.
   The unions represent workers in variety of workplaces and salary
levels. They have not stated specific figures, but they want raises
of at least 10 percent. Monthly salaries now range from $435 to
$1,850.
   The government maintains the economy now is stable so even small
raises are unnecessary. Inflation last year was 20 percent, which
is low by Israeli standards.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
told the NATO allies Thursday that the failure to reach a strategic
arms agreement at the Moscow summit was a blessing ``in a curious
way'' because it allowed more attention to be focused on human
rights and other issues.
   The allies, in turn, cheered what they called a broad
improvement in East-West relations.
   Shultz met with European foreign ministers and other alliance
officials for about two hours before flying to London to join
President Reagan. He plans to leave Friday on a new mission to the
Middle East to push his plan for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   ``I certainly feel, and I believe all my fellow foreign
ministers felt, the outcome was a very good one,'' Shultz said at a
news conference.
   He said the two leaders had scored advances in numerous areas of
arms control, including negotiations to ban chemical weapons, cut
long-range nuclear missiles and reduce East-West conventional
forces.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, told
reporters after meeting with Shultz that his government was pleased
with the summit results, despite the lack of a big breakthrough in
arms control.
   ``We share his opinion that it was a successful and substantial
summit,'' Genscher said. ``Through this summit the American-Soviet
relationship got a new stability, a new perspective.''
   Other alliance officials were equally upbeat.
   ``What is important is the judgment that Shultz gave that the
political climate of the meeting was a substantial success,''
Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti told reporters.
   Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary general, underscored the
emphasis Reagan put on human rights issues during the summit, as
well as the progress reported in various areas of arms control.
   ``All these are elements of an increasingly stable relationship
between the United States and the Soviet Union which can only
benefit the alliance,'' Carrington said.
   In his news conference, Shultz discounted Gorbachev's comment on
Wednesday that the summit could have achieved more in arms control.
   ``Always it's possible to achieve more ... but it simply wasn't
possible to work through all of the difficult issues, and I think
we all recognize that,'' he said.
   Shultz said that absent a major arms control breakthrough, the
superpowers were able to give more attention to three other main
agenda items: human rights, bilateral relations and regional issues
such as the Angolan civil war.
   He called this a blessing ``in a curious way.''
   ``The absence of anything like that has caused people to reflect
on what may be the more important meaning of what the president,
the general secretary and others have managed to put together
here,'' Shultz said.
   ``People can see more clearly than otherwise that the
(superpower) relationship now proceeds on the basis of an
established, four-part agenda.''
   Shultz declined to rule out a U.S.-Soviet agreement on 30
percent to 50 percent reductions in strategic, or long-range,
nuclear weapons before Reagan leaves office next January. The main
stumbling block is Soviet objections to Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative for developing a space-based defense against ballistic
missiles.
   ``It's possible. We're going to work hard on it,'' Shultz said.
Negotiations are scheduled to resume in Geneva on July 12.
   Genscher said he told Shultz that the Europeans were
particularly eager to see a strategic arms accord, since the Soviet
long-range missiles can be targeted on European as well as American
territory.
   Andreotti said Shultz told the NATO meeting that Gorbachev had
demonstrated at the summit a determination ``to want to conclude
initiatives with this administration to the maximum extent
possible.''

   President Reagan's special arms control
adviser began an Asian trip Thursday to brief leaders on the
summit, and a top State Department official planned a similar visit
to two of Moscow's tightest adherents.
   Edward L. Rowny, the arms control official, told Japanese
Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno ``the summit was a triumph of
realism,'' according to an account issued by Rowny's office.
   Rowny, who in the past has been outspoken in his criticism of
Soviet motives, said progress on strategic disarmament was made at
the summit, but ``let's remember that the Soviet negotiators always
seek to cripple us in areas where they fear we might utilize our
comparative technological advantages.
   ``Whenever they move away from such positions and agree to truly
equitable measures, they are not being motivated by philanthropy.
Rather they are responding to patience, firmness and solidarity on
the part of the allies.''
   Rowny was scheduled to brief Chinese leaders on Saturday and
planned to go to Australia and South Korea for similar meetings.
   The State Department announced, meanwhile, that Deputy Secretary
John C. Whitehead will visit East Germany, Austria, Hungary,
Yugoslavia, West Germany and the Netherlands during a trip to
Europe beginning Friday, ``to review the results of the summit''
and discuss other issues.
   East Germany and Hungary are Soviet allies and provide troops to
the Warsaw Pact forces in Eastern Europe.
   Since Reagan first met Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Geneva in 1985, the United States has made a practice of sending
top-level officials on post-summit trips to Eastern Europe, to make
sure the Soviets' allies get the U.S. perspective on how the
meetings went.
   There are no plans for Whitehead to meet Kurt Waldheim, the
president of neutral Austria, during talks in Vienna. Waldheim has
been barred from entry to the United States because of his
activities as an officer in the German army in World War II and
U.S. diplomats are under orders to avoid contacts with the Austrian
president.

   Mr. General Secretary and Mrs. Gorbachev. This is an emotional
moment for Mrs. Reagan and me. We have been truly moved by the
warmth and the generous hospitality that we received from all of
our Soviet hosts during this brief visit but most especially from
the two of you.
   During this meeting, as in all of our previous meetings, I
appreciated and valued our exchanges and the long hours of hard
work that we and our experts put in to make progress on the
difficult issues we face. But this meeting has added something else
for Mrs. Reagan and me.
   Our time here has allowed us to know if only briefly your art
treasures and your people, artists, writers, individuals from all
walks of life, people who were willing to share with us their
experiences, their fears, their hopes.
   Mr. General Secretary, it is fitting that we are ending our
visit as we began it in this hall named for the Order of St.
George. I would like to think that our efforts during these past
few days have slayed a few dragons and advanced the struggle
against the evils that threaten mankind, threats to peace and to
liberty. And I would like to hope that like St. George, with God's
help, peace and freedom can prevail.
   Mr. General Secretary, if you will permit me just one more
proverb. I think a very old and popular saying you have here about
last Sunday, the day of our arrival, spoke to the promise we have
seen fulfilled at this summit in this Moscow spring.
   Truly then Troitsa _ ves les postroitsya (Holiday of the Trinity
_ and the whole forest will bloom).
   And now, if I might just conclude on a personal note. Earlier
this week at Moscow State University I mentioned to the young
people there that they appeared to my eyes exactly as would any
group of students in my own country or anywhere else in the world.
So, too, did Nancy and I find the faces young and old here on the
streets of Moscow.
   At first, more than anything else, they were curious faces, but
as the time went on the smiles began and then the waves. And I
don't have to tell you Nancy and I smiled back and waved just as
hard.
   Mr. General Secretary, I think you understand we're not just
grateful to both you and Mrs. Gorbachev, but want you to know we
think of you as friends. And in that spirit, we would ask one
further favor of you. Tell the people of the Soviet Union of the
deep feelings of friendship felt by us and by the people of our
country toward them.
   Tell them, too, Nancy and I are grateful for their coming out to
see us, grateful for their waves and smiles and tell them we will
remember all of our days, their faces, the faces of hope, hope for
a new era in human history, an era of peace between our nations and
our peoples.
   Thank you and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   Esteemed Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, one hour from now you
will be leaving Moscow. In the first place, I want to thank you and
your colleagues for cooperation, openness and a business-like
approach to the talks we have had here. I believe that both of us
have every reason to regard this meeting and your visit as a useful
contribution to the development of dialogue betwen the Soviet Union
and the United States.
   Mr President, you and I have been dealing with each other for
three years now. From the first exchange of letters to the
conclusion of this meeting, we've come a long way. Our dialogue has
not been easy but we mustered enough realism and political will to
overcome obstacles and divert the train of U.S.-Soviet relations
from a dangerous track to a safer one.
   It has, however, so far been moving much more slowly than is
required by the real situation, both in our two countries and in
the whole world. But as I have understood, Mr. President, you are
willing to continue our joint endeavors.
   For my part, I can assure you that we will do everything in our
power to go on moving forward. Now, with the vast experience of
Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow and backed up by their
achievements, we are in duty bound to display still greater
determination and consistency. That is what the Soviet and American
peoples, international public opinion and the entire world
community are expecting of us.
   I hope you will have pleasant memories of your stay in this
country. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan when you return to America
please convey to the American people best wishes from the peoples
of the Soviet Union.
   Over the past three years, our two nations have come to know
each other better, they have now taken a really good look in each
other's eyes and have a keener sense of the need to learn to live
together on this beautiful planet Earth.
   I wish you a good journey back home, Mr. President and Mrs.
Reagan. To you and to all members of the U.S. delegation, I wish
good health. Good-bye.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
Thursday lost a three-year court battle to block Australian
publication of a former intelligence agent's memoirs.
   Mrs. Thatcher's expensive crusade against Peter Wright's
``Spycatcher'' had prompted protests that the government was
infringing on freedom of the press.
   Australia's highest court, the seven-judge High Court in the
capital of Canberra, ruled against Britain in its final bid to
suppress the book.
   The judges accepted Britain's contention that Wright was bound
by a lifetime oath of silence about his 25 years with the MI5
counterespionage agency, but they said Australian courts had no
jurisdiction to enforce a British security regulation.
   They unanimously rejected the British government's attempt to
seize all profits from ``Spycatcher'' to prevent further
publication of the book in Australia.
   About 240,000 copies of the book had been sold in Australia
after lower courts ruled in Wright's favor, and publishers William
Heinemann released 200,000 paperback copies immediately after
Thursday's verdict.
   The judgment also releases nearly $3.6 million in royalties to
the 73-year-old Wright, who lives on a horse farm in Tasmania and
is said to be in poor health.
   The publicity from Mrs. Thatcher's campaign against the book
accounts for much of the book's stunning commercial success.
   More than 1.4 million copies have been sold in 40 countries,
including the United States, despite the government's continued ban
in Britain and Hong Kong.
   The British taxpayer is left with an legal bill estimated at
$3.6 million. In the Australian case alone, the government was
ordered to pay an estimated $900,000 in legal costs.
   Wright's book, frequently smuggled into Britain by tourists and
Britons returning from overseas, describes his 20-year career in
the MI5 counterespionage service.
   It alleges that the security service eavesdropped on foreign
embassies, burgled offices, stole documents, plotted assassination
attempts and discussed how to bring down Harold Wilson's Labor
Party government in the 1970s.
   Mrs. Thatcher's attempt to suppress the memoirs dates from
September 1985 when an Australian court granted a temporary
injunction against the book.
   The subsequent hearings prompted newspapers in Britain to
publish extracts of ``Spycatcher,'' and the government immediately
clamped down, creating a confrontation over press freedom.
   The government maintains it has pursued the case to uphold the
principle that former security officers are bound by a lifetime
oath of silence about their work. To relax the rule, officials
argue, would seriously undermine national security.
   Lawmaker Tam Dalyell of the opposition Labor Party said the
government was squandering public money on its legal challenges.
   ``It was obvious to many lawyers and politicians many moons ago
that this (Australian decision) would happen,'' Dalyell said.
   ``It was political obstinacy and stupidity on behalf of the
government. ... The government must now abandon all other
proceedings relating to this book around the world.''
   The government still hopes to block ``Spycatcher'' in Britain,
where it has banned the book and brought a half-dozen court cases
to prevent newspapers from publishing extracts.
   On June 13, the nation's highest court, the five-judge Law Lords
of the House of Lords, is to decide whether to overturn a ban
imposed on publication of extracts from ``Spycatcher'' in three
newspapers, The Sunday Times, The Observer and The Guardian.
   Conservative Michael Mates said the principle confidentiality on
which the government based its case should be defended to the last.
   ``And I think the government has been entirely right to do that,
difficult and embarrassing as it has been,'' he said in an
interview with Independent Television News.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee voted
approval Thursday of a $300 billion military spending bill that
gives President Reagan far less than he wanted for his ``Star
Wars'' anti-missile defense.
   The voice vote action sends the bill to the floor of the
Democratic-controlled House, where it is expected to be considered
next week.
   The bill appropriates $299.5 billion for the Pentagon for the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which would be a reduction from the
current defense budget of $301 billion.
   The bill appropriates $3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. Reagan had sought $4.9
billion for the program, which has a $3.9 billion budget for the
current year.
   The bill appropriates money already authorized by the House last
month in a separate Pentagon measure.
   The appropriations bill did not contain a series of arms control
restrictions added last month by Democrats to the authorization
bill.
   Those restrictions eliminate all but the smallest nuclear tests,
require adherence to the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear arms
treaty and ban spending money for any Star Wars tests that violate
the existing interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty.
   The restrictions were dropped from the legislation approved
Thursday hiefly because of a jurisdictional fight within the House
between the Appropriations Committee and the Armed Services
Committee, which oversees the authorization bill.
   Under House rules, the appropriation bills are only supposed to
involve amounts of money, and not include policy issues such as
arms control. The Armed Services Committee had objected to adding
the arms control restrictions to the appropriations bill.
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., a member of the Appropriations
Committee and a supporter of the restrictions, said, ``I think you
might see the arms control amendments added on the floor.''
   ``My instinct is that it helps to have them on both bills,
appropriations and the authorization bill,'' said Dicks. ``I would
support adding them on the floor.''
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said, ``We didn't add the arms control
provision basically because of a jurisdictional question.''

<HEAD>Investigation Shows Credentialing Failure at Bethesda Naval
Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after its chief heart surgeon was
court-martialed, the Bethesda Naval Hospital has come under new
criticism for failing to follow physician credentialing procedures,
officials said Thursday.
   An internal investigation has concluded the latest problem did
not jeopardize patient care, and the competence of any doctors
never was called into question at the Maryland facility, the
officials added.
   But the finding that there was a procedural failure in the
hiring and credentialing of a physician at the Navy's premiere
hospital nonetheless has ``attracted high-level attention,'' one of
the officials said.
   The criticism is contained in an interim audit report by the
Navy's inspector general. The report was prompted by a complaint
from the current head of Bethesda's cardio-thoracic unit.
   The Navy said Thursday it would not release the interim audit
report, but several officials agreed to discuss the matter on
condition they not be identified.
   The issue is a particularly sensitive one for Bethesda because
of the case of Dr. Donal M. Billig, the former chief heart surgeon.
   Billig was court-martialed and convicted in 1986 of involuntary
manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three patients. That
conviction was overturned in April by an appeals court, however,
and Billig received an honorable discharge.
   One of the key issues raised by prosecutors during the
court-martial was that Billig hid a visual handicap from his
superiors and that military recruiters failed to investigate his
background adequately.
   In the latest case, the sources said the inspector general found
the Navy failed to adequately review the patient survival record of
a heart surgeon who was returning to Bethesda after five years in
private practice as the head of the Howard University Hospital
cardio-thoracic unit.
   Ironically, the surgeon involved _ Dr. Reginald Peniston _ was a
prosecution witness against Billig.
   The officials said Thursday that Peniston's credentials were not
reviewed formally by a new panel of naval officers before his
appointment to the hospital. Peniston's appointment was finalized
in February with orders given to him to report for duty in March.
   Peniston, who was assigned temporarily to the cardio-thoracic
unit at Walter Reed Army Medical Center early in May, did not
return a phone call Thursday to discuss the matter.
   The inspector general launched the investigation after a
complaint was filed by Cmdr. Edward Woods, the current head of the
Bethesda cardio-thoracic unit.

<HEAD>Six Stolen Miro Paintings Returned To Barcelona Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Thursday they recovered six
paintings by Joan Miro and arrested eight suspects in a theft two
months ago from the Fundacion Miro Museum in Barcelona.
   A painting believed to be the work of 19th century French artist
Henri Toulouse-Lautrec also was recovered, police chief Enrique de
Federico told reporters.
   Ferran Cardenal, civil governor of Barcelona, returned the Miro
paintings to the museum.
   On Wednesday, police in Milan, Italy, arrested Antonio Jorge
Carrancio of Spain in connection with the April 5 museum break-in.
   De Federico said Carrancio, 32, was in Italy seeking buyers for
the Miro works, which included gouaches, pastels and oils from the
Spanish artist's early period.
   Also on Wednesday, police arrested a 36-year-old Uruguayan, Luis
Anibal Medina, 36, and two suspects in Barcelona.
   Police found three Miro paintings and the work attributed to
Toulouse-Lautrec in a sealed tube buried near a cottage outside the
city. De Federico said authorities did not know where the fourth
painting had come from.
   The other three paintings were in a hollow wall in a fruit
warehouse owned by Carrancio's parents in the northern city of
Palencia, the police chief said, and parents and two Carrancio
brothers had wee arrested.
   Investigators began following Carrancio and Medina the day after
the theft, when a witness provided the license number of a van
registered to one of them, de Federico said.
   Carrancio set off an alarm when he broke into museum but escaped
because the lone, unarmed night watchman called police instead of
confronting the thief, police said. Medina allegedly was waiting
outside in the van.
   According to de Federico, both men have police records and are
not specialists in art theft.

<TEXT>
   Consumers lack adequate information to
evaluate the quality of care from doctors and hospitals, according
to a congressional study released Thursday.
   The study by the Office of Technology Assessment, prepared at
the request of Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., said there now is no
single source readily available to the consumer to evaluate the
quality of care, and what little information is available is
difficult to collect and understand.
   Such evaluations could be created, the report said, if congress
would act to require the data to be collected and released to the
public.
   ``We have all kinds of high-tech medical equipment now, but when
it comes to information for consumers on the quality of medical
care, we are still in the ice age,'' Scheuer said in releasing the
report. ``What information is available is inadquate and frequently
incomprehensible.''
   Scheuer said he will conduct hearings to determine the best way
to evaluate the qualilty of work by doctors and hospitals and then
will push for a legislation requiring that this information be
distributed to consumers.
   ``We're trying to develop a system to give consumers information
that they need,'' he said. ``We know now that there are valid
indicators to assess both hospitals and doctors.''
   The OTA report said quality of care information could be used
not only by individual consumers, but also by companies and labor
unions that are selecting hospitals, physician groups and health
maintenance organizations.
   Doctors could find the information on other doctors useful in
deciding on referrals and in hiring staff physicians at hospitals
or HMOs.
   For now, the report said consumers rely mostly on the
suggestions and experiences of friends and families to select
doctors and hospitals.

<HEAD>Chinatown Activist Dies At 90</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emily Lee Fong, a leader of Sino-Japanese
War relief efforts, has died of heart failure. She was 90.
   Fong came to San Francisco with her parents in 1899 from Canton,
China. She helped care for eight younger brothers and sisters in
their attic above a cigar factory operated by her father and uncles.
   A grandson, Carey Mark Huang, said Fong fought to attend high
school but her father drew the line at her aspirations for college
because she was too valuable to the family at home.
   Fong became a charter member of the Chinatown YWCA and helped
organize a YWCA Red Cross Auxiliary, teaching women to roll
bandages during World War I.
   She married Bing Shun Fong in 1919, and the student from Canton
who then was studying at Stanford later helped her rally more than
100 Chinese-American associations in the United States to
contribute to the war relief effort.
   In World War II, when Fong's sons joined the military, she
joined the American Women Voluntary Service to sell war bonds and
ferry soldiers to and from the Presidio's Letterman Hospital.
   Fong died May 21. She is survived by a daughter, Florinda Huang
of San Francisco; three sons, the Rev. Matthew Fong of San
Francisco, Dr. Albert Fong of Novato, and Wilmer Fong of San
Francisco; eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

   Fresh from the splendors of the Kremlin, President
Reagan and his wife Nancy went to Buckingham Palace for tea with
the queen Thursday and smiled aside all invitations to compare the
virtues of East and West.
   Standing on a red carpet in the marble-columned Grand Entrance
Hall of the 600-room palace, the president was asked by a reporter
whether he was happy to be out of Moscow and back in London.
   ``Let me put it very simply, I'm very happy to be in London,''
he replied, smiling wryly.
   Mrs. Reagan, whose prickly relationship with Raisa Gorbachev was
evident during this week's Moscow summit, was asked whether she was
happy to be seeing Queen Elizabeth II rather than the Soviet
leader's wife.
   ``I'm very happy to see the queen at all times,'' she replied
with a big smile.
   The hour-long tea in the queen's Audience Room overlooking the
45-acre palace gardens was a meeting of old friends. The Reagans
were guests of the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1982, and the
62-year-old monarch stayed at the Reagan ranch in 1983. Reagan
attended a Buckingham Palace dinner during the 1984 economic summit.
   The Reagans arrived at the palace two minutes late, getting out
of their limousine at the glassed-in Grand Entrance, where Prince
Charles and Princess Diana returned in a horse-drawn open carriage
after their 1981 wedding extravaganza.
   Inside the hall, the queen, hatless and wearing a sapphire-blue
silk dress, stretched out her hand and said: ``Nice to see you
again. How are you Mr. President?''
   Reagan, in a blue suit and red and blue striped tie, and the
first lady, wearing a silk two-piece dress and matching shoes in
her favorite color of red, chatted with the queen while posing for
photographers.
   Then, the queen led them along the gilt-and-white Marble Hall,
lined with sculptures and paintings mainly of her great-great
grandmother Queen Victoria, to the Audience Room, where she
receives Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her weekly audience.
   It was just tea for three, since the queen's husband, Prince
Philip, had a previous engagement in Suffolk.
   The Reagans' greeting was watched by about 50 members of the
queen's household who stood behind a red rope in the Marble Hall.
   Outside the palace, police said about 1,500 people gathered,
cheering and waving as the Reagans drove by. The president and his
wife waved back as they swept through the iron gates.
   ``We got a beautiful warm smile. It was worth the 2{-hour
wait,'' said Barbara Lee of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
   Barbara Black of Camarillo, California, said: ``I live ... about
30 miles from Reagan's ranch, and I don't bother to visit him, and
here I am half way around the world standing in line waiting to get
a vague glimpse of him.''
   Justine Griffin, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was
enthusiastic about the American president.
   ``I think he's a good bloke,'' she said.
   After tea, the Reagans went their separate ways.
   The president went to the Foreign Office where he was officially
welcomed by Mrs. Thatcher and a band of Welsh Guards playing the
national anthem and Irving Berlin hits.
   The first lady returned to the U.S. ambassador's residence,
Winfield House, to meet with Prince Charles, who flew back to
London from a series of public engagements in Lancashire.
   Mrs. Reagan and the 39-year-old heir to the throne have met
several times previously in Washington and London, and the palace
said they share an interest in social and human rights issues.

   The remains of the bunker where Adolf Hitler
committed suicide were destroyed to make room for a housing project
in East Berlin, the state-run East German news agency reported
Thursday.
   ``For the new building project, the former bunker site was
cleared over the past few months with numerous blastings and with
wreckage collection teams,'' the ADN news agency report said.
   During World War II, Hitler and other Nazi officials often used
bunker complexes in Berlin, then the capital of Germany, to direct
the war and seek protection for Allied bomb attacks.
   To avoid capture when the war ended, Hitler and his companion
Eva Braun killed themselves in the chancellory bunker, which was on
what now is part of the construction site in East Berlin.
   In recent years, the site next to the Berlin Wall was only a
pile of rubble that had become overgrown with grass and weeds.
   ADN said apartments for about 3,000 people will be constructed
there. It said a shopping center, school and kindergarten also will
be constructed as part of the project.

<HEAD>Study Says U.S. Living Standard Rises Slower Than in Other
Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The standard of living of workers in other
major countries has risen four times as fast as the U.S. standard
of living in the past 15 years, according to a new study on
American competitiveness released Thursday.
   The report, prepared by the Council on Competitiveness,
concluded that the United States had lost ground not only in terms
of living standards, but also in the related areas of international
trade, productivity and investment.
   ``In an increasingly global economy, others are either fast
gaining on us or have surpassed America in the areas that will
determine future competitive success,'' said Michael Porter, a
Harvard University economics professor who served as a consultant
on the study. ``If we continue along the path we've been on since
1972, we could lose the competitiveness battle altogether.''
   The council is a coalition of executives from industry,
organized labor and higher education who got together in 1986 to
help American companies compete more effectively in world markets.
   The new report is certain to heighten the debate in the
presidential campaign over whether the United States is becoming a
second-rate economic power. Critics of Reagan administration
policies point to the country's status as the world's largest
debtor nation to highlight their contention that a string of record
trade deficits during the 1980s shows that America has lost the
ability to compete internationally.
   The Reagan administration has dismissed such concerns,
contending that the country's trade deficits have begun to improve
and the United States is currently enjoying the longest peacetime
expansion on record.
   But the council's report argued that the administration's
position neglects long-term economic trends that paint a more
distressing picture.
   ``We would hope that both presidential candidates will have
strong programs to propose in this area,'' Porter said. ``This will
give the America people a benchmark with which to grade the quality
of each candidate's proposals.''
   The council presented what it called a ``competitiveness
index,'' which it said measured America's performance against its
competitors in global markets.
   The report said in all four areas it surveyed, the United States
had lost ground compared with the world's six other large
industrial democracies _ Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Canada and Italy. These nations and the United States meet annually
for economic summits, including an upcoming session this month in
Toronto.
   Among the report's conclusions:
   _Since 1972, the United States standard of living has grown only
one-fourth as fast as the average standard of living of the other
summit countries. When compared with America's two biggest
competitors, West Germany and Japan, the difference is even more
striking. American workers' standard of living has risen only
one-half as fast as the average West German and only one-seventh as
fast as the average Japanese. Because of these developments, the
council's standard of living index dropped to 78.9, which is 21.1
points below its 1972 level of 100.
   Traditional measures of the standard of living focus on total
output divided by the population. However, the council said it
divided output by the number of workers to reflect the fact that
more and more American families find they must have two incomes to
keep up financially. The council's living standard also included
the country's trade deficit on the grounds that this represented
money borrowed from foreigners that would eventually have to be
paid back.
   _Despite the boom in American export sales last year, America's
share of world exports stood at 10 percent last year, below the 12
percent share the country had in 1972. This pushed the trade index
down to 82.6 percent of its 1972 base. This was still an
improvement from 1986, when the index fell to 74.5, before the
weaker dollar began to boost U.S. export sales.
   _Productivity, the output per worker, showed the most lost
ground. The council's measure for productivity dropped to 68.7
percent of its 1972 base. Since 1972, manufacturing productivity in
Japan has increased eight times faster than in the United States,
while average productivity growth in the six summit countries has
been more than four times as fast as in America.
   _Long-term U.S. investment, including spending for research and
development, capital equipment and education, came out best in the
ranking at 96.2, down only 3.8 percent from the 1972 level.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis cut short his California campaign Thursday and
canceled his final debate with rival Jesse Jackson to return to
Massachusetts and his wife Kitty who faced back surgery Friday
morning.
   ``She feels good; she's obviously a little apprehensive,''
Dukakis said after talking with his wife by telephone before
leaving San Francisco.
   Mrs. Dukakis' surgery was decided upon after her doctor in
Boston, Nicholas T. Zervas, examined results of tests done last
Saturday while she was in Los Angeles.
   She was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital Wednesday
night for further tests, and hospital spokesman Martin Bander said
she was experiencing ``considerable increasing discomfort.''
   ``Because of the worsening of the condition, we feel it
important to operate now,'' Zervas said.
   Mrs. Dukakis had complained for about a month of a numbness in
her hands and pain in her neck, said Mark Gearan, campaign press
secretary for the Massachusetts governor.
   The surgery is to correct two herniated cervical discs in the
neck area of her back, Gearan said. He said no other medical
problem was discovered.
   ``I think everything is OK and is going to be OK, but Dr. Zervas
felt it was better to operate now and not wait a few days,''
Dukakis told reporter.
   Bander, the hospital spokesman, said the operation involved
taking a bone graft from Mrs. Dukakis' hip to replace a portion of
bone in her back that is pressing against her spinal cord.
   ``The plan is to remove the discs compressing on the spinal
cord. The bone graft taken from the hip will be split and fused
into the vertabrae to replace the two areas from which the discs
will be removed,'' Bander said.
   Dukakis said he regretted having to cancel campaign appearances
but ``this is obviously the most important thing.'' He said he
hoped to resume campaigning Saturday or Sunday ``if everything is
OK.''
   His debate with Jackson was to have been the last debate by the
Democratic presidential candidates of the primary season. Both
Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning toward the June 7 primaries in
California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   Jackson, in Los Angeles, said, ``I'm available to debate any
time.'' He said of Dukakis: ``His excuse is certainly an acceptable
one. ... I do fervently hope the debate can be rescheduled.''
   Among the other campaign events canceled was a scheduled stop in
Montana and a meeting with supporters in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Mrs. Dukakis' surgery was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EDT at
Massachusetts General, with a surgical team led by Zervas, chief of
neurosurgery at the hospital.
   Gearan said doctors described her medical problem as ``a
degenerative condition'' apparently not caused by an injury. She
has been wearing a neck brace.
   Dukakis arrived in California from Massachusetts only Wednesday
night. He attended just one public event, a meeting with school
children on a San Francisco beach, before leaving.
   Dukakis first met privately with environmentalists at a
restaurant, the Cliff House, overlooking the rocky Pacific coast
where seals played in the ocean. He then walked down to a beach
where he spoke informally to 45 elementary school pupils about the
environment and the importance of using biodegradable products that
will not leave lasting pollution.
   On another subject, at a news conference, Dukakis said the
summit meeting just concluded in Moscow ``wasn't dramatic'' but
produced ``a series of small steps that are encouraging.''
   ``Obviously there's some disappointment there's not a START
(strategic arms reduction) agreement, but that doesn't mean we
can't have one,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Two newspaper groups said Thursday they will
encourage newspaper ``readathons'' and other activities on Sept. 8
as part of what they are calling National Newspaper Literacy Day.
   The American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation and the
American Society of Newspaper Editors declared the special day to
coincide with the International Reading Association's celebration
of International Literacy Day.
   John Seigenthaler, editor and publisher of the Nashville
Tennessean and president of ASNE, said in announcing the joint
effort, ``National Newspaper Literacy Day focuses our attention on
the urgent need to eliminate illiteracy in America.''
   Sandra C. Hardy, vice president of Calkins Newspapers of
Levittown, Pa., and chairman of the ANPA Foundation, said, ``At
least 21 million adults cannot read at a survival level; up to 40
million cannot read bus schedules, job applications or the local
newspaper.''
   The newspaper associations' activities on that day _ the
Thursday after Labor Day _ include a National Literacy Symposium in
Washington on adult literacy programs; newspaper readathons in
shopping malls with the help of volunteers from the American
Association of Retired Persons and other organizations; and efforts
to encourage readers to share newspapers and magazines with people
who do not have print material at home.

   Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills rose
in Thursday's action to the highest level since before the October
stock market crash.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.8 billion of the bills at an
average discount rate of 7.08 percent, up from 6.74 percent at the
last auction on May 5.
   The rates were the highest since Sept. 30, when the one-year
bills sold for 7.32 percent. The new discount rate understates the
actual return to investors _ 7.59 percent with a $10,000 bill
selling for $9,284.10.

<HEAD>Researchers Find AIDS Virus' Precise Target on White Blood Cells</HEAD>

   Scientists have identified the precise
target where the AIDS virus latches onto cells it destroys, another
step toward a drug to combat the fatal disease.
   ``For the first time, we have fairly precisely defined the
structure on the cell surface to which a virus binds. This is a
primary step in the infective process,'' said protein chemist
Stephen B.H. Kent, research team leader at the California Institute
of Technology.
   Once the virus' target, called a ``binding site,'' was
identified by Caltech molecular biologist Bradford Jameson, the
study's chief author, he and his colleagues manufactured crude
synthetic copies of the binding site.
   The study's co-authors at the University of Alabama then found
that in the test tube, the fake binding sites acted as decoys to
attract the AIDS virus. They overwhelmed AIDS virus particles so
the virus couldn't latch onto real binding sites on T4 white blood
cells, the main cells infected and destroyed by the virus, which
cripples the immune system.
   If scientists can create more sophisticated versions of the fake
binding site, those might work as a drug to treat or cure acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, or to carry virus-killing drugs to the
AIDS virus.
   The same method might be used to create drugs to fight other
viruses, rheumatoid arthritis and rejection of transplanted organs,
Jameson said.
   ``This is the first step toward a second-generation drug'' that
could be available in 10 years and be more effective than drugs now
under development to combat the AIDS virus, Kent said, adding, ``We
do not want to give people false hope.''
   ``Kent is exaggerating the length of time a little bit,'' said
Dr. Mathilde Krim, a founder of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research. ``If things go very well, I'd say two years until it (the
drug) would be made available to people with life-threatening HIV
(AIDS virus) infection.''
   Krim's foundation funded the $120,000 study, which is being
published Friday in the journal Science. Other co-authors included
ORTHO Pharmaceuticals researchers in Raritan, N.J.
   Scientists previously knew the AIDS virus infects T4 white blood
cells by binding to CD4, a protein on their surface. Caltech
researchers identified the exact part of that protein to which the
AIDS virus binds, and determined that it looks like a loop
protruding from the protein.
   ``To my knowledge, it is the first time a binding site has been
identified with such precision for any virus,'' Krim said by phone
from New York. ``It's a wonderful accomplishment.''
   ``It will enable people to get a handle on the mechanism by
which a virus can infect a cell,'' Jameson said.
   In December, researchers at Philadelphia's Smith Kline & French
Laboratories, South San Francisco's Genentech Inc. and Boston's
Dana Farber Cancer Institute said they manufactured synthetic CD4
proteins. In test-tube experiments, the fake proteins acted as
decoys, preventing the AIDS virus from infecting T4 cells.
   The fake binding site copies made by Jameson, Kent and Caltech
biology chairman Leroy Hood stopped AIDS infection the same way.
Kent speculated that a drug made only of fake binding sites, rather
than fake whole CD4 proteins, should last longer in the bloodstream
and be more effective in stopping AIDS.
   A major obstacle is that either fake CD4 proteins or fake
binding sites might serve not only as decoys for the AIDS virus,
but as decoys for macrophages, cells that carry invading germs to
T4 cells so they can be destroyed by the immune system.
   So a drug meant to prevent AIDS from destroying the immune
system might actually prevent the immune system from performing its
job, Kent said.
   But Krim said that risk should be much lower if fake binding
sites rather than fake CD4 proteins are used in a drug, and that
such risk would be acceptable in treating severely ill AIDS
patients.
   Kent said drugs could be developed against other viruses if
scientists identify precisely binding sites on cells those viruses
attack, then make fake binding sites to prevent the viruses from
reaching their intended targets.
   Such drugs might be useful even if they harm the immune system.
Those drugs might be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other
``autoimmune'' diseases _ in which the body is attacked by its own
immune system _ and to prevent the immune system from rejecting
transplanted organs, Krim and Jameson said.

<HEAD>Soviet Plant Apparently Discharging Radioactive Clouds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish monitors said Thursday they
have detected radiation indicating that a nuclear power plant in
the Soviet Union routinely discharges clouds of radioactive
particles.
   ``The levels are still harmless, but they illustrate a poorer
security thinking than we have in Sweden,'' said Lars-Erik de Geer
of the defense research agency FOA.
   He said a study of wind directions and radiation levels at
different monitoring stations pointed to the Ignalina plant in
Lithuania as the source of the radiation.
   He said the plant 400 miles southeast of Stockholm has made four
large discharges of radioactive particles every year since it
started operations at the end of 1983.
   Each discharge from Ignalina contains 10,000 times more
radioactive material than a Swedish nuclear plant discharges over
an entire year, he said.
   ``The guideline in Sweden is to discharge as little as
possible,'' de Geer said in a telephone interview. ``We pointed it
out to the Soviet nuclear authorities in 1986, but they denied such
discharges were made at Ignalina.'' Sweden has been on higher alert
against radioactivity since the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl
plant, 720 miles southeast of here, sent clouds of contamination
over vast areas of northern Sweden.
   The world's worst nuclear accident killed at least 31 people
near the plant.

<HEAD>Gannett Chairman Says Castro, Botha Mistreated By U.S. Reporters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allen H. Neuharth, chairman of Gannett Co.,
Inc., said Thursday that world leaders such as Cuba's Fidel Castro
and South Africa's P.W. Botha have been mistreated by U.S.
reporters whom many heads of state now view as the new ugly
Americans.
   Neuharth, answering questions after a speech at the National
Press Club, said that although he has no sympathy with Cuban
communism or with South African racism, leaders such as Castro and
Botha have a legitimate complaint.
   ``Botha and Castro have been mistreated by the press'' because
reporters have not let them be heard fairly, he said.
   All world leaders ``have the right to present their point of
view without some reporter, especially a reporter from this
country, acting like judge and jury, confronting and convicting and
then spreading news of that conviction,'' said the 64-year-old
chairman and founder of the internationally circulated newspaper
USA Today.
   Since February, Neuharth has visited 19 countries and
interviewed 15 heads of state in the newspaper's ``JetCapade''
reporting venture.
   Neuharth, who is midway in the tour with members of his staff
who fly aboard a private jetliner, said he believes he has gained
access to a wide variety of world leaders, including Castro and
Botha, because his newspaper is ``informational rather than
confrontational.''
   ``In the eyes of some leaders, the `ugly American' is no longer
the wealthy camera-laden tourist in Bermuda shorts. He or she is
the arrogant Nikon-carrying reporter from a big U.S.A. newspaper,''
Neuharth said.
   ``I hope we will not be tempted to start or stop wars, dethrone
presidents or kings or elect them. I don't think that's our role,''
he said, in announcing that 5-year-old USA Today would once again
not endorse a U.S. presidential candidate.
   He said, however, he has ``no quarrel'' with the newspaper's
editorial board decision to call for the resignation of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.
   Neuharth said attempts to curtail press freedom are unfortunate,
``but they go with the territory as the U.S.A. press exerts greater
influence around the world.''
   ``Unless we are sensitive to different political systems and
philosophies, unless we try to report international issues from al
perspectives, not just ours, we run the risk of perpetuating
worldwide the same image of arrogance some of us suffer from here
in the U.S.A.,'' he said.
   ``Worldwide, I think it's extremely important that the media
from the U.S.A. practice informational journalism, not
confrontational journalism. We should inform, not indict ...,'' he
said.
   ``If we do that, foreign leaders and their people will talk to
us and share their problems and their hopes. If we don't, they'll
resent us and try to shut us out.''
   Neuharth said USA Today's circulation and advertising revenue
are at an all-time high, with average daily paid circulaton of 1.6
million, more than 105 ad pages published last week and weekly
revenues of $3.7 million.
   He predicted that the newspaper, which had its first profitable
quarter at the end of 1987, would either show a profit or a
marginal loss for all of 1988.
   Gannett owns and operates 90 daily newspapers, 35 non-dailies,
10 television stations, 16 radio stations, and the largest outdoor
advertising operation in North America, according to a company news
release.

   Martha Chappel's sole surviving son has just
graduated from high school even though he suffers from the
congenital illness that killed his three brothers, becoming the
first of her children to live long enough to reach that goal.
   ``God has not given me children to keep forever,'' she said
Thursday. ``He gave them to me to love and care for, they are a
loan.''
   Willie Jackson, 18, graduated this week from Cold Spring School,
a public school for mentally and physically handicapped children.
   One son, Adrian, died when he was 5 in 1976, followed by Eddie
in 1979 at 15 and Ernie in 1981 at 18.
   The cause each time was a rare, inherited disorder known as
Hunter's syndrome, which causes mental retardation and physical
abnormalities. There is no cure or therapy for the disease, which
strikes only males and can cause dwarfism, deafness, heart defects
and arthritic joint pain.
   ``He knew all his brothers and that they died in the hospital
and he becomes very upset when we go to a hospital,'' said Mrs.
Chappel.
   The life expectancy of children with Hunter's is 15 years.
Willie is a dwarf and is moderately retarded and deaf in one ear.
   ``This boy has been so close to death you could almost see it,
but he's so strong,'' said his stepfather, Waller Chappel.
   Mrs. Chappel didn't know her first two boys had Hunter's until
after the third, Willie, was born.
   ``In the beginning, it was like a shock to me. I cried for
days,'' Mrs. Chappel said. ``I kept thinking I'll have a girl and
I'll tell her not to have children. I've always wanted a lot of
kids. That's been my goal since I was little.''
   ``There have been times when I've been frustrated, but whenever
things got rough I had friends and relatives to help me over the
hump,'' Mrs. Chappel said.
   Because of the disease, Willie has a small esophagus and
difficulty breathing. He tires easily and can walk only about a
half block at a time.
   ``For the last six or seven months we've been spending about
$500-to-$600 a month for his medical expenses. We have to have
oxygen and had to get a wheelchair. We've had to struggle, but the
time with Willie and the other boys has been worth it,'' Mrs.
Chappel said.
   The graduation was ``one of the highlights of my life,'' said
Mrs. Chappel. ``He's the first to live long enough to accomplish
it.''
   She hopes to enroll Willie in a day adult program for the
handicapped so he can continue associating with other youngsters.
   ``He knew something exciting was going on (at the graduation),
all the people and receiving a certificate. He knew there was some
sort of special conglomeration taking place. But, I think he'll be
kind of sad when he learns what it means, that he won't be seeing
the teachers and children every day,'' Mrs. Chappel said. ``He's
always looked forward to the bus rides to school.''

   A strong earthquake shook the western
island of Cephalonia Thursday for the third time in two weeks but
there were no reports of damage or injuries, police said.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the tremor measured 5 on
the Richter scale. Its epicenter was in the Ionian seabed off
Cephalonia, about 195 miles from Athens.
   ``We felt the tremor around lunchtime but people didn't bother
to leave their homes and there were no damage reports,'' said a
police officer on Cephalonia, speaking on condition of anoymity.
   Tremors measuring 5.8 and 5.3 on the Richter scale shook the
island on May 18 and May 21 but caused no damage.
   Buildings on Cephalonia have been constructed to withstand
tremors of 7 on the Richter scale ever since the Ionian islands off
western Greece were hit by a devastating quake in 1953.
   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A quake measuring 5 on the Richter quake can cause considerable
damage and quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

   Only 15 children remained in the National
Spelling Bee today after the sixth round as the complexity of words
began drawing gasps from the audience and sighs of relief from
competitors lucky enough to survive.
   Thirty-seven youngsters were eliminated in the contest's sixth
round, bringing to 129 the number who found Thursday's words too
arduous to master.
   A record field of 200 contestants on Wednesday began the bee,
which is sponsored by Scripps Howard newspapers.
   That field had included Iris Liu of Muncie, Ind., the youngest
hopeful ever to make the national finals in their 61-year history.
   Iris, a third-grader whose parents moved to this country from
Taiwan in 1979 and operate a bookstore in Muncie, Ind., stumbled on
``waywiser,'' an instrument used to measure distances.
   She spelled it as ``weighweiser,'' then pivoted and walked
quickly from the stage with her hands folded in front of her pink
frilly dress when informed that she was wrong.
   Iris, who turns 9 on June 20, cried into a tissue outside the
hotel ballroom where the bee proceeded.
   Her mother, Clara, comforted her, then turned to a reporter and
said, ``She knows lots of difficult words, so the easy words she
missed.''
   Robert Pryor, 11, from Washington, D.C., had apparently
recovered from a nervous stomach that had so weakened him that he
had to be helped to the microphone on Wednesday.
   But with a bee official standing behind him, the son of a
computer analyst was eliminated today when asked to spell
``fidgetiness'' _ nervous movement.
   ``Ohhh,'' he moaned as he learned his fate from the judges.
   Fifty-six hopefuls were eliminated in the first day of the
competition.
   Wednesday's rounds featured a spelling error by bee officials
themselves.
   They began distributing to reporters a list of words that had
been asked in the first round when one journalist pointed out that
a word appeared to be misspelled. Indeed, ``hitchhike'' had come
out ``hitchike'' on the bee's list, and officials stopped handing
it out while they penned in the missing ``h'' on all 300 copies.
   When the event began Wednesday, there were 102 girls and 98 boys
from 47 states, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Guam and Mexico in the running.
   None of them was yet 15 years old, even though contest rules
permit entrants who have not reached their 16th birthdays, are not
yet in the ninth grade and have not won previously.
   Last year's winner was Stephanie Petit, 13, from Bethel Park,
Pa., who correctly spelled ``staphylococci,'' a bacteria. In that
contest, in which there were 185 entrants, it took 876 words before
a winner was declared.
   There were 485 words offered Wednesday.
   Webster's Third New International Dictionary, copyright 1986,
which seemingly weighs as much as some of the contestants, is used
as the final authority by the judges.
   Competitors are eliminated as soon as they misspell a word. A
judge clangs a desk top bell to let each error-maker know that for
him or her, the contest is over.
   When only two contenders are left, the rules change. If a
contestant misspells a word, his or her opponent is asked to spell
it correctly. If the opponent can correctly spell the misspelled
word and one additional word, a winner is declared.
   Contest officials estimate that 8 million to 9 million children
competed in local tournament that produced the 200 hopefuls who
traveled to Washington for the finals.
   The event offers $1,500 and other prizes to the winner.
   Scripps Howard also gives $1,000 to the second place finisher,
$750 for third place, $500 for fourth, $400 for fifth, $300 for
sixth, $200 each for seventh through 10th, $100 each for 11th
through 20th, and $50 to each of the other 180 entrants.

   The condition of a 5-year-old boy whose arm
was ripped off in a farm machine stabilized Thursday, and he was
taken off the critical list at Tampa General Hospital.
   ``He is serious but stable, which shows he is improving and
that's good news,'' said Emily Stehle, hospital spokeswoman.
   A team of three doctors gave up Wednesday after nine hours of
surgery to try to reattach Fidencio Jaurequi's limb. His right arm
was ripped from its socket Tuesday when he poked his hand into a
machine that sorts tomatoes at Singletary Farms in Dade City, where
his mother works.
   The boy's father, Salvador Jaurequi, is a carpenter who moved to
Florida from Guadalajara, Mexico, 10 years ago.
   His mother, Eustolia Jaurequi, brought her son to work Tuesday
because there was no one home to care for him, said Dora Jaurequi,
sister-in-law of the boy's father. Fidencio finished a preschool
program last month.
   Mrs. Jaurequi told investigators that Fidencio asked for money
to buy a snow cone just after lunch. He returned to where his
mother stood sorting tomatoes and began trying to touch a rolling
conveyor belt. Mrs. Jaurequi told him to stay away, but when turned
her back for a moment, the accident occurred.
   Earl Singletary, co-owner of the farm, said the machine has a
safety switch, but ``when it happened, it happened. It was done.''
   Officials from the Tampa office of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration have begun an investigation, said Lawrence
Falck, area director.
   ``Our jursidiction is related only to the employees,'' he said.
``But from the description of the accident it sounds like there may
be hazards to employees there.''
   Singletary said Mrs. Jaurequi and some relatives have worked on
and off at the farm for about seven years.
   Dora Jaurequi said her nephew, who was born in Dade City, is a
``very happy boy.'' School officials agreed, describing him as
``delightful'' and well-mannered.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Women Held in Kentucky Federal Prison Were Mistreated</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 3 grafs after 4th graf, Deutsch appeared, with Bureau
of Prisons rebuttal; picks up 5th graf pvs, Last week</NOTE>

   A half-dozen women prisoners, held in an
isolation unit in an underground Kentucky federal prison, are being
treated so inhumanely that they may be permanently psychologically
harmed, a federal judge was told Thursday.
   A lawyer argued that the women, all serving long terms in the
Federal Correctional Institution in Lexington, Ky., had to disrobe
in rooms visible to guards, shower in stalls without curtains, did
not have recreation equipment in the exercise yard, went without
heat in freezing weather and were shackled hands and feet whenever
they were taken out of their unit.
   Attorney Michael Deutsch said most of the five women he
represents had been placed in the special unit because of their
political beliefs, not for their prison behavior, and that the
purpose was ``to destroy these women.''
   Deutsch appeared before U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker
seeking to have the women removed from the high security unit and
to have it closed. The Bureau of Prisons has said it intends to
shut down the unit in July when a new medium- and high-security
facility for women will be opened in Marianna, Fla.
   John C. Cleary, representing the Bureau of Prisons, said that
the women were transferred into the unit because they posed ``a
risk of external assault on the prison.'' He said there is no
medical evidence to support an accusation that they have suffered
psychological harm.
   ``There is no question that it's constitutional to prevent
prison escapes,'' he told the judge. ``At no time were the
political beliefs of these women taken into account in transferring
them to the high security unit.''
   The arguments will continue next Tuesday.
   Last week, the Soviet news agency Trud said that the FBI was
conducting experiments on female political prisoners at the
Kentucky institution and ``exerting psychological pressures aimed
at breaking the will of the prisoners.''
   There was no reference to such activity in Deutsch's
presentation.
   But he said, the women ``are suffering from restricted
environment syndrome, from sensory deprivation, free-floating
anxiety and depression.''
   One inmate, Susan Rosenberg, was in court. She is serving a
58-year term for possessing weapons and explosives in connection
with a 1985 police raid in New Jersey and is one of seven recently
indicted in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Capitol.
   Another of the inmates is Sylvia Baraldini, convicted of
racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a $1.6 million Brink's
armored car heist in Nyack, N.Y. that left a guard and two police
officers dead. Ms. Rosenberg was linked by law enforcement officers
to the same bungled Brink's robbery.
   Deutsch said that Ms. Baraldini had been in prison for more than
four years with only one minor infraction _ that of cutting to the
wrong side of a food line _ on her record.
   He said she was sent from prison in Pleasanton, Calif., to the
newly opened isolation unit in Kentucky in 1986 without being told
why. As for Ms. Rosenberg, he said, her status as a sympathizer
with terrorist groups was inexplicably elevated to that of member
in letter exchanges between prision officials.
   ``There is no need to have these women in this unit,'' Deutsch
said. ``There is no evidence they were involved in any escape
attempt or that they were plotting to escape.''
   Deutsch told Parker that the women were sent there after ``a
call for bodies to fill this unit.''
   The unit can house 16 women but has not had more than six, he
said, adding: ``What has happened is this: They realize they are
running an unconstitutional unit and they are closing it down.''

   Telephone companies are busy rewiring Atlanta for
next month's Democratic National Convention, and they are promising
to install phones just about anywhere, even in trees.
   ``The news media have got to be able to cover the news where it
happens. We have to be able to respond,'' said Paul Harman,
convention coordinator for Southern Bell.
   ``We've examined the places where you're likely to get protests:
Piedmont Park, Central City Park. ... We'll be able to drop 'em a
business line from a tree in Piedmont Park if that's what they
want. Maybe not in two hours, but close,'' said Harmon.
   About 20,000 delegates, alternates, reporters and technicians
are expected in town for the July 18-21 convention.
   Southern Bell has created a special 9,000-line phone system that

   The United States conducted its third
nuclear test in less than three weeks Thursday, just hours after
the conclusion of the Moscow summit.
   Nuclear testing was one of the issues addressed in Moscow, with
the Soviet Union and the United States formally agreeing to monitor
each other's tests this summer in joint verification experiments.
   The test shook the Nevada desert and registered on seismic
equipment atop hotels and casinos here, 110 miles from ground zero.
The blast measured 5.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion at the
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   Soviet scientists who are setting up monitoring equipment at the
Nevada Test Site were at Mercury, Nev., 52 miles from ground zero,
at the time of Thursday's blast. The Soviet scientists also were on
hand for two previous tests, May 13 and May 21.
   The test was the fifth announced blast this year, and the 680th
announced test since the program moved to the Nevada desert in
January 1951.
   The nuclear device was buried 2,000 feet beneath the surface of
Pahute Mesa, a rocky patch of desert in the far northwest corner of
the 1,350-square-mile test site.
   The blast had an explosive force of up to 150 kilotons. The
atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima had an explosive yield of 13
kilotons. All tests are listed as less than 20 kilotons or 20 to
150 kilotons, with advance notice given for tests at or near the
upper limits. Such a notice was issued Tuesday.
   The force of the blast produced a gentle swaying motion at the
Regency Towers high-rise condominiums in Las Vegas, according to
Energy Department spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg.
   ``Everything appears normal,'' Ms. Yoerg said as she monitored
the blast from a control point 31 miles from ground zero. ``Nothing
is coming out of the ground.''
   The success of underground tests is measured, in part, by the
ability to prevent radiation from leaking into the atmosphere.
   Ms. Yoerg said she did not feel any ground motion at the control
point. DOE personnel monitoring such blasts often experience a
rocking motion following detonation.
   DOE seismic equipment atop the Golden Nugget and Mint hotels in
downtown Las Vegas and the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip
recorded the blast ``distinctly,'' according to Ms. Yoerg. A
similar reading was obtained at Scotty's Castle in Death Valley, 60
miles from ground zero.

   Vice President George Bush could face a close
race in Texas this fall, particularly if paired against a
Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, according to a newspaper poll released Thursday.
   Bush, the all-but-sure Republican nominee, held a roughly
seven-point lead over the Massachusetts governor when voters were
asked to consider only the two candidates, according to the poll
conducted for the Houston Chronicle.
   The poll, conducted between May 13-28, showed 48 percent of the
785 voters surveyed preferring Bush if the presidential election
were held the day they were contacted. Forty-one percent said they
would vote for Dukakis.
   However, when the Democratic front-runner was paired with
Bentsen as his running mate, Bush led Dukakis by only two
percentage points, 43 percent to 41 percent, falling within the
poll's three-point margin of error.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday refused to release
convicted anti-Castro terrorist Orlando Bosch while he appeals an
immigration service order expelling him from the country.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler reviewed 700 documents,
many of them classified intelligence reports linking Bosch, 61, to
two violent anticommunist groups, before denying bond.
   Bosch returned to the United States in February after spending
11 years in Venezuelan jails successfully fighting charges he blew
up a Cuban jetliner in 1976, killing all 73 aboard. He had fled
Florida in 1974 while on probation for a 1968 Miami bazooka attack
on a Polish ship that had previously stopped in Cuba.
   The federal parole commission, saying it had no objection to
Bosch's being freed, turned his case over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   Bsch's attorney, Hank Adorno, said he had a right to live in
Miami's exile community, where he has received strong support from
many anti-Castro Cubans, ``in light of the fact that he has
renounced his ways of fighting communism and fighting Castro.''
   But the INS started proceedings to deport him, calling him an
undesirable alien with terrorist connections. The agency said he
would not be sent to Cuba, but did not specify a country where he
would go.
   The agency said Bosch has ``a history of leadership and
involvement in terrorist groups and activities,'' including a role
in two groups responsible for more than 50 bombings in the United
States and Latin America.
   ``Terrorism is terrorism, no matter how long ago it took
place,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Kenny, representing
the INS. Freeing Bosch would ``send the wrong message'' to
terrorists, she said.
   Bosch is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center south of Miami.
   Bosch's daughter Myriam lashed out at the decision to keep her
father in custody, blaming it on the Reagan administration's desire
to reach a global accommodation with the Soviet Union and its
allies.
   ``Cuba does not want him free,'' she said. ``That is why my
father is behind bars.''
   Attorneys for Bosch said they planned to appeal to the federal
appeals court in Atlanta, but his daughter said the judge had been
the family's last hope.
   ``He's going to die in jail,'' Ms. Bosch said bitterly. ``Why
don't they just send him back to Cuba?''
   Early Thursday, Hoeveler abandoned a compromise that he had
proposed earlier to allow Bosch to remain under house arrest while
appealing his expulsion.
   Hoeveler made no reference to that proposal in his eight-page
order rejecting the petition for parole. The order said the
government has a ``legitimate and bona fide reason'' for wanting to
expel Bosch.
   Under federal law, the INS can hold an alien pending disposition
of deportation proceedings provided it is acting in good faith.
   ``The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the attorney
general has acted in bad faith,'' the judge said, therefore he had
no power to overrule the INS decision to keep Bosch in custody.
   His deportation case now goes to the regional commissioner of
the INS in Dallas for a recommendation.

<HEAD>Phone Service is Returning to Chicago Suburbs as Costs Mount</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HINSDALE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The six Chicago suburbs that lost all or
part of their telephone service in a May 8 switching station fire
should have service restored by this weekend, officials said
Thursday.
   About 35,000 Illinois Bell customers had their service disrupted
when the station, which houses computerized equipment that connects
local and long distance calls, was damaged in the blaze.
   The costs of the outage continued rising _ not only for
businesses whose phone service was cut off, but also for local
governments forced to pay for overtime and emergency equipment.
   ``I've gotten very close to Illinois Bell officials over the
past few weeks,'' said Hinsdale Village Manager Ronald Ruskey.
``I'm learning about the telephone business.''
   The fire also disrupted service at several automatic teller
machines, Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s catalog sales phones and
off-track betting parlors. Crews at the Federal Aviation
Administration's control center in Aurora were forced to go to a
backup phone system, delaying some flights to Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport by two hours.
   The total cost to communities and businesses could exceed $100
million, officials said, and they said Bell would be asked to help
pay for it.
   Bell spokeswoman Laura Littel said the phone service should be
restored for customers by 12:01 a.m. Sunday, more than a week ahead
of schedule. About half the 35,000 customers were switched over to
the new system last Friday.
   ``There may be a few bugs, but we're hoping for the best,'' Ms.
Littel said.
   For governments, the fire meant extra overtime and equipment to
connect emergency services. The estimated costs ranged from $13,000
at Burr Ridge to $65,000 at Clarendon Hills.
   Ms. Littel said the exact cause of the fire is still being
investigated. The Illinois Commerce Commission hired an Annapolis,
Md., firm, Forensic Technologies International Corp., to
investigate.
   ``We do know that it's possibly electrical in nature,'' she said.
   Bell, which has promised customer rebates for the disrupted
service, is facing lawsuits from several businesses. The businesses
contend Bell was negligent in unstaffing the Hinsdale station and
for having no direct telephone link with the local fire department
at the time of the fire.
   In addition, Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan has filed a
complaint with the ICC, asking the comission to order Bell to pay
for financial losses.

<HEAD>Unacceptably High Radon Levels Found at AF Academy, Colorado Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Thursday a new program of
testing its bases for the natural radioactive gas radon had turned
up two facilities inside the United States and three outside with
unacceptably high readings.
   Both of the bases inside the United States are located near
Colorado Springs, Colo. _ the U.S. Air Force Academy and Peterson
Air Force Base.
   One of the three bases outside the country is Andersen Air Force
Base on the island of Guam. The Air Force said it would not
identify the other two overseas bases until it had notified the
host country's government.
   The service said in a statement it was launching a more
extensive radon survey of all habitable structures and preparing to
take ``quick corrective action'' at the academy and Peterson and
Andersen bases because of radon readings above the level of 20
picoCuries per liter of air.
   ``The Environmental Protection Agency considers radon levels of
four picoCuries or less per liter of air acceptable,'' the Air
Force said. ``For a level of radon (above 20 picoCuries), the EPA
recommends that corrective action be taken within several months.''
   The service said that at 49 other bases around the world, it had
discovered one or more structures with radon levels between four
and 20 picoCuries per liter. In those cases, every habitable
building at the bases will be screened for the next year to
determine which ones need repair work to reduce radon levels below
the four picoCurie standard.
   The Air Force said 33 of those 49 bases were located in the
United States. The other 16 are located in foreign countries and
will be publicly identified ``in the near future following
notification of host countries.''
   All told, the Air Force said it had taken 4,404 air samples at
135 major bases and found 211, or 4.8 percent, at a level above
four picoCuries.
   ``The EPA has found levels above four picoCuries per liter in 14
percent to 20 percent of the houses they have tested nationwide,''
it added.
   The service declined to speculate on why the radon levels at the
two Colorado facilities and on Guam were unacceptably high.
   The Air Force became the first of the military services last
December to launch a test program for radon. The Army has since
followed suit and the Navy and Marine Corps are considering such a
move.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless natural product of decaying
uranium in the soil. Medical research has indicated that exposure
to high levels of radon over extended periods may increase the risk
of lung cancer.
   ``Results of commercial testing in communities throughout the
United States, coupled with concern about the health of Air Force
members and their families, prompted the decision to test,'' the
service said last year in announcing the program.
   The Air Force has said it will launch a ``mitigation program''
for those buildings where radon levels exceed the recommended EPA
standards, sealing foundation cracks or installing new ventilation
systems.
   The service estimated last year it would spend up to $2.6
million on the testing and up to $30 million on repair work. The
Air Force said Thursday it now appeared those figures would be
overstated, but added it did not have new estimates available.

   A television tower more than twice as tall as
the Eiffel Tower collapsed Thursday, killing two maintenance
workers seeking to strengthen the structure and leaving one
missing, authorities said.
   The 2,000-foot tower was reduced to a ``tangled pile of metal,''
said C.L. Harlan, a Missouri State Highway Patrol dispatcher.
   Workers used torches Thursday afternoon to cut through the
debris in search of the third man.
   ``I don't think there's any hope of anyone who was on that tower
surviving,'' said patrol Sgt. Ron Lenzini.
   The center section of the tower fell with such force that it
went into the ground, he said. ``It's so far down that they have
digging equipment out there.''
   Colony is about 25 miles from the Iowa and Illinois state lines
and 200 miles northwest of St. Louis. The tower belonged to KTVO-TV
in Kirksville.
   The three workers were in a basket-type carrier at the 500-feet
level when the tower collapsed, the patrol said.
   Martha Huber, 15, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the
tower, witnessed the collapse.
   ``I saw the buggy or thing they run up the tower in, and I saw
this coming down and part of the tower with it,'' she said. ``You
couldn't see much because the dust was flying so much. I saw some
of the cables snapping and we called the ambulance right away.''
   Many of the 30 heavy cables that supported the tower snapped
when it collapsed, witnesses said.
   The tower did not strike any homes in the mainly rural area, but
tore down several trees, she said.
   Jerry Heilman, KTVO general manager, said the workers were
replacing more than 1,000 structural braces.
   They were employees of Structural System Technology Inc. of
McLean, Va., and had been working in Colony for several weeks.
   Peter Kizer, president of KTVO's parent company, Federal
Broadcasting of Southfield, Mich., was en route to the scene to
speak with station personnel and the media, Heilman said.
   The tower was erected in September at a cost of $2.5 million and
was one of the tallest transmission towers in the United States,
authorities said. By comparison, the famed Eiffel Tower of Paris is
984 feet tall.
   The tower's unusual height was intended to expand KTVO's viewing
area, said Kurt Sweeney, station news director. It increased the
station's audience from 40,000 households to about 120,000,
officials said.
   ``I heard it (the collapse) and it sounded like a jet taking
off,'' said Elizabeth Huber, Ms. Huber's sister.
   KTVO went off the air about 9:50 a.m. Heilman said the station
could be off the air anywhere from two days to two weeks.
   The tower was the maximum height permitted under Federal
Aviation Administration rules, said Sharon Scott, public service
specialist for the Federal Communications Commission in Kansas City.

<HEAD>Boeing Spokesman Says Company Would Oppose Mandatory Airplane
Retirement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes would oppose any
effort to set a mandatory retirement age for jetliners even though
such a requirement could boost sales of new planes, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
   ``It would be arbitrary and we don't think it would be
necessary,'' Jack Gamble, a spokesman for the Seattle-based
aerospace company, said during a break in a Federal Aviation
Administration-sponsored conference on aging aircraft.
   On Wednesday, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor raised the
possibility of mandatory airplane retirement. But Gamble said
Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers have found nothing to
suggest that jetliners can't fly safely for years if they are
properly maintained.
   ``We could be selfish and say it would be good for us,'' Gamble
said of mandatory aircraft retirement. ``But it is good equipment.''
   ``Mandatory retirement just wouldn't make any sense,'' he said.
   The average age of the world airline fleet has increased from
eight years in 1980 to nearly 12 years in 1988, said Gamble. By
2005 the average age of jetliners is expected to be 15 years.
   Gamble said that Boeing's commercial planes are built to provide
at least 20 years of ``economical'' service.
   The FAA called the three-day conference as a result of increased
concern about the safety of older jetliners since the in-flight
breakup of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 in April.
   A 20-foot section of the plane tore away and a flight attendant
was swept to her death, although pilots were able to land the
aircraft safely.
   Gamble said that even before the Aloha incident there was
increasing industry interest in aging plans and that Boeing began
looking at the problems as early as 1983.
   Since January 1987, Gamble said, Boeing has been conducting an
informal survey of 50 of its older planes owned by 33 airlines in
19 countries.
   ``There have been no surprises,'' he said of a preliminary
analysis of the survey.
   In addition, Boeing recently put a 737 it purchased from
Piedmont Airlines after an accident through an extensive series of
tests that simulated more than 200,000 takeoffs and landings.
   ``We didn't find anything unexpected,'' said Gamble, adding that
some small cracks were found in the airplane after the test, but
they were easily fixed.
   The Aloha plane involved in the recent accident had undergone
about 90,000 landings and takeoffs.

   It's crowded at the top, at least at
Bellefontaine High School.
   When diplomas are passed out Sunday to 185 seniors, the school
will honor 14 valedictorians, each of whom managed a perfect 4.0
grade point average.
   ``It makes us look like we're grading on a very easy kind of
basis. But these are the same standards that we've always had. This
is an extremely unusual group of kids who just happen to be in the
same class,'' said Principal George Harris.
   Harris said the 14 valedictorians had shown their academic
prowess on college admission and scholarship tests as well as in
class. They earned more than $52,000 in scholarships, and three of
them are National Merit Scholarship winners.
   Average ACT college exam scores for the 14 seniors was 28.6,
placing them at the 95-plus percentile of all students taking the
exam across the nation.
   Tammy Watson, class secretary and one of the valedictorians,
credits the harmony of the class for its scholastic achievement.
   ``I think the strength of our class is achieving what we want
through a tremendous unity,'' Watson said. ``We work together and
help each other to reach higher goals.''
   But valedictorian Elizabeth Hendershod said she believes
competition was critical.
   ``The fact that there were 13 other candidates helped to
motivate us. We would say to ourselves, `I'm not gonna allow that
other person to get it and leave me out. If that person can get it,
I can too,' '' she said.

   An Italian journalist who was jailed in Afghanistan
for 6{ months on espionage charges returned home Thursday and said
he was whipped after being caught entering Afghanistan with
insurgents.
   Fausto Biloslavo, 26, told reporters he spent three or four
months in jail near the Afghan capital of Kabul before receiving
the first of two letters from his family.
   Biloslavo, who looked weary but healthy, said he would describe
his time in captivity at a news conference on Friday.
   Asked to confirm news reports that he was whipped after his
arrest in November, the journalist said: ``Yes, it happened when I
was first taken prisoner about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from
Kabul.''
   ``They put a gun to my head, made me put my hands on my head and
an officer whipped me,'' Biloslavo said, then added: ``I will
continue to work in this profession, and I will ask for a visa to
return to Kabul.''
   The journalist smiled broadly when he stepped off a special
private plane at Rome's Ciampino airport after a flight from Kabul.
   Biloslavo, who worked for the tiny Trieste-based Albatross news
agency, was greeted by his mother Grazia who hugged and kissed him.
   A crowd of well-wishers, including former Socialist Premier
Bettino Craxi, welcomed the journalist when he got off the Falcon
50 aircraft.
   Also present was Bruno Bottai, secretary general of the Italian
Foreign Ministry, who had delivered a plea for clemency to Afghan
President Najib from Italian President Francesco Cossiga. The
request was granted on Wednesday.
   ``I want to thank President Cossiga and Mr. Bottai, who
literally came to pull me out of the prison,'' said Biloslavo, who
was wearing a blue T-shirt, gray jeans and sneakers.
   Biloslavo was arrested Nov. 14 while traveling with Moslem
guerrillas battling the Soviet-backed Afghan government. He was
convicted in March of espionage and sentenced to seven years in
prison.
   He shared a jail cell with French free-lance photographer Alain
Guillo, who was freed last week after an appeal from French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Bilislavo left Kabul early Thursday in the company of an Italian
delegation headed by Bottai. Bilislavo and Guillo were held at
Kabul's Pul-I-Charki prison after being found guilty of spying.
Both men denied the charges.

   The most powerful U.S. warship in the
Persian Gulf stood by on Thursday when Iran's navy stopped, boarded
and escorted away a Cypriot freighter apparently suspected of
carrying war-related cargo for Iraq.
   U.S. Navy officials said the guided missile cruiser Vincennes
was two miles away and did not get an appeal for aid that could
have caused the first direct confrontation with Iran since April
18. Six Iranian vessels were knocked out that day, including two
sister ships of the frigate involved in Thursday's incident.
   It also was the closest brush since the United States adopted a
new policy allowing Navy ships to intervene in attacks on neutral
commercial ships flying flags of other nations. The rule requires a
victim to be a non-belligerent in international waters that
requests assistance.
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a Navy spokesman, said the Iranian ship
was tentatively identified as the 1,540-ton frigate Alborz and
acted within maritime law that allows for ``visit and search'' in
international waters.
   It halted the Cypriot motor vessel Vevey in the southern gulf at
about 9:30 a.m. Van Dyke said the Cypriot ship ``did not request
assistance and did not appear to be in any distress.''
   He said the 9,400-ton Vincennes remained two miles away and had
no radio exchanges with either vessel.
   ``The Vincennes had the others in view as the Iranian frigate
stopped the Cypriot ship, launched a small boat that put a search
party on board and then escorted her off in a northeasterly
direction,'' Van Dyke said.
   There was ``no communication between the merchant and the U.S.
warship'' and no indication the Vevey tried to make contact during
the incident 25 miles northeast of Dubai, he said.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London said eight Iranian
naval personnel boarded the 10,000-ton freighter and it was taken
to the Iranian port and naval base at Bandar Abbas in the Strait of
Hormuz.
   Its listed cargo was Italian marble chips and powder, bound for
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the report said.
   Iran considers Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to be allies of Iraq,
with which Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime has been at war
since September 1980. Most commercial ships it has attacked were
traveling to or from those countries.
   Iranian gunboats regularly stop and search merchant vessels to
search for war-related cargo that could be bound for Iraq.
   The Vincennes, based in San Diego, arrived in the gulf last
weekend on the first assignment to the gulf of an Aegis-type
cruiser, equipped with advanced long range radar surveillance and
missile systems.
   Three other U.S. warships left the gulf Thursday home ports on
the East Coast. The missile cruiser Wainwright and missile frigates
Jack Williams and Simpson all played prominent roles in ``Operation
Praying Mantis'' April 18.
   Staying behind in a Dubai drydock is the missile frigate Samuel
B. Roberts, which struck a mine April 14. That incident led to the
retaliation four days later.
   The Iranian frigate involved in Thursday's incident was one of
two believed operational after the April 18 encounters. The frigate
Sahand was sunk by American bombs and missiles and the fourth,
Sabalan, was severely damaged.

   A Continental Airlines DC-10 aborted its
takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport Thursday because the
pilot thought a just-landed jet had not cleared the runway,
officials said.
   The DC-10's tires automatically deflated but no one was hurt
when Continental Flight 43 to Honolulu, carrying 148 passengers and
about 15 crewmembers, came to a stop, said airline spokesman Ned
Walker in Houston.
   Walker said the pilot felt a Delta Air Lines jet hadn't
adequately cleared the runway, but Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman Elly Brekke said the Delta plane was off the runway and
had come to a stop on a taxiway.
   Ms. Brekke said the Continental pilot ``took the extra margin of
safety'' in the 9:55 a.m. incident. Passengers deplaned on a
taxiway but did not use emergency exits or equipment.
   Neither Walker nor Ms. Brekke knew how far into the takeoff the
airliner had gotten before the abort, but the FAA spokeswoman said
the jet had reached at least 100 knots, or 115 mph. They did not
know the actual distance between the planes.
   ``Captain did a good job in reacting quickly when he saw the
other aircraft,'' said Walker, who would not release the names of
the crew.
   Ms. Brekke initially reported that four of the DC-10's tires
blew after the abort, but later she and Walker explained that the
tires have a safety plug that melts when heated to a certain
temperature, letting the tires deflate rather than explode.

   The following is a list of the Air Force bases
in the United States at which one or more readings for radon gas
were found to exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's
recommended standard of 4 picocuries per liter or air.
   Any reading above 20 picocuries per liter is considered
sufficient to trigger detailed 30-day and one-year testing of all
habitable structures at a base and immediate repair work.
   Any reading of 4 to 20 picocuries per liter triggers a one-year
detailed sampling of all habitable structures, followed by repair
work as required.
   The Air Force said Thursday that sampling at five bases had
produced readings above 20 picocuries per liter, while sampling at
49 bases had produced readings of 4 to 20 picocuries.
   Of the bases with readings above 20 picocuries, three of the
bases are in the United States or a U.S. territory and two are in
foreign countries. Of those with readings of 4 to 20 picocuries, 33
bases are in the United States and 16 in foreign countries. The Air
Force said it would not identify any of the bases overseas until
the host country's government is notified, the Air Force said.

   It wouldn't have the lovable personality of
R2D2, but an artificial intelligence system being developed for the
Air Force would perform many of its tasks, including alerting a
pilot to key points in an air battle.
   The ``pilot's associate'' program, a version of which was
demonstrated Thursday at Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., was
initiated by the Air Force because of the proliferation of
high-speed, high-tech weapons and aircraft systems, said Maj. Ron
Van Der Weert, director of the program.
   Today's pilot is inundated with information about his plane,
other planes, radar installations hoping to hit him with
surface-to-air missiles and other threats.
   ``In the heat of battle, there's a tendency to get overloaded
with everything that's taking place,'' said Van Der Weert, a
graduate of the Flight Weapons School, the Air Force version of the
Navy's ``Top Gun'' school.
   Lockheed and McDonnell Aircraft Co., working independently under
Air Force contracts, hope to take advantage of advances in
artificial intelligence to produce a computer that would focus the
pilot's attention on the most critical decisions while handling
lower priority matters itself, like the vacuum cleaner-shaped
sidekick of ``Star Wars'' hero Luke Skywalker.
   For example, in a Central European battle scenario demonstrated
Thursday, the ``pilot's associate'' copes with an overheating radar
system while the pilot is firing missiles at an enemy bomber. All
the while, the computer is giving the pilot a display of the
missile ranges of the most threatening enemy fighters.
   Major new threats prompt the computer to talk aloud _ Lockheed's
model, in fact, sounds like a woman with a Southern accent.
   The ability to pick out the biggest threats is made possible by
artificial intelligence. The computer considers the pilot's planned
flight path and the capabilities and behavior of enemy aircraft and
draws conclusions. It may suggest avoiding some planes or attacking
them, depending on the orders for each mission.
   And instead of merely telling the pilot that fuel has been lost,
the computer would indicate whether the plane has enough to carry
out the original mission and suggest a new flight path if
necessary. That flight path would take into account the delicate
task of weaving among enemy ground radars to prevent them from
gaining a good enough fix to launch a missile.
   Van Der Weert said that would replace educated guesswork by the
pilot.
   But Van Der Weert emphasized the ``pilot's associate'' would
replace neither the pilot nor, on two-seat planes, the navigator.
   The pilot could overrule any action proposed by the computer, in
some cases simply by ignoring it. Martin Broadwell, Lockheed's
program manager, noted that the computer would adjust to the
pilot's rejection, going to work on new proposals consistent with
the pilot's decisions.
   As smart as the new system is, it must overcome the
``notoriously slow'' characteristics of artificial intelligence
computers, said Lockheed program manager Jack Barnette.
   The 30-minute simulated flight replayed on video monitors for
reporters Thursday actually took nearly three hours for the system
to process, but Broadwell said that meets the goal for this point
in the system's development.

Surgery</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson met with members of Los Angeles street gangs in an
extraordinary campaign spectacle on Thursday, while fellow Democrat
Michael Dukakis cut short a California campaign trip to be at his
ailing wife's side.
   Dukakis canceled a debate with Jackson and flew home to be with
his wife, Kitty, for surgery that one of her doctors described as
``not emergency but urgent.'' Dr. James R. Lehrich said surgeons
would remove two herniated discs that are pressing dangerously on
her spinal cord and could, if left untreated, cause paralysis.
   Vice President George Bush pronounced himself a ``refurbished
candidate'' after four days of skull sessions with aides and
outside advisers in Kennebunkport, Maine, and said he won't change
tactics just because he trails Dukakis in the polls.
   ``I've never felt more relaxed, never felt more convinced that
we're on the right track,'' Bush said at his vacation home after a
Coast Guard check of his powerboat. He said he would make his
differences plain with his likely Democratic opponent after the
Democratic convention in July.
   With his armed Secret Service guards in attendance, Jackson met
privately with members of the Bloods and an affiliated group, the
Bounty Hunters. Later, Jackson told reporters that the gang members
talked of how they could buy any type of weapon.
   ``They can buy the very latest guns, no ID,'' Jackson said.
``The combination of drugs, guns and money creates a kind of unholy
alliance.''
   Jackson said he hoped the meeting would be the first of many
aimed at ending gang violence, which killed 205 people in Los
Angeles last year. ``It's not a matter of signing papers,'' he said.
   Jackson has finished second in more than 30 primary and caucus
contests this year, and one of the prime topics of speculation in
Democratic circles is whether he is owed special consideration when
it comes time for Dukakis to select a running mate.
   Dukakis himself said no to that question on Wednesday, and party
chairman Paul Kirk seconded the idea in a speech in Milwaukee on
Thursday. Kirk said Jackson is entitled to ``fair consideration''
but no more.
   At the same time, he praised Jackson for running a
`'constructive campaign. ... I think it will help in November.''
   Dukakis canceled his California schedule and left for Boston to
be with his wife, saying, ``This is obviously the most important
thing.''
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, where her surgery is to be
performed, Dr. Lehrich said it was not certain what caused Mrs.
Dukakis' problems. ``We have seen no trauma, unless you consider
that she has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, has been a student and teacher of modern dance
for three decades.
   Lehrich said Mrs. Dukakis has suffered numbness and altered
sensations in her hands and feet.
   Dukakis, who said he might resume campaigning over the weekend
if his wife's operation went smoothly, picked up 21 additional
delegates during the day, bringing his total to 1,768 in the
Associated Press count. He is expected to achieve a nominating
majority of 2,081 by the time the votes are counted Tuesday night
in the final Democratic primaries of the year in California, New
Jersey, Montana and New Mexico. Jackson has fewer than 1,000.
   The Massachusetts governor's campaign announced the beginning of
a television advertising campaign in California, with a commercial
seemingly designed more for the general election campaign than the
primary battle with Jackson. It claims striking achievement in
Dukakis' drive to reduce crime in Massachusetts, and said the
governor ``did it with hard work, integrity, leadership. We could
use some of that...in the White House.''
   Bush tried to explain his comments in a New York Times interview
in which he assailed two new right activists who have been critical
of him.
   ``That's a longstanding feud with two individuals who don't have
any following,'' Bush said. ``The fact that I have been constantly
attacked by two individuals doesn't have anything to do with votes.
If it did, I wouldn't be the likely nominee of the Republican
Party.''
   But some conservatives questioned the vice president's tactics.
   ``He's not running against Dick Viguerie and he's not running
against Howie Phillips. He's running against probably Mike Dukakis
and you really ought to keep your eye on the ball,'' said Lyn
Nofziger, a former political aide to President Reagan.
   In the New York Times interview, Bush criticized Viguerie, a new
right fund-raiser, and Phillips, chairman of the Conservative
Caucus, as polarizing influences on the party.
   When asked if he needed to court the two new-right activists,
Bush said, ``There are some people that are almost self-appointed
spokesmen that will make a claim for that. I don't feel that at
all.''

<HEAD>Nicaragua Denies Soldiers Crossed Honduran Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government denied Honduran
allegations of a cross-border raid by Sandinista soldiers and made
a counter-claim that rebels based in Honduras attacked Nicaraguan
troops.
   It also accused an official of Nicaragua's leading business
organization of working for the CIA and running a spy network that
stole government documentsccording to press reports Thursday.
   The Interior Ministry said Mario Jose Alegria Castillo and two
government officials had been detained in the case.
   On Wednesday, the Honduran armed forces said Nicaraguan soldiers
crossed into Honduras the previous day and attacked the San Agustin
post six miles inside the burder, but were driven off. Honduras
said an undetermined number of Sandinista soldiers were killed.
   Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto said the fighting occurred in
Nicaragua, with rebels, and a Nicaraguan soldier was captured and
taken to San Agustin.
   Carlos Lopez, the Honduran foreign minister, protested the
border incident and d'Escoto replied:
   ``The crude manipulation of the facts contained in your note
reveals the real aim of this campaign (which is) to try to create
an incident between Honduras and Nicaragua'' and to damage peace
talks between the Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported
rebels, known as Contras.
   ``Acts that occurred in Nicaragua are being presented as if they
occurred on Honduran soil and ... the armed forces of Honduras
takes upon itself crimes that in reality have been committed by the
Contras,'' he said.
   During the 6-year-old Nicaraguan civil war, the Contras have had
bases in southern Honduras from which they have launched attacks
across the border. The Contras and Sandinistas have agreed to a
temporary truce during which they are trying to negotiate a
permanent cease-fire.
   About the spy case, the Interior Ministry sid in a statement
carried by Managua newspapers that Alegria Castillo has worked for
the CIA since 1985 and ``organized a network of informing agents in
some institutions of the Nicaraguan state.''
   Alegria Castillo, who was detained Tuesday, is director of the
Institute of Economic and Social Research, which is tied to the
Superior Council of Private Enterprise.
   The Interior Ministry statement, released Wednesday night, said
authorities also detained two government officials identified as
Pedro Su Olivas of the Central Bank and Adrian Espinales of the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
   On Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said Alegria Castillo and
his secretary, Dora Aldana Centeno, were ``tied to the crime of
stealing documents with a secret classification by the Nicaraguan
state.'' Mrs. Aldana Centeno was detained briefly Tuesday and
released.
   The research institute periodically puts out bulletins with
economic information about Nicaragua based on official and private
publications.
   Enrique Bolanos, president of the Superior Council of Private
Enterprise, said Wednesday the detentions were illegal and stemmed
from a 1981 decree reserving publication of economic information
for the government's Nicaraguan Institute of Statistics and Census.

<HEAD>Janitors' Strike Threatens to Turn into Citywide Labor Showdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE CARPENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snarled deliveries and piled-up trash in
offices testify to the newest problem facing Mayor Art Agnos,
already plagued by a $180 million city deficit.
   Labor officials representing 1,767 striking janitors say the
9-day-old standoff, which has been marked by vandalism and some
arrests, may be headed for a city-wide labor-management showdown if
it isn't defused soon.
   Effects of the strike and a labor boycott are increasingly
evident in the downtown area to tourists and workers who frequent
the 204 affected buildings, including most major office complexes.
   Paper and garbage are scattered all over downtown, trash bins
are overflowing and employees in business suits can be seen lugging
heavy packages that Teamster drivers refuse to deliver inside.
   Pickets are posted around the clock and a few windows have been
broken and eggs smeared on the fronts of buildings where janitors
continue to defy the strike.
   Labor leaders say they will step up the protests and may further
tighten supply lines if contract negotiations remain deadlocked.
Trash haulers, building engineers, construction workers, elevator
repair personnel, delivery people and longshoremen are all honoring
the strike, although the San Francisco Port remains open.
   ``We see this as an important dispute because it is so
visible,'' Chuck Mack, president of Teamsters Joint Council 7, said
Thursday. The council represents 30 union locals and 65,000 members
from Santa Rosa south to Salinas, encompassing the entire San
Francisco Bay area.
   ``The outcome of this dispute is going to set the tone for other
negotiations in the city and maybe even the Bay area over the next
few years,'' said Mack.
   The 3,500-member Local 87 of the Service Employees International
Union, working without a contract since February, launched the
strike May 24.
   The janitors rejected a proposal by the San Francisco Building
Maintenance Contractors Association for a three-year freeze of
their $11.25 hourly pay, and changes in job assignments the
janitors say will cost them money.
   The janitors want a 50-cent hourly raise in each year of a
proposed three-year contract, as well as the continued right to a
leave of absence.
   The 11 maintenance firms in the association also are seeking a
two-tier pay system in which new hires would get less than current
employees.
   Disgruntled janitors contend they can't keep up with the area's
high living expenses under the current proposal and claim
management's hard bargaining stance may be masking an attempt at
union-busting.
   The contractors, in turn, maintain that only New York janitors
make more than San Francisco's. They say they offer job security
and maintained benefits.
   Marc Intermaggio, representing the building owners, said they
remain ``absolutely firm'' in their commitment to ``stem the rise
in these outrageous wages.''
   Contract talks continued Thursday for a third straight day since
resuming a week after the walkout began, but Local 87
secretary-treasurer Eric Hall said there had been ``zero progress''
since February.
   Guillermo Loyola, a union member for 33 years and a unit
foreman, said the disturbance that resulted in five arrests on
Tuesday is increasingly likely to recur as the stalemate continues.
   While some 300 janitors marched through the Financial District,
two protesters were arrested after they allegedly struck a police
officer with picket signs and three were arrested for vandalism and
disturbing the peace.
   Local 87 President Wray Jacobs angered police earlier by saying
that although he does not condone violence, vandalism is ``an
emotional outlet'' and he ``might even break one or two (windows)
myself at times.''
   The San Francisco Labor Council, which is coordinating the
boycott, criticized Agnos this week for not taking stronger steps
to end the dispute. After meeting with 14 local labor leaders, the
council asked Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to mediate the strike.
Brown did not immediately respond.
   ``It would seem to me that to maintain harmony in the city, he
(Agnos) could have called in people sooner,'' said Walter Johnson,
secretary-treasurer of the council. ``I think this needs direct
action.''
   Deputy Mayor Hadley Roff said the mayor has been talking to
people behind the scenes and urging the two sides to settle their
differences at the bargaining table.
   Roff said Agnos had no immediate plans to participate directly
in the talks, although he acknowledged having received a few
complaints about the downtown disruptions.

<HEAD>Education Department's Research Budget Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department's budget for research
and development fell by 33 percent after inflation between 1980 and
1987, the General Accounting Office said Thursday.
   At the same time, the federal government's overall spending on
research and development rose 24 percent, the agency said in a
report to a House education subcommittee.
   But most of the growth was in the Pentagon budget, where R&D
expenditures shot up 81 percent during the 1980s, the GAO said.
   The Education Department spent $132 million on research and
development in 1980 and $124 million in 1987. The latter figure,
taking inflation into account, was the equivalent of $88 million in
1980 dollars, the GAO said.
   Defense expenditures on R&D rose from $13.9 billion to $36.1
billion. The 1987 figure was the equivalent of $25.2 billion in
1980 dollars.
   The government's overall R&D spending rose from $31.7 billion in
1980 to $56.1 billion in 1987, or in terms of 1980 dollars, to
$39.4 billion, the GAO said.
   Such departments and agencies as Health and Human Services, the
National Science Foundation, the Veterans Administration and the
Agency for International Development registered real increases, but
R&D spending fell at the departments of Agriculture (down 2
percent), Commerce (down 16 percent), Energy (down 29 percent),
Interior (down 35 percent), and Transportation (down 39 percent) as
well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (down 47
percent).
   The report said that Education's Center for Education Statistics
has experienced a cut of 34 percent in constant dollars since 1980
and more than 50 percent since 1978.
   The report was prepared at the request of Rep. Major Owens,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Education and Labor subcommittee on
select education.

   Teamsters attorney John Climaco said Thursday
any scaled-down plan for government supervision of the union would
be just as unacceptable as a straight takeover contemplated earlier.
   Federal law enforcement sources said Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of New York, was considering
modifying plans to seek a takeover following a failed attempt by
federal prosecutors to convict Teamsters officials of corruption.
   Giuliani initially wanted to force Teamsters leaders out of
office and put the union under court trusteeship.
   Instead, he likely will file suit seeking a court-appointed
monitor to oversee some organization activities, according to the
sources, who spoke only on condition they not be named. Such a
lawsuit still could seek removal of some members of the union's
executive board, the sources said.
   The sources were confirming a story in the Los Angeles Times.
   Giuliani plans to forward recommendations soon to acting
Associate Attorney General Francis A. Keating on how to proceed
against the Teamsters.
   ``Whether you call it a monitor or a trusteeship, it's still an
undemocratic attempt by the government to become involved in the
supervision of a free trade union,'' Climaco said. ``It doesn't
appear to me to be any change; it's still business as usual.
   ``The Reagan administration started with the air traffic
controllers and it appears they want to end with the Teamsters,''
Climaco added. President Reagan fired striking air traffic
controllers in 1981.
   On May 4 a U.S. District Court jury in New York aquitted Anthony
``Fat Tony'' Salerno and eight associates of charges they rigged
the elections of Roy L. Williams in 1981, and Jackie Presser in
1983, as Teamsters presidents.
   Although acquitted of the election-rigging charges, Salerno and
six others were found guilty by the same jury of rigging
multimillion-dollar bids in the New York construction industry.
   Presser, who recently underwent surgery for brain cancer, is
awaiting trial on criminal charges in Cleveland that he allegedly
misappropriated $700,000 by keeping non-working ``ghost employees''
on the union payroll.

   A court-martial has been ordered for
the first of five women charged in a crackdown on alleged
homosexuality at the Marine Corps' Parris Island Recruit Depot,
officials said Thursday.
   A date for the court-martial of Cpl. Barbara J. Baum will be set
next week. The proceeding was ordered by the base commander, Major
Gen. Joseph P. Hoar.
   An Article 32 hearing, similar to a civilian preliminary
hearing, was held in April after Ms. Baum was charged March 28
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, said depot spokesman
Maj. Robert McLean.
   Ms. Baum, 23, of Mishawaka, Ind., is charged with conspiracy to
obstruct justice, sodomy, indecent acts, obstruction of justice and
communicating a threat, McLean said.
   ``After a thorough investigation and review by the Article 32
investigating officer, and a recommendation by Baum's commanding
officer, charges were referred to court-martial on Wednesday,''
McLean said.
   Ms. Baum, if convicted on all charges, would face a maximum of
38 years confinement, a dishonorable discharge, reduction to
private and a forfeiture of all pay and allowances, McLean said.
   Ms. Baum, who is single, entered the service in May 1985 and
arrived at Parris Island in December 1985, McLean said. She had
been a military policewoman but is assigned to administrative duty,
the spokesman said.
   ``The other four women also had Article 32 hearings, and we are
presently awaiting results of that. ... This is the first of those
to come to fruition,'' McLean said.
   He also said the Naval Investigative Service review is
continuing.

   Clare Brower remembers finding a veteran
with frostbitten feet living in a Yakima garbage can last winter.
He was treated at a hospital and is now working.
   Then there was the drunken 54-year-old Korean War veteran in
Walla Walla who hadn't held a steady job since 1953. When he
sobered up, doctors found he was a schizophrenic.
   Or the former Navy typist with psychiatric problems who'd been
living on the streets since her discharge in 1982.
   The three are among thousands of homeless, mentally ill veterans
located and helped under a two-year, $10 million pilot program
launched in 43 communities around the nation by the Veterans
Administration last year.
   About 240 of those people have been located by the Yakima
office, the only one in Washington, said Brower, a Vietnam veteran
who runs the office.
   ``The reason they're homeless is the same reason as anyone else,
for alcohol and substance abuse,'' he said recently. Causes could
be anything from pre-existing mental illness to delayed stress
syndrome brought on by war experiences, he said.
   ``The single male in general has fallen though the cracks in all
health projects in the past,'' Brower said. ``You send a single
male to (social agencies), and unless they're disabled they tell
him to go to unemployment and find work.
   ``What he needs is food in the belly and a place to stay,'' he
said.
   So Brower searches the alleys, the rescue missions, the drunk
tanks, under bridges, old rail cars and other collecting grounds
for the homeless and mentally ill.
   Those who are veterans are steered into a variety of VA and
community programs. Non-veterans are referred only to community
programs, Brower said.
   ``A lot of veterans are eligible for benefits that other
homeless may not be,'' said Dan Sullivan, a spokesman for the Walla
Walla VA hospital. Among the programs are medical care, housing and
welfare assistance, education programs and job training.
   In the first seven months of the pilot program, there were
contacts with about 10,000 veterans nationwide, said Terry Clark,
of the VA in Washington, D.C. Of the 7,800 veterans who received
formal assessments of their cases, 86 percent showed symptoms of
mental illness, he said.
   ``A lot of studies indicated a significant portion of the
homeless population are veterans and a significant number of them
may be emotionally disturbed,'' Clark said.
   ``I don't think we've gotten all of them,'' he said.
   The goal is to get them back on their feet.
   ``If a veteran is willing to work, I can get him a job now,''
Brower said. ``No ifs, ands or buts.''
   The homeless vet with the frostbitten feet, who had been
stationed in Korea during the 1960s, was found to have a drug
problem, was hospitalized and is now working, Brower said.
   The 31-year old former Navy typist is hospitalized wih multiple
psychiatric problems, which may have been aggravated by her service
stint, Brower said.
   The vet suffering from schizophrenia qualified for some back
pay, and has moved to Tacoma for treatment at a veterans hospital.
   Brower, 44, who served in Vietnam in 1968-69, said 90 percent of
the homeless vets suffer alcohol or drug problems, which can be a
self-medication for delayed stress syndrome.
   ``To get rid of nightmares and flashbacks, the greatest medicine
is alcohol, and it's readily available,'' Brower said.

<HEAD>Doctor Terms Kitty Dukakis' Spinal Surgery `Urgent'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis will undergo surgery Friday morning
to remove two herniated discs that are pressing on her spinal cord,
an operation described by one of her doctors Thursday as ``not
emergency but urgent.''
   Dr. James R. Lehrich said that if left untreated, the condition
could leave the wife of the Massachusetts governor paralyzed.
However, he said it appeared to have been spotted early, and there
was no sign of permanent damage.
   ``In view of the fact that this condition has quite definitely
worsened in the past 24 to 48 hours, it was felt that waiting even
until next week was taking a chance,'' he said at a news conference.
   Lehrich, a neurologist, is a member of a team that confirmed her
diagnosis at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she is scheduled
to have the operation.
   He said the damaged discs were first spotted by doctors at
Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, where Dukakis was
campaigning for the California primary.
   Lehrich said he considered the surgery, known as cervical
laminectomy, ``not emergency but urgent.''
   Mrs. Dukakis' problems were caused by two herniated discs in her
neck. These discs serve as soft cushions between the bony vertebrae
that protect her spinal cord.
   In her case, these discs have squeezed out of place so that they
press on the spinal cord.
   Lehrich said this could cause severe damage to the spinal cord
resulting in permanent paralysis. ``Fortunately, she has come to us
early before any damage is evident.''
   At Boston University Medical Center, Dr. Ronald Mortara said
most people with herniated discs are treated first with bed rest,
traction and pain killers, and surgery is used only as a last
resort.
   However, he added, ``If someone has any evidence of spinal cord
compression, that becomes much more serious and urgent.''
   Lehrich said that discs can be damaged by injury or it can
happen spontaneously.
   He said the doctors are unsure what caused Mrs. Dukakis'
problems. ``We have seen no trauma, unless you consider that she
has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot,'' he said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, has been a student and teacher of modern dance
for three decades.
   He said Mrs. Dukakis has suffered numbness and altered
sensations in her hands and feet as a result of herniated discs.
Although she noticed the problems several weeks ago, the symptoms
have worsened in recent days.
   Lehrich said the operation, which he described as major surgery,
would take several hours. The surgical team will include Dr.
Nicholas T. Zervas, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery and a
friend of the Dukakis family, as well as Drs. Lawrence Borges and
Frederick Mansfield.
   Lehrich said serious complications of the surgery are very rare,
although they can include paralysis if the spinal cord is damaged.
   During the operation, doctors will remove bone from her hip and
use it to replace the damaged discs. Her recovery in the hospital
was expected to take one or two weeks.
   Doctors said that her problem, while not rare, is far less
common than herniated discs in the lower back that do not press in
the spinal cord.
   Mrs. Dukakis entered Massachusetts General on Wednesday night
after flying to Boston from Arizona.
   Mrs. Dukakis disclosed last year that she had been addicted to
amphetamines for 26 years until she entered a Minnesota clinic in
1982. She said she began taking the pills to curb her appetite and
became addicted.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher congratulated
President Reagan Thursday on his ``tremendous success'' at the
Moscow summit, laying on pomp and panoply for what was probably his
last visit to Britain as president.
   Reagan, stopping over for two days en route home, spent a
relaxed day having tea with the queen, watching parades and basking
in tributes from his longtime friend and ideological soulmate, Mrs.
Thatcher.
   She told Reagan, ``I warmly congratulate you,'' especially on
his stance on human rights and his street encounters with Russians,
a senior British official said.
   ``She argued that the Russian people would find it difficult now
to see the United States as a threat in the future,'' the official
said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Other British officials reported that at a small dinner for 19
people at her No. 10 Downing St. residence, Mrs. Thatcher called
his work at the summit ``a tremendous success'' heralding ``a new
era in East-West relations.''
   Ronald Reagan ``will take his place in history as one of the
greatest U.S. presidents,'' she told her dinner guest.
   Reagan, on his third presidential visit to Britain, warmly
clasped elbows with Mrs. Thatcher as she greeted him in the
graceful columned quadrangle of the Foreign Office. He is to
deliver a speech Friday on East-West relations.
   During their 45-minute talk at No. 10 Downing Street, Reagan
told Mrs. Thatcher he believed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ``to
be vigorous and determined to carry out'' his reform program, a
British official said.
   Reagan also told Mrs. Thatcher he was not prepared to be rushed
into a strategic nuclear arms agreement, said the official, who
added: ``and we don't have any reservations about the position of
the United States on this.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Mrs. Thatcher
promptly accepted Reagan's invitation to visit Washington in
November, after the presidential election, to see him once more
before he steps down. Fitzwater said it was assumed she would also
meet the president-elect.
   The visit promised to be a fond goodbye from Mrs. Thatcher to
Reagan, an ideological ally who shares her belief in capitalism and
distrust of communism.
   By stopping to brief Mrs. Thatcher on his talks with Gorbachev,
Reagan was demonstrating his esteem for the woman whose nine years
in office have paralleled his own tenure and made her the Western
alliance's senior leader.
   Reagan rested at the U.S. ambassador's residence before going to
Buckingham Palace, where he passed a crowd estimated by police at
1,500. There were waves and cheers, and Reagan waved back from his
limousine.
   The queen, wearing a sapphire-blue silk dress, greeted the
Reagans in the marble-columned entrance hall of her 285-year-old
palace.
   ``Nice to see you again,'' she said. ``How are you Mr.
President?''
   To a reporter who asked whether he was glad to be here and not
in Moscow, Reagan grinned and replied: ``Let me put it very simply:
I'm very happy to be in London.''
   Many of the onlookers were Americans who had waited up to two
hours to see Reagan. ``I live about 30 miles from his ranch and I
don't bother to visit him,'' said Barbara Black, of Camarillo,
Calif. ``And here I am, half way around the world, standing in line
waiting to get a vague glimpse of him.''
   Justine Griffin, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was
enthusiastic about the American president.
   ``I think he's a good bloke,'' she said.
   Reagan drove from Buckingham Palace to a ceremony outside the
Foreign Office while Mrs. Reagan returned to the ambassador's
residence to receive a visit from Prince Charles.
   The president stood on a dais in the quadrangle flanked by the
prime minister, who was in a black suit and wide-brimmed black and
white hat. Welsh Guards in tall black bearskin caps and scarlet
tunics played the American anthem and two Irving Berlin hits.
   After inspecting the guard of honor, Reagan went next door to
Mrs. Thatcher's home at No. 10 Downing St. and briefed her on his
talks with Gorbachev.
   In a special show of esteem for the 77-year-old president, Mrs.
Thatcher allowed cameras to film them in the Cabinet room, which is
usually closed to photographers.
   Mrs. Reagan was later greeted at Downing Street by Mrs.
Thatcher's husband Denis who bent and kissed her hand before
escorting her inside to join their spouses for drinks and a dinner
of lobster mousse, chicken with pate de fois gras and raspberries.
   There was also a parade outside the 300-year-old Downing Street
residence, the ceremony of Beating Retreat, an annual event in
ceremonies leading up to the queen's birthday. The parade, dating
back to 1727, includes 406 musicians and 61 horsemen in colorful
garments, and is televised live in Britain.
   Air Force One brought Reagan from Moscow to London's Heathrow
Airport, where he stepped onto a red carpet and was greeted by
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe. He then flew by helicopter in
drizzling rain to U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II's home in
Regent's Park.
   Police mounted massive security, checking sewers for bombs,
sealing the access holes on lampposts and placing barricades along
Reagan's travel routes. Rooftop marksmen and policemen with
submachine guns patrolled the VIP area at Heathrow.
   On Friday, while Secretary of State George P. Shultz meets with
Howe, Reagan will confer with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
   He then drives to The City, the financial and historic heart of
the capital, to speak from one of the most hallowed platforms
outside Parliament _ London's Guildhall, where mayors of the city
have presided since the 12th century. Mrs. Thatcher will make a
public farewell tribute to Reagan there.
   Celebrities including playwright Harold Pinter and actors Jeremy
Irons and Julie Christie said they would hold a silent vigil
outside the Guildhall during Reagan's speech, protesting U.S.
policy in Central America.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, Europe's first woman prime minister, has been
elected three consecutive times and may seek a fourth term.
   She describes Reagan, who is leaving office after this year, as
``cantering up to a very strong finish ... There's no sign of
slowing down at all.'' Of herself, she says she hopes ``to go on
and on.''

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney general Urges Maximum Sentence For TWA Hijack
Defendant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III said Thursday he hopes a man accused in the 1985 TWA hijacking
gets life in prison.
   Meese was in Munich to attend a meeting of European Economic
Community interior and justice ministers.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Meese was asked about
Mohammed Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem who goes on trial July 5
in Frankfurt on charges of air piracy and murder in the TWA
hijacking.
   ``We hope that he (Hamadi) will be successfully prosecuted and
appropriately sentenced,'' Meese said. ``We believe that because of
the severity of the crime that Hamadi should receive the maximum
life sentence.''
   A U.S. Navy diver was killed during the hijacking and 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   The Frankfurt juvenile court hearing Hamadi's case could give
him a life sentence. It also could rule that Hamadi was under age
21 at the time the hijacking began and try him as a juvenile. In
that case, he could receive a maximum of 10 years in prison.
   When he was apprehended, Hamadi gave his birthdate as June 13,
1964, but later maintained he was two years younger.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987 after
customs agents found liquid explosives in his luggage and
discovered his identification papers were forged.
   Earlier Thursday, Meese met with European ministers representing
the 12-nation TREVI group, which meets to coordinate anti-terrorism
efforts. TREVI is an acronym for Terrorism, Radicalism, Extremism,
Violence International.
   The United States is not an official member of the group, but
for years Meese has met with ministers within the framework of
TREVI talks.
   Meese said he would present a number of U.S. proposals to
strengthen security cooperation during the meeting Friday and
Saturday.
   He declined to detail specific U.S. suggestions, but said there
were several areas where cooperation could be expanded. Meese said
U.S. officials hope for increased exhanges of intelligence on
terrorist groups and drug smuggling operations.
   ``Cooperation between the United States and Europe has already
been a material factor in decreasing terrorism,'' Meese said. ``But
it remains a serious problem.''
   He said the United States has also urged creation of a unified
program of border security checks before the EEC loosens travel
restrictions in 1992.

<HEAD>Anti-Secrecy Groups Filing Suit Against FBI Library Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two groups announced Thursday they are filing
suit to force the FBI to disclose information about a program using
librarians to monitor suspicious library users.
   A spokesman for one of the groups, the liberal People for the
American Way, said the suit follows unsuccessful attempts to get
information about the FBI's Library Awareness Program through the
Freedom of Information Act.
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way, said
the suit was being filed by his group and the National Security
Archive in U.S. District Court in Washington.
   ``We believe that information is the currency of democracy,''
said Scott Armstrong, a former Washington Post reporter who now
heads the National Security Archive. ``Therefore, anything that
constrains the flow of this valuable information damages the
liquidity of the marketplace of ideas and thus damages democracy
itself.''
   The FBI contends the program is an essential counterintelligence
effort. In a report released last month, the FBI said Soviet
intelligence agents seeking sensitive technological information are
among the most enthusiastic users of U.S. libraries.
   But Kropp maintained that the FBI uses techniques of
intimidation to enlist library officials. Kropp cited several
instances of FBI agents instructing librarians to look for
suspicious, anomalous or ``funny behavior'' by people using
libraries.
   The American Library Association, which represents 50,000
library workers, has also been critical of FBI measures, accusing
the agency of undertaking a ``generalized effort to solicit
librarians to do surveillance work.''
   People for the American Way claims 250,000 contributors
nationwide. It opposes censorship of school materials, religion in
politics and what it considers excessive government secrecy. The
National Security Archive is a security research group founded by
Armstrong to publish formerly classified government materials.
   Kropp said the FBI efforts have been reported in public
libraries as well as university and technical libraries in New
Jersey, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, California, Florida and Maryland.
   The FBI report said Soviet agents have been using libraries for
26 years to identify the nation's ``emerging technology'' before it
can be classified or restricted.
   FBI Director William Sessions told a Senate committee last month
that the Library Awareness Program was an important
counterintelligence program and that librarians are free to refuse
FBI requests for information about patrons.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev parted company Thursday expressing confidence they had
advanced the cause of peace during five days of a ``Moscow
spring.'' En route home, Reagan stopped overnight in London for a
sentimental visit with a steady ally.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher honored Reagan with a
dinner for 19 at No. 10 Downing Street. She told him the summit was
a ``tremendous success'' heralding ``a new era in East-West
relations.''
   She told told her guests that Reagan ``will take his place in
history as one of the greatest U.S. presidents.''
   At a Kremlin farewell, Gorbachev said he and Reagan could have
accomplished more, although they did manage to ``divert the train
of U.S.-Soviet relations from a dangerous track to a safer one.''
   Reagan replied that he and Nancy ``for all our days'' will
remember the people of Russia _ ``the faces of hope, hope for a new
era in human history, an era of peace between our nations and our
peoples.''
   ``We think of you as friends,'' he told the Kremlin leader.
   And thus ended the first presidential trip to the Soviet Union
in 14 years.
   Asked later about Gorbachev's criticism of the pace of
negotiations, Reagan replied, ``I'd like to speed them up.'' He
offered no elaboration.
   The Geneva negotiators are scheduled to resume talks, but not
until July 12.
   Just hours after Reagan departed, Gorbachev told several hundred
peace activists that Reagan's human rights campaign would not
change Soviet policy. He said the Russians don't need ``advice on
how we run our affairs.''
   Meantime, the British turned on the pomp.
   When the president came to her 285-year-old palace for tea,
Queen Elizabeth II greeted him with a simple handshake and a ``Nice
to see you again. How are you, Mr. President?''
   A band played the tunes of 100-year-old American songwriter
Irving Berlin when Reagan met Mrs. Thatcher, who has been her
steadiest supporter in the West. He grasped her warmly by the elbow.
   There was also a parade outside No. 10 Downing Street, an annual
event in ceremonies leading up to the queen's birthday. The parade,
dating back to 1727, included 406 musicians and 61 horsemen.
   Reagan invited Mrs. Thatcher to visit Washington after the
November election, and she promptly accepted. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said it was assumed she would also meet
the president-elect.
   A senior British government official, briefing reporters on
condition he not be identified, said Mrs. Thatcher was
``gratified'' that Reagan had mingled among Muscovites. She told
Reagan ``the Russian people would find it difficult now to see the
United States as a threat,'' he said.
   Reagan planned to meet Friday with Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and deliver a speech on the state of East-West
relations before returning to Washington.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who made a side trip to
Brussels, gave the NATO allies an upbeat summit assessment and said
``it's certainly possible'' that the superpowers could agree on
deep nuclear cuts before Reagan leaves office in January.
   ``We share his opinion that it was a successful and substantial
summit,'' said Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West German foreign
minister, after meeting with Shultz. ``Through this summit the
American-Soviet relationship got a new stability, a new
perspective.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev had hoped to find the formula for a 30 to
50 percent slash in strategic weapons. That goal evaded them, but
they agreed on two ``confidence building'' treaties and established
a personal warmth.
   Reagan took pleasure in the outcome. He said ``this summit in
this Moscow spring'' had fulfilled its promise.
   A less-than-euphoric tone was struck by Edward L. Rowny,
Reagan's special adviser for arms control matters. Rowny returned
to Washington where, his staff said, he told Japanese Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno that progress on strategic disarment was made,
but cautioned: ``Let's remember that the Soviet negotiators always
seek to cripple us in areas where they fear we might utilize our
comparative technological advantages.''
   By stopping here to brief Mrs. Thatcher, Reagan was
demonstrating his esteem for the woman whose nine years in office
have made her the Western alliance's senior leader.
   The trip to London was likely to be Reagan's last as president,
although the pair will meet again in Toronto later this month for
the seven-nation economic summit.
   The Reagans looked drawn and tired as they left Moscow in a
downpour. ``He is tired, I guess he looks tired. We're all tired,''
acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker.
   Baker, talking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to
London, said Reagan and Gorbachev were ``going at it pretty heavy
until the end'' and disagreed over whether a communique should
embrace the concept of ``peaceful coexistence'' _ a term coined by
the Soviets that became part of their Cold War jargon.
   Gorbachev, speaking a farewell to Reagan, seemed to agree that
the talks were not always smooth.
   ``Our dialogue has not been easy,'' the Soviet leader said,
``but we mustered enough realism and political will to overcome
obstacles and divert the train of U.S. Soviet relations from a
dangerous track to a safer one.
   ``It is, however, so far, been moving much more slowly than is
required by the real situation, both in our two countries and in
the whole world,'' he said.
   He added: ``Over the past three years, our two nations have come
to know each other better. They have now taken a really good look
in each other's eyes and have a keener sense of the need to learn
to live together on this beautiful planet Earth.''
   Reagan noted that their parting was occuring in a Kremlin hall
named for the Order of St. George and said, ``I would like to think
that our efforts during these past few days have slayed a few
dragons and advanced the struggle against the evils that threaten
mankind ... And I would like to hope that like St. George, with
God's help, peace and freedom can prevail.''

<HEAD>House Approves NASA Authorization Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House gave overwhelming approval Thursday
to an $11.5 billion NASA authorization bill that includes nearly $1
billion for the start on a space station but nothing for a
free-flying, unmanned, factory in space.
   The Senate is not likely to go along with authorizing anything
near that amount. Some senators have expressed an inclination to
vote for no more than $10.2 billion for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1, an amount that could kill the space station project.
   For the first time, the House authorization bill puts a cap of
$24.2 billion on the total cost of the space station, which is
planned to be in orbit around Earth and occupied by astronauts at
the end of 1996. A year before that it would be available for
periodic visits by astronauts.
   Also, for the first time, the bill authorizes spending for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration for three years _
$11.5 billion in 1989, $14.4 billion in 1990 and $15.7 billion in
1991. The amount for 1989 is what President Reagan asked for and
represents an increase of 29 percent over the $8.9 billion
authorized for this year.
   The vote was 360 to 26.
   The bill authorizes no funds for the mini-space station that
would be carried into orbit by the space shuttle, then leased by
NASA from its developers for $700 million over five years. It
allows the space agency to request proposals for such a facility
but specifically bans the awarding of any contracts, except for
studies by the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Academy of Public Administration.
   Under the House bill, a 12-member ``National Mars Commission''
would be established to prepare a detailed proposal for a joint
manned mission to Mars with the Soviet Union.
   Development of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite,
which is opposed by the Reagan Administration, is authorized by the
bill. And the House calls for a flight demonstration for a
hypersonic space plane _ one capable of flying at least five times
the speed of sound _ by 1995.

<HEAD>Major Colombian Drug Figure Gets 60 Years</HEAD>

   A Colombian cocaine dealer whose arrest prosecutors
called second only to drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas' in
importance was sentenced to 60 years in prison Thursday.
   Jose Auli Lopez Chacon, 38, ran a Bogota-based drug trafficking
ring that smuggled $32.5 million worth of cocaine to cities across
the United States, according to his indictment. He was snared in a
sting federal agents had dubbed Operation Pisces.
   ``We don't usually catch people of your caliber,'' U.S. District
Judge Lenore Nesbitt said as she imposed the 60-year sentence for
one count of operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Lopez pleaded guilty to the charge in a plea bargain, escaping
the maximum life sentence possible under the law. But Lopez's
attorney, Joel Rosenthal, said his client probably would spend the
rest of his life behind bars.
   ``The 60-year sentence is a functional life term,'' said
Rosenthal. ``He has to serve at least 40 years without parole.''
   Lopez was indicted in the Drug Enforcement Administration
money-laundering sting Operation Pisces, along with top Medellin
Cartel figures Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Luis Ochoa
Vasquez, who have escaped custody.
   Lopez apparently kept his operation separate from the cartel's,
but special Justice Department prosecutor Carol Wilkinson said he
was second only to Lehder in major drug figures arrested in the
United States.
   Lehder, a top cartel manager, was convicted of cocaine smuggling
in Jacksonville last month.
   Lopez supervised his own far-flung empire, said Ms. Wilkinson,
overseeing drug laboratories in the Bogota area as well as U.S.
distribution of the drug.
   His undoing was Operation Pisces, a three-year sting operation
in which the DEA set up undercover agents as money launderers while
cracking down on the traffickers' traditional conduits.
   In all, the DEA agents handled 325 transactions averaging $1
million to $1.5 million each, agency officials said.
   The sting supplied the DEA with enough information for state and
local authorities to arrest more than 350 people from 1984 to 1987,
as well as seize more than 19,000 pounds of cocaine with a
wholesale value of $270 million.
   Operation Pisces ended in April 1987 with the indictment of 115
people in Miami, New York and Los Angeles.
   Lopez was caught that same month when an undercover agent lured
him to the United States by promising to introduce him to Mafia
money men who would launder his drug cash. He was arrested as he
stepped off the plane at Miami International Airport.

   Some of the 57 men killed in the
Stolzenbach coal mine survived a devastating gas explosion but
suffocated when their emergency masks ran out of oxygen, officials
said Thursday.
   Among the dead was an 18-year-old who was on his first shift as
a miner when the explosion occurred Wednesday afternoon in what an
official described as ``one of the most modern and best-equipped
lignite coal mines around.''
   The young man had ``graduated from school last Friday and wanted
to earn some money before continuing his education,'' Mayor Bernd
Hessler told reporters. Hessler would not give the young man's
name, honoring the family's wishes.
   Rescue workers brought the first 11 bodies to the surface
Thursday afternoon and took them to a temporary mortuary in metal
caskets. Gottfried Milde, Hesse state interior minister, said 36
bodies had been found and the others were scattered over a wide
area underground.
   Milde said earlier Thursday that 12 bodies had been taken from
the mine, but changed the number after talking with rescue workers.
   Fourteen of the dead miners were Turkish immigrants. Families
and friends _ Germans and Turks together _ clung to each other at
the mine 70 miles northeast of Frankfurt, eyes red and swollen from
tears and lack of sleep.
   Around them, men with with grim faces black with coal dust and
soot moved to and from the mine intent on retrieving all the bodies.
   ``My son Dieter is down there. He's been a miner for 20 years,''
said Werner Henke, who waited at his son's house. ``God, let him be
alive. He has two small children.''
   Wulf Boettcher, a state mining official, said: ``The chances of
finding any survivors have sunk to zero.''
   Rescue workers broke through tons of debris and battled rising
water in the effort to retrieve the bodies of all 57 victims of
West Germany's worst mining accident since 1962.
   ``Some of the dead were found with their miners' breathing masks
on,'' said Erwin Braun, head of the Hesse state mining board.
``That means they survived the blast and apparently ran out of
air.''
   He said the emergency masks had about three hours of oxygen, but
Boettcher put the time at about 45 minutes. Braun said the
explosion was caused by a buildup of methane gas.
   A report on the ZDF television network said investigators were
speculating that a short-circuit from a power tool may have started
a chain reaction of explosions inside the mine.
   Braun said that was possible, because ``coal dust can become
dangerous if it gets mixed with methane gas and there is suddenly a
spark.''
   About Stolzenbach, he said: ``This is one of the most modern and
best-equipped lignite coal mines around and it has been inspected
many times, including recently.''
   Stefan Walscher, the local prosecutor investigating the
disaster, told reporters it could be several days before all the
bodies are located and brought out.
   ``The water is rising in several places, hampering the attempts
to get the bodies out,'' he said, and workers were pumping fresh
air into the mine to minimize the risk of another gas explosion.
   Braun said the danger of another methane buildup persisted and
``Rescue work is being hindered by heavy damage. ... Teams can
proceed only with oxygen masks.''
   Braun said carbon monoxide levels inside the mine had receded,
but still were severe.
   Milde said officials planned Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Moslem
religious services at a local school where the bodies were to be
taken and where relatives assembled earlier Thursday.
   Turkish consulate representatives also were at the scene. They
said state officials had confirmed that the total number of Turkish
victims was 14. Some of those killed will be taken back to Turkey
for burial, they added.
   Wednesday's explosion blew the roofs off at least three
buildings at the mine, knocked down sheds and shattered windows and
sent debris flying that seriously injured eight miners on the
surface. The mine is in a field, with the nearest homes about 500
yards away.
   The explosion was the worst mining accident in West Germany
since February 1962, when 299 miners were killed at Voelklingen in
Saarland state.
   About 170 people have been employed in the Stolzenbach mine,
which is owned by Preussen Elektra of Hanover, one of the largest
West German utility companies.

<HEAD>ABC's `Slap Maxwell' Scuttled Over Actor-Producer Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC dropped ``The Slap Maxwell Story'' after
its star, Dabney Coleman, and producer and creator, Jay Tarses,
refused to continue working together, the president of ABC
Entertainment said Thursday.
   ``We never really had an opportunity to renew the show or cancel
it,'' Brandon Stoddard said at an informal meeting with newsmen in
his office.
   ``The way it was presented to us was that if Dabney continued
with the show, Jay wouldn't do it. And if Jay stayed with the show,
Dabney wouldn't do it. It just went its way.''
   Stoddard said he did not know what caused the conflict between
Coleman and Tarses, neither of whom was available for comment.
Tarses was in New York, and Coleman was working on a movie for NBC
called ``Sooner or Later.''
   The show, with Coleman as an acerbic sports writer, did poorly
in the ratings and had particular trouble reaching women viewers.
Stoddard said he felt it was essentially a variation of ``Buffalo
Bill,'' which Coleman and Tarses did for NBC several years ago.
   ``We felt the show had problems with women,'' said Stoddard.
``They had trouble caring about that character. But Jay runs his
show, very clearly. We talked to him and made suggestions, but he
does what he wants to do.''
   Tarses was also the creator and producer of ``Days and Nights of
Molly Dodd,'' which was canceled by NBC.
   Stoddard met with newsmen to discuss the new schedule and ABC's
plans for the future, although he avoided answering questions about
contingency plans for fall programming should the writers strike
continue.
   Although ABC finished last season in second place in the
ratings, ahead of CBS, he said he still considered ABC the third
network because it took second on the basis of the Winter Olympics,
World Series and the Super Bowl.
   ``We think the quality of our programming continues to move
forward,'' he said. ``We have a long way to go in that direction
but we are committed to quality programming. We were lucky this
spring that some of our tryout shows caught on with the public,
like `The Wonder Years,' `The Ten of Us' and `China Beach.'''
   ABC's biggest problem show appears to be ``Moonlighting,'' which
irked many viewers this past season with numerous reruns. Another
problem was that Cybill Shepherd, who co-stars with Bruce Willis,
was pregnant.
   ``We're making some headway against the problem of repeats,''
Stoddard said. ``That is a serious problem but we look for more
original shows. The writers strike is causing creative problems at
this time, but in the future I'd like to see a greater balance in
the stories.
   ``We want `Moonlighting' to return to being a detective show and
to put less emphasis on the relationships. We want it to get back
to being a detective show. We have great writers and a great cast
and I don't think that'll be too difficult.''
   Stoddard said he expected ABC's 30-hour miniseries ``War and
Remembrance,'' a sequel to ``The Winds of War,'' to begin in
February. He said a final decision on how to schedule the series
would be made soon. The series, based on the book by Herman Wouk,
could not be scheduled in the fall because of NBC's coverage of the
Olympics ``which has tied up all the advertising money.''
   ``I've seen 18 hours of this show,'' he said, ``and you ain't
never seen anything like this! Not ever! I think this show is going
to bring people back to television who haven't watched in years.
And it's not just one show. It's 30 hours long.''
   The final scenes for ``War and Remembrance,'' including a tank
battle and miniatures for the Battle of Midway, are now being
filmed. Stoddard said a 26-foot submarine miniature had its front
end blown off during filming when two torpedoes were fired at the
same time and exploded.

<HEAD>Minister Tells of Plans To Salvage 16th-Century Treasure Ship</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rahim on second reference is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief minister of Malacca
state spoke Thursday of plans to salvage a fortune in precious
gems, jewelry and artifacts from a Portuguese treasure ship that
sank in the Straits of Malacca in 1512.
   The national news agency Bernama quoted Chief Minister Abdul
Rahim Thamby Chik as saying talks between the state and the federal
government ``will be carried out as soon as possible to enable
salvage operations (to begin) and to recover the treasures.''
   Rahim said the wreckage of the Flora de la Mar was discovered in
the Straits of Malacca near Indonesian waters by a salvage team
which conducted a three-year study of the sinking, the agency
reported.
   History records indicate the Flora de la Mar was used to ferry
treasures seized after the Portuguese conquered Malacca in 1511.
The ship was on its way to Portugal from Malacca when it struck a
coral reef during a storm and capsized in January 1512.
   Rahim was quoted as saying that several precious items were
believed to have been saved by Portuguese naval commander Alfonso
D'Albuquerque, who was aboard the Flora de la Mar when it sank and
was rescued by another ship.
   The items _ including a gold sword, rubies, gold bangles and a
gold ring _ were gifts of the King of Siam to King Manuel and Queen
Donna Maria of Portugal, Rahim said.
   Bernama quoted Rahim as telling the agency in an interview in
Malacca, 72 miles south of Kuala Lumpur, that replicas of some of
these items were expected to be exhibited at the Malacca Sultanate
Palace early next year.

<HEAD>Disparity in Kidney Transplant Rates Found, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White men suffering from kidney failure are more
likely to get a kidney transplant than are women or minorities, a
new study says, but an transplant expert says that the statistical
differences aren't the result of bias on the part of doctors.
   A study in the June issue of the American Medical Association's
Archives of Internal Medicine showed 31 percent of U.S. men who had
undergone long-term dialysis received a transplant, compared with
21 percent of the women.
   Among minority patients, 20 percent received a transplant after
long-term dialysis compared with 30 percent of white patients, said
the report, based on national statistics dating to 1983.
   Dr. Carl M. Kjellstrand said the imbalance his report found does
not prove ``actual bias.''
   ``However, the most favored recipient of a transplant is similar
to the physicians who make the final decision: a young, white
man,'' said Kjellstrand, a Swedish doctor who spent several years
doing research in the United States.
   In certain age groups, the difference in transplant rates
between races or sexes was even greater than the 3-to-2 ratio found
overall. Minority long-term dialysis patients age 21 to 45 were
half as likely to undergo the surgery as white patients of the same
age and sex.
   And women of any race age 46 to 60 were less than half as likely
to receiving a donor kidney as men of the same race and age,
according to the report.
   Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker, former president of the American
Society of Transplant Physicians, said that for various reasons,
white men are more likely to seek transplants.
   A recent change in the method used to allocate donor kidneys to
people on waiting lists, ordered by the government, ensures against
bias based on age, sex or race, he said.
   But women and non-whites who have had kidney failures are much
less likely to be on those lists than white men, Hunsicker said in
a telephone interview Thursday.
   Hunsicker said blacks might be less eager than whites for
transplants, because they typically do not do as well after
receiving a donor kidney. But they also do not do as well on
dialysis because of specialized health problems, he said.
   ``To get a kidney transplant, your doctors or you must get you
on the list, and black patients (and doctors) may not take the
initiative,'' said Dr. Arthur J. Matas, a kidney-transplant surgeon
at the University of Minnesota.
   About 5 percent of the women who qualify for kidney transplants
may have trouble being matched to a donor organ, Hunsicker said.
Women who have been pregnant several times can develop antibodies
that would reject the organ, a problem that can be detected in
pre-transplant tests, he said.
   But that 5 percent does not nearly justify the disparity between
the number of women and men on dialysis who receive transplants, he
said.
   Hunsicker also said women may hesitate to get transplants
because ``by and large, in our society, men tend to be more
aggressive and risk-taking.''
   In November 1987, the United States instituted a new policy for
allocating donor kidneys based on objective criteria, Hunsicker
said. The government enforces the system by denying hospitals
Medicare if they fail to report all patients on waiting lists, all
donor kidneys and all recipients.
   Even before the law was passed, Hunsicker said, ``there is no
reason to believe there was any bias anywhere with regards to race
or sex. Age is a different matter.''
   He said some hospitals may have used age as a criterion before
the new policy was instituted.

   Security forces killed 23 leftist guerrillas
in the Andes and eastern jungle, and in Lima rebels assassinated a
lawyer who was recovering from an earlier attempt on her life,
official sources said Thursday.
   Guerrillas of the Shining Path, a Maoist group, ambushed a
military patrol Wednesday and 12 rebels died in a 15-minute battle
with troops, the military said.
   A brief statement said the fighting occurred in the rural
highlands of Ayacucho state near Huanta, 230 miles southeast of
Lima. There was no mention of army casualties.
   La Cronica, the government newspaper, said 11 Shining Path
gunmen were slain Wednesday in a fight with paramilitary police on
the outskirts of Uchiza, a center of the cocaine trade 260 miles
northeast of Lima. Police accuse the Maoist rebels of cooperating
with narcotics traffickers.
   The regions around Uchiza and Huanta are under a state of
emergency because of the Shining Path, which began an insurgency
eight years ago that has cost more than 10,000 lives.
   In Lima, police said two men carrying concealed guns entered a
hospital Wednesday and killed Carmen Rosa Cuzquen, 32, an alleged
former member of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
   She was recovering from an attack two months ago by the
guerrillas, who have accused her of being a government informant.
   The Tupac Amaru movement, named for the leader of an Indian
revolt in 1780, began operating in 1984. It favors a Cuban-style
Marxism.

   Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov suggested Thursday that
the superpowers spend money saved by disarmament to finance joint
missions to Mars and beyond.
   In an interview with the Soviet weekly Nedelya translated by the
Tass news agency, Leonov said that would be an ideal use for money
previously spent on intermediate-range missiles, which United
States and Soviet Union have agreed to scrap.
   ``The funds released can be diverted to the implementation of
large-scale peaceful projects, specifically to manned flights to
Mars and the exploration of the universe,'' said Leonov, who flew
on the joint Soyuz-Apollo mission in the 1970s. He estimated the
cost of a Mars mission at $30 billion.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
ratification instruments Wednesday for a treaty eliminating the
missiles. The Soviet Union has said some transportation devices
used for its missiles were being converted into construction cranes
and civilian uses were being found for other missile hardware.
   Washington has been lukewarm to Soviet proposals for a joint
manned mission to Mars because of the cost. Gorbachev first
broached the idea in an interview last month with the Washington
Post and Newsweek magazine.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers attacked a gathering of two
leftist guerrilla groups who were discussing joint operations and
25 guerrillas and eight troopers were killed in the battle, the
Defense Ministry said Thursday.
   In Bogota and other Colombian cities Thursday, people honked car
horns, waved flags and white handkerchiefs and sang the national
anthem in an appeal to kidnappers to free former presidential
candidate Alvaro Gomez Hurtado.
   The shootout between soldiers and guerrillas occurred Sunday
near San Pedro de Uraba, a town in the northern banana-growing
region.
   A report Thursday in the El Mundo newspaper of Medellin, a
northwestern city known as the center of Colombia's cocaine trade,
said 60 guerrillas had been killed in the initial fighting and in
daily running battles since.
   According to the ministry statement, the guerrillas involved
were from the Popular Liberation Army, a Maoist group, and the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, a Moscow-line organization.
   During the nationwide demonstration, which lasted 10 minutes
beginning at 11 a.m., about 1,000 people assembled in a park
outside the Bogota apartment building where Gomez lives. Gomez was
kidnapped last Sunday as he left a church two blocks away.
   ``Colombians today have expressed the utmost unity for the
immediate release of Alvaro Gomez Hurtado,'' acting President Cesar
Gaviria Trujillo said after the demonstration.
   Gaviria is minister of government. He is tanding in for
President Virgilio Barco, who is on an official trip to Europe and
the United States.
   Radio stations have received several telephone calls allegedly
from the abductors, but police say they are not sure any are
legitimate.
   Some callers claimed responsibilities for drug traffickers,
others for leftist guerrillas. One said Gomez had died of bullet
wounds.
   Dozens of Colombians have been kidnapped by leftist guerrillas
and several have been seized by narcotics traffickers who demand
that the government stop extraditing Colombian drug suspects to the
United States.
   Colombia has not extradited anyone on drug charges in 15 months.
   Gomez, publisher of the daily El Siglo, ran for president twice
and has said in many editorials he wants to see Colombia free of
leftist guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 students from Beijing University
marched to the city's main square Thursday night to protest the
death of a fellow student in a brawl.
   Foreign sources said the demonstration developed spontaneously
at about 11 p.m. after students read a poster on campus describing
the death earlier in the day of Cai Jinfang, a 22-year-old
geophysics student.
   Students said Cai was beaten to death by ``hooligans'' while
buying liquor outside the campus.
   It was the largest demonstration since huge pro-democracy
rallies in December 1986 and January 1987 that led to shakeups in
the government and a conservative backlash against ``bourgeois
liberalization.''
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
students arrived at about 4 a.m. at Tiananmen Square, the large
plaza in central Beijing, passed through it and stopped at a police
office to present a list of demands.
   About 700 students completed the 10-mile walk from the campus in
northwest Beijing to the square, linking arms and shouting for
``justice and human rights.'' One banner read ``pay back the blood
debt.''
   Police watched the march but did not interfere.
   In their petition to police, students demanded the arrest of the
assailants, a public trial, better security around the campus and
reports of in the official media.
   Yuan Liben, a Beijing Communist Party official, told the
students at the police office that two of the attackers had been
arrested, but demonstrators shouted him down with complaints about
``bureaucracy,'' the sources reported.
   About 1,000 students from the University of Foreign Economic
Relations in Beijing demonstrated in December about a similar
incident, in which a student was knifed to death. One of the
attackers, a 22-year-old man, was executed.

   Representatives of big
business failed to persuade black labor unions on Thursday to
abandon a three-day protest next week that is expected to take the
form of a general strike.
   The two largest black labor federations have called for a
peaceful, nationwide protest June 6-8 to express opposition to
government crackdowns on anti-apartheid groups and to a proposed
labor bill that would curtail unions' ability to hold legal strikes.
   The federations cannot legally endorse a general strike, but
their previous calls for national protests have resulted in
widespread work stoppages. Leading anti-apartheid clergymen have
endorsed the federations' latest appeal.
   Leaders of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the
largest union federation, met Thursday with a committee
representing major employer organizations and headed by Bobby
Godsell of Anglo American Corp.
   The federation's general secretary, Jay Naidoo, told reporters
the protest will go ahead as planned because the business officials
failed to ease union concerns about the proposed labor legislation.
   ``We maintain that the bill represents a major rollback of the
rights of workers,'' Naidoo said.
   Godsell said the bill is not ``union-bashing'' legislation. He
also said the federation officials refused to promise him that next
week's protest would not include stayaways.
   Federation leaders arranged a meeting Thursday with the South
Africa Consultative Committee on Labor Affairs, which represents
major employer organizations. The talks included management
representatives from the country's leading industries, such as
mining, metals and manufacturing.
   Officials of the Congress of South African Trade Unions met
Wednesday with the National Council of Trade Unions, the second
largest labor federation. The two groups, which have differed over
political ideology, agreed to cooperate in promoting the protest.
   The Congress says it has 691,000 dues-paying members. The
Council claims more than 400,000 members.
   Police officials said the union groups are being monitored to
see if they violated state-of-emergency prohibitions on promotion
of political strikes and boycotts. Some employers have threatened
to dock wages, take disciplinary action and withdraw from wage
negotiations if workers take part in a stayaway.
   In February the government banned the Congress of South African
Trade Unions and 17 other anti-apartheid organizations from taking
part in politics.
   A main federation target is the proposed Labor Relations
Amendment, which would make it harder for unions to strike, outlaw
sympathy strikes and hold unions liable for losses suffered by
employers during an illegal strike.
   Unions charge that major businesses have not used their
influence to oppose the measure, now before Parliament.
   At the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, police
fired rubber bullets into the air Thursday to disperse hundreds of
college students demonstrating against government detentions of
anti-apartheid activists.
   There were no injuries or arrests, Vice Chancellor Mervyn Shear
said. He said that the students had engaged in a ``perfectly
peaceful protest.''
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying
lengths of time since the government declared a state of emergency
in June 1986 following anti-apartheid violence.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Jackson Meets With Gang Members</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 5 grafs with comment after City Hall meeting</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson met with
gang members in a violence-ravaged ghetto Thursday and said he
wants to end the cycle of ``desperation...hopelessness'' that
plagues their lives.
   ``A combination of drugs and guns and money creates a kind of
unholy alliance that has left the South Central Los Angeles
residents feeling they have no way out,'' Jackson said.
   He said he hoped the meeting would be the first of many such
talking sessions between officials and the young gang members,
beginning with one that afternoon with Mayor Tom Bradley at City
Hall.
   He talked to reporters as gang members and other residents of
the Nickerson Gardens housing project milled around in the
courtyard outside a two-bedroom apartment where Jackson had spent
the night with a projects family.
   Jackson's closed session with more than 100 community
representatives and gang members in the Watts housing project had
been billed as a meeting of both Bloods and Crips, rival gangs in a
city that saw 205 gang-related deaths last year.
   But the few dozen gang members on hand were all from the Bounty
Hunters gang that dominates that area or their affiliate groups.
Many sported the red colors, hats or shirts, that mark the the
Bloods.
   Gang members and police officers said they doubted anyone could
get the gang rivals to sit down together peacefully.
   ``I'd be surprised if they both got in there and didn't start
anything,'' said Officer Victor Rocha, who patrols the South
Central Los Angeles region where Watts is located.
   Jackson emerged from the meeting to announce to reporters that a
meeting had been arranged later in the day at City Hall for
himself, gang members Mayor Tom Bradley and other officials.
   Initially, Jackson's schedule included an afternoon debate with
front-runner Michael Dukakis, but Dukakis canceled it Thursday
morning because his wife was to undergo surgery on Friday. He flew
back to Boston to be with her.
   Jackson said the City Hall meeting would include discussion of
ways to more effectively target resources, social programs and job
efforts in the communities plauged by gang and drug problems.
   He described gangs as groups of people ``who form a reaction of
desperation to hopelessness.''
   It was unclear what else was acheieved at the morning meeting
which was closed to reporters.
   Some local residents _ many of whom have lost friends and
relatives to gang shootings _ expressed hope at the attention
Jackson brought to their concerns, but also skepticism that any
changes could be achieved.
   ``I don't know, I doubt it,'' said James Tapla, 17, who
described himself as aa Bounty Hunter ``marked'' by rival gangs.
   ``You can't go nowhere without somebody wanting to beat you down
or shoot you. I lost three close friends'' to gang violence, he
said. ``I'm tired of it. It's time for this to stop.''
   Another youth, John Thomas, 25, said he once shot someone in a
gang feud and didn't stay around to see if the person died.
   ``It's no big deal. Life in South Central LA is tough,'' he
said. But he said ``deep down inside'' many gang members don't want
to be involved in violence.
   He and others said virtually everyone in their community has a
gun.
   ``It's better to be caught by the police with it, than by some
other fool without it,'' said Kevin Johnson, 25.
   Later Thursday, at City Hall, before Jackson and Bradley met
with several county and city representatives and six gang members,
Bradley praised Jackson's ``thoroughly remarkable campaign.''
   ``I commend you for what you have done in showing what is
possible for this country,'' the mayor told the candidate.
   However, when questioned by reporters, he declined to directly
endorse Jackson.
   ``Jesse Jackson hasn't needed anybody to endorse him. He's done
it on his own,'' Bradley said. He credited Jackson with
``energizing millions of people across the country.''
   When the two emerged from a private meeting, Bradley turned
aside questions as to why it took a Jackson visit to spark the
meeting between officials and gang members. Jackson ``in his most
unique way has been able to make an appeal'' to gang members, the
mayor said.

   A teen-age Arab prostitute fatally shot an
18-year-old Jewish seminary student Thursday after telling him she
was tired of life and wanted to commit suicide, police and an
Israeli news agency reported.
   Spokesman Rafi Levy said Jerusalem police were investigating
whether the killing was linked to the Palestinian rebellion that
began Dec. 8 in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Also Thursday, a court convicted four left-wing Israelis who met
with PLO officials of breaking a law against contacts with members
of terrorist groups. Israel calls the Palestine Liberation
Organization a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it.
   Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir on Thursday reiterated his
opposition to holding an international Middle East peace
conference. Shamir was reacting to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's statement Wednesday that he would be willing to renew
relations with Israel if such a conference took place.
   Shamir told army radio that Gorbachev's remarks ``will not
change my views. ... I don't think we should pay a heavy price for
renewing relations with the Soviet Union.''
   The Soviets broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the 1967
Middle East war, when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip
from Jordan and Egypt.
   In the United Arab Emirates, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said the
Arab uprising in the occupied territories will continue until
Palestinians have an independent homeland.
   ``We need another year of continuous uprising,'' Arafat told a
gathering of Palestinians at the emirate's presidential guest
palace Wednesday night.
   The killing in Jerusalem was the second recent attack on a
seminarian in the Holy City, which has 340,000 Jewish and 130,000
Palestinian residents. The first occurred May 26, when an Arab
stabbed and wounded a Jewish student in the Arab quarter.
   The latest victim, Eliezer Schlesinger, was a student at the
Sha'arei Chesed seminary in the Rehavia quarter, near where he was
shot.
   Itim, the Israeli news agency, said Schlesinger and another
student took a break from studies at 1:30 a.m. and walked through
Sacher Park.
   Schlesinger's companion, who was not identified, said they
encountered a young woman who told them in fluent Hebrew: ``I'm
tired of life. I want to commit suicide,'' Itim reported.
   He said they talked about two minutes, then the men walked away
and the woman drew a pistol and opened fire, hitting Schlesinger
five times in the back and head.
   She fled but was caught by a security officer who heard the
shots. Levy said the woman confessed and described the shooting,
but her name was not released because she is a minor.
   An Israeli soldier and a teen-age Jewish settler have been slain
in the West Bank during the Palestinian uprising. At least 199
Palestinians also have been killed, according to U.N. figures.
   Arab east Jerusalem was taken from Jordan along with the West
Bank, but Israel has formally annexed it.
   On Thursday, the army retracted figures published earlier this
week that put the Palestinian death toll at 207.
   Col. Raanan Gissin, an military spokesman, said the army was
certain of only 152 deaths, all at the hands of Israeli soldiers.
``All the rest are unclear and we are not going to relate to
them,'' he said.
   The court convicted the four Israelis after rejecting defense
arguments that the PLO was not a terrorist group and the 2-year-old
law against meetings with such organizations did not apply.
   Latif Dory, Yael Lotan, Reuven Kaminer and Eliezer Failer held
talks with a 15-member PLO delegation in Romania in November 1986,
soon after the law was passed. They said at the time they
considered the meeting a test of the law.
   Dory called the statute ``a terrorist law against a peace
dialogue'' and declared: ``We shall continue to fight it until it
is revoked.''
   At Rafah in the Gaza Strip, soldiers prevented students from
entering a junior high school. Itim said the army closed the school
for two weeks, accusing students of throwing rocks at Israelis who
drove by.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander in the West Bank,
said soldiers no longer will force Arab merchants to open stores
during hours set by the army. Underground leaders of the rebellion
have ordered shopkeepers to close in the afternoon.

   Supernova 1987A, the closest star to explode
in 400 years, has provided a feast of many courses for an
international army of scientists. Now the researchers are waiting
for dessert: a look at a neutron star in its infancy.
   ``We've never before observed a supernova evolve through to the
birth of a neutron star,'' Stan Woosley, a University of
California, Santa Cruz, astrophysicist said at a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration news conference Thursday.
``Now the egg is about to hatch.''
   Supernova 1987A was first detected on Feb. 24, 1987. The burst
of light and radiation was located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a
galaxy near the Milky Way, and some 160,000 light years away.
   It was the first exploding star in four centuries that was close
enough to be seen with the unaided eye _ but only in the Southern
Hemisphere _ and scientists all over the world immediately turned
powerful instruments toward the object.
   Since then, the progress of the explosion has been charted in
minute detail as light and other radiation streamed away and were
detected by instruments onboard airplanes and satellites, or
carried aloft by balloons and sounding rockets, or housed in
ground-based observatories.
   ``It has been the most completely studied phenomenon outside the
solar system in history,'' Woosley said. ``It has been a grand
event, as it should be since something like doesn't happen but
every 30 generations.''
   The scientists actually are studying an event that occurred
160,000 years ago. But the star is so far away, some 960,000
trillion miles, that it has taken all of those centuries for the
light to reach Earth.
   Visible light from the explosion has declined slowly, but data
is still being collected in other parts of the radiation spectrum.
   At Thursday's NASA news conference, scientists said the studies
have confirmed some basic theories about the life cycle of stars
and about the formation of fundamental elements in the universe,
but Supernova '87 also has created mysteries that are yet to be
explained.
   Among the findings reported Thursday:
   _Gamma ray studies show that as the star exploded, a small
amount of matter in its helium core evolved into radioactive
nickel, which decayed to cobalt and finally to the stable isotope
iron-56. This confirmed theories of the evolution of matter from
stars.
   ``We have seen for the first time the creation of new matter in
the universe,'' said David Helfand, a Columbia University scientist.
   _Data from emissions of the explosion, which give indications of
the star's composition, show the star had a puzzling lifetime
before its explosion. Woosley said it apparently spent about 9
billion years as a blue sequence star, changed its composition to a
red super giant star for a million years through the loss of
material equal to about four suns, and then evolved back to a blue
star. He said there is no general explanation for this.
   _Early in its life, the star that exploded was about 20 times
more massive than the sun. It's explosion came about through a
gravitational collapse of shells of surrounding the core of helium.
   _Light streaming from the star has been the result of
radioactive decay. The light has declined and will continue to do
so until energy from an evolving neutron star causes the level of
light to become steady.
   It is this event, Woosley said, that astronomers are awaiting.
   Detection of the neutron star could come in a year, as some
believe, or it could take many years.
   A neutron star is the final stage in the life of a star. It is
composed of neutrons and compressed to the density of about a
thousand million million times that of water. Its density is only
10 percent less than that of a black hole, which is so dense that
not even light can escape its gravitational field.
   ``If a sugar cube was dropped on a neutron star, it would hit
with a megaton of force,'' Woosley said. ``That's the energy in
such a force of gravity.''

   Agencies coping with the AIDS epidemic in America praised a
White House AIDS commission's call Thursday for legislation
protecting the infected, and urged Congress and the Reagan
administration to follow its recommendations.
   A spokesman for one agency, however, challenged the report as a
``Band-Aid approach,'' saying the proposed $3 billion increase in
AIDS spending is too little, too late.
   ``The commission's report is courageous, aggressive and
compassionate,'' said Tim Sweeney, deputy executive director for
policy of the New York City-based Gay Men's Health Crisis, a
clearinghouse on AIDS.
   ``We applaude their honesty and directness in addressing
anti-discrimination, explicit education, addiction treatment,
violence against people with AIDS, expansion of voluntary testing
and the federal government's lethargic approach to drug testing,''
he said.
   ``We challenge the president, Congress and presidential
candidates to respond to this report by implementing its
recommendations,'' Sweeney said.
   The American Public Health Association, a private organization
of health professionals, lauded the report ``as an aggressive first
step towards developing an integrated national strategy to deal
with the AIDS epidemic.''
   The recommendations ``are a rational, intelligent and
compassionate response to the epidemic,'' the association said.
   ``It goes a long way in calling for a rational, compassionate,
practical response to the AIDS epidemic, which we are yet to have
in this country,'' said Rene Durazzo of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation.
   He said the commission's report should have specifically called
for the use of condoms, and should have been strong in preventing
AIDS transmission among intravenous drug users.
   The recommendations cannot be ignored by the White House in
light of similar recommendations by the National Academy of
Sciences, he said.
   ``We're having a very strong consensus coming together to form a
good, national, practical response.
   ``At the White House, they have no reason to hedge the issues
any more,'' he said. ``If they do, they're laying down and letting
peope die.''
   Bob Kunst, director of Cure Aids Now, a clearinghouse on AIDS
and a service agency in Miami feeding 120 AIDS patients, condemned
the report as ``a Band-Aid approach to this global menace and
emergency.''
   Kunst said the $3 billion spending hike proposed ``is again
woefully deficient. As a direct service agency in Miami, there is
no money for food, for housing, for legitimate issues to keep
people who are already infected alive.
   ``The emphasis in this report is on anti-discrimination laws for
people with AIDS,'' he said. ``Florida was the first state to treat
AIDS as a handicap. ... None of that is saving anybody's life.
   ``The last thing we need is the killing us with kindness
attitude. What we want is the money, the accountability and we want
legitimate people involved.''

   Former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin was
sentenced Thursday to two years probation and 50 days of community
service after being convicted of using cocaine.
   Ruffin also was ordered to remain drug free during his probation
in the sentencing at Detroit Recorders Court, authorities said.
   Ruffin was convicted May 19 of using cocaine after Judge John
O'Brien ruled there was not enough evidence to convict him of a
cocaine possession charge.
   Ruffin, who sang with the Temptations from 1963 to 1968, was
found in the basement of a Detroit house authorities raided for
drugs. A bag containing cocaine residue was found with his personal
papers in the raid July 28, 1987.
   Ruffin said he went to the home to find a friend, not to buy
drugs. A co-defendant in the trial, Marvin Hicks, testified Ruffin
was among seven people who pitched in to buy 42 grams of crack
cocaine.
   Ruffin, who has been touring with former Temptations singer
Eddie Kendricks, is in a hospital drug treatment program in Saline
and will remain there until he is discharged, according to a court
official.

<TEXT>
   There is no ``smoking gun'' in the Harvard
Business School faculty's vote for a former professor who claims
she was denied tenure at the school because of her sex, a federal
judge said Thursday.
   Whether Barbara Bund Jackson should become the fifth tenured
woman in the school's 80-year history hinges on whether the
evidence showed discrimination when she was denied tenure in 1981
and 1983, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock said Thursday.
   Jackson, 44, now a private marketing consultant, began teaching
at Harvard in 1973. She was promoted to associate professor in 1977
and applied for tenure in 1981. She sued the university in 1984.
   The judge, who is expected to rule in the case next week, heard
closing arguments in the eight-day trial came after attorney Evan
T. Lawson refused the judge's recommendation to suspend the trial
to question 56 professors involved a key 1981 faculty vote.
   Lawson said he did not have the resources to embark on ``an
extremely complicated and lengthy procedure.''
   ``I think you will concede that there is no smoking gun here,''
Woodlock said. ``What I'm interested in finding out is not whether
or not her tenure review case was unfair but whether it was unfair
because she is a woman.''
   In closing arguments, Lawson maintained he had compiled ``a
multiplicity of little things that put together add up to an evil.''
   Harvard attorney Allan A. Ryan Jr. maintained ``not one shred of
evidence'' linked Jackson's tenure denial to sex bias.
   During testimony, Harvard admitted that documents existed
showing the school's faculty voted 47-7 to support Jackson's tenure
bid but two days later backed her by 29-27. But Ryan said there was
no evidence that McArthur used Jackson's sex in lobbying professors
to switch their votes in 1981.
   Tenure decisions at Harvard are submitted to the faculty to
gauge support for the professor; the actual decision rests with the
university president.
   Lawson's argument cited a number of factors which he contends
prove that Jackson was a victim of sex discrimination, including:
   _Business school dean John H. McArthur, a co-defendant with the
university, once said the only way to get more women on the
school's faculty would be to impose quotas.
   _At least four men who had less favorable reviews and faculty
support than Jackson received tenure from 1977 to 1984.
   _A marketing expert from outside Harvard who backed Jackson was
specifically asked whether his recommendation had anything to do
with affirmative action.
   Lawson claimed the school's tenure standards were applied
unfairly to Jackson, who after being denied tenure in 1981 was
given a three-year extension and asked to demonstrate excellence in
marketing.
   Ryan contended that Jackson's case was ``a long train of
perceived slights ... but it is wholly bereft of any evidence that
a man would have been treated any differently than her.''

<HEAD>Woman Who Went on School Shooting Spree Was Taking Experimental
Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laurie Dann, whose school shooting spree killed
an 8-year-old boy and wounded six other people, was using an
experimental drug used to control certain behavior problems, a
medical examiner said.
   Traces of the drug clomipramine, known by the trade name
Anafrail, turned up in autopsy tests on Laurie Dann's body, Cook
County Medical Examiner Robert Stein said Wednesday. He said the
tests showed no traces of any other drug.
   Anafrail can cause suicidal tendencies in some patients who take
it, Dr. Robert DeVito, a pyschiatrist at Loyola University Medical
Center in suburban Maywood, said Thursday.
   DeVito, in an interview with WMAQ-TV, said he didn't think the
drug would have caused Ms. Dann to go on the shooting spree.
   Dr. John Griest, a Madison, Wis., psychiatrist treating Ms.
Dann, was involved in tests of Anafrail at a University of
Wisconsin clinic, said Gloria Martini, a spokeswoman for Ciba-Geigy
Corp., the New Jersey maker of the drug.
   Griest cannot comment on Ms. Dann's case under the
confidentiality of doctor-patient relationships, said Lauren Cnare,
a spokesman at the Madison clinic. But Ms. Cnare said, ``We are
involved in clinical trials of Anafrail.''
   On May 20, Ms. Dann, 30, walked into the Hubbard Woods
Elementary School in Winnetka, north of Chicago, shot a boy in the
bathroom and then entered a classroom and shot five other
youngsters.
   She fled the school and entered a nearby home, where she wounded
a 20-year-old man who tried to seize the gun, then killed herself
as police surrounded the house.
   Ms. Cnare said the drug, which has been used in other countries
for two decades, is being tested in the United States to treat
``obsessive-compulsive disorder,'' which occurs in about 1 percent
of the population.
   People suffering from the disorder have repeated unpleasant
thoughts or impulses as well as repetitive behavior, Ms. Cnare said.
   ``Carried to the extreme, some people spend eight hours in the
shower,'' Ms. Martini said. The drug also is used to check
``repetitive thoughts of random violence,'' she added.
   Ms. Dann had exhibited various symptoms of the disorder.
Residents of an apartment complex in Madison where she once lived
said she often rode the elevator for hours.
   Ms. Cnare said the University of Wisconsin has been involved
with clinical trials of Anafrail since September 1986. So far, she
said, 32 adults and 30 children have been given the drug.
   The clinical tests are being conducted, with government
approval, at 21 centers around the country.

<HEAD>Former Maine Governor, U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Dies at Age 85</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Horace A. Hildreth, whose career as
lawyer, broadcast executive, college president and two-term
governor of Maine was capped with four years' service as a U.S.
ambassador, died Thursday. He was 85.
   Hildreth suffered a heart attack while at Maine Medical Center
undergoing an examination for a blood pressure problem, said his
son, Horace Jr.
   In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Hildreth
ambassador to Pakistan, the Moslem country carved out of India in
1947. At that time, Hildreth had been president of Bucknell
University for four years.
   Hildreth was governor from 1945-49. In 1948, he ran for the U.S.
Senate seat, finishing second to Sen. Margaret Chase Smith in a
four-way Republican primary contest. Ten years later he lost a bid
for a third term as governor.
   Hildreth, a Gardiner native, was a graduate of Bowdoin College
and Harvard Law School. He practiced law in Portland and began his
Hildreth Network of Maine radio and TV stations before entering
politics.
   In 1940 he was elected to the Maine House and later that same
year he won promotion to the state Senate, where he became
president in 1943.
   The Hildreth Network included the state's first commercial radio
station, Bangor's WABI and television stations WABI in Bangor and
WAGM Presque Isle.
   In 1977 Hildreth merged his network with W. Russel Brace's
newspaper and publishing interests to form Diversified
Communications Inc. He served as its chairman until 1980 and as a
director thereafter.
   In addition to his son, Hildreth is survived by his wife,
Katherine, and three daughters.

   A former U.S. soldier who was caught with 18
pounds of cocaine during a traffic stop was part of a
drug-smuggling ring that used bogus military IDs to operate through
U.S. bases in Panama, federal drug authorities said Thursday.
   Members of the ring got false Army identification papers, forged
requests to board military aircraft and pretended to be active duty
servicemen returning home on leave, said Cornelius Dougherty, a
spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in
Washington.
   The members carried cocaine in luggage on flights from Howard
Air Base in Panama and shipped cocaine in Army mail from Fort
Kobbe, also in Panama, said Robert Feldkamp, another DEA spokesman.
   DEA officials said Thursday that Jackie Lee Bigelow, 27, of
Moultrie, was a central figure in the ring.
   Bigelow was taken into custody last week after being stopped by
a state trooper in nearby Colquitt County. He admitted he was
carrying cocaine and agreed to cooperate with police, said Sheriff
Gene Beard.
   Information supplied by Bigelow led to the arrests of five women
and one man in the past week. More arrests were expected, said FBI
agent David Parker.
   Each woman is charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine with
intent to distribute. If convicted, they could each face a maximum
sentence of life in prison and a $4 million fine. A bond hearing is
scheduled for Friday in Albany.
   At an initial hearing Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Nathan Davis
appointed lawyers to represent Maxine Williams, 24; Brenda McGee,
25; and Betty Howard, 31, all of Colquitt County, and Regina
Carmela Smith and Julia Thom, both of New York City. Ms. Smith's
husband, Oscar, has been arrested in New York on the same charge
and is being held there, said U.S. Attorney Edgar W. Ennis Jr. of
Macon.
   An FBI affidavit released Wednesday said Bigelow told
investigators he traveled to Panama twice this year to meet with
two members of the drug operation. He said he arranged for cocaine
packages to be mailed to the three Georgia women.
   Investigators seized two packages of cocaine last week that were
mailed to Moultrie from a military post office in Panama. One was
an 18-pound package taken from Bigelow's car on May 24 after he was
stopped for having a suspended license and the other was a 29-pound
package seized Friday at the Moultrie post office.
   Army spokeswoman Paige Eversole said military investigators were
trying to determine if any active-duty personnel were involved.

<HEAD>Storm Kills 14, Six Missing in Cuba</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heavy rains from the first tropical
depression of the year killed at least 14 people and drove many
thousands from their homes in central Cuba, the Cuban government
news agency Prensa Latina reported Thursday.
   The 3-day-old storm seriously damaged homes, bridges, roads and
railroad tracks and cut off electric power and communications to
several areas, said the agency, monitored in Mexico City.
   It said a tornado touched down early Thursday at an airport in
Camaguey city, destroying five Soviet-built MiG-21 fighter planes
and several buildings.
   Authorities ordered the evacuation of 65,000 people in five
central provinces whose homes were threatened by flooding. Prensa
Latina said rescue crews using helicopters and amphibious vehicles
evacuated at least 10,000 from their homes Wednesday and carried
them to higher ground.
   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Thursday the
storm was downgraded to a foul-weather system and was drifting
northeast from Cuba at between 5 and 10 mph.
   The official Agency of National Information said six people
drowned and three were electrocuted, Prensa Latina reported, with
seven of the dead in Cienfuegos province and one each in Villa
Clara and Sancti Spiritus.
   It did not give details on the five other deaths.
   The depression was the first of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season, which began Wednesday and ends Nov. 30. A typical season
sees 10 named tropical storms with winds exceeding 39 mph. Six
become hurricanes with winds over 74 mph.
   Tropical depressions can become tropical storms if their
circulating winds reach 39 mph. Storms become hurricanes if those
winds hit 74 mph.
   In 1987 there were three hurricanes and four tropical storms in
the Atlantic.

   Rageshree Ramachandran, a 13-year-old
eighth-grader from Fair Oaks, Calif., won the 61st National
Spelling Bee on Thursday, scoring her victory with the word
elegiacal, a form of couplets in a poem.
   Rageshree, the Indian-born daughter of statistics professors at
the University of California at Sacramento, defeated Victor C.
Wang, 14, of Camarillo, Calif., after a prolonged head-to head
match. She had placed 36th in the 1986 bee.
   Victor stumbled on the word stertorous, an adjective meaning
characterized by a harsh snoring or gasping sound. Rageshree
spelled the word correctly, then sealed her victory by correctly
spelling elegiacal.
   The winner won $1,500 and other prizes from the sponsoring
Scripps Howard newspapers, the runner-up $1,000.
   ``I'm really happy,'' said Rageshree, known to her friends as
Raga. ``I have been studying hard since January, at least a couple
of hours a day.''
   Asked if she had any coaches, she laughed and replied, ``My mom
and my dad. Also, my little sister. She's just 6, but she likes to
ask words, too.''
   Rageshree, who was sponsored by the Sacramento Bee, said she was
not surprised that Victor had misspelled six in the final round and
she five. ``There are always words that anyone can miss,'' she said.
   For Victor, it also was his second appearance at the national
bee. He placed 34th in the 1985 contest. He was sponsored by the
Ventura County Star-Free Press.
   Earlier, Iris Liu, 8, of Muncie, Ind., the youngest member of
the record 200-youngster field, made it to the fifth round in the
annual competition.
   But ``waywiser'' _ an instrument that measures distance _ proved
to be the instrument of her downfall. She spelled it
``weighweiser.''
   The pace of attrition escalated dramatically in the fifth round,
with 78 dropouts, more than five times as many as the round before.
The day had started with 144 survivors from Wednesday's competition.
   As the stakes got higher, the spellers increasingly requested
definitions, illustrative sentences, word origins and repetitions,
hoping for a magic moment of revelation.
   Antonia Seesink, 13, of Bangor, Pa., wrote frenetically on her
arm with a finger, a trick that saved her Wednesday with
``pontificalibus.'' But it didn't work Thursday with
``multipotent.''
   Some contestants who fluffed their words left the stage
tearfully. Others saved their reactions for the privacy of the
restroom or a special comfort room equipped with soft drinks and
soft couches.
   There were a few light moments. As the contest began its second
day Thursday, Robin Covey, 12, of Detroit, had barely repeated his
word _ ``eschatological'' _ when the disqualifying bell sounded.
   ''What's the matter, did I pronounce it wrong?'' Robin asked
with a grin. He went on to spell it correctly.
   Vasilios Stavrou, 13, of Dracut, Mass., fell victim to
``isepiptesis,'' a line on a map that shows the path of a migratory
bird. He spelled it ``isepatesis.''
   And ``klinotaxis'' _ bending in the direction of a stimulus _
proved fatal to Ana Gordan, 12, of Manchester, N.H. Her version:
``clinataccis.''
   Robert Pryor, 11, of Washington, D.C., who struggled heroically
through Day One on Wednesday with a stomach virus, returned
Thursday only to be stymied by ``fidgetiness.'' He spelled it as
``fidgitinous.''
   Contest officials estimate that 8 million to 9 million children
competed in local tournament that produced the 200 hopefuls who
traveled to Washington for the finals.
   The event offered $1,500 and other prizes to the winner.
   Scripps Howard also gave $1,000 to the second-place finisher,
$750 for third place, $500 for fourth, $400 for fifth, $300 for
sixth, $200 each for seventh through 10th, $100 each for 11th
through 20th, and $50 to each of the other 180 entrants.

<HEAD>Dissident Speaks To Students; Protests Over Arrested Journalist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident Milovan Djilas told an
enthusiastic student audience on Thursday in the increasingly
liberal republic of Slovenia, ``Yugoslavia can prosper only as a
democratic confederation,'' sources said.
   They said Djilas praised the West European pluralistic political
system.
   The sources said the noted author and former vice president of
Yugoslavia, once heir-apparent to the late President Josip Broz
Tito, talked to students in the Slovenian city of Maribor, in
northern Yugoslavia near the Austrian border.
   About 300 students loudly applauded him when he entered a hall
in their dormitory and during and after his address, according to
the sources, who spoke on condition their names not be used.
   Although the anti-communist themes Djilas expressed were typical
of him, the fact that he was allowed to voice them was considered
an event in itself.
   Djilas, a former comrade-in-arms of Tito, the founder of
communist Yugoslavia, spent about three years in royalist jails in
Yugoslavia before World War II and nine years in communist jails
after becoming one of the strongest critics of communism.
   He was given back his passport in January 1987, for the first
time since 1969, and began traveling widely, giving lectures.
   Slovenia is Yugoslavia's most developed region and is strongly
influenced by Italy and Austria, on its western and northern
borders.
   In another development Thursday, the arrest of Janez Jansa, an
outspoken journalist and Slovenian youth leader, led to sharp
public criticism in Slovenia.
   Jansa, one of four candidates for president of Slovenia's
official Socialist Youth organization, was arrested on Tuesday in
Ljubljana, a city 62 miles southeast of Maribor, on what police
said was ``suspicion of revealing a military secret.''
   He had published articles in Slovenian youth periodicals
critical of Yugoslav army policies and leaders. He also reported on
alleged plans for a military coup in Solvenia.
   ``We are embittered by Jansa's arrest and we are worried about
the freedom of public speech,'' said a statement released Thursday,
signed by 88 leading Slovenian intellectuals. ``We feel this is an
act of intimidation,''
   Police said earlier that authorities found ``a secret military
document'' in a Ljubljana software company where Jansa works.
   The document allegedly represents the minutes of a top-level
closed Communist Party meeting at which a plan for a possible
military intervention in Slovenia was discussed, Jansa's friends
said.
   They said the same document was published by the Mladina youth
magazine in May, but authorities immediately banned the periodical,
saying it contained state secrets.
   Last month, Slovenian youth publications said the military was
planning a coup in Slovenia and intended to arrest intellectuals,
journalists and others to quell dissent in the republic.
   A communique issued last week by the Presidency of Yugoslavia
denied plans for a military takeover and called the articles a
``slanderous campaign.''
   Bojan Korsika, a journalist friend of Jansa, told The Associated
Press, that Jansa's whereabouts were unknown since and that the
military said he would be allowed only an official army attorney.
   Korsika said several youth organizations around Slovenia have
held meetings protesting Jansa's arrest and demanding his release.

<HEAD>Indian Film Star Raj Kapoor Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film star Raj Kapoor, known as ``the
Charlie Chaplin of India'' for his comedy roles, died Thursday
after a month in the hospital following an asthma attack, state
television reported. He was 64.
   Kapoor was stricken on May 2 during a film awards ceremony at
which he was given India's highest movie honor, the Dada Saheb
Phalke Award. He was already in such weakened physical condition
that Indian President Ramaswami Venkataraman had come down from the
stage to give him the trophy.
   The actor later was carried from the auditorium and hospitalized.
   Kapoor acted in 60 films and produced or directed 18 others over
a career that spanned four decades. Almost all his movies were hits
in India, and he was perhaps the most popular Indian film actor
abroad with followers in the Soviet Union, the Middle East and
China.
   Among his best-known films was ``Awara'' (The Vagabond), in
which he borrowed from Chaplin and played the part with trousers
riding high above his ankles and a perpetual forlorn look on his
face.
   A semi-biographical film, ``Mera Naam Joker'' (My Name is
Joker), filled 25 reels and allowed the audience two intermissions
in its four-hour-plus showing.
   Kapoor's father, the late Prithvi Raj Kapoor, was a stage and
screen actor and three of Kapoor's sons _ Randhir, Rishi and Rajeev
_ are popular actors. Kapoor's two younger brothers, Shammi and
Shashi, also are screen stars.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi issued a statement mourning the
death, calling Kapoor, ``a person who became a legend in his
lifetime.''

<HEAD>British Nationals Convicted in Hawk Killing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury convicted a British
nobleman and two British gamekeepers Thursday of conspiring to kill
protected hawks on a billionaire's game preserve.
   Sir Richard Musgrave, manager of the Albemarle County preserve
of John Kluge, and his gamekeepers, Paul Shardlow and David Amos
were convicted on the misdemeanor conspiracy charge.
   Musgrave, 66, also was convicted on three misdemeanor counts of
aiding and abetting the killing of hawks. Shardlow, 25, also was
convicted on three misdemeanor counts of killing migratory birds
and on one misdemeanor count of possessing a migratory bird. Amos,
20, was convicted only on the conspiracy count.
   The jury deliberated for about 4{ hours in the six-day trial.
   Musgrave faces a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison and a
$20,000 fine. Shardlow could be sentenced to 2{ years in prison and
a $25,000 fine and Amos could receive up to six months in prison
and a $5,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge J. Harry Michael Jr. did not immediately set
a sentencing date. Defense attorneys said they planned to appeal.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Bondurant Jr. said in closing
arguments that the three defendants killed hawks ``from the first
day they stepped on the shoot till the bust.''
   Shardlow's lawyer, Frederick W. Payne, said predators were
killed to protect the imported pheasants and other game birds
stocked for Kluge's guests to hunt.
   Kluge, 73, is chief owner of Metromedia, a telecommunications
and technology holding company. Last fall, Forbes magazine listed
him as the second-richest man in America, putting his worth at $3
billion.
   He and his wife were not charged.
   Payne dismissed the government's key witness, Brian Heath, as a
``ne'er-do-well'' who went to federal authorities in hope of
getting a job as a wildlife law enforcement officer.
   Heath was fired from his job as a gamekeeper at the preserve in
February. Agents of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uncovered
the remains of hundreds of hawks and other animals during a search
of the estate in late March.
   Musgrave, whose Agricultural Sporting Consultants Ltd. ran the
shooting preserve for Kluge, said he assumed his gamekeepers would
shoot hawks to protect the stock of pheasants.
   Musgrave carries the title ``Sir'' because he is a baronet, a
hereditary title in British nobility.
   Heath testified as many as 400 hawks were killed at the
Albemarle Farms preserve over two years. Shardlow and Amos each
admitted killing about two dozen of the birds.

   Howard W. Hunter, 80, was ``set apart'' by church President Ezra
Taft Benson during a meeting of high officials of The Church of

according to a church statement.
   By tradition, the president and most senior member of the Twelve

   Hunter succeeds Marion G. Romney, who died May 20 after a long
illness. Hunter had been acting president of the Twelve since
October 1985 and an apostle since 1959.
   A native of Boise, Idaho, Hunter practiced corporate law in
California until his appointment as an apostle in the 6.5
million-member church.

<TEXT>
   George Bush declared himself a
``refurbished candidate'' on Thursday after a week of rest and
strategy talks but said he won't change his tactics just because
he's trailing in the polls.
   The vice president spoke with reporters at his seaside vacation
home after a Coast Guard safety check of his powerboat.
   ``I've never felt more relaxed, never felt more convinced that
we're on the right track,'' he said. ``And I'm not going to be
stampeded by polls that don't mean anything.''
   Recent public opinion polls have shown Bush trailing Democrat
Michael Dukakis by 10 or more points.
   On another subject, Bush moved slightly away from President
Reagan, stressing more forcefully than Reagan did the U.S.-Soviet
differences on human rights.
   ``I think we have very different views on human rights than the
Soviet Union,'' he said. ``I would suggest that Soviet retaliation
against us, saying we've got human rights problems, is mixing
apples and oranges.''
   ``We've got some problems, but they're not problems of human
rights. I think the Soviet Union should adhere to these high
standards the president is talking about,'' said the vice president.
   But Bush sidestepped questions about Reagan's suggestion that
Soviet bureaucracy, not Kremlin policy, was to blame for delays in
issuing exit visas, or refusing them outright.
   He said he was pleased with the overall outcome of the summit,
saying: ``I don't think anyone expected a significant
breakthrough'' on a new treaty.
   ``When I get back (to Washington) I'll get a much better inside
assessemnt of what went on. But I think, generally speaking, it's
been very positive,'' he said.
   On another subject, Bush said he has ``great respect for the
conservative movement'' and believes he has its support despite a
public disagreement with two of its more outspoken members.
   One day earlier, in a New York Times interview, he had taken aim
at Richard Viguerie, a new right fund-raiser, and Howard Phillips,
chairman of the Conservative Caucus. He said in the interview,
``There's only one or two that polarize, and Viguerie and Howie
Phillips are two of them.''
   ``That's a longstanding feud with two individuals who don't have
any following,'' Bush said Thursday. ``The fact that I have been
constantly attacked by two individuals doesn't have anything to do
with votes. If it did, I wouldn't be the likely nominee of the
Republican Party.''
   Bush clinched the GOP nomination in April.
   The vice president returns to Washington on Friday after an
eight-day sojourn at his vacation retreat, during which he met with
domestic policy and economic advisers and held strategy sessions
with top aides.
   Asked by a reporter if a ``new Bush'' would emerge, he said:
``You're going to see a refurbished candidate because I come here
and I feel good. I get a little bit rested. But you're not going to
see any drastic change in campaign plans.''
   Some Republican consultants have urged Bush to put more distance
between himself and the Reagan administration and to step up his
attacks on Dukakis. But while Bush has moved a little bit in that
direction in recent days, he told reporters: ``We've got a game
plan. We're staying with it. It will be effective.''
   He said he planned to hold most of his fire against Dukakis
until after the Democrats formally nominate their candidate.
   Then, he said, ``you will see me doing much more to put
differences in focus. ... And that will be easy to do because we
fundamentally differ on so many issues.''
   Bush invited reporters to his house to watch his 28-foot
powerboat, ``Fidelity,'' get a safety check from the Coast Guard
auxiliary. It passed.
   He was presented an inspection sticker by John Murray, chief of
staff for the regional Coast Guard Auxiliary, who noted that it was
Safe Boating Week.
   Next, Bush took a group of reporters for a boat ride as the
Coast Guard officials looked on.
   ``Should I make a dramatic exit?'' he asked. He gunned the two
185-horsepower engines on his modified Cigarette racing boat and
turned the boat in a fast circle in the cove next to his dock,
sending up a wall of spray, before rocketing out into the Atlantic
Ocean.
   Was that a safe-boating manuever, Murray, the Coast Guard
inspector, was asked by reporters?
   ``It's his cove,'' Murray responded.
   Bush said that he ``learned a lot'' from economists who had
briefed him on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   He want on to attack Democrats for ``pessimism and negativism''
about the economy.

   France said Thursday it will continue
nuclear tests in the South Pacific and rebuffed a Third World
campaign for nuclear disarmament, saying that fighting poverty and
hunger are just as important.
   France told the U.N. special session on disarmament not to adopt
Utopian declarations on total nuclear disarmament. It called for
realistic measures to reduce conventional arms, especially in
Europe, and a ban on chemical weapons.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told the 159-member General
Assembly it was paradoxical ``to lavish so much effort on
disarmament talks while displaying only resignation and sometimes
even indifference when tragic problems of poverty, hunger and debt
are broached.''
   China's minister of foreign affairs, Qian Quichen, congratulated
the United States and the Soviet Union for recognizing their
special responsibility to reduce their enormous nuclear arsenals,
and on their treaty to scrap medium- and shorter-range nuclear
missiles.
   He called on the superpowers to cut their arsenals further,
while cautioning against false complacency:
   Qian said that ``even if they do cut by half the number of their
nuclear weapons, their nuclear arsenals will still account for
approximately 90 percent of the world's total ... sufficient to
destroy all life on earth many times over.''
   He said ``people should be on guard against an important change
which is taking place in the superpower arms race.'' Even with a
reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, he asked, ``will
qualitative development of more and newer types of armaments make
the world safer and peace more secure?''
   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus called again for
demilitarization of his divided Mediterranean island, saying the
money saved could promote economic development of Turkish Cypriots.
   Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
areas since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, saying it was to
protect the Turkish Cypriot minority after a brief but unsuccessful
coup there fostered by the Greek military government then in power.
   Vassiliou said ``no lasting solution is attainable unless
Turkish occupation forces and settlers are withdrawn from the
island.''
   The special session meets through June 25. The United States and
its Western allies hope for a concrete, modest U.N. document on
disarmament that will not impose on national defense policies and
bilateral disarmament efforts.
   Most of the 12 speakers at the opening session Wednesday issued
sweeping calls for total disarmament, a comprehensive nuclear test
ban and a supervisory, verification and monitoring role for the
United Nations. The United States is mainly opposed to the measures.
   Dumas said Thursday that France will not stop nuclear testing in
the Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific but announced that the
government for the first time would make an annual statement on the
number of tests in the preceding 12 months.
   France refuses to ratify the Rarotonga Treaty instituting a
nuclear-free zone in the region and Dumas reaffirmed that decision.

<TEXT>
   A former Franciscan monk serving an 18- to
20-year prison term here for assault and battery has persuaded
Mother Teresa to visit three of the state's prisons after
corresponding with her for two years.
   Donald Ouimet, 47, will be greeting Mother Teresa when the
77-year-old nun visits three state prisons, including Walpole, on
Saturday. Ouimet said he invited Mother Teresa last year and he
hopes she will spread ``the healing warmth of love'' among the
inmates.
   ``Walpole prison has been recognized as a holding pen for the
lowest of the low,'' said Ouimet at a prison news conference
Thursday afternoon. ``But every now and then a ray of hope shines.
I hope this Saturday a ray of hope will shine when a little nun
from India comes.''
   Walpole inmates will present Mother Teresa with a pen drawing of
her against a background of a comment she once made: ``We are like
a pencil in God's hands, even though the instrument is imperfect,
the writing is beautiful.''
   The unlikely acquaintance of Ouimet and the Nobel Peace Prize
winner began in 1986 when Ouimet, encouraged by a prison chaplain
and a nun in New York City, decided to write to her.
   Since then, he has written to her and has received four letters
from her.
   Ouimet, who grew up in the working-class western Massachusetts
town of Holyoke. After graduating from Sacred Heart High School in
Holyoke, he became a Capuchine Franciscan monk and joined the St.
Pius X Friary in Middletown, Conn., as a lay brother.
   After four years in the monastery, Ouimet left. He said he's
still not sure why he decided to leave.
   ``It was springtime and the birds were singing and I wanted to
live the good life,'' said Ouimet, addressing reporters with the
aplomb of a celebrity accustomed to the spotlight. ``Little did I
know the good life would lead to the good life behind bars.''
   In 1965, a few years after leaving the monastery, Ouimet was
convicted of aggravated assault. He served nine years at Walpole
before his release in 1974, then returned to western Massachusetts
and held odd jobs, mostly as a cook.
   Around 1985, he said, he was arrested for four separate
incidents of aggravated assault. Ouimet said he assaulted both a
man and a woman in the course of the incidents, but he did not
provide any details.
   ``That's not the issue,'' he said. ``What's here and now is the
issue. I have nothing, no life in the streets. My life is in here.''
   Walpole, properly known as the Massachusetts Correctional
Institution-Cedar Junction, is the state's only maximum-security
prison and is known as a tough institution. But Ouimet says he
likes prison life and doesn't want to leave.
   Though he is eligible for parole in 10 years, Ouimet said he
would prefer to stay inside, describing himself as an ``old-time
con, part of the furniture here.'' He said he even likes the food.
   ``I prefer it here, there's security, I don't have to pay rent,
don't have to pay for lights,'' he said. ``I'm comfortable here.''
   Ouimet said he plans to continue his correspondence with Mother
Teresa after her visit, adding that it has ``broadened'' his
outlook. He hopes his fellow inmates will have the same experience
when they meet her Saturday.
   ``We are poor in spirit, poor in emotion and poor in material
possessions but in the eyes of our Father we have a great
dignity,'' he said.

   Riot police in armored vehicles swept onto a
Lima university campus Wednesday and arrested about 100 people
protesting the death of a campus demonstrator, officials said.
   Earlier, police fired buckshot and tear gas to disperse
students, some wearing masks and shouting leftist guerrilla
slogans, who lobbed dynamite sticks at police and burned bonfires
in nearby streets, according to reporters on the scene.
   Demonstration leaders at San Marcos, about four miles west of
downtown, told reporters that six students were wounded by buckshot.
   Police said the Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group
fomented the San Marcos violence, but refused to confirm the
reports of injury.
   Violent demonstrations also erupted at two universities
downtown. Tear gas fired by police wafted through the city during
evening rush hour, forcing thousands of pedestrians to cover their
faces or seek shelter.
   The campus strife, which began Monday to protest the alleged
killing of highland peasants by soldiers and against recent fee
increases, intensified Wednesday, a day after a student was slain.
   Protest supporters charge the student was killed by a tear gas
cannister fired by police. Officials have not confirmed the cause
of the death.
   Demonstrations, held throughout the day, culminated late
Wednesday afternoon as dozens of heavily-armed police, in five
armored vehicles and in vans, rolled into San Marcos, police said.
   Officials said 100 university protesters were arrested, among
them students in the campus cafeteria.
   Television news reports showed footage of police smashing a
life-sized campus statue of Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, the deceased
hero of Cuba's Marxist revolution.
   It was the second time in 16 months that police entered the San
Marcos campus, which the government charges serves as a planning
site for small pockets of leftist guerrillas.
   University campuses in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, are
considered autonomous and traditionally off limits to government
forces.
   A San Marcos police raid in February 1987, during which about
800 students were briefly arrested, sparked intense criticism by
left-wing politicians against the government.

   The state Medicaid program offered free condoms
to its clients for the first time Wednesday, but an unscientific
survey of pharmacies found there were few takers.
   Michigan's Department of Social Services is allowing Medicaid
recipients to receive up to 24 free condoms at a time from
pharmacies in an effort to promote birth control and curb the
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   By early afternoon, the response at Perry's Drug Store in Battle
Creek was ``absolutely zero,'' said Arch Kane, the store's
pharmacist.
   At a Perry's Drug Store in Detroit, five people requested free
condoms by early afternoon. ``Give them a week. Word will spread
quickly,'' said the store's pharmacist, who declined to give his
name.
   The program, approved by the Legislature in December 1987, is
believed to be the first of its kind in the nation and officials
are uncertain how strong demand will be, said Chuck Peller, DSS
spokesman.
   The DSS plans to put a limit on the giveaway when it compiles
statistics on average use, Peller said. Recipients who ask for
condoms must register their Medicaid number to prevent from abusing
the offer, he added.
   Most of the cost of the program should be reimbursed by the
federal government, which pays for 90 percent of the costs of
family planning services, Peller said.
   The state will reimburse drug stores, giving them a 47-cent
profit on each condom, but that isn't as large as the margin on
condom sales, Kane said.
   ``Condoms are the highest gross-margin product in the store,''
Kane said.
   At Snyder's Drug Store in Marquette, there were no takers by
early afternoon, pharmacist Pam Pyle said.
   ``I never notice anyone being hesitant to ask for condoms,''
Pyle said, but she said most of the store's Medicaid patients
already use some type of birth control.

   Israeli human rights activists
accuse their nation's soldiers of systematic brutality in the
occupied lands and say such tactics are prolonging the
six-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   In one case, an Arab resident of this isolated village said
soldiers pelted him with rocks for two hours last month as he sat
handcuffed in a pit. Two hand-sized spots of dried blood were
visible in the pit several days later.
   In another village, Arabs alleged troops forced them to remove
roadblocks as they tried to evacuate a 15-year-old shot by soldiers
in a clash _ intentionally wasting crucial minutes of the boy's
life. The youth died the same day.
   In a third case, a 70-year-old man claimed troops threw him into
a 12-foot-deep well in his garden and closed the lid. The man, who
suffered sprained ankles and a fractured lower back, said he sat in
two feet of cold water for six hours before being rescued.
   The army said initial investigations proved the allegations in
all three cases to be unfounded, adding that soldiers were cleared
of wrong-doing.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Thursday
appointed Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani acting
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces after major military
defeats on land and sea.
   The appointment increased the political power of the man
Iranians call ``the shark.'' Iran's official media, monitored in
Nicosia, reported that Khomeini, who has held the title of
commander-in-chief, gave Rafsanjani ``full authority'' to take over
control of military affairs.
   Rafsanjani's appointment followed a disastrous confrontation

and escorted away a Cypriot freighter apparently suspected of
carrying war-related cargo for Iraq.
   U.S. Navy officials said the guided missile cruiser Vincennes

have caused the first direct confrontation with Iran since April
18. Six Iranian vessels were knocked out that day, including two
sister ships of the frigate involved in Thursday's incident.
   It also was the closest brush since the United States adopted a

<TEXT>
   The first Mormon missionaries to Nigeria and Ghana were greeted
by whole congregations of converts awaiting baptism into a church
that for more than a century had refused to ordain blacks to its
priesthood.
   ``They came to us,'' said former missionary Reed Clegg. ``We
could have baptized thousands. They were living the gospel, paying
tithing, holding meetings, before we arrived.''
   When the late Mormon Church President Spencer W. Kimball ended
the 130-year exclusion of blacks from the church's all-male
priesthood on June 9, 1978, he paved the way for one of the most
extraordinary episodes in the faith's long history of missionary
work.
   Blacks have also converted by the thousands in many
predominantly black Caribbean countries and in Brazil, where many
of the church's 250,000 members claim black ancestors.
   But the story of Mormon growth in Africa stands apart. For
decades, thousands in Nigeria and Ghana who had read Mormon books
and tracts implored the church to send missionaries to baptize
them. But it wasn't until the doctrine forbidding black priests was
abolished that African governments would grant visas to Mormon
missionaries.
   In one year, the first missionaries _ two elderly couples _
baptized nearly 2,000 converts. A decade later, Nigeria has 8,500
church members, Ghana 5,000, with membership growing by about 4,000
a year in the two combined.
   Missionaries returning from African service tell of villagers
walking more than 50 miles round trip to attend church meetings, of
baptismal services lasting for hours to accommodate all the
converts and communities where religion in general was of urgent
concern.
   Church leaders assert they could multiply by many times the rate
of growth in Africa if they wished. But they are moving slowly to
build a solid base of black leadership, and they say the strategy
is paying off.
   In May, visiting officials from Salt Lake City ordained the
first black African stake president, a lay leader who presides over
several congregations, in the Nigerian city of Aba.
   In South Africa, controlled by the apartheid system of racial
separation, the number of black converts is also on the rise.
   The church could not estimate their number because its
membership records do not note race, but blacks attend Sunday
meetings and worship in the Johannesburg Temple alongside whites,
said Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who supervises church activities in
Africa.
   Black Africans are aware of the church's old policy of denying
priesthood membership to blacks, but it appears to have made little
difference to them.
   ``They are not as interested in it as we are. For them, that's
that. They are grateful for (the change), but their eyes are on the
future and they don't seem quite as caught up in it. It's not a big
thing for them,'' said Maxwell.
   Despite the success, prosyletizing in Africa has raised new
challenges to a church long acquainted with missionary work in
far-away places. Among the more difficult is the popular tradition
of polygamy.
   Scores of potential converts have been denied baptism because of
plural marriage, a practice the Mormons themselves once embraced
but officially dropped in 1890 as a prerequisite to statehood for
Utah.
   Rendell Mabey, who led the first missionary contingent, said the
problem arose on a grand scale in a congregation organized years
before the missionaries arrived. When Mabey went to the village to
baptize the people, he learned about half were polygamists.
   The monogamists initially refused to be baptized unless the
others could be as well. But after meeting privately, local leaders
decided that those who were monogamous would be baptized and the
polygamists would continue to attend as non-members.
   A cultural barrier of a different type _ the practice of voodoo
_ confronts missionaries in the West Indies. A folk religion with
African origins, voodoo involves the belief that the dead live in a
spirit world from which they can be recalled to bless or curse the
living. Those who practice it are refused baptism, said David King,
a former Utah congressman who now directs the church's missionary
effort in Haiti.
   But King said adherents usually are not attracted to Mormonism.
   ``I rarely hear it discussed, although I'm aware it is very much
a part of the Haitian culture,'' King said. ``We can hear the
voodoo drums going into the night.''

   Cleeretta Smiley says she's ``free at last''
in the Mormon Church's new Washington, D.C., Second Ward, but her
25-year-old son, a Sunday School teacher, wishes the church had
more appeal for young blacks.
   A decade after the church began admitting blacks to priesthood,
the sole urban Mormon congregation in Washington, which is 70
percent black, is mostly white and struggling to convert and keep
black members.
   Ward leaders could think of only two black families who attend
church together. Most members are singles or couples and few stay
in the ward long. The 400-member congregation is about 40 percent
black, but at a recent Sunday service with 100 people, only about
one-fourth were black.
   Yet officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
say some of the black members, particularly more-recent immigrants,
are faithful members, and they are having a subtle impact on
traditional Mormon services.
   A former Nigerian legislator, Rufus Olumba, teaches in his
native ``agbada'' robes and headdress to a mostly white priesthood
class. The lessons are out of the church manual, but Olumba adds
unique phraseology and experience to Mormon doctrine.
   Mrs. Smiley, the ward's public communications director, has
heard the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. quoted in church.
   ``What this church has given me is such a high level of freedom.
I'm free, I'm free at last in that ward,'' she said, consciously
echoing King's words.
   Mrs. Smiley, whose husband left her and won custody of two of
their four children after she joined the church three years before
the ban on black priests was lifted, said she and other black
Mormons tried for years to get an inner-city ward, which was
finally established in May 1987.
   Before that, the city had been divided like a wagon wheel, with
its wards radiating out into the suburbs along the lines of the
spokes. That scattered the few black members among the suburban
wards.
   Beverly Campbell, a Washington-based church spokeswoman, said
the church earlier avoided having a city ward because it didn't
want the appearance of segregating church members.
   Now, although the gleaming Mormon temple in Kensington, Md., is
a suburban landmark, the city's Mormons have no chapel.
   On Sundays, the church leases part of the National Press Club,
turning the modern downtown center into a not-so-typical Mormon
wardhouse, with bishops conferences in a 13th-floor lounge
overlooking the city, Sunday School classes in rooms named for
famous journalists and sacrament services in a hall where the
nation's newsmakers address the Washington press.
   Campbell acknowledged the church faces a challenge in attracting
black Americans.
   ``The gospel is ever true and ever the same. It does not
change,'' she said. ``And yet, the people of other cultures must
feel a spiritual and emotional binding with the spiritual message.
That is sometimes missing.''
   But in a church that now prides itself in attracting all races
and nationalities, there aren't enough active black members to
raise the issue of segregation.
   Mrs. Smiley's son Robert said the church has little appeal to
inner-city blacks, who still view it as a white, racist institution.
   ``The church has the basic principles,'' he said, ``but it has
to change with the times.'' A graduate in industrial technology, he
said one of his major complaints about the church is the dullness
of its music.
   At a recent service, the congregation sang several traditional,
slow Mormon hymns _ a sharp contrast to the lively gospel music of
Washington's predominantly black Protestant churches.
   A member of the bishopric, Mark Sykes, said he knew of no
incidents of racial prejudice among Mormons in the area but pointed
to other problems.
   Church members assigned to make monthly visits to members' homes
have been mugged in tough inner-city neighborhoods, he said.
   Ward leaders try hard to make black members more active in the
congregation and to make them leaders, he said, but many are from
homes where they are the only Mormons. They face pressure to leave
the church from their families and friends and from actively
anti-Mormon Protestant ministers, he said.
   Sykes, a 26-year-old financial analyst with the Marriott Corp.,
said he believes full acceptance of the church by blacks may have
to come with the generation who are now children.
   ``The children ... should be able to reconcile their black
heritage and their Mormon heritage,'' he said. ``Maybe only then
can there be a happy marriage of Mormonism and the black American.''

   The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal
against back taxes and penalties by the Church of Scientology,
leaving in place the 1967 revocation of its tax exemption.
   The high court declined to review lower court decisions
penalizing the group for tax deficiencies in 1970, 1971 and 1972,
holding that large amounts of its monies claimed as tax-exempt went
for private enrichment of Scientology's late founder L. Ron Hubbard
and his wife, Mary Sue Hubbard.
   The U.S. Tax Court had ruled that $3.5 million was deposited in
Swiss banks through a bogus trust in those years, much of it later
removed to a safe on a yacht, Apollo, on which the Hubbards had
taken up residence in the Mediterranean. He died in 1986.
   However, the group continues to function, pressing lawsuits
claiming its ``E-meter'' auditing is religious and exempt from
taxes levied against its income.

<HEAD>Town Survives On Planning, Good Fortune after 1,000-Job Pullout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN KUSMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENCASTLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen months ago when IBM suddenly
shut down its Greencastle operation and took away nearly 1,000
jobs, it left behind a lot of ``ducks,'' local merchant Barbara
Lane likes to say. ``Very calm on the surface, but paddling
furiously underneath.''
   That's how she describes the approach this quiet college town
has taken from the day of IBM's bad news _ using careful planning,
good fortune and hard work to bring in six new employers and 1,000
replacement jobs in the short term, as many as 2,000 five years
from now.
   Long before International Business Machines Corp. said it would
close its parts distribution center after 33 years, Greencastle had
laid the foundation to deal with the shock of losing 8 percent of
the jobs in Putnam County.
   IBM made the announcement without warning Nov. 11, 1986, and by
the following March, about half of the employees had transferred to
other sites, the rest had taken early retirement.
   ``The fact that IBM closed could have been devastating. It
wasn't,'' said banker Bill Marley. ``The framework was there, we
were ready to go.''
   In 1983 an economic development review had identified the
strengths and weaknesses of the town of 8,400; the importance, for
example, of revitalizing the courthouse square, which had just been
designated a national historic district. A needed hotel, the Walden
Inn, was planned for the edge of the DePauw University campus.
   Two years later a planning group examined the town's economic
future, leading to the incorporation of the Greencastle Development
Center in September 1986.
   ``We were fortunate this community had started planning for the
future three years ahead of time,'' said Bob Hutchings, chairman of
the mayor's economic development commission.
   Despite an initial dark mood in town, residents projected only
optimism to reporters who came to record the changes Greencastle
was going through.
   ``Everytime any media came around, the word would get around and
the cheerleading would begin. I think that's what won all the
industry,'' said Ms. Lane, who chairs the group that has led the
rehabilitation of the Victorian buildings along the courthouse
square.
   Charles Preston, who helps the state recruit new industry
through the Indiana Department of Commerce, said, ``I think they
benefited from a lot of exposure when IBM left and the legacy IBM
left.''
   No one has a harsh word for IBM. The company gave $1.7 million
to local government to smooth the transition of its loss and
continued its United Way contribution of more than $120,000 for
three years. It also turned over $700,000 from the sale of ``Big
Blue,'' its 350,000-square-foot complex.
   Just as importantly, IBM bought the more than 300 homes being
sold by transferred employees and hired Merrill Lynch to market
them. Fewer than 10 remain unsold.
   Fortunate timing helped Greencastle. Just days before the IBM
announcement, bonds were sold for a $13 million expansion of the
high school and construction of the middle school. A week later and
the bonds might not have been sold. They've made the schools more
attractive to companies scouting new locations.
   A day before the announcement, scouts for Automotive Industries,
which produces auto trim, had been in the area discussing possible
locations. A few days afterward, they were inspecting the IBM site.
   That January, just 72 days after IBM's announcement, Automotive
Industries became the first new industry to come to Greencastle in
15 years. It built a plant under the Shenandoah Industries name
that might employ as many 700 workers in five years.
   ``It was the boost we needed. It was a confirmation to our
optimism,'' said Joyce Hanlon, president of the Greencastle
Merchants Association.
   Banker Dan Doan recalled the time he and others were in his
office after midnight negotiating with an officer from Charming
Shoppes in Pennsylvania on one phone and one from Shigeru K.K. in
Japan on another.
   Charming will move into ``Big Blue'' and employ 300 by early
next year in a warehouse for its women's fashion outlets. More than
600 eventually might work there.
   Shigeru, which like Shenandoah will supply auto trim to Japanese
auto plants being built in the Midwest, will employ 100 in a
company called Heartland Automotive Inc. by the end of next year.
   Three other companies _ two automobile parts suppliers and
Sherwin-Williams, which is setting up a distributing center for
automotive paint _ also are developing facilities in an industrial
park where once only IBM stood.
   The new companies, however, won't replace IBM's payroll, which
was $38 million, or roughly $38,000 per year per employee. Bill
Andis, IBM's former head of strategic planning who took early
retirement to run the development center, said new employers will
create an initial payroll of about $20 million. He and other
retirees will bring in an additional $9 million in income.
   Al Carney, a local car dealer, said IBM people represented sales
of at least a car per day for him. After IBM left, his volume has
dropped from more than 80 cars per month to about 20. He laid off
19 of his 45 employees.
   The Rev. Alan Barber, pastor of the Peace Lutheran Church, said
IBM's departure meant losing a fifth of his congregation of 216,
plus 31 percent of the donations. But now his congregation is back
over 200 again.
   ``The Lord was very gracious with us,'' Barber said.
   Mayor Mike Harmless, a 38-year-old Greencastle native elected
last November, points out the new industry will create entry-level
jobs for local high-school graduates. But until all the companies
get going, he acknowledges, ``these are going to be lean years for
the community.''

   Professional surfer Rell Kapoliokaehukai Sunn
figured she and her dog, Shane, had the ``Wet Pet'' division of a
recent surfing contest all wrapped up. Then the pig with the
sunscreen showed up.
   Brian Keaulana, another pro surfer, and his 4-month-old pig
``Chop Chop'' sent the 2,000 spectators and five judges at Makaha
Beach on Leeward Oahu hog wild, beating a dozen other human
competitors who rode their boards tandem with everything from a
baby goose to saltwater fish in a bowl.
   ``Shane is the surfing dog of Makaha, the kids love him,'' Sunn
said of her 2-year-old mutt. ``But Brian really did some moves on
the board with that pig, Chop Chop. Shane just sort of sits there.''
   But Sunn, who is 37 and works as a lifeguard, said winning was
not important. She was happy that the first ``Wet Pet'' contest,
part of the 11th Annual Rell Sunn Menehune Surfing Championships,
was a hit.
   ``The kids out there were going crazy. Everybody just loved
it,'' she said.
   Not everybody.
   The Hawaiian Humane Society received numerous phone calls
protesting the event and wants to prevent similar contests in the
future, according to Bob Spencer, public relations and fund
development director.
   The society is not impressed by surfing animals.
   ``We are against putting animals in unnatural or dangerous
situations,'' Spencer said. ``And there is nothing more unnatural
than a pig on a surfboard.''
   Further, Spencer said, delicate pink pig skin is prone to
sunburn, and not all owners are as considerate at Keaulana, who
covered Chop Chop's ears and snout with multicolored zinc oxide.
   ``People thought the pig was in distress because it was green,''
Spencer said. ``They didn't know it was covered with colored suntan
lotion.''
   Sunn's ``Wet Pet'' contest is the first one Spencer has heard of
in the islands, but he's worried the idea might catch on.
   ``It might look fun, but whose entertainment is it?'' he asked.
``It's certainly not entertaining or fun for the animals.''
   Sunn disagreed, but acknowledged Spencer had a point.
   ``Shane loves being in the water. He loves to surf and he loves
the attention,'' she said. ``But some animals might not like it,
and their owners shouldn't push them just to show off.''
   Sunn said she refused to let one inexperienced surfer enter the
``Wet Pet'' competition after she saw the woman practicing with her
dog.
   ``She wiped out and had attached the dog's leash to the board so
it really got knocked around in the waves. That dog could have
drowned or broken its neck,'' Sunn said.
   Spencer said the Humane Society ``isn't declaring war on these
people, we just want to educate them,'' noting that animals are
prohibited on state beaches, and that regulation could be more
strictly enforced.
   Sunn said she plans to hold the competition again next year, but
will regulate who can enter.
   ``We're only going to have people who we know surf with their
animals, who we've seen out before,'' she said. Meanwhile, she says
she'll keep surfing with Shane.
   ``He loves it and I don't think anybody should tell me what to
do with my dog,'' she said. ``I don't force him. I just put the
board on the beach, he jumps on the nose and we paddle out
together.''
   ``I only take him out in gentle surf. He likes small waves,
nothing bigger than 5 feet.''
   Rob Burns agreed: ``You know how certain dogs really like to
hang their heads out of car windows? Well, it's like that, some
pets just really take to the waves.''
   Burns owns Local Motion, a Honolulu-based water sports equipment
and clothing store with nationwide distribution, which sponsored a
surfing contest in the waves off Waikiki on Memorial Day and wanted
to include a ``Wet Pet'' division this year.
   ``I've heard of pigs out in Waianae that bodysurf all by
themselves and one gal has a pet rabbit that follows her to the
beach,'' he said.
   But after talking it over with the Humane Society, Burns
scrapped his plan.
   ``They let us know they were against it and that is was illegal
to have animals on the beach,'' Burns said. ``It looked like it was
going to cause a big stink, when it was supposed to be all in fun,
so we just decided to drop it.''
   Burns ``was very sensible about it and understood our point of
view,'' said Spencer. ``Some people aren't so sensible. Those are
the ones we're worried about.''

   Garrison Keillor's ``A Prairie Home Companion:
The Second Annual Farewell Performance'' comes to cable viewers
Saturday from that most cosmopolitan of places, Radio City Music
Hall.
   The setting is symbolic of Keillor's new life in New York. After
13 years of radio shows, several television appearances and two
best-sellers filled with wry tales from the quintessential small
Midwestern town, Keillor said in a recent interview that Lake
Wobegon, as well as real-life Minnesota, had become part of the
past.
   Keillor ended the radio show last year with a farewell
performance in St. Paul, then left his life-long home to move to
Denmark with his Danish wife. But he soon wearied of being a
stranger in a strange land and returned to the United States, this
time to New York.
   ``Lake Wobegon is really my childhood and it does not, it isn't,
perhaps I'm supposed to walk away from it at some point and leave
it,'' Keillor said somewhat sadly over Italian food near his
Chelsea apartment. ``I went back to Minnesota. I've been back twice
since I left there last fall, and realized both times that ... it's
not my home. Strange feeling. Not pleasant.''
   Though his Saturday evening public radio show was popular, fame
really descended upon Keillor after publication of his 1985
best-seller, ``Lake Wobegon Days.'' In New York, he said, ``I think
that our life is, if anything, more domestic than it was in St.
Paul, and much quieter and much more private. Some people might go
to the Midwest for peace and stability, but life in St. Paul and in
the Midwest was crazy, and life in New York is eminently sane.''
   Saturday's broadcast, after two non-broadcast performances, will
be available on a number of cable systems offering a free sample of
The Disney Channel. The performance will also be carried live on
American Public Radio. Keillor's guests include Chet Atkins, Leo
Kottke, Butch Thompson and the Everly Brothers.
   Leaving Lake Wobegon doesn't mean an end to the folksy stories
and dry wit that have made Keillor famous. They'll just move to
Manhattan.
   ``There are a lot of people like me in New York,'' Keillor said.
``Midwestern people, church-going people, not that I set
church-going people aside as a separate class, but white, sort of
unremarkably liberal, ordinary people who enjoy all of the
fascinations and foreignness of the city and the excitement without
themselves being changed so much. ... I think I could talk about
those people in New York.''
   Such adventures might turn up on radio in the not-too-distant
future, Keillor said.
   ``I think that I owe myself two years' sabbatical, and it's half
up. But I really feel that, (since) I did the show for 13 years at
the biblical rate of one per seven, I'm entitled to a year and 10
months or something. Then I could decide on it. But New York is our
home for as far ahead as I can see.''
   More television is also likely. There have been network people
``who want to have lunch sometime,'' he said. Meanwhile, Keillor
writes for The New Yorker magazine and is working on a movie script
at the urging of director Sydney Pollack. His books, ``Lake Wobegon
Days'' and ``Leaving Home: A Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories,''
both became best-sellers.
   Although in appearances on public television and previously on
The Disney Channel, Keillor proved himself a natural for
television, he says he hasn't gotten used to seeing himself on the
small screen.
   ``If I had guests, they'd sometimes turn it on, and I'd stand
and watch part of it, but when I came on the screen I always felt
unbearable and went and cooked something,'' he said.
   Perhaps inspired by his recent appearance in the gala honoring
Irving Berlin on his 100th birthday, Keillor's Radio City Music
Hall performance will feature a production-number monologue
involving the rotating stage.
   While Keillor is lifted, lowered and turned around, the radio
audience is to be none the wiser.
   ``I'll be talking about something all this time that doesn't
have anything to do with the house, the stage, television,''
Keillor said. ``I was hoping to disappear, as an illusion trick. I
didn't know quite how to do that on radio.''

   Avant-garde artists armed with video cameras
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art
designed to draw the viewer into the picture.
   ``People are captivated by this art form,'' said video artist
Mary Lucier. ``It screens out distractions. It draws you into a
completely new and different world. In that sense, it's kind of
like going to the movies.''
   A new exhibit, ``American Landscape Video: The Electronic
Grove,'' features work done in the past decade by seven leading
video artists, including Lucier.
   The show, on display through July 10 at Pittsburgh's Carnegie
Museum of Art, features bright moving images that appear on video
monitors illuminating darkened rooms.
   The videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds
call, a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging
amid crackles and pops. Eerie music plays as the camera peers up
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water.
   The artists placed rocks, trees and other objects around the
video monitors, which have screens up to 25 inches wide. In one
work, viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own
images in the still water of a reflecting pool. In another, a coil
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream.
   ``Each space creates its own environment,'' Lucier says. ``The
impact, I think, is greater than sculpture. There is the sound as
well as moving images and three dimensional objects.''
   Many people resist the concept of video art, assuming viewing it
would be like watching television, but they usually like the works
once they see them, said Bill Judson, film curator at the Carnegie.
   ``People come in and they see this and they say, `My God, I love
that,''' he said. ``They're astonished in themselves.''
   Video art began in the mid-1960s, when advances in technology
made black and white film equipment more affordable. In the early
'70s, museums began showing elaborate video displays, and some
artists used color computer-generated images in their work.
   In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney
Museum of American Art have displayed video works, but many smaller
museums can't afford the high cost of building the exhibits, Judson
said.
   ``There's a lot of great work being done, but it's just not
getting exposure,'' he said.
   In Lucier's ``Wilderness,'' three videotapes are shown
simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals. She
filmed the same sites depicted by 19th century American landscape
artists such as Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, showing gleaming
icebergs against a backdrop of clear sky.
   One work, ``Room for St. John on the Cross,'' has a gyrating
image of mountain tops projected on a large screen. In the center
of the room is a small cube with light streaming from a single
window. A voice reciting in Spanish can be heard, and a
white-capped mountain is shown on a small video monitor inside the
cube.
   Artist Bill Viola said the work is based on a Spanish mystic who
wrote love poetry and dreamed of flying over mountains despite
being confined and tortured for nine months in a cell.
   Doug Hall's ``The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described,''
features six monitors and a large screen that show a roaring fire,
tornadoes whirling and storms at sea. Within the gallery, a steel
fence encloses the coil that fires an electrical discharge at two
oversized, stainless steel high-backed chairs.
   In ``The Allure of the Concentric'' by Rita Myers, four monitors
amid large volcanic rocks show closeup views of leaves and weeds,
dry cracked ground and the silhouette of stark tree trunks against
sky.
   Frank Gillette placed eight eye-level monitors in a square,
showing reeds in a marsh, birds flying and other wildlife in the
wilderness north of Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Around the corner, the viewer stands in the center of a ring of
eight monitors showing natural and colorized images that Steina
Vasulka created of New Mexican mountains and the desert.
   In Dara Birnbaum's ``Will-O'-The Wisp,'' three monitors placed
in a panel show a woman amidst trees as a woman's voice speaks
about a former lover.

<HEAD>Old Stars Are a Refreshing Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's hobnobbed with Errol Flynn, Rita
Hayworth, Jack Benny and Bette Davis, and touted the talents of a
budding actor named Ronald Reagan.
   But Irving Fein counts as his greatest coup resurrecting the
career of an 80-year-old out-of-work comic named George Burns.
   ``I've been lucky,'' Fein said during a recent interview at
Caesars Palace, where Burns, his longtime friend and client, was
appearing. ``I've been able to work with the best of them. And I've
been in a position to turn away the tough ones who spell trouble.''
   Fein recites a long list of famous stars he's promoted since he
entered the publicity field via a short story contest at the
University of Wisconsin more than half a century ago. The names
include Flynn, Hayworth, Benny, Davis, Burns, Reagan, Edgar Bergen
and Gracie Allen.
   He says working with those great names of another era is a
different world from today's stars, many of whom have egos to match
stratosphere salaries.
   ``These young kids, making $5 million a year, they think they're
giants and suddenly they're monsters,'' Fein said. ``Some of these
young stars are impossible, with 18 hangers-on, managers, agents,
etc.
   ``I've been very lucky. George is very easy to deal with; he's a
professional. You get ready to go to the plane and he's half an
hour early. He gets to the dressing room an hour or hour and a half
before the opening act.
   ``Jack (Benny) was the same way. He was always ready. I'd pick
him up to go to the airport and he'd be waiting out in front of his
house with his bags.
   ``Some of these new stars are terrible,'' Fein said. ``You pull
up and they're still sleeping. You make the plane just as the doors
are closing.''
   What makes the difference?
   ``Jack and George were old pros,'' he said. ``They came up the
hard way, started small time in vaudeville, had tough breaks, tough
jobs.''
   Fein remembers another era, as a publicity executive at Warner
Bros., when it was easier to work with stars.
   ``At Warners we'd hire 20 young people a year, sign them up at
$75 a week,'' he recalled. ``Hayworth, (Ann) Sheridan, they all
started that way. They had six-month options. Their salaries would
jump from $75 a week to $100, then $125, $150. Those young kids
were so eager, so cooperative. They'd do anything to work with you.
They used to plead with us to do that publicity stuff.''
   Fein was Benny's manager in 1974 when the famous comic
contracted cancer. Fein had landed Benny the lead role in ``The
Sunshine Boys'' with Walter Matthau.
   Benny died Dec. 26, 1974, at the age of 80. Fein had worked with
Benny 27 years, winning an Emmy for production work on his show. In
the last decade of Benny's life, it was Fein who produced his TV
specials and set up benefit concerts that took the two across the
country and around the world. Fein was left with some poignant
memories.
   ``He was such a vibrant guy _ warm, sweet, honest, decent.''
   Fein said he came up with Burns _ Benny's best friend _ as the
replacement for the ``Sunshine'' role. Burns won an Academy Award
for his performance and his second career _ at age 80 _ was off and
rolling. Today Burns is the author of several books, performs
regularly at Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe, has starred in
several movies and has been the host of several TV specials.
   It was a different story in 1974.
   ``George's career had gone way down since Gracie (Allen) died in
1964,'' Fein recalled. ``He worked very little. Once in a while he
would do spots for us (Jack Benny's TV show). George was very
unhappy.''
   When Fein learned Benny was dying, he told the film's producers
Burns could fill the void.
   ``Every star was after that job,'' Fein recalled. ``Danny Kaye,
Milton Berle, Danny Thomas, Art Carney, Jack Albertson, Sid Caesar,
a million people were after that job. But I got it for George.''
   After ``Sunshine Boys'' was completed, Fein booked Burns in
London, then Carnegie Hall in New York.
   In the past 14 years with Burns, Fein has produced several
movies starring his friend (``You and Me Kid,'' ``Oh God, You
Devil,'' ``18 Again'') and is working on ``Oh God IV.''
   He has written the book, ``Jack Benny _ An Intimate Biography,''
and worked with Burns on books such as ``Living It Up _ Will They
Still Love Me in Altoona,'' and the upcoming book, ``Gracie _ A
Love Story,'' which is due out in October.
   Fein planned to be a lawyer when he went to the University of
Wisconsin. But he won a short story contest, which landed him a job
in the publicity department at Warners. He worked 18 hour days to
continue his PR job and earn a law degree. His first love remained
the stars he promoted.
   After getting dozens of stars tons of ink, he's focusing today
only on Burns.
   And he hasn't lost the knack of answering _ or avoiding a
question.
   How old is he?
   ``Early 70s,'' Fein says.
   ``How early?''
   ``Just early,'' he grins.

<HEAD>Christians Flock To Atheist Land To Salute Faith</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By some odd twists of place and history, church
leaders of the world converge next week in a land of official
atheism to celebrate the original flowering there of Christianity.
   It's a peculiar combination. In the seemingly incompatible
setting of the Soviet Union, whose government disavows existence of
God, an enduring faith marks its 1,000th birthday.
   Taking part there in June 5-16 celebrations are prominent church
figures from many countries, ranging from top Vatican officers to
evangelist Billy Graham to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
   To a curious extent, the occasion brings together chieftains of
belief in a climate against it, where the Communist government's
efforts to stamp it out have gone on for 70 years.
   But signs of change circulated and the Rev. Bruce Rigdon, a
Presbyterian scholar of Chicago and specialist on Soviet church
life, says ``all kinds of amazing things are happening'' to improve
religious conditions.
   ``We want to show our solidarity with churches there, to express
our hopes for them and let the government know that they're not
isolated and alone but part of a worldwide community that holds
them in esteem and cares for them.''
   The Rev. John Wilkes of the Baptist World Alliance in
Washington, also among those attending, says, ``This worldwide
gathering can be helpful in overcoming barriers to Christianity and
making it better understood.''
   The affair comes at a time of moderations in Soviet domestic
policies, including opening of additional churches, large-scale
printing and importing of Bibles and promised easing of religious
restrictions.
   Some even see latent religious potentialities in Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, reportedly raised in a Russian Orthodox family
and who says laws are being revised to recognize religious concerns.
   ``We are praying that he will become a Christian and, if
possible, a Methodist,'' the Rev. Olay Parnaments, a Methodist
pastor in Soviet Estonia told the United Methodist general
conference in St. Louis in May.
   Gorbachev in April met with Patriarch Pimen in the Kremlin and
called for more tolerant attitudes toward religion, the first such
meeting between top church and government leaders in 40 years.
   Bishop Clement, U.S. representative of Russian Orthodoxy, says
about 450 foreign church leaders are attending the celebrations
there, including about 60 from the United States.
   Roman Cathoilicism is sending a high-level, 10-member
delegation, headed by the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal
Agostino Casaroli, the pope's top aide.
   He and Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, leader of the
world-wide Anglican communion, including U.S. Episcopalians, are
among speakers for special ``Jubilee'' ceremonies June 10 at
Resurrection Church of the newly restored St. Daniel Monastery in
Moscow.
   Other speakers at that time are to include Graham and Rabbi
Arthur Schneier of New York, president of the interfaith Appeal of
Conscience Foundation, which works internationally to promote
religious freedom.
   Pope John Paul II issued a pastoral letter on the rise and
endurance of Christianity in the Soviet Union, expressing hopes for
`` full communion in Christ with these sister churches.''
   The Lutheran World Federation hailed the Russian church for its
creative influence in the country's history.
   Among American church leaders attending:
   The Rev. Avery Post, president of the United Church of Christ;
the Rev. Arie Brouwer, chief executive of the National Council of
Churches; Metropolitan Theodosius, head of the Orthodox Church in
America; Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York; the
Rev. Joe Hale, general secretary of the World Methodist Conference;
Bishop Herbert Chilstrom, head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America; Episcopal Bishop David Reed of Louisville, Ky.;
Presbyterian William P. Thompson of the World Conference on
Religion and Peace; Neal Wilson, president of Seventh-day
Adventists, and the Rev. Donald Miller, general secretary of the
Church of the Brethren.
   The 10-day celebration starts with all-night vigils at Moscow
churches, followed the next day, June 5, by a liturgy at the
Patriarchal Cathedral of the Epiphany led by Patriarch Pimen.
   Russian Orthodoxy holds a council June 6-9 at the nearby
theological center at Zagorsk, with various intervening events at
theaters and churches prior to the ``Jubilee'' ceremonies June l0.
   Another all-night vigil was set June ll at Moscow churches.
   Other special services commemorating saints, and recognizing
some new ones, were set for June 12 in Trinity Cathedral, with a
reception afterward, hosted by Pimen and other Orthodox prelates.
   On following days, and also interspersing previous events,
visits were to be made to churches in other cities, including
Leningrad, Kiev and Vladimir.
   It was in A.D. 988 that Prince Vladimir, newly converted to
Christianity, got the pagan subjects of his principality then known
as Kievan Rus to join in a mass baptism of thousands in the Dnieper
river at Kiev.
   The faith penetrated a people and a culture, and despite
hardships it has encountered, the imprint remains.

<HEAD>Prepared for Earthquake, He Orchestrated Recovery from High-Rise
Fire</HEAD>

   Cole Emerson has known for two years that
when the big earthquake hits California, it will be his job to get
First Interstate Bank back into business.
   When the city's worst high-rise fire swept the bank's
headquarters last month, Emerson saw his disaster plans put to the
test, and by all accounts, they passed.
   The inferno broke out at 10:30 p.m. May 4, gutting 4{ floors of
the 62-story building, killing one maintenance man and closing the
state's tallest building for an indefinite time.
   But by the start of banking hours the next day, the vital
business of the First Interstate Bancorp, the nation's
ninth-biggest bank holding company, was proceeding. And only one of
the company's 320 California branches was closed _ the one on the
building's ground floor.
   ``Because of the planning process, because of the group of
people that was there, the team, and our instant communications
with our customers, we didn't miss a beat,'' said Emerson, the
bank's vice president for information management.
   Emerson, 42, is in charge of contingency planning and computer
security. He is assigned to the First Interstate Bank of
California, although in the headquarters fire, his plan and staff
also helped restart the parent company, which owns banks in 13
states and franchises in 10 others.
   A former criminal investigator for the Internal Revenue Service,
Emerson moved into corporate security in 1977. He began his tenure
at First Interstate in 1986 after stints with various other firms
including Bank of Boston Corp. and Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.
   His straightforward, almost deadpan description of First
Interstate's recovery from the fire is typical of his lawman's
approach to the task of disaster planning.
   He recalled that shortly after the fire broke out, his
five-member ``business resumption group'' and a parallel group that
deals with staff safety opened the bank's new emergency center,
which is in a computer operations building seven blocks from the
downtown headquarters.
   As damage reports came in, Emerson's group orchestrated moves
for the vital groups that work in the headquarters:
   _They saw the securities trading department dispersed, with
traders flying to company offices in Hong Kong and New York, as
well as taking borrowed space in town. They were prepared, since
the disaster plan calls for traders and a few other key employees
to carry home diskettes bearing vital records from their personal
computers.
   _They arranged the rental of hundreds of telephones, switched
numbers and lines, and organized the flow of 125,000 incoming and
8,000 outgoing pieces of mail each day.
   _As the week wore on, they found office space for 1,500
displaced workers in First Interstate buildings and branches
throughout Southern California and in offices rented or borrowed on
short notice.
   The main computers handling the bank's daily rush of consumer
and business transactions weren't in the headquarters, but if they
had been knocked out, they would have been backed up in Northern
California, Emerson noted.
   ``Those in banking that were aware of First Interstate's
(disaster) plan said that it was among the best in the industry,''
said Nancy Sheppard, spokeswoman for the California Bankers
Association.
   ``Cole is a very well-organized person, a very non-excitable
type person,'' said Ed Pistey, a co-worker in charge of the bank's
physical security. ``That's something that's very important in any
crisis ... And if your planning has gone well, that's something
that's not all facade.''
   J.J. Pinola, chairman of the holding company, credits planners
with foreseeing the necessary moves, but, like Emerson, praises the
employees who made the plans work and continue to work in sometimes
cramped quarters.
   ``I think the heroes are there,'' Pinola said, ``(but) in this
case every single member of the organization feels good about their
part in getting us out of this mess.''
   The disaster plan actually was developed to deal with a great
earthquake. The state Office of Emergency Services say odds are
better than 50 percent that such a quake will hit the region in the
next 25 years.
   ``An earthquake is real, and it's catastrophic, and it's going
to happen,'' Emerson said. ``There's nobody in my position in any
of the banks who's going to say `if.' It's always `when it's going
to happen.' I feel even more confident right now that we're well on
the way to being prepared for that.''
   In Emerson's office, a hardhat hangs from the coatrack and a
portable telephone sits on a chair. The view out the window is of a
white circus tent pitched to shelter hundreds of cardboard cartons
holding business documents and personal belongings salvaged from
the building.
   Preliminary engineering reports indicate the building will be
safe to reoccupy, but Pinola says estimates of when are guesses at
best. An electrical fault is believed to have caused the fire, but
the investigation isn't complete. There still isn't a firm dollar
estimate of the damage.
   For Emerson and his team, the recovery is both a victory and a
base on which to build.
   ``It's funny, it's almost addictive _ planning alternates,''
Emerson said. ``Even planning a trip you find yourself saying, `If
I can't go this way and catch this plane at this schedule, then I
have this back-up.' It just becomes a normal part of your
thinking.''

<HEAD>Capitalism Visits Communism for Superpower Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Cajun food to cable television, the
journalists, Kremlinologists, presidential aides and party
functionaries involved in the Moscow summit got a glimpse of
capitalism in the core of communist power.
   While the summit was short on substance, it broke down some of
the stereotypes the two leaders had on life in the other
superpower, stirring up a ``feel-good'' atmosphere that was visible
on the streets and sidewalks of this infamously grim city.
   Media madness and commercial hype are unfamiliar experiences in
Moscow, and for the most part Soviet citizens were excluded from
the fray that unfolded at the summit media center. Roadblocks set
up a half-mile from the site at the International Hotel steered
away all without special passes.
   But for the Westerners in town for the meetings between Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan, a few touches of
home made their stay more comfortable and in conformance with
similar events held abroad.
   The island of consumerism established at the hotel, known as the
``Mezh'' among the foreign community here, drew dozens of prominent
Soviet pundits and politicians.
   Instant coffee and caviar sandwiches were sold from linen-spread
tables in the Congress Hall, alongside kiosks selling Gorbachev's
book ``Perestroika'' and stacks of Moscow postcards.
   Officials in the vanguard of the glasnost and perestroika
campaigns milled around the cavernous press room, where many of the
5,000 journalists covering the event set up telephones, typewriters
and portable computers. They gave impromptu interviews, surveyed
the souvenirs and watched the live Cable News Network feed on huge
television monitors set up throughout the center.
   The White House press center issued texts of the president's
speeches and comments, and the Soviet Foreign Ministry responded
with summit briefing packets and a desk that took applications for
private interviews with Soviet officials.
   CNN beamed its 24-hour service into central Moscow for the
summit, but only foreign-made televisions like those at the Mezh
were able to tune in the American programming.
   A mobile pizza van brought in to Moscow two months ago parked
along the Moscow River embankment across from the hotel and did a
whopping business with the busy journalists.
   A Louisiana chef, John Folse, shipped his Cajun cooking
operation _ lock, stock and catfish _ to Moscow for the summit,
taking over the Mercury restaurant at the Mezh in a weeklong
joint-venture that hit some snags. The restaurant gave out free
hamburgers and fries to the working press as a means of eating up
some of its profits that could not be taken out of the country.
   Rival T-shirt and souvenir kiosks sprung up at the press center,
dispensing ``Moscow Summit-88'' memorabilia for hard currency. Even
the official Tass news agency got in on the act, producing shirts,
buttons, records and tapes with the help of an American marketing
firm.
   Summit spinoffs that reached the general public were at times
more hindrance than help. Roadblocks were set up at intersections
leading to all summit sights _ the press center, the American
ambassador's residence where the Reagans stayed and along motorcade
routes. The traffic diversions frustrated some Soviets trying to
get to home or work in areas around the president's path.
   But the spruced-up city and the excitement of a visit by the
American president who once called the Soviet Union an ``evil
empire'' made Muscovites proud and brought them out in droves for
walks about the summit showcase.
   American and Soviet flags stemmed from light poles along the
motorcade routes and Red Square, with its famous and garish
landmarks, was floodlit throughout the summit for the benefit of
American television viewers who saw the historic setting as the
backdrop on evening news programs.
   The Arbat pedestrian mall, always thronged with street artists
and strollers, took on a more political focus with murals depicting
abstract concepts of superpower relations and buttons commemorating
the five-day event.
   But almost simultaneously with the takeoff of the presidential
plane, the barriers came down and the power plugs were pulled.
   Some summit preparations may have longer term effects, like the
frenetic painting and repaving done before the event. But for most
Muscovites, the signs of the superpower conference were a memory
before Reagan's plane crossed out of Soviet airspace.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In an affluent town on the Connecticut River, a
new subdivision features antique homes that have been dismantled,
rebuilt, and equipped with today's conveniences, such as burglar
alarms and air conditioning. The price tag: $800,000 to $1.2
million.

   An 18th century tavern with trees sprouting
through the floorboards seemed destined to be razed in a
firefighting drill until it was rescued by a couple of Connecticut
developers who look to the past to find fancy homes for the future.
   Now it will be restored, with modern conveniences added, and
become one of the dozen or so antique homes in an unusual 33-acre
subdivision in this affluent town on the Connecticut River.
   Developers Harry P. Broom Jr. and William Oberg are scouring the
countryside for other vintage homes for the subdivision they call
Sterling Meadows. The homes, when finished, will carry a modern
price tag of $800,000 to $1.2 million. Broom and Oberg say they
haven't tried to sell any yet.
   The former owner of the old tavern, they said, sold it to them
rather than to the Salem fire department, which was going to burn
it down for a firefighting drill.
   ``The problem is most old houses are accidents of geography,''
says Oberg, 32, of Essex, who left a career in finance more than
two years ago to become a developer.
   ``What used to be a convenient location on the main road is now
a busy commercial district with a lot of traffic going by and they
end up being torn down for a new office building, a new apartment
building or one thing or another.''
   Oberg says the partnership has purchased five buildings for its
subdivision and is still looking for others to fill the seven other
lots. Four buildings are now being reconstructed at the site. A
concrete foundation is ready for a federal-style home from
Massachusetts that dates to around 1800.
   They expect to complete the development in about three years.
   The first step is saving the buildings, a painstaking task. The
partnership has paid $5,000 to $20,000 for the relics and spends
five to six weeks dismantling them.
   With a crew of carpenters supplied by Broom's other business,
H.B. Broom Housewright Inc., a restoration company, nearly
everything is saved from frame and windows to mantels and
floorboards.
   Broom and Oberg remain true to each building's original design _
which means, for example, rebuilding six fireplaces in the former
Salem tavern _ but the structures are outfitted with modern
conveniences such as burglar alarm systems and central air
conditioning.
   ``When we rebuild these houses, we're using all the original
features and restoring the house as best we can, but we're not
building museums,'' says Broom, 44, of Lyme, whose office is in a
building built in 1770 to serve as a general store for steamships
on the Connecticut River and the ferry that to this day shuttles
between Chester and Hadlyme.
   ``We're building houses that are practical to live in.''
   The interiors are slightly modified with ells to accommodate the
modern trappings of kitchens and bathrooms. Otherwise the homes are
original, right down to the slightly off-center front doors on some.
   They plan to pave the winding road leading to the development
and line it with sugar maples, stone walls and picket fences.
Antique lampposts will be re-created, based on design borrowed from
Deerfield, Mass.
   ``We're trying to create the perfect New England environment,''
Oberg says. ``We try not to change the details at all and take
small liberties with the ells.''
   Oberg is quick to dispel notions that the developers are trying
to imitate Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts or Williamsburg in
Virginia. He says they confine their efforts to homes built between
1700 and 1815 and lean toward those in formal styles, such as
federal or Georgian.
   Similar but smaller subdivisions of five relocated historic
homes each are located in rural Killingworth, Conn., and in
Waitsfield, Vt.
   Oberg criticizes the so-called ``purist'' approach to
restoration, which is light on modern conveniences and heavy on
dark interior colors.
   ``The result when a so-called purist restores a house is that
the houses tend to be dark and use dark colors and that is not
quite what everybody would like,'' he says.
   The Sterling Meadows development has met the approval of town
officials, who are committed to 2- and 3-acre zoning in order to
preserve the town's atmosphere.
   About 1,910 people live in Lyme's 33 square miles. Homeowners
include former New York City Mayor John Lindsay and Brooklyn, N.Y.,
District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   ``If you're gonna have development of that nature, you could do
no better than Skip Broom,'' says Lyme First Selectman John F.
Yeomans, referring to Broom by his nickname. ``They're as good as
any and better than most.''
   Oberg and Broom formed their partnership 2{ years ago after
Oberg bought a tract of land alongside a 12-acre parcel Broom
already owned. Oberg says he has had a lifelong interest in antique
homes while Broom quit a job as an analyst with Shell Oil Co. about
15 years ago to start his restoration business.
   ``I had a piece of land I bought as a investment and I always
wanted to put antique houses on it,'' says Broom, whose company has
restored about 80 homes. ``Oddly enough, he wanted to do the same
thing.''

<HEAD>Ford's Probe Makes Heads Turn</HEAD>

   The 1989 Ford Probe can be hazardous to drive.
The problem is not with the car, but with other folks who want to
get a good look at it.
   During the time I had a Probe GL test car, I was chased at 80
mph down a freeway by two guys in a spanking new-looking Pontiac
Grand Prix who wanted to check out the Probe. Their Grand Prix just
made its debut this model year.
   I also encountered an older fellow who nearly stopped in the
middle of intersection so he could get a gander at my Probe.
Traffic in my neighborhood picked up one Sunday as people came back
around the block to get second and third looks at the Probe.
   And the Probe was immediately surrounded by curious sales people
at a Honda dealership I visited.
   It sure seems that Ford has an attention-getter with this
aerodynamic, fun-to-drive, small specialty car that was unveiled in
Chicago in February and went on sale in May. Ford already has
70,000 orders, which amounts to this year's full production at the
Flat Rock, Mich., plant where the car is built. Eventual plant
capacity could reach 150,000 annually.
   The front-drive Probe is unique in a couple ways. Though sold in
Ford showrooms, the car was designed with the help of Mazda Motor
Corp. of Japan and is being produced at the Mazda plant in Flat
Rock by United Auto Workers members.
   The plant, the first U.S. assembly plant operated by a Japanese
automaker to be organized by the UAW, also builds the Mazda version
of the Probe, called the Mazda MX-6 which shares many components
with the Probe.
   Ford, by the way, owns 25 percent of Mazda.
   But the Probe differs from the MX-6 in appearance inside and
out, conveying a more modern, sleek image. And for all the
attention it gets, it doesn't cost a mint. Base price for the GL,
the lowest-priced version of the Probe, was $10,459. The test car,
with optional premium sound system, cast aluminum wheels, air
conditioning and automatic transmission totaled $13,186.
   Ford also offers an upscale LX model which starts at around
$11,400, and a top-of-the-line performance GT, which sports a
spoiler, fog lamps and turbocharged engine and starts at around
$13,600.
   Those prices put the Probe squarely in contention with its
Japanese competitors _ the Honda Prelude, which starts around
$14,000, and the Toyota Celica, which starts around $12,000.
   The test car, the low-end Probe GL, had commendable suspension
and good handling. However, the standard engine _ a 2.2-liter
electronic fuel-injected four-cylinder _ didn't quite seem to
deliver the power one would want in such a sleek, sassy-looking car.
   Cloth front bucket seats were comfortable enough. But leg room
in the back was a problem.
   Fit and finish inside and out was admirable, and the tilt
steering was different, causing the whole steering module,
including instrument cluster, to move up and down. It was a nice
touch, considering the feature meant never having to worry about a
steering wheel adjustment obscuring the view of one of the gauges.
   It took some getting used to the blinker. It wasn't a stalk on
the side of the steering column. Rather, it was a small lever
attached to the dash.
   Likewise, the headlights were not activated by the traditional
push-pull knob on the dash nor the turn of a switch at the end of a
blinker stalk. Instead, the retractable headlights came out and on
when a large dial on the side of the instrument cluster was turned.
   The rear cargo area was deep and roomy, but items had to be
lifted up and over the rear of the car. The Probe is aimed at
young, career-oriented buyers, a Ford statement said.
   Specifically, targeted buyers have a median age of 30, 55
percent are single, half are male, and they have a median annual
income of $33,000, said Ford analyst Ray Windecker. The major
occupations expected to be represented among Probe drivers include
professional-technical workers and managers, he added.
   There have been several reports that the Probe is designed to
replace the Ford Mustang, which has been around since the 1960s.
   Ford says the two cars will be sold side-by-side in showrooms,
and the Mustang will remain as long as there is consumer demand.
   Because the Probe is just arriving on the market, there are no
reliability reports.

<HEAD>Felton Perry of `Hooperman' Handcuffed Into Crime Stories</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Felton Perry of ABC's ``Hooperman,''
being an actor has meant putting a lot of handcuffs on people _
when he wasn't wearing them himself.
   Perry plays gruff Inspector Clarence McNeil in the ABC comedy
starring John Ritter as Harry Hooperman, a plainclothes San
Franciso police officer.
   Perry was also a police lieutenant in a recurring role on NBC's
``L.A. Law.'' He was Dirty Harry's partner in the movie ``Magnum
Force.'' In ``Walking Tall,'' he was a deputy sheriff. He was a
prison warden in ``Weeds'' and a policeman in several TV pilots.
   Perry also spent considerable time playing men on the other side
of the law. He was the terrorist who kidnaped Patty Hearst in ``Get
Patty Hearst.'' He was a villain in ``Stingray,'' a vicious drug
dealer on ``Hill Street Blues'' and a criminal on ``Cagney &
Lacey.''
   ``People see me either as a cop or a crook,'' said Perry. ``I
spend a lot of time putting on handcuffs or wearing them. Or saying
`Freeze!' or throwing my hands up.''
   On ``Hooperman,'' Perry said, ``I'm like Hooperman's best friend
on the show. He's a guy he can level with. A guy who looks to him
and says, `What's next?' They go out on cases together, but Harry
goes out with everyone.''
   Barbara Bosson plays Capt. C.Z. Stern, who runs the department,
and the name describes her authoritarian approach.
   ``She sees through all of us,'' Perry said. ``We've all been on
the carpet for the chances we took. Under Harry's guidance, of
course.''
   Last season, Perry had a recurring role as police Lt. Lester
Tuttle in ``L.A. Law'' in the episodes in which Alfre Woodard, who
won an Emmy for her performance, played a leukemia victim who was
raped and made to seem the aggressor at the trial.
   His only other series was ABC's ``Matt Lincoln,'' a short-lived
1970 show about a hotline for troubled teen-agers. It starred Vince
Edwards.
   In recent years, Perry has devoted most of his time to
television and theatrical motion pictures and occasional guest
roles on TV.
   ``In `Robocop' I got to play a character I've never played
before,'' he said. ``I didn't play a cop. Fortunately, the director
was Dutch and didn't have a strong Hollywood connection and I'd
known the producer for years. I played a member of the management
team that controls `Robocop.'
   ``I'm this wimp, a yes-man who agrees with everyone. As it turns
out, I'm one of the few people to survive and I become the No. 2
man in the management team. That role helped people see me
differently.''
   He just completed a role as a psychiatric therapist in the movie
comedy ``Checking Out.'' He counsels Jeff Daniels about dying, then
promptly dies himself. That's not the end of his role in the film,
however.
   Perry also recently closed an eight-week run of the play ``An
American Tract,'' which he produced. He's also the author of a play
called ``Or,'' about wounded Vietnam veterans in a special
rehabilitation ward of a Veterans hospital, plus two other plays,
``by the bi and bye'' and ``Sleep No More.''
   Perry grew up in Chicago and quit school to join the Marine
Corps when he was 17. His fluency in Spanish landed him a job as an
interpreter while stationed in Spain. He also spent time in Japan,
the Philippines and Lebanon.
   He obtained his high school diploma while in the Marines, and
afterward got his degree at Roosevelt University. While in college
he was on the judo team and qualified for the 1964 Olympics tryouts.
   ``I really started performing when I was 2,'' he said. ``My
great aunt took me around to churches where I performed for pennies
and peppermint sticks.
   ``When I was 10 or 11 I really liked this girl and we'd read
fairy tales together. She'd be the damsel in distress and I'd be
Prince Charming. The kids would gather around and watch and say,
`Go on, kiss her!'''
   After college, he worked in the post office and acted in
community theater productions. A television commercial got him into
the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was in
a production of ``MacBird,'' which got him into Actors Equity, and
his first movie, ``Medium Cool,'' got him into the Screen Actors
Guild.
   ``I knew I had to leave Chicago to find film work,'' he said.
``I saw in a trade paper that Rene Valente, who was casting for
Columbia Pictures Television, was looking for talent. I wrote her a
letter. I was pretty naive. But she called me and I got an audition
for `Here Come the Brides.' After that I did several episodes of
the show.''

<HEAD>Summit Offered A Forum To Show Off Soviet Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moscow summit offered the Soviets a forum to
show off Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and a chance to boost the
Kremlin leader on the eve of a Communist Party conference crucial
to the success of his policies.
   While the U.S. media devoted much space and time to the meeting
between President Reagan and Gorbachev, the Soviet media devoted at
least as much space _ if not more _ to discussion of the party
conference and a reform document published on the eve of the summit
that outlines more, potentially radical reforms.
   Soviet television coverage of the summit, meanwhile, portrayed
Gorbachev as a dynamic, worldwise leader.
   Reagan helped promote that image during his stay by repeatedly
acknowledging the blossoming of the state-run arts and media,
restructuring of the economy and freeing of some political
prisoners under Gorbachev.
   In fact, Reagan appeared so impressed with Gorbachev's policies
that he withdrew his earlier characterization of the Soviet Union
as an ``evil empire.'' And when it came time for Reagan to leave,
he bid a warm farewell to a leader he said had become a personal
friend.
   But the air of good will did not hide the fact that Gorbachev is
waging a battle to win the support of the 5,000 Communist Party
delegates to the national conference, which begins June 28. The
conference is the first of its kind since 1941.
   Gorbachev has said he wants ``partisans of perestroika,'' his
effort to restructure Soviet society, elected as delegates to the
conference. At the same time, the Soviet leader has indicated that
he does not want any party conflicts out in the open, and he
studiously avoided mention of the party conference during the
summit.
   But that did not stop Soviet reformers from speaking out about
the fierce fight being waged by orthodox Communists and outspoken
Gorbachev supporters over delegate elections to the conference.
   Boris Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow Communist party boss dropped
from the ruling Politburo last February, took the most dramatic
step, giving two interviews to Western television stations in which
he called for the resignation of the Kremlin's No. 2 official,
Yegor K. Ligachev.
   Yeltsin is said to have criticized the slow pace of reform in an
unpublished speech last Oct. 21 that led to his ouster. This week,
he took the unprecedented step of using Western interviews to
assail Ligachev for allegedly blocking reform.
   Gorbachev insisted at his news conference last week that there
is no movement to force Ligachev to step down.
   At the same time, however, the pro-reform weekly Ogonyok and the
weekly Moscow News _ available in English, Spanish, French, German
and Arabic as well as Russian _ published candid articles about
maneuvers used to ease reformers off the conference slate.
   Organizers of the Soviet Union's fledgling independent political
party, the Democratic Union founded on May 4, held a meeting of
1,500 people in Leningrad last weekend demanding a multi-party
system and fairer delegate selection.
   Smaller protests on this and other issues, such as Jewish
emigration, took place daily in Moscow during the summit, with
police watching in silence.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of Ogonyok, said Moscow students went to
the city's Pushkin Square last week to collect signatures on a
petition demanding he be a conference delegate.
   Sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, writer Fyodor Burlatsky,
historian Yuri Afanasyev and Korotich told Western reporters in
news conferences or interviews that they failed to gain election as
delegates in an initial round of voting.
   Burlatsky said the problems were due to the fact that ``we are
learning democracy.''
   Korotich, too, blamed the maneuvering on the lack of a political
culture.
   ``We have to learn not to be afraid,'' he said in an interview.
``We have to get rid of the Stalinist remnants. Under Stalin, it
was easy. He had a theory of enemies that made everybody afraid of
one another.''
   Banging on a desk for emphasis, he added, ``If you thought this
desk was bad, you could just say it was made by enemies. Simple as
that.''
   ``Perestroika,'' he added, ``is just a big return to the norm.
We have to become normal again.''
   Foreign Ministry press center officials were swift to accede to
Western reporters' requests for interviews with the most outspoken
proponents of reform, who also took the dais at news conferences
for hundreds of journalists.
   Known conservatives were not seen at such forums, and were not
strongly in evidence at a meeting Reagan had with writers and
intellectuals last Tuesday.
   This could be the result of what Gorbachev himself has described
as passive, panicky resistance to his reforms. This maneuvering has
not so far emerged into a publicly identifiable political movement.
   Korotich also noted that ``the conservatives have not yet
presented a program, and have not suggested any new leader'' to
replace Gorbachev as Communist party general secretary.
   He said he expected Gorbachev to emerge strengthened from the
conference.
   The public relations campaign for Gorbachev's reforms that was
waged during the summit certainly convinced a Moscow taxi driver,
who said he was from the Soviet leader's home region in southern
Russia.
   ``Gorbachev is like Jesus Christ,'' he volunteered to a Western
reporter during a conversation highly critical of Soviet life.
``Our children have all forgotten how to work, and he will get them
going again.''

<HEAD>Germans Rushing To Boost Trade With Soviets; Washington Concerned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German businesses, lured in
part by promises of economic reform in the Soviet Union, are
rushing to boost their trade with the Kremlin.
   They range from the mighty Deutsche Bank, which recently
arranged a $2 billion line of credit for the Kremlin, to the
sporting goods company Adidas, which already is making products in
the Soviet Union but is looking to expand.
   While a string of new collaborations were announced in May, the
growing trend has sparked some criticism from Washington.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., without referring by name to Deutsche
Bank, said the Soviets ``are using these loans to finance military
mischief, I fear, around the world.''
   But Soviet economists say that is unlikely.
   ``Soviet consumers want better products,'' said Helmut Giesecke,
an economist with the Bonn Industry and Trade Conference office.
``Once they have them, they're not going back to the old ways.''
   Still, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who appeared with
Sasser at a recent senate committee hearing, said U.S. defense
officials had discussed the situation ``in general terms because
they put an added defense burden on the NATO allies.''
   The allies, however, could also complain about U.S. trade with
the Soviets, Carlucci noted.
   West Germany, which serves as NATO's front line of defense
against the Soviet-led Warsaw pact, has seen its trade with the
Soviets decline for the past three years.
   West German imports from the Soviets have nearly halved to $4.27
billion since 1984, and exports to the Soviets are down to $4.6
billion, from $6.3 billion three years ago.
   Seventy percent of Soviet exports to West Germany are natural
gas and oil products, which are purchased with U.S. dollars. But a
low dollar and cheap oil prices have taken their toll, cutting into
the foreign currency supplies the Soviets need import goods.
   Increased ties to West Germany fit Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's program to improve conditions at home, Soviet
economists say. To encourage foreign investment, the Soviet Union
has begun allowing Western concerns to own a share of Soviet
industries.
   Deutsche Bank economist Hans Dettmar said that it is too early
to tell how the line of credit will be used by the Soviets, but
``it is intended for light industry consumer products, such as
shoes and foodstuffs, and joint venture projects to expand that
market with the Soviet Union.''
   Any business deals will be announced by the companies taking
part, not the bank. ``We and the other banks involved only make the
money available,'' he said.
   Among the German companies that announced deals last month were:
   _Salamander, West Germany's largest shoe producer, which already
produces shoes in Leningrad, said it would up its production with a
new plant in Vitebsk.
   _Lurgi GmbH said it was heading a consortium of companies
awarded a $294 million contract to build two new oil and gas plants
to expand production in the Tengiuz oil fields near the Caspian Sea.
   _Adidas will begin making sports textiles in Tbilis by the end
of this year. The company has been making shoes in Moscow since
1978 and in Kiev since 1984.
   _MAN, producer of heavy vehicles, announced a joint venture with
the Soviets to produce long-haul trucks.
   To help finance the deals the Soviets are looking West for hard
currency. Frankfurt bank sources said the Soviets are planning to
sell $294 million in Eurobonds in West Germany.
   That sale would follow a $70 million bond the Soviets floated
five months ago in Switzerland.

<HEAD>Slowdown Reported In Export Growth In May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's exports in May rose 16
percent to $4.67 billion but appear to be slowing from the brisk
pace set in the first four months of the year, the Trade and
Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
   Exports totaled $4.67 billion last month, compared with $4.02
billion a year ago.
   But they increase fell short of the 32.5 percent average boost
during the first four months of the year.
   The setback was attributed to recent labor disputes over wage
hikes in auto and some other export-sensitive industries as well as
the appreciation of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar. The won
has risen about 8 percent in value since January.
   Imports in May totaled $4.23 billion, up 16.6 percent from $3.63
billion a year ago.
   The trade surplus in May amouted to $435 million, compared with
$437 million in April and $395 million in May 1987. The May surplus
was the smallest since February.
   For the past five months, exports totaled $22.1 billion, up 28.6
percent from a year ago, while imports rose 30.7 percent to $19.83
billion, according to the ministry's preliminary figures.

<HEAD>Government Rolls Back Some Anti-Alcohol Measures, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has relaxed curbs on the production
of alcohol and lifted some restrictions on the sale of booze in a
slackening of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-drunkenness drive, a
weekly newspaper reports.
   Moscow News, which is at the forefront of the Soviet leader's
campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness, did not say what
restrictions on sales were removed.
   But the labor newspaper Trud reported last month that Moscow
city authorities had recently allowed an expansion of the number of
stores selling alcoholic beverages to 772. It did not give the
previous figure.
   Moscow News, in its Wednesday editions, and Trud gave two
reasons for the easing of Gorbachev's anti-alcoholism campaign: to
try to discourage moonshining and stop a run on sugar. The
moonshiners, who Trud said are outproducing the legal alcohol
industry, use sugar to make alcohol.
   Sugar is being rationed in several Soviet cities, but Moscow
News said it is not in short supply, adding that sugar supplies
were greater in 1988 than last year.
   Increased sales of alcohol and the stabilization of alcohol
production should reduce the use of sugar by moonshiners, Moscow
News said.
   Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, his first major initiative
after taking power in March 1985, included raising the drinking
age, shortening the hours of liquor stores and cutting liquor
production.
   Soviet officials have credited the campaign with increasing the
life expectancy and cutting drunkenness on the job.
   but Nikolai Shmelev, a prominent economist, told reporters last
week Gorbachev has been going about trying to reduce alcoholism the
wrong way.
   He said the campaign has encouraged moonshiners and taken
revenue from liquor sales away from the government.
   Instead, said Shmelev, the government should improve consumer
supplies ``so a man could use his ruble to buy a bottle of vodka or
a good shirt.''
   The Communist Party daily Pravda reported late last year that
more than 4.5 million of the Soviet Union's 284 million people are
``registered alcoholics,'' 1 million of whom require compulsory
care.

<HEAD>Hallmark Halts Shipment Of Alcohol-Related Graduation Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. said it had stopped
making graduation cards containing humorous references to drinking
after they got a cool reception from a Mothers Against Drunk
Driving chapter.
   Hallmark decided Tuesday ``to discontinue manufacturing and
shipping alcohol-related graduation cards,'' Diane Wall, a
spokeswoman for the Kansas City-based company, said Wednesday.
   However, Janet Cater, director of the Orange County, Calif.,
chapter of MADD, said Hallmark had not done enough because the
cards were still available in some stores.
   Ms. Wall said the graduation season is nearly over and that the
cards would soon been removed from store shelves. The company said
the decision to withdraw cards was up to retailers.
   Two stores in Anaheim, Calif., pulled the cards at the request
of CASA, an Orange, Calif.-based group that works against drinking,
drug use and pregnancy among teen-agers, said organization
chairwoman Jane Wyner.
   ``Every day these cards are on the market, they are going to be
selling,'' she said. ``This has to be nipped right away.''
   The controversy arose last week when parents of students at
Edison High School in Huntington Beach, Calif., showed MADD
officials two cards.
   One card, depicting a refrigerator filled with beer and a single
egg, advises, ``Don't go to graduation without a good breakfast
first.''
   Another suggests that graduates wear loose-fitting gowns so they
can ``hide at least two bottles of champagne underneath.''
   ``How can a company which advertises `When you care enough to
send the very best, send Hallmark,' produce cards which encourage
alcohol and drunken driving?'' asked Ms. Cater.
   ``Hallmark offers about 600 graduation card designs, and less
than 1 percent deal with alcohol-related subject matter,'' said Ms.
Wall. ``It is a very small percentage.''
   The Costa Mesa, Calif.-based Grad Night Foundation, which
promotes sober graduations, is urging Orange County members to ask
shops to pull the cards, said foundation director Lori Warmington.
   ``This is such a national issue now,'' Ms. Warmington said.
``Incidents like this really fan the flames. It's inconceivable
(Hallmark) can be so lacking in sensitivity.''
   ``We are certainly concerned, and we feel our actions are an
appropriate response,'' replied Ms. Wall.

   Schering-Plough Corp. says it has

   Schering said Wednesday it ended the deal because it did not

Commission.
   Schering and Cooper reached a definitive agreement in March, but
terminated it in May after the FTC threatened a suit. The FTC said
at the time the deal might reduce competition in the manufacture
and sale of soft contact lenses.
   A few weeks later, the companies entered a revised agreement and
submitted it for FTC review.
   The transaction would have doubled the size of Schering's

<HEAD>Fleming Plans to Acquire Memphis Wholesaler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fleming Companies Inc. of Oklahoma City
will become the nation's largest food wholesaler _ supplying 5,700
retailers in 37 states _ with the acquisition of a rival
Memphis-based company, Fleming announced.
   Fleming announced Wednesday it will pay $225 million in cash to
acquire all of the outstanding stock of Malone & Hyde Inc. The
Memphis wholesaler, now the country's fourth largest, projects
sales of $3 billion for 1988.
   With 1987 sales of $8.6 billion, Fleming ranked second only to
the Super Valu grocery operation in Minneapolis. Fleming's sales
will surpass Super Valu's after the Malone & Hyde acquisition, said
James W. Clark, a Fleming vice president.
   Malone & Hyde will become a subsidiary of Fleming, Clark said.
In addition to the cash payment, Fleming will assume $375 million
of the acquired company's debt. Fleming said it expects to finance
the acquisition through sale of stock and long-term debt.
   Malone & Hyde operates eight distribution centers that supply
1,750 retail grocers in 16 states, primarily independent stores in
the Southeast. Clark said Malone & Hyde owns a few of the stores it
supplies as well as 101 retail drug stores.
   The core of Fleming's business is supplying independent grocers.
   The firms said the agreement has been approved by both companies
and is now subject to regulatory approval. The deal is expected to
close by Aug. 1.
   Malone & Hyde operates 3.3 million square feet of distribution
space at locations in Southhaven, Miss.; Goodlettsville, Tenn.;
Miami; Monroe and Layfayette, La.; Sikeston, Mo.; Nicholasville,
Ky.; and Tupelo, Miss. The company also operates a general
merchandise distribution center in Memphis and dairy plants in
Nashville, Tenn., and Baton Rouge, La.
   The company employs 9,000 people.
   Malone & Hyde was founded in 1907 and became a publicly owned
company with a stock offering in 1961. It was listed on the New
York Stock Exchange beginning in 1971.
   In 1984, the firm returned to private ownership through a buyout
led by management and the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co.

   Nabisco Brands Inc. says it will
reorganize into a holding company with four autonomous operating
companies in a move designed to make the food company more
responsive to its market.
   Domestically, the Biscuit Division has been renamed the Nabisco
Biscuit Company and the Grocery Products Division will now be
called the Nabisco Foods Company.
   Nabisco's two international operating companies, London-based
International Nabisco Brands Inc. and Toronto-based Nabisco Brands
Ltd., will be relatively unaffected, Nabisco said Wednesday.
   Nabisco expects the reorganization to be complete by the end of
the year. All but about 400 of the current 2,000 workers on Nabisco
Brands' corporate staff will be assigned to the operating companies.
   The company said it did not know if any layoffs will be
necessary.
   ``Our goal with this new corporate structure is to give our
operating companies full responsibility for their key functional
areas as well as all the resources necessary to fulfill this
responsibility,'' said H. John Greeniaus, president and chief
executive officerf of Nabisco Brands.
   In the first quarter of 1988, Nabisco had net income of $273
million, up 24 percent from $220 million during the same time
period in 1987, company spokeswoman Caroline Fee said.

ever.
   IBM said its new Model 70, available in three configurations,
can do jobs up to 1{ times as fast as its previous top-of-the-line
PC, the Model 80, which stands on the floor.
   IBM also introduced the Model 50 Z, which offers up to 35

   Also introduced were a low-priced local area network station,
which is used for tying clusters of PCs into groups; new storage
features for its small low-end Model 25 PCs; and new equipment for
electronic publishing.
   Prices for the Model 70 range from $5,995 to $11,295, depending
on features. IBM said two versions of the Model 70 would be
available this month, while the most expensive version would come
out in the third quarter.
   All the other PCs are to be available this month, but some of
the add-on equipment will not be available until later this year,
IBM said.
   The company also reduced prices on some of its older Personal
System-2 computers, including the Model 60 and Model 80.

   Postmaster General Anthony Frank is turning to
Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot for help in improving the nation's
postal service.
   Perot, a pioneer in computer services, is expected to be asked
to study the massive Postal Service and recommend ways to improve
efficiency.
   Frank, who became postmaster general March 1, reportedly first
met Perot at about that time and began discussing the possibility
of having the Texan help improve postal efficiency.
   Details of the plan, including the cost of Perot's work, were
not immediately available, but is was expected that Perot and
associates from his computer firm would undertake an analysis of
postal operations, including automation and labor relations.
   The Postal Service lost $635 million in the quarter from
December to March, but higher rates put into effect April 3 are
expected to pull the agency back into the black.
   When it was made an independent agency in the early 1970s, the
postal subsidy was eliminated and the service was directed to break
even, which it has done, on average, over the last decade.
   Perot founded Electronic Data Systems Co., a pioneer computer
services company, and later worked to help restructure General
Motors Co., before clashing with GM chairman Roger B. Smith. Frank
was president of a California bank that became part of Ford Motor
Co.

<TEXT>
   After three months of lawsuits, talk of a
recapitalization plan and a flurry of political support, Koppers
Co. succumbed to a $1.7 billion takeover bid from British
industrialist Brian C. Beazer.
   The construction materials and chemicals company, one of the
largest U.S. road repair concerns, agreed Wednesday to be acquired
for $61 a share by BNS Inc., a company formed by Beazer, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank PLC.
   ``We set out to keep the company independent, but business as it
is currently conducted didn't give us that opportunity,'' Koppers
Chairman Charles Pullin said after the board unanimously approved
the merger.
   Beazer's struggle to acquire Koppers aroused intense hostility
in Pennsylvania, where Koppers is a major employer. It led to legal
wrangling in federal court and compelled local members of Congress
to introduce anti-takeover measures.
   The battle also ignited sharp criticism over Shearson's role in
participating in a hostile takeover while helping to finance it.
   Koppers' congressional allies were quick to note that Beazer's
victory does not quiet those concerns.
   ``The question for the Congress remains about the role of the
investment bankers, where they were essentially both soliciting the
deal and providing the wherewithall,'' said Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa.
   ``That to me is something that we ought to remain concerned
about,'' said Walgren, one of 15 congressmen who petitioned the
Energy and Commerce Committee for an investigation.
   ``It's not approprite for securities firms and foreign
corporations with banking interests to be involved in hostile
takeovers,'' said Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., who vowed to support new
regulations.
   Ridge and Walgren co-sponsored a bill barring foreign banks and
domestic financial services firms from hostile takeovers. But their
efforts, like a bill introduced by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., fell
short of helping Koppers.
   A key feature of the merger agreement is job guarantees for
Koppers employees. About 7,000 salaried workers will be guaranteed
jobs for at least one year or get a year's pay, and hourly
employees are covered by contracts that remain in force, Koppers
said.
   In addition, payments from a 32-year-old deferred compensation
plan will be accelerated to some of Koppers' 460 active and retired
managers, but ``nobody is going to get more under this merger than
they had when Koppers was ... totally independent,'' Pullin said.
   Beazer said he would delay for 45 days plans to sell the
chemicals business, giving managers a chance to make an offer. He
agreed that Koppers will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh for at
least three years.
   Pullin said Koppers' greatest hope of surviving on its own was a
recapitalization plan it claimed would compete with Beazer's offer.
But management's deal collapsed last week when an unidentified
prospective buyer backed out of purchasing part of the construction
materials business, he said.
   Koppers opposition to Beazer traces back to March 3, when BNS
launched a $45-a-share tender offer. BNS boosted the offer to $60 a
share on March 25 and sweetened it by $1 during weekend
negotiations.
   Koppers won anti-takeover injunctions in U.S. District Courts in
Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. The California ruling, concerning
antitrust issues, fell last week on appeal, and the judge in
Pittsburgh offered BNS options for overcoming apparent violations
of securities laws.
   On Wall Street, Koppers stock closed Wednesday at $60.50 a
share, up $1.50.
   Analysts were satisfied with the $61-a-share payout. ``That's a
good value for Koppers shareholders,'' said analyst Christopher H.
Willis of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
   In the end, Pullin insisted that the merger agreement was
reached ``with my complete cooperation'' and that the takeover
fulfills management's commitment to enhance shareholder value.
   ``Now that the drama has ended, we are looking forward to
getting on with the job, putting together a world class aggregates
company and beating the competition,'' Beazer said.
   The tender offer was extended until June 15.

<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Coleco
Industries Inc. says it plans to offer to make its debtholders
majority owners of the company if they agree to a restructuring of
the company's debt.
   The ailing West Hartford toy maker made the announcement
Wednesday as it extended a debt-exchange proposal a fourth time,
this time until June 30.
   Coleco has pinned its hopes for recovery on a plan to exchange
$335 million of debt for $119 million of new debt and 6 million
shares of common stock.
   But that offer, launched March 23, was rejected by debtholders
because it reduced the value of their investment in the company by
about 65 percent.
   Debtholders also complained that the plan did not require
similar sacrifices from Coleco stockholders, who would have seen
only a 34 percent reduction in the value of their investment if 6
million more shares of stock were issued.
   In a short statement, Coleco said it is preparing a revised
offer that would respond to the concerns of debt holders. Without
giving specifics, Coleco said the new plan would offer more bonds,
nearly as much as the $335 million of original securities that
would be replacing.
   In addition, Coleco said the new offer would include enough new
shares of common stock to give bondholders ``more than a majority
equity interest'' in the restructured company. With 17.8 million
shares of stock outstanding currently, that indicates that 18
million new shares of stock would have to be issued under the new
plan.
   Coleco officials have said the company might have to seek
protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy laws unless
it can restructure the debt and raise working capital.
   Coleco's other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic
tricycles, and board games such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
   Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.

   The stock market declined broadly today, giving
up some of its recent gains as interest rates turned upward.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 11.56 to 2,052.45
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 301 up, 718
down and 414 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.15 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates rose in the credit markets this morning,
reversing a sharp decline Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts also
noted an increase in British interest rates.
   That prompted many traders to sell stocks in order to cash in on
the gains of the past two sessions, brokers said.
   The upswing in stock prices since the start of the week was met
with considerable skepticism on Wall Street, given continued signs
of upward pressure on commodity prices.
   Texaco fell 1{ to 50~. Financier Carl Icahn said he would
probably sell his large stake in the company if he should lose his
bid to gain control of five seats on the board of directors.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.69 to 149.65. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .68 at 297.61.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 32.89 to
2,064.01, bringing its gain over the past two sessions to 107.57
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,287 up, 323 down and 360 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 234.56 million shares, against 247.61 million in the
previous session.

directors voted to pay roughly $1.085 on each share of Series B
convertible preferred stock that was sold to finance part of the
$1.5 billion, federally-assisted restructuring of the Houston-based
holding company.
   After overcoming weeks of delays spurred by hesitant
debtholders, the transaction was completed April 19. The dividend,
the first to be paid by the restructured company, will be paid to
stockholders of record June 15.
   The Series B preferred bears a $5.50 annual dividend rate, and
the partial dividend will cover the period between April 19 and
June 30, First City officials said.
   The restructuring was completed using $500 million of private
capital, including the sale of 2.45 million preferred shares, a
$970 million note from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and a
$108 million loan from a group of banks.
   First City spokesman Jim Day said the company has been
profitable since April 19, when the transaction was completed.

   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries has postponed next week's meeting by three days, probably
due to an Arab summit meeting in Algeria, an OPEC spokesman said
today.
   He confirmed reports that the oil ministers from OPEC's 13
member nations would start their conference on Saturday, June 11,
rather than Wednesday, June 8, as had been planned.
   ``There is no official reason for the postponement, but most
likely the meeting was delayed because it coincided with the Arab
summit meeting in Algiers'' which starts Tuesday, the spokesman
said.

   Diamond-Star Motors Corp. has begun
production of about 100 pilot cars at its new factory, testing the
coordinated work of robots and humans, a company spokeswoman said
today.
   The assembly line began rolling slowly on Wednesday, giving some
400 auto workers their first experience working with robots in the
new $650 million plant, a joint venture between Chrysler Corp. and
Mitsubishi Motors of Japan.
   But the first pilot cars won't roll off the assembly line until
mid-June, said spokeswoman Chris Ziehmann.
   ``Production did begin yesterday. Understanding that it is a
very slow, careful beginning, everything that was scheduled
yesterday went fine,'' Ms. Ziehmann said today.
   ``This is the start of tying everything together, making sure
everything works right,'' she added.
   The state-of-the-art auto plant features high-technology
machinery, including robotics on the final assembly line.
   Diamond-Star is scheduled to begin full-scale production of
sporty coupes at the new plant in the first week of September.
Chrylser will market the car as the Plymouth Laser.
   Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which has 205 dealerships in
the United States, also will distribute the sports car, but it
hasn't announced the name it will use.

<HEAD>Fisher-Riser Merger Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fisher Foods' shareholders have approved a
merger with Riser Foods Inc. that will give Riser 63 grocery stores
and one of the largest wholesale grocery operations in the Midwest.
   The vote came Thursday, a day after Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Judge Michael Corrigan denied a request by three Fisher Foods
shareholders to prevent the grocery firm from holding a special
meeting of shareholders to vote on the merger proposal.
   Fisher said in a news release that it expects the merger to go
into effect June 13. The new company will be the largest retail
employer in Greater Cleveland with about 6,500 employees and
estimated revenues of about $1 billion, Fisher said.
   Under the merger, each share of Fisher common stock will be
exchanged for one share of Riser Class A common stock, and each
share of preferred will also be evenly exchanged.
   Even though the special meeting was not delayed, Corrigan will
still consider the suit filed by William Steiner and Charles Miller
of Great Neck, N.Y., and Edith Citron, of Pompano Beach, Fla.
   The three shareholders alleged that the parties to the merger
are scheming to acquire a disproportionately high amount of
Fisher's stock at the expense of Fisher shareholders.
   Brian K. Garson, Fisher president, said: ``We are very pleased
with Judge Corrigan's decision to allow Fisher shareholders the
right to vote on the erger proposal.''
   He said the lawsuit's allegations ``are totally without merit.''
   A similar suit, filed by the same shareholders, against Fisher
is pending in U.S. District Court.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Advance In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower, then
quickly turned mixed to higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The lower opening reflected the tail end of Wednesday's
profit-taking and reports of light rain in the eastern Corn Belt,
analysts said.
   New buying interest surfaced in response to the National Weather
Service's prediction of below-normal rainfall in most
grain-producing areas for the period June 7-11.
   The early gains ``make sense given the six-to-10 day forecast,''
said Katharina Zimmer, a grain analyst in New York with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ``We need rain now; we don't need
another six to 10 days of dry weather.''
   Rain is badly needed in the Midwest, where the corn crop is
entirely planted and soybean planting is nearing completion.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to \ cent higher with
July at $3.48 a bushel; corn was { cent to } cent higher with July
at $2.21{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3\ cents higher with July
at $1.81{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher
with July at $8.01} a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with June at 72.37
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .48 cent higher with
August at 76.70 cents a pound; hogs were .38 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with June at 54.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.40 cent to .98 cent lower with July at 57 cents a pound.
   Frozen pork bellies settled sharply higher on Wednesday while
livestock futures were mixed.

   Stock prices pulled back today after rising sharply over the
past two sessions, and the nation's largest general retailers
reported May sales that analysts described as lackluster.
   At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had climbed 107.57 points Tuesday and Wednesday, was off 6.76
at 2,057.25.
   Analysts said some traders sold stocks to cash in on the gains
of the past two sessions. They noted that interest rates, which had
fallen earlier this week, turned higher today.
   In the latest round of retail sales reports, major storeowners
reported their sales were marginally higher or actually fell last
month.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall sales last month rose 5.1 percent from May 1987 levels,
while sales from stores open at least a year _ also known as
same-store sales _ rose only 0.2 percent.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 6 percent last month,
while same-store sales rose only 2.3 percent. J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
said its overall sales fell 1.2 percent last month and same-store
sales fell 1.4 percent.
   On Wednesday, the government reported April gains in its chief
economic forecasting gauge as well as in factory orders and
construction spending.
   The Commerce Department reported its Index of Leading Indicators
rose 0.2 percent in April, following rises of 0.2 percent rise in
March and 1.5 percent in February.
   The March increase in the leading index originally was reported
as a much stronger 0.8 percent rise. However, weakness in consumer
and business borrowing pulled the index down sharply.
   The government also reported that orders to U.S. factories for
manufactured goods climbed 1.2 percent in April to a seasonally
adjusted $218.7 billion following an even bigger 1.6 percent March
increase.
   Most economists had been forecasting only modest growth in new
orders of 0.5 percent in April. The bigger-than-expected number
likely will do little to alleviate concern among some analysts that
strong demand, particularly for exports, will trigger greater
inflation.
   The strength in new orders in April came in electrical
machinery, lumber and wood products and in petroleum, chemicals and
paper.
   In a third report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending rose 0.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $401.8
billion, following a 1.3 percent jump in March and a 0.4 percent
February increase.
   Analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and focused
on a big 8.8 percent rise in spending on industrial plants, which
put activity in this sector up 39.8 percent from where it was a
year earlier.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the gain reflected the boom in export sales,
which has meant plants in many industries are operating near full
capacity.
   Government construction fell by 3.1 percent in April to an
annual rate of $79.3 billion. Residential construction posted a 0.4
percent advance in April to an annual rate of $191.9 billion, while
non-residential construction climbed 2.1 percent in April to an
annual rate of $94.4 billion.
   In another economic report Wednesday, the Agriculture Department
said U.S. farm exports climbed to a 3{-year high of 14.8 million
tons valued at $3.3 billion in March. A year earlier, farm exports
were 11.4 million tons valued at $2.4 billion.

<HEAD>Mexico Begins Marketing New Light Crude</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's state oil monopoly Pemex has begun
marketing a new high-grade crude in the international petroleum
market, the government newspaper El Nacional reported.
   Abundio Juarez Mendez, deputy director of primary production for
Pemex, said the company last month exported 250,000 42-gallon
barrels of the new crude, called Olmeca. He did not identify the
purchaser.
   He said the new crude can be priced a dollar more a barrel than
the Isthmus brand, which previously was the nation's superior oil.
Mexico also exports a heavy crude, called Maya.
   ``(Olmeca) is much finer than Isthmus (and) it is superior to
Arab light,'' Juarez Mendez told local reporters at an oil
conference on Latin American drilling, according to the article,
which was published Thursday.
   Mexico, he said, has the capacity to eventually export 125,000
barrels to 150,000 barrels a day of the new crude, which is being
extracted from fields in the southeastern state of Tabasco along
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
   Juarez Mendez said the new oil has a density of between 38 and
40 on the American Petroleum Institute scale, compared to a density
of 32 to 34 for Isthmus.
   The English-language daily Mexico City News quoted an
unidentified Pemex official as saying the government ``is not yet
sure how much light oil it has. Pemex is still exploring.''
   ``There is probably not much Olmeca in Mexico,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Pemex, meanwhile, reported that prices to Japanese clients for
Isthmus and Maya crudes were held steady in May
   The price for Isthmus was $15.30 a barrel in May to Japan, the
same as in April, and for Maya, $12.60 a barrel.
   ``This reflects the stability that prevails in the general level
of prices in the international oil market,'' Pemex said in a
statement.
   Mexico has a contract with Japanese customers to supply 180,000
barrels of oil a day, the statement said.
   Mexico's prices vary according to geographical area. The oil
company did not give the May prices for U.S. and European customers.
   In April, the price of the Isthmus brand to U.S. customers was
$16 a barrel and $12.77 for the heavy type.
   Mexico maintains an export platform of 1.36 million barrels a
day.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stock Exchange To Raise Margin Requirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Thursday it would
raise its margin requirement for stock purchases from 60 percent to
70 percent as of June 3 because of recent gains in share prices and
volume.
   A substantial rise in margin transactions also prompted the
move, exchange officials said.
   Traders however said the action was likely to have little effect
on the market and added that changes in the margin requirement in
the past had failed to have strong impact on the exchange.
   The margin requirement represents the down payment needed for
investors who purchase stock with borrowed money.
   On May 16, the TSE raised the margin requirement to the current
60 percent from 50 percent. The next day, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues rose 167.86 points to top its close on the
day before the October crash. It rose another 93 points the day
after that and then surged 1,001 points over three sessions early
the next week to surpass its pre-crash high.
   Over the past four sessions this week, the main market barometer
has risen 906.86 points. It closed Thursday at a record high
27,869.36 points.
   Volume, meanwhile, this week has averaged around 1.8 billion
shares a day, compared with around 1.1 billion shares a day last
week. On Wednesday, volume in terms of shares traded reached the
highest level since the market crash after 2.561 billion shares
were traded for the second highest one-day volume ever.
   On Tuesday, the TSE announced that in the week ended May 28, the
balance of margin buying rose 208.1 billion yen to 6.485 trillion
yen. It was the fourth consecutive weekly rise, and a historical
high balance of long positions.

   Britain's major commercial banks, heeding a signal
from the Bank of England, announced they would raise their base
lending rate by half a percentage point to 8 percent.
   Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank
PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC said Thursday they would increase the
benchmark rate, effective Friday.
   The Bank of England, apparently responding to the slumping
British pound, sent its signal at noon local time by announcing it
would raise a key money-market intervention rate.
   The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and the West
German mark in the last few days as the market's attention has
shifted away from sterling into the dollar and other major
currencies.
   The British base rate was last changed on May 17, when it was
cut to 7.5 percent from 8 percent as British authorities attempted
to estrain a strong rise in the pound.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans from commercial banks at
one percentage point above the base rate.

   About 200 capitalists converged here Thursday for
a weekend of caviar on the Great Wall, boat rides on an imperial
pleasure lake and a display of opulence not seen in this spartan
socialist capital since 1949.
   The participants, from 21 countries, are spending $4,300 each to
enjoy such Western luxuries as a masked ball and champagne
breakfast at sites of past Chinese imperial glory.
   For $5,200 more, 100 of them will spend 10 days touring China's
most famous scenic spots.
   The weekend event, dubbed ``The Return of Marco Polo'' after the
13th century Venetian adventurer, was organized by a French group
calling itself the Committee to Save Venice and the Great Wall,
headed by public relations agent Daniel Vial.
   The proceeds were intended to help restore the Great Wall,
reduced in many sections by weather and war to a heap of stones,
and to preserve the art and architecture of Venice, Italy.
   But Vial said Chinese officials are charging such high fees for
transportation, food, site rentals and services that most of the
ticket receipts will be needed to cover expenses.
   He cited a $54,000 charge by Beijing municipal authorities to
rent a section of the Great Wall for four hours Saturday so the
guests can lunch there on caviar and champagne.
   ``I'm not sure they (Chinese officials) got exactly the concept
of a charity,'' Vial told a news conference this week. ``They
charge us the maximum.''
   The number of high-paying guests also is less than half what was
expected, Vial acknowledged. He said Chinese delays in confirming
arrangements made it impossible to advertise far enough in advance.
   The organizers now say any funds to help the Great Wall or
Venice will have to come from the final event of the weekend, a
Sotheby's auction Sunday of donated modern Western and Chinese art
and rare objects.
   Sotheby's has estimated the 67 items, including a 1777 bottle of
cognac, a pottery jug painted by Picasso and a painting by Deng
Lin, the daughter of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, should fetch
$695,400 to $869,000.
   However, auctioneer Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's
International, said no one is really sure what to expect. It will
be the first auction of Western art in China since the Communist
takeover in 1949.
   The cheapest item in the sale is expected to be a Sevres
porcelain cup valued from $215 to $320 _ about how much an average
Chinese factory worker earns annually.
   Despite uncertainty about how much will be reaped for charity,
plenty of cash will flash during the weekend.
   The guests will be ferried about in black Red Flag limousines,
entertained by Chinese acrobats and singers, fed on caviar, French
cuisine and brandy and allowed to party at some of China's most
sacred national monuments.
   They will boat at the luxurious 19th century Summer Palace and
hold a Venetian masked ball and watch fireworks at the Diaoyutai
state guesthouse.
   They will breakfast at the Temple of Heaven, where the emperor
offered sacrifices for a good harvest, dine in the Forbidden City,
the imperial palace in Beijing and watch Chinese and Western
performers Saturday night at the Great Hall of the People.
   The guests gathered at the weekend's first event, a cocktail
party in the garden of the glass-plated Sheraton Hotel, serenaded
by Chinese musicians playing ancient instruments.
   An American businessman, asked why he was willing to pay so
much, said with a shrug, ``To have fun.''
   ``We are not in Beijing now,'' said a Frenchman who, like the
American, spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's as if we are in
San Francisco.''
   Organizers said several European and Arab nobility signed up for
the weekend, but most of those at the party seemed to be involved
in business with China.
   Hundreds of police will shield the guests from contact with
ordinary Beijing residents, among who the main topic of
conversation lately has been 30 to 60 percent increases in the
prices of pork, eggs and sugar.
   Former Foreign Minister Huang Hua, when asked at the cocktail
party if such displays of wealth were appropriate in impoverished
China, call income differences ``an objective reality.''
   ``We are trying to make our country prosperous,'' he said. ``We
need all kinds of help.''

   Government prosecutors Thursday
arrested two senior officials of Hyundai Engineering and
Construction Co. and charged them with paying a group of men to
kidnap a labor organizer.
   The prosecutors said they are trying to determine whether other
Hyundai officials were involved in the kidnapping. The organizer
was freed after several days when he resigned as an employee of the
construction company.
   Earlier Thursday, about a dozen radical students hurled rocks at
the headquarters of the giant Hyundai group in Seoul to protest the
kidnapping at the Hyundai subsidiary. No injuries were reported.
   The arrests and the attack by the students came as labor unrest
continued at three other Hyundai plants in southern South Korea.
The Hyundai group is one of the largest conglomerates in the nation.
   In Ulsan, management on Wednesday locked out 20,000 striking
workers at Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest automaker, and
said there was little chance of settling the strike for higher
wages. The walkout began Monday.
   At Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., which makes trains,
management and leaders of the 4,000 strikers held two rounds of
talks Thursday but failed to end a one-week strike at the company's
plants in Ulsan and Changwon.
   The talks were held one day after strikers freed one of the 11
executives they took hostage on Friday. They were still holding 10
executives on Thursday.
   Strikers at Hyundai Motors want raises of up to $180 a month,
against a company offer of $105. The workers earn an average of
$750 after five years.
   Hyundai Precision on Thursday offered to raise workers' pay $85
a month, but workers stuck to their demand of a $180 increase. They
earn $600 a month.
   ``Punish the masterminds of the kidnapping,'' the students
shouted as they hurled rocks at the Hyundai group's main building
in Seoul, breaking four windows. The students ran away before
police arrived.
   Several hours after the attack, government prosecutors arrested
two Hyundai Engineering officials, executive board member Choi
Jae-dong, 47, and manager for general affairs Kang Myung-ku, 42,
and charged them with hiring several men to kidnap labor organizer
Suh Jung-ui, 34.
   Suh was kidnapped May 10 by a group of unidentified men as he
left a Seoul restaurant where he had met with some officials of the
construction company, which is based in Seoul.
   Suh, who worked at the company's Seoul headquarters, returned
home several days later and said he was released after he agreed to
write a letter of resignation addressed to the company.
   Hyundai Engineering denied involvement at the time.
   Details of the kidnapping emerged this week when some of the
alleged kidnappers surrendered to police or were arrested in Seoul
and other cities.
   Their leader told police Hyundai Engineering executives offered
him $27,000 to kidnap Suh and persuade him to drop his labor
organizing effort.

<HEAD>AT&T Calls for Service Charge Hikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said
Thursday it wants to increase its service charges on
operator-assisted, interstate calls to help offset rising costs.
   AT&T said its service charge for all out-of-state collect calls,
calls billed to a third number and pay-phone calls would rise to
$1.75. The service charge on most of those calls is now $1.55 and
lower for short-distance calls.
   The service charge on operator-dialed calls charged to an AT&T
credit card, now $1.55, also would rise to $1.75. Also, the company
would set a uniform surcharge of 80 cents for interstate AT&T
credit card calls that are customer-dialed. The charge for most of
these calls is already 80 cents, but it is 60 cents for
short-distance calls that cross state lines.
   The company additionally is proposing to raise its service
charge on interstate, person-to-person calls from $3 to $3.50.
   The proposed increases would go into effect July 16, under plans
AT&T filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC must
approve the increases before they can take effect.
   AT&T said its service charges for operator-assisted calls have
not changed since 1982, though costs for providing those services
have risen an average of $159 million a year during the past five
years.
   As part of the proposal, AT&T also wants to charge callers 75
cents for calls they ask the operator to dial, beginning Dec. 1.
   The charge would not apply if the caller is unable to complete
his or her call for any reason, including customer error, but
callers would have to tell the operator they had tried to dial the
call themselves. It also would not apply to disabled customers who
need an operator's assistance.
   The company said that for one year its operators would inform
callers if they are subject to the 75-cent surcharge.
   Also beginning Dec. 1, AT&T wants to charge out-of-state callers
$2 to have an operator verify a busy line is in use and another $2
if the caller wants the operator to interrupt the call. AT&T
currently does not charge for these services.

<HEAD>FMC Inks $1 Billion Pact With Turkey; Announces Tank Sale To
Saudis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FMC Corp. moved Thursday toward increased weapons
sales in the Middle East by signing a $1 billion pact to jointly
produce armored vehicles for Turkey and announcing a $400 million
sale to Saudi Arabia.
   The Saudi order, approved by Congress last month, represents
Chicago-based FMC's first foreign sales of its Bradley Fighting
Vehicle and could open the door for similar sales to other friendly
countries in the region, a spokeswoman said.
   ``Sure, it's a possibility,'' said FMC spokeswoman Patricia
Brozowski. ``It's hard to judge right now what the overall
potential is but we'll certainly see what happens.''
   The previously announced $1 billion deal calling for FMC and
Nurol Defense Industry to produce 1,700 smaller armored vehicles
for the Turkish government is a ``crucial element'' of Tukey's
defense-modernization plan, said FMC Chairman Robert H. Malott.
   ``Through participation in this contract ... FMC-Nurol will
contribute to Turkey's economic dynamism,'' Malott said in remarks
prepared for an afternoon signing ceremony with Turkish Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal in New York.
   ``Meanwhile, the U.S. economy will benefit from the sale of some
U.S.-produced components to Turkey,'' Malott said.
   FMC, a leader in armored-vehicle manufacturing and technology,
produced the Turkish army's exisiting fleet of M113 personnel
carriers. The new contract is for Armored Infantry Fighting
Vehicles, which are popular because they can operate in water
without add-on flotation devices and are small enough to be
transported in C-130 class aircraft.
   The vehicles have 25mm cannons and the capacity to carry 10
people at a maximum speed of 45 mph.
   The agreement calls for FMC-Nurol to deliver 1,700 vehicles over
an eight-year period from the joint venture's manufacturing plant
in Turkey. The percentage of the vehicles' content produced in
Turkey will steadily rise to 73 percent in the last contract year,
Malott said.
   FMC will own 51 percent of FMC-Nurol and hold a majority of the
positions on the joint venture's board, he said.
   The agreement represents one of the largest joint ventures
undertaken by FMC, which has previously co-produced armored troop
carriers in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, Malott said.
   The sale of 200 Bradley vehicles to Saudi Arabia, with
deliveries expected to begin in 1990, expands FMC's customer base
for Bradleys beyond the Pentagon for the first time.
   The Pentagon has purchased about 3,400 of the vehicles since the
early 1980s, Ms. Brozowski said.
   The Bradley, touted by Malott as ``the Mercedes Benz of its
type'' but reviled by some military critics, is equipped with
surface-to-surface rocket launchers and 25mmm cannons.
   The Saudi order also specifies that the Bradleys be
air-conditioned.
   ``Deserts, you know,'' said Ms. Brozowski.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Stocks In Yugoslav Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Yugoslav government, faced with
a deepening economic crisis, is considering a plan to allow
citizens of this communist country to buy stocks and securities,
the state-run press reported Thursday.
   A draft of the reform, proposed by a government-appointed
comission of about 140 prominent economists and scientists, has
been presented to the federal parliament for debate, newspapers
said.
   Stocks and bonds would be issued by state-run companies and
could be purchased by their workers or other citizens, said the
Vecernje Novosti newspaper.
   ``In this case, a shareholder takes over (part of) the risk of
managing the company,'' said the report.
   Except for small cooperative and private ventures, the majority
of Yugoslav enterprises are owned by the state.
   Yugoslavia's economy, a mixture of free-market elements and
Soviet-style central planning, has been growing at a sluggish rate
averaging less than 1 percent annually over the past six years.
   The reform also calls for the sale or a temporary lease of a
state-run company to its workers or other citizens in case the
state is not interested in ownership.
   The draft of the reform also indicates that Yugoslavia plans to
gear its economy more to the market to overcome difficulties that
include a 15 percent unemployment rate, a $21 billion foreign debt
and an inflation rate of around 170 percent, the highest in Europe.
   The government last Saturday launched a major austerity program
that included substantial price hikes, wage cuts of up to 30
percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the Dinar, the national
currency.
   The program also lifted price controls for about 60 percent of
goods and services, under a price freeze since last November.
   As a result, Yugoslavs have been hit by a new wave of price
hikes for hundreds of goods and services of up to 127 percent.
Food, drinks, cars, rents and air transport were affected by the
increases.
   Meat went up by an average 50 percent, rents in Belgrade by 90
percent and domestic air travel by 127 percent.
   The price hikes are bound to contribute to a further decline in
living standards, which have already fallen by one-third since
1980. Labor unrest is also expected to grow.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose
slightly Thursday late in the day after Wall Street erased some of
its earlier losses.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
stood at 1,810.3, up 4.6 points or .33 percent.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, off as much as 18 points at
the New York opening, recovered slightly by the close of trading
here.
   Analysts said there was a dearth of news in the market to
influence trading.
   ``There's just nothing to get excited about in this market,''
said Anthony Abrahams, Managing Director of U.K. Equity Trading at
Smith New Court Ltd. in London, adding that ``there's only marginal
movement'' in share prices.
   Only selected equities were affected after the Bank of England
signaled a half-point rise in base rates to 8.0 percent from 7 1@2
percent around midday. Major banks followed the central bank's lead
by announcing they would raise their base lending rates 0.5
percentage point to 8.0 percent, effective Friday. The interest
rate hike was not enough to lift the sinking pound.

   Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines are
being operated safely but labor turmoil at Eastern raises the risk
of safety problems there, an investigation by the Transportation
Department concluded today.
   The report said that a close inspection of Texas Air Corp., the
parent company of the two airlines, showed no serious management or
financial problems, but that labor strife at Eastern may have a
future impact on public safety.
   As a result of the continuing labor problems, the Federal
Aviation Administration planned to continue close scrutiny of
Eastern's operations and former Labor Secretary William Brock will
attempt to work with Eastern management and labor to ease tensions.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told a news conference that ``an
unsafe condition does not currently exist'' at either Eastern or
Continental.
   But McArtor and Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley voiced
concerns that safety may be jeopardized at Eastern in the future by
the ``extreme labor-management tensions'' at the airline.
   Burnley said that the department's investigation of Texas Air
and its two major airline subsidiaries showed no safety problems at
Continental. It did, however, find a serious lack of communication
between labor and management at Eastern.
   The department also said it found no evidence that Texas Air
Corp.'s extensive financial losses last year posed any serious
financial problems, saying the company had adequate resources and
its management was found to be ``fit, willing and able'' to run an
airline.
   Burnley said that Brock's role will be to ``work for ways to
de-escalate the (labor-management) tensions'' at Eastern.
   Brock said he had been in contact with most of the parties
involved in the Eastern turmoil but that he had not yet developed a
game plan on how to ease those tensions.
   McArtor said that an in-depth, plane-by-plane inspection at both
Eastern and Continental had not shown anything that would warrant
extreme safety concerns.
   Frank Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, repeatedly has blamed labor
unons at Eastern Airlines for his two airlines' problems, accusing
the unions of waging a campaign against the airline to discredit
its safety record.
   The Transportation Department announced its two-pronged
investigation of Texas Air on April 13, including a plane-by-plane
examination of Eastern's aircraft by FAA inspectors. Five days
later the FAA safety inspection was broaded to include Continental
as well.
   In conjunction with the announcement of the investigation, the
FAA disclosed that it was proposing a $823,000 fine against Eastern
because of safety violations found in special reviews of the
Miami-based airline last year.
   During the 30-day inspections of Eastern and Continental, FAA
officials repeatedly examined each aircraft at airport gates to
determine if they were following federal air safety requirements.
   The separate probe of the parent company focused on possible
management and financial concerns. DOT investigators wanted to
determine if the executives of the Houston-based holding company
are ``fit, willing and able'' to operate an airline according to
federal aviation laws.
   There had been pressure from Congress for the department to open
an investigation of Texas Air in light of the company's huge
losses, including $466 million last year, and its continuing labor
turmoil at Eastern.
   A resolution calling for a such an investigation gained the
support of 150 congressmen.
   In announcing the special probe, officials cited a pattern of
safety violations at Eastern reflected by the latest $823,000 fine,
which came
   on top of a $9.5 million civil penalty from earlier Eastern
safety violations.
   The department also had raised concern about recent financial
transactions involving Texas Air and Eastern, including attempts by
the airline to spin off Eastern's lucrative Northeast shuttle. The
shuttle spinoff has been blocked by the courts.
   These transactions raised quetions about whether the managers of
Texas Air Corp., have complied with federal safety and economic
practices that are required of commercial air carriers under
federal aviation law, DOT officials said in April.
   Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines are the key airlines
under Texas Air Corp. It also owns Rockey Mountain Airways, Britt
Airways, Bar Harbor Airlines and Provincetown-Boston Airlines. None
of the smaller carriers specifically was subject to the DOT or FAA
investigations.

   Soybean futures prices surged Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade and grain futures posted moderate gains on
forecasts for continued warm, dry weather in the Midwest.
   The soybean market, already more sensitive than the grains to
weather factors because of tight-supply concerns, got an additional
boost from indications the Soviet Union had recently purchased more
than 1 million metric tons of soybean meal from South American
processors and was looking for more.
   ``There was tremendous strength coming out of the meal market,''
said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago. ``I think the bean rally was due to the rally in meal more
than anything else.''
   Soybean meal futures posted near-limit gains with the contract
for delivery in July closing $7.30 higher at $253 a ton.
   The chances for widespread rains in the Corn Belt remained slim,
and the National Weather Service predicted below-normal rainfall in
most grain-producing areas for most of next week.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3\ cents higher with July at
$3.51 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3} cents higher with July
at $2.24{ a bushel; oats were 7\ cents to 8} cents higher with July

<HEAD>IBM Announces New Models Of PCs, Including Fastest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. fleshed
out its 14-month-old Personal System-2 line of personal computers
Thursday with reliable new models that include what would be the
world's fastest PC.
   But Compaq Computer Corp., IBM's top rival in speedy personal
computers, hinted it would strike back with one even faster that
would reach the market before IBM's. Compaq has scheduled a product
announcement for June 20.
   ``In the time frame that IBM has indicated they might deliver
their product, we will continue to have the highest performance
386-based machines in the marketplace,'' said Michael Swavely, vice
president for marketing at Houston-based Compaq.
   IBM said the fastest version of its new Model 70, to be
available in the July-September period, will be up to 50 percent
faster than the Model 80, its fastest currently available computer.
Its price will be $11,295.
   IBM also announced two other versions of the Model 70 available
immediately, starting at $5,995, and a version of its Model 50
starting at $3,995 that is up to 35 percent faster than the current
model.
   Also introduced was a version of the Model 25, the smallest and
cheapest member of the Personal System-2 family, that is designed
for use in office networks. Hard disk drives are also available for
the Model 25 for the first time. Those products are available this
month.
   IBM said the new computers are up to five times more reliable
than the original PC, introduced in 1981. It said its one-year
maintenance contract on a Model 60 is about $200 a year, compared
to the $600 to $800 a year charged by competitors for computers of
similar power.
   IBM reduced prices on the Model 60 and Model 80 by 5 to 18
percent to keep them in line with the improved new models. Analysts
are expecting announcements of improvements in those products in
coming months.

little more than a week after it revealed plans by Farley Inc. to
purchase up to 25 percent of its common stock.
   The Georgia-based textile company announced that its board had
amended its share purchase rights plan, which allows existing
stockholders to purchase additional shares at reduced prices in the
event of a takeover bid. The plan is designed to make a hostile
takeover more expensive.
   Previously, the plan was effective when a person or group
acquired 20 percent or more of Pepperell's common stock or
announced a tender offer. Under the amendment, the threshold is 10
percent.
   Pepperell announced May 25 it had been notified of Farley's
filing with the Federal Trade Commission for permission to purchase
up to 25 percent of Pepperell's approximately 32 million
outstanding shares.
   Farley, a conglomerate privately owned by William F. Farley,
includes in its holdings Fruit of the Loom Inc., the underwear
manufacturer.
   Pepperell recently became the nation's largest publicly owned
textile company when it acquired J.P. Stevens & Co. in a joint
buyout with Odyssey Partners Inc.
   Pepperell officials declined to confirm Thursday's action was in
response to the Farley disclosure.
   But Patricia Ryan, a textile industry analyst with Raymond James
in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the directors probably took the
action to protect stockholders if Farley does buy a significant
portion of Pepperell stock.
   ``Apparently it's to dilute the ownership of the outside group
that's trying to buy stock,'' added Kay Norwood, a textile analyst
with Interstate Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
   In a statement issued by the company, Pepperell Chairman Joseph
L. Lanier Jr. said the amendment will expire in two years if the 10
percent threshold has not been crossed.

   Quaker State Corp., a major refiner of
engine lubricants, said Thursday it signed a definitive agreement
to sell its Western chain of 102 Arctic Circle restaurants to a
Pittsburgh-based investment fund.
   Quaker State acquired the restaurants in 1985 in order to get
Arctic Circle's chain of motor oil changing shops, which have been
renamed Quaker State Minute Lube Inc.
   The sale, for undisclosed terms to the Maverick Fund, was
planned before New York investors led by Ardshiel Inc. made an
unsolicited bid in April of $26.50 per share, or $675 million, for
the company, said Quaker State spokesman Benton H. Faulkner.
   ``Our position continues to be one of silence'' on the takeover
bid, Faulkner said.

   The nation's money supply rose in the week ended
May 23, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
to a seasonally adjusted $769.3 billion from a revised $768.1
billion the previous week.
   A broader measure of the money supply, M2, rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3.009 trillion from $3.003 trillion.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3.782 trillion from $3.775 trillion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In setting its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $766.5 billion, a 5.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks.
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $96 million,
compared with a decline of $1.1 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $776 million, up from $388 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $276.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $275.6 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Silver Prices Skyrocket On Peruvian Mine Strike; Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices skyrocketed to seven-month highs in their
largest single-day gain since last September as news of a Peruvian
mine strike and continuing inflation fears unleashed a storm of
speculative buying.
   On other markets, other precious metals also advanced sharply;
copper prices leaped; grain and soybeans futures posted strong
gains; livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures were
mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities surged
3.25 points to 253.08, its highest level since Dec. 4, 1984.
Fifteen components gained, four posted losses and two were mixed.
   The crippling strike at the Uchucchacua mine owned by
Buenaventura, Peru's largest silver producer, will probably not
have much impact on world silver supplies, analysts said.
   But the silver market has lagged behind platinum and gold in
recent months, and news of the strike gave speculators an excuse to
buy heavily into silver, said George Anagnos, metals analysts for
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``To some extent, there was some pent-up buying mechanism built
into the market structure,'' Anagnos said.
   In addition, the broad rise in commodity prices over the past
several months has fanned inflationary fears, prompting many U.S.
investors to turn to precious metals for the first time since the
financial markets collapsed in October, analysts said. Precious
metals tend to hold their value during times of rising prices.
   ``We're starting to see more speculative demand here in the
United States based on the sharp increase in the CRB index and the
strength in the grains, and that obviously translates into fear of
inflation,'' said Jacques Luben, executive director of investments
for the New York-based Platinum Guild International.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $9.10 to $10
higher with the contract for delivery in August at $471.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 44 cents to 47.6 cents higher with July at $7.305
a troy ounce.
   Also on the Comex, reports of a strike at Southern Peru Copper
Co.'s Toquepala mine contributed to fears of tight copper supplies
and helped drive futures prices sharply higher, Anagnos said.
   Copper settled 1.80 cents to 9.70 cents higher with June at
$1.0825 a pound.
   Soybean futures prices surged on the Chicago Board of Trade and
grain futures posted moderate gains on forecasts for continued
warm, dry weather in the Midwest.
   The soybean market, already more sensitive than grains to
weather factors because of tight-supply concerns, got an additional
boost from indications the Soviet Union recently purchased more
than 1 million metric tons of soybean meal from South American
processors and was looking for more, analysts said.
   ``I think the bean rally was due to the rally in meal more than
anything else,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   The soybean meal contract for delivery in July settled $7 higher
at $252.70 a ton.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2} cents higher with July at $3.50{ a
bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3{ cents higher with July at
$2.24} a bushel; oats were 7\ cents to 8\ cents higher with July at
$1.86{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 18 cents higher with
July at $8.19 a bushel.
   Cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
ideas that cash prices for dressed beef were ready to rebound after
a recent decline, analysts said.
   Pork futures retreated in anticipation of an increase in hog
marketings next week as cooler weather moves into the major
hog-producing states, said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Hogs sometimes die if they are transported in hot weather, he
said.
   ``Hogs don't sweat well,'' Morgan said. ``When the weather gets
hot, they tend not to market hogs as aggressively.''
   Live cattle settled .17 cent to .37 cent higher with June at
72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .38 cent
higher with August at 76.60 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to
.65 cent lower with June at 53.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .95 cent lower to 1.55 cents higher with July at 57.05
cents a pound.
   Oil prices finished mixed in a quiet session on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 13 cents
higher with July at $17.65 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with July at 47.38 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .23 cent lower to .10 cent higher with July at 51.51
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .50 point lower at 266.35.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Up in New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance
Thursday in foreign exchange trading in the United States after
rising against most major currencies in earlier dealings in Europe.
   Gold prices rose sharply in New York after falling earlier in
Europe. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold of
$466.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $8.75 from $457.50 late
Wednesday.
   Analysts cited inflation fears, sparked by persistent rises in
agricultural commodity prices in recent days, for the precious
metal's big gain.
   Currency dealers in Europe said the dollar's rise stemmed from
the improved U.S. trade performance and firmer U.S. interest rates.
They said activity was muted by the closing of West German markets
for a national holiday.
   But the dollar finished lower in New York against the West
German mark, Swiss franc and French franc and higher against the
British pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
   Traders in New York said the market was buffeted throughout the
session by large orders to sell British pounds and Japanese yen and
buy West German marks and Swiss francs, whose value has been driven
down against the pound and yen in recent days.
   In addition, there were unconfirmed reports that several central
banks, including the Federal Reserve, sold dollars early in the
session.
   ``There was widespread talk of it, and the dollar came off its
highs. It took some of the steam out of the rally,'' said James T.
McGroarty, vice president for foreign exchange at Discount Corp. of
New York.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 125.68 Japanese yen, up from
125.35 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar
reached 126.53 yen. In U.S. trading, the dollar rose to 126.12 yen
from 125.425 yen late Wednesday.
   The British pound, which touched a six-year high of $1.90 in
March, fell to $1.7967 in London from $1.8220 late Wednesday. Later
in New York, the pound fell to $1.80435 from $1.81325 late
Wednesday.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.72105 West German marks, down from 1.7308;
1.43505 Swiss francs, down from 1.44345; 5.8270 French francs, down
from 5.8425; 1,281.75 Italian lira, down from 1,286.62; and 1.23075
Canadian dollars, up from 1.23035.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
were: 1.7295 West German marks, up from 1.7255; 1.4425 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4390; 5.8502 French francs, up from 5.8270;
1.9413 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9330; 1,286.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,282.50; and 1.2325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2319.
   Gold prices jumped on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where
gold for current delivery rose $9.40 an ounce to $467.
   ``Inflationary expectations have been increasing,'' said John
Norris, director for precious metals trading at Citibank in New
York.
   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors
in New York, said increases in other commodities such as soybeans
had set the stage for a revival of inflation concerns.
   Gold is often purchased by investors as a hedge against
inflation.
   Earlier in London, gold fell to a late bid price of $454.30 a
troy ounce, down from $456.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, it dropped
to a late bid of $453 from $457 late Wednesday.
   The metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $455.38 an ounce, down
from $458.55.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $6.73 a troy
ounce, down from $6.79. But silver for current delivery later
jumped 44.2 cents an ounce on the Comex in New York to $7.26 an
ounce.

   A lung-cancer victim's intelligent decision
to smoke despite the known risks of smoking should not be
second-guessed, a tobacco company lawyer said Thursday during final
arguments in a cigarette liability trial.
   Rose Cipollone ``made an informed choice, a choice people in
this country have a right to make'' to use a product with
associated risks, said Lorillard Inc. attorney Robert Northrip in
the second day of summations.
   In a U.S. District Court civil suit against Liggett, Lorillard
Inc. and Philip Morris Co., Antonio Cipollone contends the tobacco
companies misled the public about the danger of cigarettes. He has
not specified damages.
   Mrs. Cipollone died four years ago at the age of 58, and if the
jury awards damages it would be the first time a tobacco company
has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by smokers and
their families.
   Another tobacco company lawyer, Peter Bleakley, argued that
people have been talking about the risks of smoking for hundreds of
years.
   ``People have been claiming that smoking is bad for you, that
it's bad for your health, that it kills you, as long as these
products have been on the market,'' he told the jury Thursday.
``People do things all the time they know to be risky.''
   Bleakley, who represents Philip Morris, also defended the
Council for Tobacco Research, formed and funded by the tobacco
companies to study the health effects of smoking. He said no
evidence in the case shows that the scientists on the council's
advisory were anything but reputable and disinterested.
   The companies presented evidence throughout the four-month trial
to support their contention that Mrs. Cipollone was intelligent,
knew of smoking's risks through newspaper articles and warnings
from relatives and made a strong-willed choice to smoke.
   ``It's our position that (smoking) was her decision to make, and
we shouldn't second-guess her, not me, not Mr. Edell, not Mr.
Cipollone,'' Northrip said, referring to Cipollone attorney Marc Z.
Edell, who was expected to make his closing statement Friday.
   Northrip on Thursday and Liggett attorney Donald J. Cohn on
Wednesday cited testimony by relatives who said Cipollone
constantly told his wife to stop smoking, her mother blamed
cigarettes for her father's death and two sisters called cigarettes
``coffin nails'' as youths.
   They also cited newspaper articles relating charges about the
dangers of cigarettes.
   Earlier Thursday, Northrip focused on medical testimony by
physicians who treated Mrs. Cipollone, pathologists who studied her
cancer and cancer experts.
   He noted that physicians for the defense and the plaintiffs
disagreed over what kind of lung cancer killed Mrs. Cipollone.
   ``Some are statistically associated with cigarette smoking _
small cell carcinoma. Some are not _ carcinoid, or atypical
carcinoid,'' said Northrip.
   Edell must convince the jury that cigarette smoking caused Mrs.
Cipollone's lung cancer, not that smoking causes cancer in general,
Northrip told an 11-member panel that will be randomly reduced to
six for deliberations.
   The case was expected to go to the jury Monday.

   Researchers say a genetically altered carp that
grows up to 20 percent faster than normal could mean billions of
dollars for the fish industry, but a critic says the carp would
wreak ``havoc'' if released into lakes and streams.
   Scientists from Johns Hopkins University here and Auburn
University in Alabama inserted a gene from rainbow trout into carp
eggs, creating a fish that grows more quickly.
   ``The potential of doing this in other fish could mean billions
of dollars worldwide,'' Dennis Powers, chairman of the biology
department at Johns Hopkins University, said Thursday. ``If you can
get organisms to grow faster and improve efficiency it will bring
down the price to the consumer.''
   The technique could eventually be applied to catfish, a $300
million-a-year industry in the South, Powers said.
   However, a leading critic of genetic engineering,
Washington-based lobbyist Jeremy Rifkin, said if the carp are put
into the natural environment ``that could dramatically change and
disrupt marine life.''
   If the altered genes are transmitted to other generations ``they
could overtake the environment,'' said Rikfin, president of the
Foundation on Economic Trends.
   But Powers said the fact that the fish need substantially more
food means they would likely starve if released into the
environment rather than being raised at a fish farm.
   Powers cautioned that the experiment is just a ``preliminary
study'' and said he and his colleagues have not yet determined
whether the altered gene can be passed on to future generations of
carp.
   The scientists injected a gene from the pituitary gland of
rainbow trout into carp eggs. The gene produces additional growth
hormone, which regulates the growth of the fish.
   The technique for putting the gene into the carp eggs is still
imprecise, with only 20 successes in 10,000 attempts. The
scientists hope to produce more altered carp before publishing a
study.
   Rex Dunham, a fisheries geneticist at Auburn University, said
there was no particular reason for choosing a donor gene from
trout, except that it was more interesting to try a gene from a
different species. He said he thought the same result could have
been achieved by inserting an extra carp growth hormone gene.
   Powers and the two other scientists involved in the experiment,
Dunham and Thomas Chen, a molecular biologist at the Center of
Marine Biotechnology at John Hopkins, have asked the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to allow them to release the carp into
experimental ponds to see how the fish fare outdoors.
   Powers said the fish would be isolated and would not allowed to
escape from the holding ponds to lakes and streams, but Rifkin said
there is not enough assurance of that and wants the petition denied.
   Chinese scientists last year proved that genes from other
animals can change the physical and chemical processes in fish.
   Scientists have also successfully mixed genes from different
species in warm-blooded animals, such as rodents and livestock, and
microbes and plants.

<HEAD>SEC Files Civil Action Against Roberto Polo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sought a
court order Thursday to force high-living investment adviser
Roberto C. Polo to produce business records.
   The SEC action accused Polo, 37, and his Private Asset
Management Group Inc., a registered investment advising firm, of
failing to keep books and records as required by federal securities
law.
   The agency launched an investigation following published reports
last week that some of Polo's clients are suing him in state court,
alleging that he diverted $110 million from their accounts to
support a lavish lifestyle.
   The day after a May 26 Wall Street Journal article on the
lawsuits against Polo, federal officials went to check the books of
Private Asset Management at the Fifth Avenue address listed on
public documents as the firm's offices.
   Instead, they found Miguel Cruz International, a fashion design
firm owned by Polo, and were told the investment adviser business
had moved to Geneva, Switzerland ``sometime in 1986.''
   The manager of Miguel Cruz also told federal officials,
according to court papers, that all of the investment records had
been moved to Switzerland and that she and other Cruz employees had
not been paid in several months.
   In its civil complaint, filed at federal court in Manhattan, the
SEC claimed the withholding of books and records ``thwarted'' the
commission's efforts to check whether the law had been broken.
   In other court papers, Charles Padgett, associate regional
administrator for the SEC in New York, said the agency had been
unable to locate Polo or learn who his current attorney is.
   The front-page article in the Wall Street Journal described the
Cuban born Polo as a voracious art collector with an expensively
furnished apartment in Paris.
   According to the article, 13 of Polo's investors filed civil
suit in New York state court, claiming he diverted $110 million
from their accounts. A state court has barred him from disposing of
his assets, French authorities have seized the Paris apartment and
Swiss and French police are searching for Polo on financial fraud
charges in Switzerland.

   Eli Lilly & Co. has not ruled out a sale of
its herbicide ``Spike'' to the State Department for aerial spraying
of coca crops in Peru, a House subcommittee chairman said Thursday.
   Rep. Glenn English, whose House Government Operations panel is
reviewing the U.S. battle against illegal drugs, said the use of
the chemical is still possible even though Lilly has expressed
environmental and safety concerns.
   English, who spoke Wednesday to Lilly officials, did not repeat
his Wednesday statement that the Indianapolis-based corporation was
a ``deserter'' in the war on drugs.
   The Oklahoma Democrat used that critical description after Ann
B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, complained to the subcommittee that the company
refused to cooperate in the coca spraying program.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley also had said Lilly
apparently was worried about possible retaliatory measures by
``traffickers or terrorists.''
   Speaking at a hearing Thursday, English said Lilly officials
have objected to use of the chemical tebuthiuron, sold under the
name ``Spike,'' because ``they have not done the proper testing of
application by air over a wide section of countryside. They have no
data. They have not seen data from (the) State (Department), and
cannot assume responsibility or liability.''
   But he added, ``We will continue discussions. We need to acquire
a herbicide against coca bushes as quickly as possible. At this
point, my own perception is the door is open, discussions will
continue, and hopefully a solution can be found to this particular
problem.''
   Later, in an interview, English expanded his remarks to say
there had not been proper aerial testing in the coca producing
region of Peru, where the chemical would be sprayed. He said the
area has considerable groundwater, and therefore is much different
from the dry, brush areas where the herbicide is used in the United
States.
   English added that the company also was concerned that the coca
area in Peru ``may not be in friendly hands, and you may not have a
pilot totally concentrating on the accuracy of spraying.''
   Ted McKinney, a Lilly spokesman, had no immediate comment on
English's statement on Thursday.
   But he did say the chemical is applied both by air and on the
ground in the United States.
   He described ``Spike'' as ``a broad-spectrum, soil-applied
herbicide for brush and weed control on non-cropland, pasture and
rangeland.'' The herbicide is ``approved for use in grazing lands,
wildlife openings along ditchbanks, and utility rights of way. It
is safe for humans, livestock, wildlife and the environment when
used according to label directions.''

   The Suzuki Samurai, a popular sport utility
vehicle, tends to roll over in sudden turns and should be banned,
the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine said Thursday.
   ``That car literally trips over its own feet, and I wouldn't
want to be in it,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director of the
non-profit Consumers Union, which publishes the monthly magazine.
   In an article scheduled to appear in its July issue, Consumer
Reports labels the Japanese-made Samurai ``not acceptable'' _ the
first time it has given such a rating to a car in 10 years.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., based in Brea, Calif., defended its
vehicle.
   ``The Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety, including
stability and handling, prior to its introduction into the United
States,'' said Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of
American Suzuki Motor Corp.
   ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and
stable vehicle,'' he said Thursday.
   Consumers Union filed a petition with the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration asking that the agency change its
regulations to ban the Samurai, which the petition called ``wholly
unsuitable for consumer use.''
   A similar petition alleging the Samurai's rollover problem was
filed in February by the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit,
Washington-based consumer group. The government has yet to act on
that petition.
   Both petitions demand that a stability standard for vehicles
that would let the government ban any car that has an undue
propensity to roll over.
   Consumers Union said the Samurai is the first car out of 349
tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine
accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid
an obstacle in the road.
   At a news conference, Consumers Union officials showed a
videotape in which the Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to
roll over when it suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph.
   The car did not roll onto its side because it had been equipped
with arm-like extensions to avoid a rollover. Pittle said the
extensions actually improved the car's stability by lowering its
center of gravity.
   The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
Cherokee and the Isuzu Trooper, were shown making the same maneuver
without losing stability at speeds over 40 mph.
   ``We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the
Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' Mazza said. ``But
the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads
everyday.''
   Between November 1985, when the Samurai was introduced, and the
end of April 1988 there have been 154,675 Samurais sold in the
United States. The cars have a suggested retail price of about
$8,500.
   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
there have been 44 reported Samurai rollovers involving 53 injuries
and 16 deaths.
   NHTSA spokesman Ron DeFore said he could not comment on whether
the Suzuki has a higher rollover rate than its competitors, but
said utility vehicles generally have a fatality rate three times
that of light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that
rollovers account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility
vehicles.
   DeFore said drivers of utility vehicles such as the Samurai tend
to be younger and more adventurous than the average driver of a
passenger car, and therefore are more prone to accidents.
   In its statement, Suzuki said that in all of the accidental
deaths involving the car, police found that serious driver errors
led to the accidents.
   The company also said it believes the attacks on the Samurai may
have been triggered in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster
public opinion against Suzuki and perhaps the entire sport vehicle
industry.
   Suzuki also said it believes it has been targeted because the
Samurai is the leading imported sport utility vehicle from Japan
and has gained tremendous media attention because of its uniqueness
and affordability.
   The company said it would continue trying to determine the
original source of allegations against the vehicle and why the
company is being singled out. It will then consider legal action,
it said.
   The most famous vehicle rollovers involved the Jeep CJ5 and CJ7,
which the Wrangler superseded in 1986. Chrysler Corp., which bought
American Motors Corp. in August, inherited liability for lawsuits
seeking nearly $1.1 billion in damages caused by Jeep rollovers.

<HEAD>Insurer Postpones Announcement of Proxy Tally</HEAD>

   Farmers Insurance Group Inc., which is
fighting a hostile $4.5 billion takeover offer by Batus Inc.,
postponed Thursday's scheduled announcement of the results of a
shareholder vote on the issue.
   Counting of the proxy vote taken at Farmers' annual meeting May
20 was incomplete, said Charles L. Schultz, senior vice president
for finance.
   The annual meeting was reconvened Thursday in the expectation of
announcing the count, then adjourned until June 10 when results are
expected to be available, Schultz said.
   The tally, conducted by Corporation Trust Co. of America, was
difficult because both sides in the protracted fight sent out
numerous statements seeking shareholders' permission to cast their
votes in proxy, he said. The counting firm, based in Delaware, has
yet to offer a preliminary count.
   ``It's not a surprise, it is simply a question of the mechanics
of making a count when the two sides are sending out repeated
mailings with repeated proxy cards,'' Schultz said. ``The counter
has to sort them out to see which is the latest.''
   The vote was on a resolution introduced by Louisville, Ky.-based
Batus urging Farmers' board to reconsider its opposition a
$63-a-share buyout offer.
   Farmers is the nation's third-ranking home and auto insurer and
seventh-largest property and casualty insurer.
   Batus, a tobacco, retailing and paper company whose best-known
operations include Kool cigarettes and Saks Fifth Avenue, is a
subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC, a British conglomerate.

   Over-extended lending and a slumping economy
forced regulators on Thursday to shut down three banks in Texas and
two in Colorado. Guaranty Bank of Dallas, Williamstown Bank N.A. of
Houston and River Plaza National Bank of Fort Worth were declared
insolvent, pushing the state's 1988 bank-failure tally to 32.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was named receiver for the
three banks, all of which will open Friday after being assumed by
other banks, said FDIC spokesman Bill Olcheski. Depositors of the
failed banks automatically become depositors of the assuming banks.
   Guaranty had about $81.8 million in assets and will be acquired
by the Red Oak State Bank of Red Oak; Williamstown Bank had total
assets of about $23.6 million, and will reopen as a branch of City
National Bank of Houston, and River Plaza, which had assets of
$43.5 million and one office, will reopen Friday as a branch of
Tarrant Bank of Fort Worth.
   In Colorado, Security Bank of Boulder, with total assets of
$13.4 million, will be acquired by the First National Bank in
Boulder.
   The Security Bank of Aurora was taken over by Security Bank of
Colorado in Aurora, a newly chartered subsidiary of First United
Bancorporation Inc.
   They are the fourth and fifth banks to fail in Colorado.
   The failures bring the national total to 75 failed banks and 13
assistance transactions. Texas accounts for nearly half those
failures and both federal and state regulators are predicting that
the Lone Star total will reach 70 by year's end.

   A 21-year-old Hollywood feud between
scriptwriters and directors over who gets top credit for a movie is
flaring anew over a tactic writers are using in their bitter strike
against movie and TV producers.
   Negotiations between the writers' union and the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers, representing management,
were scheduled to resume Friday, following an unsuccessful
nine-hour session Wednesday.
   In making a separate labor peace with 80 small producers this
week, the Writers Guild of America used a contract that requires a
film be credited to the writer rather than the director.
   The Directors Guild of America on Thursday threatened legal
action against producers who sign the union's model contract, which
also allows writers to encroach on directors' prerogatives in
several other areas.
   The warning by the directors' guild, made in an advertisement
published in Hollywood trade journals, is the latest complication
in the writers' 13-week strike, which has already forced delays in
the start of fall television season.
   The writers' independent contract with small producers who have
broken ranks with the management group gives writers ``possessory
credit,'' the right to have their name associated with the film
title.
   Other objectionable provisions, said directors' spokesman Chuck
Warn, require ``meaningful consultation'' with the writer on choice
of director, actors and location, and give the writer a voice on
script changes made during filming.
   Warn declined to discuss possible legal action, other than to
say directors' lawyers were studying the matter. The unions fought
in court over possessory credit in 1967 and the directors won.
   Writers Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden refused to comment on
the directors' threat or the possessory credit issue.
   ``It shows their demands are not realistic,'' Herb Steinberg, a
spokesman for the producers, said of the writers. ``They're just as
unrealistic when it comes to the residuals for one-hour shows and
foreign production,'' he continued, referring to the two main
issues in the strike.
   The independent producers who have signed independent contracts
with the union employ only about 100 of the union's 3,000 active
writers, Steinberg said.
   The Writers Guild called the strike March 7, largely because the
producers sought to reduce their compensation for reruns of
one-hour television shows. With the demand for reruns of one-hour
shows slipping, the producers sought to tie the writers' payments,
called residuals, to a show's success in reruns.

<HEAD>City Asks Court To Block Koppers Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City attorneys Thursday asked a U.S. District
Court to delay the $1.7 billion sale of Koppers Co. to an
investment group headed by British industrialist Brian Beazer.
   Beazer won a three-month battle to take over the construction
materials and chemicals company when Koppers agreed earlier this
week to be acquired for $61 a share by BNC Inc., a company he
formed with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster
Bank PLC.
   In court papers filed Thursday, the city argued it should be
allowed time to review the latest findings in the case before an
injuction blocking the sale is lifted.
   Mayor Sophie Masloff sharply criticized Koppers, saying, ``I
think they sold us down the river.... I thought we had an agreement
with them that there wouldn't be a sellout yet, but apparently they
didn't pay any attention to that.''
   City officials said they are concerned about the fate of 1,150
employees the company has in the Pittsburgh area. All but 40 of
Koppers' local workforce is attached to chemicals operations Beazer
plans to sell.
   Allegheny County Commissioner Tom Foerster on Thursday asked the
city and the state to join the county in helping Koppers' employess
put together a plan to buy the company's chemical and allied
products operations from BNS Inc.

   Stock prices turned downward Thursday, giving up
some of their recent gains as interest rates rose.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 107.57 points
Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped back 11.56 to 2,052.45.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by slightly less than 3
to 2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 614 up, 888 down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 193.54 million shares,

regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
222.89 million shares.
   Interest rates rose in the credit markets, reversing a sharp
decline Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts also noted an increase in
British interest rates.
   That prompted many traders to sell stocks in order to cash in on
the gains of the past two sessions, brokers said.
   The upswing in stock prices since the start of the week was met
with considerable skepticism on Wall Street, given continued signs
of upward pressure on commodity prices.
   Futures prices for commodities ranging from soybeans to gold
climbed in Thursday's activity.
   Next on the market agenda is the Labor Department's monthly
report Friday on the employment situation. The figures will get a
close look from Wall Streeters watching for evidence of the pace of
economic activity.
   Burlington Northern gained 1} to 69[. The company reported plans
to sell a 13 percent interest in its Burlington Resources operation
to the public.

bid to gain control of five seats on the board of directors.
   Other losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &

percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .67 to 149.67.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.68 to 306.36, and
