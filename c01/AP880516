<HEAD>Soviets Say Change in General Secretary's Term Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Soviet Communist Party's
Central Committee said there is a ``good chance'' the group will
introduce laws at a party conference next month to limit the term
of office for the general secretary, according to a published
report.
   The Washington Post reports in Tuesday's editions that while
Georgi Arbatov said there was a ``good chance'' of such a change,
he added that the change would not indicate any setback for Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who now holds the general secretary
position.
   The party conference in late June will occur after the Moscow
summit with President Reagan, which begins May 29.
   Arbatov told the newspaper that Gorbachev and his propaganda
chief, Alexander Yakovlev, had been in charge of crucial
ideological issues in the party ``from the very beginning.''
   Gorbachev had weathered a strong debate with the party's second
in command, Yegor Ligachev, in the Soviet press over his reform
program, Arbatov said.
   Another high-level Soviet official, Valentin Falin, told the
newspaper that reports that there would be major personnel shifts
in the ruling Politburo were untrue.
   Falin, a non-voting member of the committee, said Kremlin
leadership had decided not to make any significant changes in top
policy-making bodies.
   Falin also said Gorbachev had recently ``learned a lot that is
new to him'' about Stalin from documents he has reviewed outlining
crimes of the Stalin era. One document proves Stalin's role in
preparing trumped up cases against his political enemies, Nikolai
Bukharin and Lev Kamenev, Falin said.
   Meanwhile, other officials predicted the Soviet leader would
give an important speech on history, highlighting the Stalin era,
at the party conference.

<HEAD>Jackson, Far Behind Dukakis, Remains Determined As Another Primary

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis wrapped up
a California campaign swing Sunday as his persistent rival Jesse
Jackson pointedly told black students: ``Never surrender.''
Republican George Bush, meanwhile, hung out the ``gone fishing''
sign.
   Jackson and Dukakis were bracing for a primary battle on Tuesday
in Oregon, with 45 Democratic delegates up for grabs. A poll last
month suggested Dukakis was leading, but Jackson has campaigned
hard in Oregon, drawing huge, enthusiastic crowds.
   Jackson planned a final swing through the state on Monday, but
Dukakis was scheduled to devote the eve of the primary to taking
care of gubernatorial business in Massachusetts.
   Bush spent several hours Sunday fishing from a raft on the Rogue
River in Oregon, with the Secret Service and a floating press corps
for company. He didn't catch any fish, though.
   The vice president was flying to Seattle for an evening rally.
Washington was the only state the vice president lost on Super
Tuesday.
   Bush's sole remaining rival, Pat Robertson, who stayed in the
race long after he fell from contention, was poised to formally
halt his bid on Monday.
   The vice president attained a mathematical lock on the
nomination last month in the Pennsylvania primary, and picked up
the endorsement of his boss, President Reagan, last week. Robertson
endorsed him, too.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson were making brief stops Sunday in New
Jersey, which, along with California, holds a high-stakes contest
on June 7, the last day of the primary season.
   ``I smell victory in the air,'' an upbeat Dukakis told a crowd
at the New Jersey Democratic Convention in South Orange.
   Appearing before the same group, Jackson, without naming
Dukakis, criticized his rival's record as Massachusetts governor
and declared: ``I've earned every vote I've gained.''
   The two met briefly before their New Jersey appearances, and
Dukakis described their exchange as ``warm, pleasant, respectful.''
   California, with its primary prize of 314 Democratic and 175
Republican delegates, has been a frequent stumping ground for the
presidential trio. All three had appearances in the state last week.
   Dukakis, who left California Sunday after two days of
campaigning, got a less-than-friendly reception on Saturday from
gay activists in Los Angeles. The governor was grilled about his
reluctance to allow homosexual couples to act as foster parents.
   He planned to return to California later in the week, as did
Jackson.
   Aides to Dukakis are hoping the last big contests in California
and New Jersey will put Dukakis over the top in terms of delegates.
According to the latest AP delegate count, Dukakis has 1,610 to
Jackson's 956, of 2,081 needed to nominate.
   Dukakis refuses to discount Jackson's continuing candidacy, but
his talk has focused more and more on an expected confrontation
with Bush in November.
   ``I think the fact that in these early matchups between me and
the vice president, the fact that I am leading at least gives you
some sense ... that this is doable,'' Dukakis said over the
weekend, referring to polls suggesting that he could beat Bush in
the fall.
   Jackson was in Hampton, Va., on Sunday, giving a graduation
address at predominantly black Hampton University. His 61-year-old
mother-in-law, Gertrude Brown, was receiving her degree in social
work at the ceremony.
   Jackson, who has pushed ahead with his campaign despite a string
of losses to Dukakis, cited Mrs. Brown as someone who has overcome
obstacles and succeeded.
   ``She is of strong character, and she never surrendered,'' said
Jackson, who told of his mother-in-law's struggle to raise five
children while working full time. Three of those children, he said,
went on to receive advanced degrees.
   When her last child left home, Mrs. Brown returned to get her
high school diploma at age 49. Over the next 12 years, she
completed her college education.
   ``Against all odds she is graduating today. ... That is what
this graduation is all about,'' Jackson said. ``Never surrender.''
   He told the students that if elected, he would double federal
spending on education.

<HEAD>Soviets Suddenly Defensive Again About Chernobyl</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public fear of nuclear power and
unexpected criticism from the press suddenly have made Soviet
officials strikingly defensive about their efforts to deal with the
effects of the Chernobyl disaster.
   Comments by some officials during a conference on the medical
effects of the accident and a tour of the mammoth Chernobyl nuclear
power plant last week suggested they are worried that public
opposition could halt development of nuclear power in the Soviet
Union.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant's
No. 4 reactor killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of
radioactive material that eventually circled the globe.
   The Soviets were severely criticized in the West for not
immediately reporting the accident. Since then, they have opened an
international media center at Chernobyl, given more than 180 tours
of the plant and made other efforts to provide information about
their efforts to clean up after the accident.
   But even before getting down to the main work of their three-day
conference in Kiev, officials several times cited evidence of what
they called ``radiophobia,'' or an unreasonable fear of nuclear
power, among Soviet citizens.
   Alexander Kovalenko, chief spokesman for Kombinat, a state-run
organization that oversees the Chernobyl plant and the 18-mile
exclusion zone around it, said ``the public conception of the
accident was not less important than the technical problems.''
   Soviet specialists acknowledged that rumors of radioactive leaks
at Chernobyl still sweep Kiev, the capital of the Soviet Ukraine,
80 miles south of the plant.
   They said some people are afraid to have children because they
fear birth defects induced by radiation. Stress and stress-related
medical problems linked to the disaster are on the rise.
   Leonid Ilyin, head of the Soviet Institute of Biophysics,
described ``radiophobia'' as a psychological and political problem
that could damage the future of nuclear power. Rejection of nuclear
power is a ``lack of understanding of the reality of today, when
there is no alternative,'' he said.
   The Soviet media have reported that public opposition has halted
construction of nuclear power plants near the southern Ukrainian
city of Odessa, the Byelorussian capital of Minsk and the southern
Russian city of Krasnodar.
   Such action is extremely rare in a country where the only
protests for years have been conducted only by small bands of
dissenters.
   Despite the Chernobyl accident, the Soviet Union has committed
itself to an ambitious nuclear power program. Last April, Andranik
Petrosyants, head of the Soviet Atomic Energy Commission, said the
country planned to double the amount of electricity produced by
nuclear power between 1985 and 1990.
   The Soviets stressed that except for those who were treated for
radiation sickness immediately after the Chernobyl accident, they
have found no medical effects of the fire.
   They criticized American doctor Robert Gale and others who
publicize estimates of the possible number of cancer deaths from
the Chernobyl accident.
   Gale retorted that with the lack of such information provided by
Soviet scientists, ``Many people in Kiev worry about what will
happen to them.''
   Cancers caused by exposure to radiation from the plant could
take decades to form, doctors said.
   Kovalenko and Chernobyl plant manager Mikhail Umanets also were
stung by sharp criticism from an unexpected source, the official
Soviet media.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on April 24 complained of
shoddy work, drunkenness and nepotism at the Chernobyl plant.
   Umanets said in a meeting with reporters at the Chernobyl plant
that some of the criticisms were justified of Kombinat in general,
but not of workers at the Chernobyl plant.
   Kovalenko said he considered the Pravda article ``extremely
harmful'' but would use it to clear up misconceptions. The paper's
article cannot be considered a statement backed by the
policy-making Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, he
said.
   On a tour of the Chernobyl plant and its surroundings, officials
used radiation counters to stress to reporters that radiation
levels were not dangerous for the relatively brief periods for
which workers now are exposed.
   Kovalenko said 400 workers are housed for two weeks at a time in
Pripyat, about a mile from the Chernobyl plant. The city of almost
50,000 where plant workers once lived in large apartment blocks was
hurriedly evacuated 36 hours after the accident and has not been
resettled.
   Kovalenko said officials also have allowed as many as 500
elderly people who once lived inside the exclusion zone to return,
even though it technically is illegal.
   They face no danger, he said.

<TEXT>
   When President Reagan assumed office
nearly eight years ago, the United States took renewed interest in
Central America.
   There was a leftist government in Nicaragua, a strong
Marxist-led insurgency in El Salvador and a simmering guerrilla war
in Guatemala. Calm prevailed in Honduras, Panama, and Costa Rica _
all longtime American allies.
   Today, the Sandinista government in Nicaragua remains in power.
The civil war is intensifying in El Salvador, and Guatemalan troops
attempted a coup last week. Hondurans attacked a U.S. government
office last month.
   Relations with Panama are at an all-time low. Even Costa Rica's
usual tranquility has been disrupted.
   A series of American administrations paid little attention to
the small republics run by military officers or small, economically
powerful groups. In the late 1970s, Central America suddenly took
center stage.
   What happened?
   Here is a look at the situation in each country:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Nicaragua</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 1978-79 war waged by the Sandinistas against then President
Anastasio Somoza returned Central America to the spotlight. It was
capped by the Sandinistas' triumphant march into Managua on July
19, 1979, to end more than four decades of power by the rightist,
pro-American Somoza dynasty.
   Less than two years later, the CIA, claiming the Sandinistas
were hardened Marxists exporting revolution to El Salvador, began
training and supplying a group of rebels known today as the Contras.
   The 1981 cutoff of U.S. aid and the 1985 trade embargo failed to
bring the Sandinista government to its knees. Millions of dollars _
some covert and some congressionally approved _ were provided to
the Contras. Yet they were unable to defeat the Soviet-supplied
Sandinistas.
   Pushed by last summer's regional peace plan, the Sandinistas
signed a historic cease-fire pact with the Contra leadership on
March 23. A fragile truce remains in place, but the two sides can
agree on little else than a desire to the war that has claimed
50,000 dead and wounded.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Panama</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The strongest efforts yet to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
chief of the Defense Forces of Panama and the nation's de facto
leader, are approaching their first anniversary.
   Noriega was indicted in February by two federal grand juries in
Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   After the indictment, the Reagan administration pushed harder
for Noriega's ouster and imposed economic sanctions. Noriega was
holding firm, although an internal opposition continues pressing
for his departure, and there are reports from Washington of a
possible negotiated solution.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>El Salvador</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The United States gave little attention to the smallest of the
Central American nations until 1980, when it appeared that
Marxist-led guerrillas who began fighting a year earlier could
topple the government. Rightists struck out with vengeance,
slaughtering suspected leftists and dumping their bodies in San
Salvador streets.
   The United States has buoyed the government with more than $3
billion to date, more than any other nation in the region.
Congress, haunted by the memory of Vietnam, agreed in 1981 to send
American troops to train the unskilled Salvadoran military. But a
limit of 55 soldiers remains in effect.
   The war continues in the countryside. Human rights groups claim
more than 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed.
   The political parties are sharply divided. President Jose
Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic Party, backed by the United
States, suffered a humiliating defeat in March legislative and
municipal elections at the hands of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Guatemala</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The military government has been fighting a stubborn guerrilla
movement for decades. The Guatemalan army has boasted that its
``scorched earth'' tactics, aimed at Indian villages in the
northwest highlands, curbed the insurgency. Nonetheless, 27 years
later the rebels continue to fight.
   On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry announced it quashed an
uprising and arrested two officers who led it. The developments
raised doubts again about the stability of the return to civilian
rule in Guatemala under President Vinicio Cerezo, who is almost
midway through his five-year term.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Honduras</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This nation became the cornerstone of Reagan's Central American
policy. Acquiescing to the United States, Honduras allowed its
territory to be used by American troops and for Contra base camps.
   The Americans during military exercises built roads and
airports, all of which could serve as a beachhead for an invasion
of Nicaragua.
   Two events, starting in March, sparked protests in the normally
tranquil nation. Reagan sent 3,200 American soldiers to Honduras
during the latest border incursion by the Sandinistas, who were
hunting for Contras. In early April, a Honduran citizen was whisked
away to the United States to face drug trafficking charges,
although the Honduran constitution bars extradition.
   About 2,000 protesters enraged by the extradition burned the
U.S. Consulate and U.S. Information Service offices. The government
imposed a weeklong state of emergency to quell the violence.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Costa Rica</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Long considered the region's democratic showcase, Costa Rica
maintains its neutrality and serves as a leader in the effort to
promote peace. President Oscar Arias won last year's Nobel Peace
Prize for writing the plan signed last August by the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
   Nonetheless, Costa Rica has not been immune from the violence.
Last month, a fragmentation grenade exploded near the U.S.-Costa
Rica Cultural Center in the capital of San Jose, wounding five
people, including two American citizens.

<HEAD>Jovial Mayor Bud Clark Expects To Win Second Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bud Clark, Portland's exuberant
barkeep-turned-mayor, expects to defy political odds once more by
winning re-election despite a stormy first term.
   Clark shocked the city four years ago when he stepped out of his
Goose Hollow Inn and mounted a grass-roots campaign to unseat
incumbent Frank Ivancie, who had dismissed the newcomer's chances.
   In his first two years in office, however, Clark faced a series
of crises, mostly involving the city Police Bureau. Two police
chiefs resigned and Clark fired a third.
   Clark survived a recall attempt and so far has weathered
lawsuits filed by his most famous appointee, Penny Harrington, who
resigned 16 months after he made her the first female big-city
police chief in the United States.
   The last two years have been quieter, and Clark seems to have
regained public support.
   Recent polls, including one published Sunday, show he holds a
32-point lead over the nearest of 10 challengers in the
non-partisan race. Sunday's poll showed him holding 51 percent of
the vote, with a 4.9 percent margin of error. His campaign now is
focusing on getting over 50 percent in Tuesday's primary to avoid a
November runoff.
   ``He's well-liked,'' concedes one of his challengers, former
City Commissioner Lloyd Anderson. ``On a personal basis, people
think he is a decent human being. That's combined with a feeling by
many who think he's not doing a good job as mayor, that he could be
stronger from an administrative standpoint.
   ``Those running against him, for whatever reasons, have not made
as effective a case as they'd hoped for that the two ought to be
separated,'' Anderson says.
   Clark, 57, with his full gray beard, bulbous nose and twinkling
eyes, looks like Santa Claus and is nearly as identifiable to
Portlanders. He's a self-described populist who enjoys being among
his constituents and often can be seen riding his bicycle about
town or poling his canoe down Portland's Willamette River.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he were re-elected in the
primary,'' City Commissioner Dick Bogle says. ``People are going to
go into that booth and see that name, and the image they're going
to get is that beard and that twinkle, and they're going to punch
that hole.''
   The jovial mayor also is known for some mild eccentricities,
including his trademark cry of ``whoop, whoop'' at civic functions,
and his ever-present camera, which he uses to chronicle his mayoral
career.
   Back in his barkeeping days _ he still owns a bar but doesn't
run it anymore _ he also was known for posing for a humorous
poster, headlined ``Expose yourself to art,'' that gained
popularity on college campuses nationwide.
   Clark's accomplishments as mayor have been varied.
   He was instrumental in getting voters to approve a three-county
bond measure for a convention center that officials hope will
revitalize the city's inner east side.
   An ambitious plan to help the city's homeless has had mixed
success. It increased the number of shelter spaces, but the
homeless population remains large and is still a source of friction
for downtown businesses and workers.
   But Clark is credited with getting City Council members to work
together, increasing citizen involvement in city government, and
improving police relations with city neighborhoods.
   Crime is another matter. Portland has so little jail space that
suspected burglars and car thieves are given tickets and released.
The issue has dominated the campaign, yet Clark's opponents,
including two of his former police chiefs, so far have been unable
to capitalize on it.
   Candidate Ron Still, who retired as police chief shortly after
Clark took office, cites Clark's cuts in Police Bureau drug and
vice squads early in his term and the increase in drug trafficking
and gang activity that followed.
   ``The public image of Portland is it's a good place to come
because even if you do a crime you aren't going to go to jail. Much
of this is his fault,'' Still says.
   Clark admits crime and the police problems have been his
greatest frustrations. He says fighting crime and drug abuse are
his top priorities for the next four years.
   ``The credibility of the justice system in this city is very
bad,'' Clark says. ``It's not my responsibility directly, but I
look at it as I've got to make this system work because we've got
to get this crime turned around.''
   Although Clark has been criticized for his antics in office,
there have been few attacks on his personality during the campaign.
Candidate Jim Davis, whom Clark fired as police chief in an
argument over a bureau audit, was booed when he made such an attack
at a recent candidates' forum.
   Clark claims he's one of many famous mayors who have used
``certain antics in drawing attention to their city.''
   ``Having certain differences gives personality to your city and
makes it realize that you're a human being, too,'' he says.
   Surveys indicate Clark's popularity stems from his carefully
maintained image as a non-politician, an outsider without a big
political ego.
   ``I'm here strictly for bettering my city. I'm not here to make
a big name for myself,'' he says. ``I don't have any political
plans beyond this. I'll do four more years and then I'm going to
quit.''

   A man who broke into a convenience store,
drank several beers and fell asleep was arrested when it opened the
next morning, authorities said.
   Stephen Ray Kirkpatrick, 21, of Newberry County, was charged
with burglary in the break-in at Buddy's Open Air Market,
authorities said.
   Kirkpatrick was arrested early Thursday after the manager found
him sleeping behind the counter, with nine packs of cigarettes in
his coat lining and surrounded by 16 cans of beer, several of which
were empty, said Sheriff's Chief Deputy Tom Summer said
   Store manager Mac Jones said the man told him he was waiting for
the owner, ``but it looked to me like he just broke in and had
himself a little party.''
   Kirkpatrick, who is unemployed, was being held on $5,000 bond in
the county detention center, authorities said.

   A police chief and a former borough

occupants were on vacation.
   West Pike Run Police Chief Lawrence P. Harris, 42, and former
California Councilman Walter Weld, 38, were convicted Friday of
theft, criminal conspiracy and receiving stolen property. Weld also
was convicted of a second count of receiving stolen property.
   Harris, who also is a Washington County deputy sheriff, was

   The charges stem from a September break-in at the home of Harry

<HEAD>Last-Minute `Coups' Could Not Pull Out Victory For Chirac</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A late-breaking series of dramatic events in the
final days of the French presidential election promised to boost
then-Premier Jacques Chirac's chances for an upset victory.
   It wasn't enough. But there is evidence the government's
``coups'' did at least improve Chirac's losing score.
   In a 48-hour span, Chirac's conservative government welcomed
home three hostages from Lebanon, attacked a rebel cave hideout in
New Caledonia to rescue 23 other hostages while killing 19
separatists, and flew a French secret agent home from her Pacific
Island exile.
   Suddenly, people in cafes were asking if Chirac _ who had been
trailing far behind in polls _ might win after all. A previously
despondent Chirac campaign staff regained hope.
   But when the results were counted May 8, Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand waltzed to re-election with 54 percent of the
vote to Chirac's 46 percent.
   Because French law makes it illegal to publish polls in the last
week before an election, it is difficult to be certain what effect
the late-breaking news had on voters' decision _ beyond saying it
was not enough to sway the election.
   The final public polls, taken immediately after the April 24
first-round vote that eliminated all candidates except Mitterrand
and Chirac, found the president leading with from 53 percent to 57
percent of the vote, which was not far from the final result.
   ``All these efforts concentrated miraculously in one little week
were not enough,'' Edwy Plenel and Georges Marion commented in a
double-bylined article in the left-leaning daily Le Monde.
   ``The `coups' did not pay off. At best, in a zero-sum game, they
did not change the tendency. At worst, the bloodshed obscured the
lives saved and the gap was widened.''
   Patrice Desaubliaux, writing in the conservative newspaper Le
Figaro, came to almost the same conclusion: ``The events that
occurred between the two rounds do not seem to have had the
slightest effect.''
   But there is other evidence suggesting there was at least some
impact on voters in the final days.
   There were reports that the Chirac campaign's private tracking
polls showed the premier gaining more than a percentage point on
May 5 _ when news of the twin hostage liberations was published _
but falling back to his previous level in the next two days.
   A survey of voters as they left the polls, done for the
newspaper Le Parisien and the magazine L'Evenement du Jeudi, found
that 8 percent of Chirac's voters made up their minds in the final
days of the campaign, compared with just 4 percent of those who
voted for Mitterrand.
   The same poll found that 13 percent of those questioned said the
release of the French hostages in Lebanon affected their vote,
while 41 percent said it did not change their decision and the rest
would not respond.
   Among Chirac voters, the hostage release made a difference for
21 percent, but it was cited by only 7 percent of those who chose
Mitterrand.
   Similarly, the exit poll found the operation to rescue the 22
police and one assistant prosecutor held captive in New Caledonia
was an element in the decision of 14 percent of all French voters.
But 22 percent of Chirac's voters said the operation had an effect,
compared with only 8 percent of Mitterrand supporters.
   The pre-election drama began May 4, when Chirac announced to a
campaign rally that the last three French hostages held by Shiite
Moslem extremists in Lebanon had just been freed.
   Chirac was the first to shake the hands of magazine writer
Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine
when they stepped off the plane in Paris the next day.
   As they were flying home, Chirac ordered an attack on Melanesian
separatists who had been holding 23 hostages in a remote island
cave. All were freed unharmed, while 19 of the New Caledonian
captors were killed.
   Then, on May 6, the government announced that Dominique Prieur,
convicted of manslaughter in the sabotage of the protest ship
Rainbow Warrior, but considered a heroine by many in France, was
being flown home early from a Pacific atoll because she was
pregnant.
   The New Zealand government denounced Mrs. Prieur's return as a
violation of the agreement under which she had been allowed to
leave prison.
   All three events were credited to Chirac who, as premier,
controlled the government's day-to-day business.
   As president, Mitterrand's role is more detached, and he was not
expected to reap much benefit from the events, which were popular
beyond the ranks of Chirac supporters.
   Mitterrand's aides said Chirac dutifully kept the president
informed of the government's actions in the closing days of the
campaign.

   China has 670,000 beggars, and many have turned
to begging as an easy way to make money, an official newspaper said
today.
   The China Daily said the nation's first conference on the
homeless, which ended in Beijing last week, concluded that beggars
pose a hazard to social order and should rouse wide concern.
   The daily and other news reports said the number of beggars at
the end of 1987 was down from 1.05 million in 1979, but that there
has been a rise in ``professional'' beggars seeking money rather
than food.
   It said only 20 percent of those who beg do so because of
natural disasters or personal misfortunes. Most turn to begging for
the money, while others have mental problems or are runaways
escaping arranged marriages.

   Film critic Gene Shalit gets a chance to blow
off some hot air tonight, along with 39 other bassoonists at a
``Bassoon Monsoon.''
   The all-bassoon ensemble, which also will include Peter ``P.D.Q.
Bach'' Shickele, hopes to raise money to endow the bassoon chair of
the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.
   Shalit, of NBC's ``Today,'' and Shickele, who has performed as
Johann Sebastian Bach's ``long-lost son,'' said the bassoon was not
their instrument of choice.
   ``We had a very fine clarinetist in Fargo, North Dakota,'' said
Shickele. ``After a few years, I was sent to him for lessons. He
said, `Peter, you've picked up too many bad habits. It would be
easier to start over on a new instrument.'''
   Shalit also started with the clarinet. ``I didn't practice for a
few weeks,'' he said, ``and the teacher got furious.
   ``He took away my clarinet and as punishment he said, `From now
on, you're gonna play THIS.'''

<HEAD>Banished Pet Bear Leaves Suburban Home For Country</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thor, a 6-foot-2, 450-pound pet bear,
is enjoying his new country home after being forced out of the
suburbs, says a woman who calls herself his ``grandma.''
   ``Thor is very happy. He has a pond to splash around in,'' said
Walterine Crosby, mother of the cinnamon-black bear's owners.
   ``We miss him terribly,'' Mrs. Crosby said Sunday.
   Officials in this Minneapolis suburb had given Charles and
Deborah Crosby until Sunday to move the bruin from his backyard
home, citing an ordinance prohibiting the keeping of wild animals.
   Thor was moved Friday night to his new digs, which the couple
built on 12 acres outside city limits, Walterine Crosby said.
   His new den is made of earth-banked logs and features a
40-by-40-foot cage and a pond near the Crosbys' new home. The
nearest neighbors are miles away.
   The Bloomington City Council first tried to banish the bear last
fall after someone called City Hall to report the bear. The order
was delayed because Thor was hibernating and nobody wanted to wake
him up.
   Charles and Deborah Crosby said they had planned to move before
the council banished the bear.
   In Bloomington, Thor hibernated in a fenced-in, concrete den
built into a hill in the backyard. In the summer, he wandered
around the backyard, restrained by a logging-chain collar and a
fence.
   The bear has never hurt anyone, say the Crosbys, who got Thor
from a game farm when he was a 5-week-old cub. His front claws have
been removed and he's been trained to respond to the command,
``Don't touch.''

<HEAD>Soviet Conference Likely to be More Important than Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. experts on the Soviet Union expect little
from the Moscow summit and are looking beyond it to an early summer
Communist Party conference which by all accounts will be a
watershed in Soviet politics.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev appears likely to survive for at least a
couple more years as the party's general secretary, but he has
failed to gain full control of the policy-making Central Committee,
the 300-plus member body that so far has stymied his far-reaching
reform efforts, according to the experts.
   They view the summit primarily as part of Gorbachev's effort to
cement his control.
   Gorbachev's reforms so far have not improved Soviet living
standards, according to Western dispatches from Moscow and a recent
analysis by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   His biggest success has been in the foreign policy arena:
improving the image of the Soviet Union around the world by
improving relations with the United States, by making arms control
proposals and by agreeing to withdraw the Red Army from Afghanistan.
   He can brighten his own image further, at home and abroad, by
playing host in the Kremlin to a smiling Ronald Reagan, who built a
career on anti-communism and who began his presidency by branding
the Soviet Union the ``evil empire.''
   ``Probably the most important thing Gorbachev needs is the
symbolism of having Ronald Reagan in Moscow,'' said Marshall
Shulman, a Columbia University lecturer and a top Carter
administration expert on Soviet affairs.
   American and Soviet officials have lowered public expectations
for the summit, as the Senate delayed ratification of an arms
control treaty signed last December and U.S. and Soviet negotiators
remain far apart on a proposed pact to sharply cut strategic
arsenals.
   But, said a senior government analyst who spoke on condition of
anonymity, ``both parties want to see the summit come off smoothly.
They don't want any embarrassments. They have made progress in the
relationship.''
   Shulman agreed that ``a successful, symbolic summit would be
useful for Gorbachev, but it would not solve his problems. His
basic problems are rooted in the domestic economy.''
   A summit marred by disagreements, on the other hand, could
weaken Gorbachev's case at home, said the senior U.S. government
analyst.
   ``The ferment in the Soviet leadership is as great as at any
time since the 1920's,'' said the government expert. ``But this
will not be played out at the summit. We won't see much disarray
there.''
   Gorbachev and his chief rival on the ruling Politburo, Yegor
Ligachev, are expected to maintain their harmonious front, at least
through the summit, said the analyst.
   That is unless Gorbachev manages to ease Ligachev from the
powerful party secretariat into the largely ceremonial post of
president, now held by Andrei Gromyko, another Politburo member
thought to be wary of sweeping reforms.
   Under this scenario, which could be played out at meetings of
the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet expected the week
before the May 29-June 2 summit, Ligachev would probably remain in
the Politburo but Gromyko would not.
   However, the Central Committee has been a thorn in Gorbachev's
side, and may balk at leadership changes until he can gain greater
control over it.
   At the most recent party congress, in early 1987, Gorbachev
replaced about 40 percent of the Central Committee, but needs to
fill another 15 to 20 percent of the seats with his people for a
comfortable majority, said Shulman.
   The party conference is his chance to do that.
   Some of the 5,000 or so conference delegates have been selected
by local and regional Communist Party bodies, and Gorbachev has
started trying to ``unselect'' those he believes will oppose him,
said Shulman.
   Since Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985, the Central
Committee has balked at some his most radical ideas, such as
limiting the tenure of party officials, having secret ballots and
allowing more than one candidate for elections.
   Gorbachev wants to push those through and persuade the committee
to accept his view on what the Soviets call ``the question of
questions: what the role of the party will be,'' said Shulman, just
back from Moscow.
   Gorbachev, agreed the senior government analyst, ``would like
the party out of the details. He wants the party to have
macro-vision, not to micro-manage.''
   Gorbachev's vision, as perceived by Shulman and the government
analyst, is for the Communist Party _ whose members now make up 10
percent of the population _ to set broad policy and exercise
general control over the country.
   The Central Committee, many of whose members are the
middle-level managers whose role Gorbachev seeks to reduce, so far
have balked at surrendering the party's minute-by-minute control
over all Soviet institutions.

<HEAD>His Mother-In-Law's Struggle To Win Diploma Becomes Symbol For
Jackson</HEAD>

   To her daughter, she was the ``chief example
of my life.'' To her classmates, she was a grandmother who
sometimes seemed as young as they. To her son-in-law, Jesse
Jackson, she was a symbol of stubborn determination in the face of
overwhelming odds.
   On Sunday, Gertrude Brown graduated from college at the age of
61. And Jackson, who continues his quest for the Democratic
presidential nomination despite mounting obstacles, was here to pay
tribute to her.
   For Mrs. Brown, a teen-age unwed mother and high-school dropout
who went on to raise five children, a college diploma was a
lifelong dream.
   ``She is of strong character, and she never surrendered,''
Jackson told the crowd of 11,000 at commencement ceremonies for
predominantly black Hampton University.
   ``Against all odds she is graduating today. ... That is what
this graduation is all about,'' he said.
   Jackson has always cited humble beginnings as a source of
strength. He did so again Sunday as he praised the mother of his
wife, Jacqueline.
   He opened his speech with a biblical story from the Book of Acts
about a shipwreck. Those who could swam to shore, while the others
clung to broken pieces of the ship to survive, he said.
   ``I want to talk today about the challenge to keep hope alive _
of making it on broken pieces,'' said Jackson. ``Keep hope alive.
Keep hope alive.''
   He described Mrs. Brown's battle to raise her family and educate
her children while working full time. Three of her children went on
to win advanced degrees, he said.
   ``I can remember her as a struggling young woman, who was a
positive person, a realist,'' said daughter Jacqueline in an
interview. ``I can also remember a number of whippings because my
vocabulary contained phrases like `I can't.' She was my chief
example in life.''
   When she was 49, Mrs. Brown got her high school diploma. Then
she slowly began her college education, still working full time,
taking one or two classes a semester.
   The degree she won Sunday was in social work. Mrs. Brown said
she wanted skills to help people _ especially teen-agers who become
parents, as she did. She retains a special fondness for young
people.
   ``I'll miss all those students on campus _ they were like my
grandchildren, but they talked to me like I was their age,'' she
said.
   Jackson spoke to the students of fighting for change _ in one's
own life and the life of the nation.
   ``We must keep America strong, and make America better. How we
relate to the least of these _ the children in the dawn of life,
poor people in the pit of life, old folks in the sunset of life _
is a measurement of our character,'' he said.
   He talked about the civil rights movement, invoking events that
happened before these students were born.
   ``We worked through blood and smiled through our tears to get to
this juncture in the road,'' he told them.
   And he semed to allude, with pride, to his own fight for the
nomination.
   ``The struggle must continue,'' he said. ``We must not
surrender.''
   As for Mrs. Brown, she was savoring her success _ and looking
ahead.
   ``I'm not stopping here,'' she said. ``I'm going to get my
master's degree.''

<HEAD>Pat Robertson Formally Giving Up The Fight For The Nomination</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: News conference at noon EDT</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson, the former television
evangelist who failed to turn the fervent support of his
``invisible army'' into a significant share of Republican votes,
was formally ending his presidential bid today.
   At the outset of the 1988 presidential race, Robertson was a
wild card.
   The Republican establishment nervously eyed his evangelical
followers and his hefty warchest and wondered what kind of a
showing he might make. Since many Robertson supporters were new to
the political process, his potential impact was difficult to gauge.
   In the end, Robertson spent $22 million and gained only 46
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   Robertson set the stage for his departure last week by endorsing
the Republican nominee-to-be, George Bush, who already has a
mathematical lock on the nomination.
   He was holding a press conference today at his home to make
official what has been clear to observers for months _ that
Robertson is not in contention for the Republican presidential
nomination.
   The former television evangelist was expected to hang onto his
delegates until the convention, then release them to Bush on the
first ballot.
   The high point of the Robertson campaign came early on _ the
Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses, where he beat out Bush for second place,
behind Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   But in the next big battle _ the New Hampshire primary _
Robertson finished behind not only Bush and Dole, but also behind
New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.
   Even then, Robertson gave every indication that he expected to
make a comeback in the South, with its March 8 mega-primary.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he told his supporters after the
disappointing showing in New Hampshire, ``tomorrow I go into the
South, and then we are going to be playing in my own backyard.''
   His backyard proved an unfriendly place. In the Southern
primaries, he finished no better than second place _ in Texas _ and
was third in his home state of Virginia.
   Robertson continued to do well in the caucus states, winning in
Hawaii, Nevada, Washington and Alaska, and doing well in Minnesota
and Alaska.
   But by mid-March Robertson was no longer even competing in
states with primaries. He concentrated his scaled-down campaign on
the caucuses, started talking about 1992, and about making his mark
at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans this summer.
   ``I am the true conservative candidate and I will bring that
voice to the convention,'' he said. Robertson said he hoped to
shape the party's platform, bringing it in line with his
conservative views.
   ``I want a platform like the 1984 platform _ for school prayer,
against abortion, for family values,'' he said.
   The Robertson campaign was not without its other-worldly moments.
   On Easter Sunday, Robertson told a Denver congregation his
presidential bid was divinely inspired.
   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _
running for president,'' he said. And it wasn't over yet, he told
the faithful.
   ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundation
for a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... but
I am not going to quit ... that is His plan for me and for this
nation,'' Robertson said.
   Other signposts on the Robertson campaign trail:
   _He sued former Rep. Paul McCloskey for libel when McCloskey
said Robertson used the influence of his father _ then a U.S.
senator from Virginia _ to avoid combat in the Korean War. After
some messy preliminaries, Robertson dropped the suit because it was
to go to trial on Super Tuesday. He was ordered to pay court costs.
   _He contended it was unfair and bigoted to describe him as a
former television evangelist, although that was how he became
famous. He said cable businessman or religious broadcaster would be
more accurate.
   _His claim, in a New Hampshire debate, that there were nuclear
missiles in Cuba aimed at this country. Robertson later said he had
no firsthand information, but insisted that ``nobody really
knows.'' The contention was denied by the White House, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and others.
   _His charges that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger
``wanted to sterilize blacks, Jews, mental defectives, and
fundamentalist Christians.'' Planned Parenthood officials dismissed
the allegation. Scholars who have studied Sanger's writings said
there was no basis for the claim.
   _Robertson's claim that the State Department chose to ignore
intelligence gathered by his Christian Broadcasting Network people
in Beirut on the location of some American hostages. The former CBN
bureau chief in Beirut later said he had no such information.
   _And statements that one can get AIDS through casual contact,
contradicting medical experts' findings on the subject. He also
advocated shooting down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs into
the country.
   Robertson has said he will return to the television network he
founded nearly 30 years ago to help shore up its financial
position. Since Robertson left CBN to campaign, donations have
fallen dramatically and several hundred workers have been laid off.
   Robertson also promised to form a political action committee to
train and fund conservative Christian political candidates.

   Stars of the new ``Gidget'' and the old
``Star Trek'' television series joined nearly 1,000 people for a
weekend walk-a-thon to raise money for the homeless.
   Mayor Tom Bradley greeted actress Caryn Richman, the new
``Gidget,'' and Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed
Chekov and Lt. Uhuru in the original ``Star Trek'' series and
movies, as the walk began Saturday.
   The San Fernando Valley Mayor's Fund, a volunteer group, will
distribute money brought in by the 6.6-mile event. Figures were not
available Sunday, but organizers had estimated it would raise
$24,000.
   ``People are beginning to realize that we are not talking about
homeless on Skid Row, we are talking about families and
neighbors,'' said actress Marsha Hunt, a founder of the fund.

   Singer-actress Rita Moreno, who has won every
major award from the Grammy to the Oscar, was installed as honorary
mayor of Pacific Palisades, an affluent neighborhood overlooking
Santa Monica Bay.
   ``You may ask how a simple girl like me became honorary mayor of
Pacific Palisades?'' she told the installation audience Sunday.
``As a matter of fact, I was running for honorary governor of all
of California until I handed the final negotiations over to the
William Morris Agency, my agents. ... Well, I'll have to settle for
being honorary mayor.''
   Miss Moreno, 56, who starred in the movie ``West Side Story,''
made it clear she will be more than just a ceremonial official.
   ``I certainly plan to break all precedent and get involved,''
she said. ``When I told one of the Chamber (of Commerce) directors
that I intend to attend meetings, she almost dropped the phone.''
   She plans to push a pilot recycling program, and drew cheers
with a pointed remark about planned oil drilling along the coast.
   ``I'm rather conservationist,'' she said. ``I turned off the
pilot light in the gas range years ago. I don't use the electric
dryer. I use a clothesline.'' She also refuses double bags at the
grocery store and grows her own tomatoes and herbs.
   Her two-year tenure follows that of comedian Chevy Chase, who
attended the installation along with such celebrities as Debbie
Reynolds and Dick Van Patten.

   Comedian Lucille Ball was released from
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after nearly a week's stay, a spokesman
said.
   ``She's doing fine,'' said hospital spokesman Ron Wise, after
the 76-year-old Miss Ball was released Sunday afternoon.
   Miss Ball was brought in Wednesday by her husband, Gary Morton,
after complaining that she did not feel well, Wise said.
   ``There was initial concern that she was having cardiac
problems, but subsequent tests indicated that her general condition
was good,'' Wise said.
   He did not know if doctors had determined the problem, but ``if
it was anything significant, she wouldn't have been out this
fast,'' Wise said.
   The comedian usually has a yearly checkup at the medical center,
and last year underwent surgery there to remove a cyst from her
thyroid gland, Wise said.

   The 23-year-old Underwood, who received his degree Sunday, said
he was determined to get it one way or another, even though it was
irrelevant in terms of his acting career.
   ``In the industry, you walk into an audition and they don't say,
`Do you have your college degree?' They just want to know if you
look the part, can you play the part. That's it,'' he said.
   ``But for me, I just wanted to finish. I hate starting something
and leaving it hang.''
   Underwood left Carnegie Mellon's drama department midway through
his junior year and headed for New York.
   Last season after various television roles and commercials,
Underwood joined ``L.A. Law,'' produced by another Carnegie Mellon
alumnus, Steven Bochco. The show's creators were looking for a
young black actor to portray an entertainment attorney.
   Carnegie Mellon officials allowed Underwood to use his acting
experience toward a student internship. His final research paper
for graduation was entitled ``The Business of Show.''

   Robert Redford presented his film ``The
Milagro Beanfield War'' at the Cannes Film Festival even though it
wasn't entered in the festival's competition.
   The movie, directed by Redford, is about the inhabitants of
Milagro, a small town in New Mexico, and a resident who diverts
water from a real estate development to irrigate a patch of his
land.
   Although the movie is not entered in the competition, Redford
said he brought it to Cannes ``because the film is very important
for me and I was in the neighborhood.''
   ``The rampant development that's going on in the U.S. should be
questioned,'' he said Sunday. ``But there is also the need to
preserve a 400-year-old culture.''

   Former White House chief of staff Donald T.
Regan, who says he can take it as well as dish it out, gets a
chance to prove it one week after taking literary swipes at the
president and first lady Nancy Reagan.
   In a book coming out this week, one-time presidential domestic
policy adviser Martin Anderson pictures Regan as a cocksure aide
following his own impulses, ``apparently unaware of the potential
cost to President Reagan.''
   Anderson's isn't the only counterpunch thrown at Regan, whose
book ``For the Record'' depicts the president as a hesitant
decision-maker and says the first lady meddled in White House
affairs, often on the basis of astrological advice.
   David M. Abshire, a special White House counselor during the
Iran-Contra crisis, writes in The Washington Post that Regan
``often seemed more concerned with his own welfare _ how he would
come out _ than with the president's.''
   Both Regan's book, which came out last week, and Anderson's are
published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.
   On the CBS television program ``Face the Nation'' Sunday, Regan
said, ``I think I have been very fair and very honest.''
   Of the ensuing criticism, he said, ``Sure, they have to hurt,
somewhat. But, look, I'm a big boy. I've been around, and I knew
this was coming. So, I'm prepared to take it.''
   Anderson, who interviewed Regan among others in preparation for
his book, ``Revolution,'' discusses the former chief of staff's
decision in October 1985 to disband a group of government economic
advisers.
   The group, the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board, of
which Anderson became a member after leaving the White House in
1982, met with the president four times a year. Regan, after moving
to the White House from his previous post as secretary of the
treasury, refused to renew the executive order creating it.
   ``As chief of staff, with unprecedented power delegated to him
by President Reagan, Regan evidently decided to tidy up the policy
advisory structure,'' Anderson wrote in his book. ``And nobody
outside a small group in the inner, upper reaches of the White
House knew it. Probably not even President Reagan.
   ``It was a small incident but it revealed something about Donald
Regan's character _ such a strong degree of assurance and
self-confidence in his own judgment _ that he unhesitatingly
followed his impulse, apparently unaware of the potential cost to
President Reagan. It was a hint of a character flaw that would be
deepened and widened by the decisions forced upon him in the months
that followed, a flaw that perhaps helped plunge President Reagan
into the abyss of the Iran-Contra affair within a year.''
   In February 1987, the presidentially appointed Tower Commission
said that Regan ``must bear primary responsibility for the chaos
that descended on the White House'' after the revelations of secret
arms sales to Iran and diversion of funds to Nicaraguan rebels.
   At this time, Abshire wrote in an article published Sunday in
the Post, he called on Regan and recommended that he ``step out
now, rather than be pushed out'' and that he ``write a book ... on
the high ground _ about the genuine dilemmas of government and the
White House.''
   ``He took neither the advice to leave earlier, nor to write a
high-minded book,'' said Abshire. ``He went out not with dignity
but, as he said, `like a shoe clerk.'''
   Regan, in his book, wrote that his dismissal as chief of staff
was ``the bitterest event of my life'' and ``destroyed my
friendship with the president to whom I had devoted six years of
loyal and (as it seemed to me) unselfish service.''
   Asked Sunday if he had made mistakes in his relations with Mrs.
Reagan, Regan said, ``To the extent that she wants yes-men around
her, I was not a yes-man and that was a mistake.''
   Abshire, however, wrote that Mrs. Reagan, while the president
was convalescing from prostate surgery early in 1987, ``did exactly
the opposite'' of Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, who cut off access to
President Wilson after he suffered a stroke.
   ``Nancy Reagan encouraged me to speak up and tell the president
frankly about the problems that faced his presidency,'' the former
counselor wrote. ``My dealings with the first lady impressed me
first, that she is a political realist and, second, that she does
not dominate this strong-minded president.''

<HEAD>When It Comes To Running Mates, Conventional Wisdom Isn't Always
So Wise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush was an 11th-hour choice by Ronald
Reagan in 1980. Lyndon Johnson was written off as a potential
running mate for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Spiro Agnew was unknown
until Richard Nixon tapped him in 1968 and Bob Dole was at the top
of nobody's list in 1976 _ except Gerald Ford's.
   When it comes to picking running mates, history indicates the
nominees may turn to someone the handicappers considered a long
shot, or didn't consider at all.
   The conventional wisdom has it that Democrat Michael Dukakis
would have to choose a Southerner as his vice presidential running
mate and Republican George Bush must choose a conservative as his
second. But there are a dozen possible choices that fit neither
bill.
   Here is a rundown of the names most often mentioned in both
parties, starting with the Democrats:
   JESSE JACKSON _ He'll enter the Democratic convention in July
with the second largest bloc of delegates and the allegiance of
millions of black voters. Former President Jimmy Carter calls
Jackson ``amazingly attractive.'' But many party leaders consider
Jackson too controversial and likely to hurt the ticket. Party
chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. points out that only once since the turn
of the century has a presidential nominee offered a place on the
ticket to his leading rival. ``If I were to finish second, it
wouldn't entitle me to anything more than consideration. Period,''
Dukakis said.
   SAM NUNN _ A favorite of fellow Southerners, the Georgian is
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and perceived by
supporters as blunting Republican criticism that the Democrats are
anti-defense. Nunn's conservative voting record on domestic issues
and opposition to some civil rights legislation and the Equal
Rights Amendment generate opposition among liberals.
   BOB GRAHAM _ A popular former governor of Florida, Graham is in
his first Senate term. His limited service in Congress works
against him if Dukakis is looking for someone to balance his own
lack of Washington experience. But if he brings 21 Southern
electoral votes, who needs Washington experience?
   LLOYD BENTSEN _ With 29 electoral votes, Texas is an even bigger
Southern prize than Florida and one that has often been critical to
Democratic victories. ``I have no interest in it,'' says the
senator. More important is the question of whether Bentsen could
deliver the state Bush most often calls home.
   DALE BUMPERS _ The Arkansas senator is one of the party's best
speakers and sounds unmistakably Southern even though his voting
record makes him a favorite of liberals. Bumpers has 13 years of
experience in Congress, but can he help Dukakis anywhere other than
Arkansas, which has only six electoral votes?
   ALBERT GORE JR. _ Gore, a Tennessee senator, carried primaries
in four Southern states as well as his home state, proving his
popularity in the pivotal region, and he also holds acceptable
credentials in defense and foreign policy. But he took some nasty
shots at Dukakis during the primary campaign.
   JOHN GLENN _ A Glenn boomlet developed when anti-Nunn Democrats
looked around for somebody with strong defense credentials but a
more liberal record on domestic issues. Glenn, an Ohio senator,
still is revered by many as the former Marine colonel who was the
first American to orbit earth. On the down side is his disastrous
1984 presidential campaign and the fact he comes from a state that
Dukakis ought to be able to carry without him.
   On the Republican side, Bush has the advantage of waiting until
Dukakis makes his choice. Here are some of the GOP prospects:
   GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN _ If he could give Bush a lock on California's
47 electoral votes, the richest prize in the nation, Deukmejian
would be a tempting choice. But the governor and many of his fellow
Californians are worried that he would be succeeded in Sacramento
by a Democrat if elected vice president.
   JACK KEMP _ He was a conservative favorite in the race for the
presidential nomination, but failed to show an ability to get
votes. His biggest plus would be if Bush felt he needed to make a
gesture to the party's right wing. Kemp is a New York congressman,
but Bush needs more than Buffalo to carry the state.
   LAMAR ALEXANDER _ The former Tennessee governor won praise for
innovative programs that improved Tennessee's schools during his
two terms as governor. Bush is known to consult Alexander on
education issues. He has the ability to appeal to both moderates
and conservatives.
   BOB DOLE _ An unlikely choice after a campaign in which he
repeatedly belittled Bush's credentials. But the Kansas senator is
strongest where Bush is weakest _ in the Farm Belt. Bush choosing
Dole would be on a par with Kennedy choosing Johnson.
   ELIZABETH DOLE _ A far more likely choice than her husband. An
appealing campaigner from North Carolina, she helps Bush among
women voters, a group where pollsters say he is weakest. Mrs. Dole,
the former transportation secretary, also is a favorite of Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, which scores a lot of points with
conservatives. Detractors blame her for chaos in the airline
industry. Her husband could prove another negative.
   JAMES THOMPSON _ As governor of Illinois, Thompson has big-state
credentials. But during 12 years as governor, he has made enough
enemies that polls suggest he might not be able to deliver his
state.
   THE WESTERNERS _ Colorado Sen. William Armstrong, former Nevada
Sen. Paul Laxalt, and Interior Secretary Donald Hodel. Long shots
all. Not a big batch of electoral votes among them and if Bush
needs them to carry their states, he's probably not going to become
president.
   THE MODERATES _ White House chief of staff Howard Baker, New
Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum are out of
step with the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan. One of the most
popular politicians in the history of New Jersey, Kean would
probably trigger a conservative revolt if put on the ticket.
Conservatives still resent Baker for his role in passage of the
Panama Canal treaty. Kassebaum's voting record is one of the most
liberal of any Republican in Congress.

   Four men killed a Japanese
businessman and his Filipino maid and terrorized his household for
10 hours before fleeing early today with cash and jewelry, police
said.
   Police identified the dead Japanese as Hichiro Kubota, 51, who
operated Starlight Promotions, a company which recruits Filipino
entertainers to work in Japan. He was found in his bedroom with
multiple stab wounds in the chest.
   Manila radio station DZXL said the assailants fled with about
$50,000 in cash and jewelry.
   According to police, the four men, one of whom was a former
employee, entered the home in the financial district of Makati late
Sunday night.
   They tied up Kubota, his two maids and his Filipino common-law
wife and ransacked the house. Police said Kubota's companion
telephoned police after the assailants fled this morning.
   Police found one of the maids dead in the bathroom. She was
naked and apparently had been raped, they said. Another maid and
Kubota's common-law wife suffered minor injuries, police said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Astrology Didn't Hurt Reagan Like Iran-Contra Did</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is always looking for good
news, and if the experts are right there's a sunny way of assessing
the disclosures in Donald Regan's book.
   According to historians and political scientists, Reagan has not
been damaged much by the former aide's revelation about astrology
at the White House and his portrayal of Reagan as an out-of-touch
leader who merely followed a script from his staff.
   On the other hand, they say the reason the latest disclosures
haven't hurt him is that Reagan already had been devastated by the
Iran-Contra affair and couldn't be hurt much more.
   Lucky for Reagan that all of this is coming out at the end of
his presidency instead of at the beginning.
   Imagine how a new president would be weakened and ridiculed when
the world learned that an astrologer commissioned by his wife
played a role in White House affairs.
   ``Virtually every move and decision the Reagans made during my
time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance by a
woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that
the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise,''
wrote Regan, who was the president's chief of staff until he was
ousted with a push from the first lady.
   Regan also documented that the president issued no orders, but
``listened, acquiesced, played his role and waited for the next act
to be written.''
   Embarrassing as those stories are, they come at the end of
Reagan's administration, when he doesn't have much of an agenda
left to push and his reputation has been established.
   The world leaders who are his friends probably won't pay much
attention to the latest news. And his enemies already had a
negative view of him, anyway.
   Tom Griscom, the White House chief of communications, brushes
aside suggestions that Regan's book, ``For the Record,'' has
wounded the president.
   ``I don't think it really matters one way or the other,''
Griscom said. ``I think this president has had a tremendous impact
on the policies of this country. I think nobody will be able to
take that away from him. It's there.''
   Moreover, Griscom believes it will not spoil Reagan's summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   Harvard University historian Adam Ulam agrees. ``I don't think
they pay any attention to it. Why should they?'' Ulam said. ``I
think that they deal with facts. They don't deal with ... gossip.''
   Duke University political scientist and author James David
Barber said, ``I don't know that this (disclosure) is really going
to sustain itself very long. Reagan has this talent for joking
these things off.''
   However, Barber said, ``Reagan's personal credibility in
international affairs regarding his relations with informed chiefs
of state has been wiped out for a long time'' because of the
revelation that he was secretly sending weapons to Iran while
publicly vowing that the United States would not deal with
terrorists.
   ``I don't think it's likely that Gorbachev is naive about, if
you hear something out of the mouth of this Ronald Reagan,
therefore you can put your money on the table,'' Barber said.
   More important than the news about astrology, Barber said, is
the picture of Reagan as president. Barber said it showed Reagan as
``a smiling loafer ... like Harding or Taft.''
   Political scientist Theodore Lowi of Cornell University said
that ``presidents as heads of state don't lose their credibility
all that fast in the eyes of world leaders.''
   He said the impact of Regan's disclosures was ``minuscule, if at
all.''
   ``The biggest effect on Reagan's presidency has already happened
_ which is the Iran-Contra affair,'' Lowi said. ``It's still
happening. The second biggest one is the Ed Meese affair. ...
   ``The effect has been quite damaging. It damages the credibility
in a very fundamental, ethical sense _ the Iran-Contra affair
primarily and Meese's (troubles) being substantial but of secondary
importance.''
   Meese, the attorney general, is under investigation for several
matters, and there have been high-level Justice Department
resignations by officials who say Meese's problems have undermined
the agency's effectiveness.
   Discounting the impact of Regan's book, Lowi said the president
``has handled it extremely well: a bit of humor, a light touch and
a bit of injured indignation. ... This is the sort of thing where
Reagan is supremely capable.''

   Within days of the attack on the USS Stark,
Iraq accepted responsibility for what it called a case of mistaken
identity and pledged to compensate the victims and Navy.
   Administration officials who ask not to be identified say it
could be years, however, before any money changes hands.
   Last month, after notifying the families of the 37 men killed,
the United States presented Iraq with a claim for wrongful death in
each case. The amount of each claim varied depending on the
expected lifetime earnings and other actuarial information for each
victim.
   A State Department source said the United States had been
working on presentation of those claims to Iraq for months. The
official declined to give the total dollar figure, but said it was
``in the tens of millions.''
   There has been no response from the Iraqis.
   Still to be determined is the size of the claim the United
States will submit for the damage to the Stark itself. The Navy
decided to perform an overhaul on the Stark as long as it was going
into drydock, and now must figure the precise cost of the battle
damage repairs.
   The State Department official estimated it would take another
six months before that claim is figured and forwarded to the Iraqis.
   The source refused to speculate on how long it would take for
money to change hands, citing the case of the USS Liberty.
   That ship was attacked by Israel during the 1967 Middle East
war. The final claim for damages was not paid until 1980, despite
the close ties between the United States and Israel.
   In the case of Iraq, the sources predicted long negotiations
would be necessary to resolve the matter, in part because Iraq will
probably try to avoid setting any precedent that could be used by
merchant ships it has attacked over the years.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaign Picking Up `Super Delegates'; Jackson Gets Few</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Michael Dukakis tightens his grip on the
Democratic presidential nomination, party leaders are moving
increasingly to join his camp. Few, however, are throwing their
support these days to Jesse Jackson.
   In the weeks since his make-or-break victory in the Wisconsin
primary, the Massachusetts governor has picked up support from 69
of the party's ``super delegates,'' while Jackson has gained just
six, according to a survey by The Associated Press.
   In all, Dukakis has 1,610 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, of whom 203 are super delegates _ the 643 party leaders
and politicians whose titles won them seats as delegates. Dukakis
is now more than three-quarters of the way to the 2,081 delegates
needed to win the party's presidential nomination.
   ``It follows success with the voters,'' said Tad Devine,
director of delegate selection for the Dukakis campaign. ``It all
began in Wisconsin.''
   Jackson has 956 delegates overall, 52 of whom are super
delegates. Another 331 super delegates are uncommitted.
   Jackson has complained that super delegates, who are free to
support whomever they choose, are not following the will of the
voters and that Dukakis is receiving more than his fair share.
   But Iowa party chairwoman Bonnie Campbell, who recently
announced her support for Dukakis, said Jackson's complaint is
unfounded.
   ``Reverend Jackson or his people were in on the decision-making
process that led to rules governing the entire nominating
procedure,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``He, in fact, signed off on the
rules. Therefore he's somewhat foreclosed from complaining.''
   Dukakis, who had been stung in Jackson's landslide victory in
Michigan on March 26, came back to win the Wisconsin primary 10
days later and went on to win the primaries in New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Nebraska and West Virginia.
   Although the super delegates are not required to declare their
allegiance to any presidential candidate, some are being drawn to
the Dukakis campaign as if by the force of gravity caused by his
string of victories and his wide lead in the delegate count.
   ``It's a two-person race, and I don't think it's going to be
close,'' said Robert Dryfoos, a New York super delegate who
recently came out in support of Dukakis.
   ``There was a time it was a very tight race,'' Dryfoos said.
``Now Mike Dukakis is clearly, comfortably and overwhelmingly ahead
of Jesse Jackson as they get to the nomination. He's going to be
the nominee.''
   The Dukakis campaign has put considerable organization and
effort into courting both the super delegates and those who were
pledged to candidates who have quit campaigning.
   Sue Pate, an uncommitted delegate from Texas, said she has been
impressed by the contact she's had with the Dukakis campaign.
   ``They've really been doing their homework,'' she said. ``They
call me every second. They are not abusive. They are friendly and
helpful.''
   Winberg Chai, who was picked as a South Dakota delegate
supporting Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, said he planned to
support Jackson after Gephardt dropped out.
   But the Jackson campaign contacted him only once and did not
send any of the candidate's position papers, Chai said. He has
switched to Dukakis.
   Some delegates have been falling away from Sens. Paul Simon of
Illinois and Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, both of whom put their
presidential campaigns on hold.
   Gore now has 32 super delegates, a decline of 17 in recent
weeks, and Simon has 22, a drop of seven. Overall, Gore has 403
delegates and Simon has 174, according to the AP delegate count.

<HEAD>Bennett Says `I Know I'm Popular;' Would Seek Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing Education Secretary William J.
Bennett says ``I know that I'm popular'' and if there is a
political race in his future, it will be for the White House.
   Such an effort may be years away, Bennett said in an interview,
``but after watching some of the people in the stakes for the
presidency, I could do that well.''
   ``I won't mention anybody in particular,'' the outspoken
educator said, but he added that he was referring to both
Republicans and Democrats.
   He brought up the White House himself when asked if he aspired
to run for the Senate.
   Bennett said he has had overtures about possible Senate races
from his native state of New York, his adopted state of North
Carolina and from Maryland, where he now lives.
   But he said neither the Senate, nor the possibility of a college
presidency, holds any interest for him.
   ``Right now, if I were going to run for anything in the future,
I'd want to run for president,'' he volunteered.
   Asked about the vice presidency, Bennett said, ``I'm not sure
I'd make a very good No. 2 man. I like to run things.''
   Vice President George Bush, who has locked up the GOP
nomination, says he wants to be ``the education president.'' But
his campaign has kept its distance from Bennett, who has warred
with teacher unions and pilloried college presidents.
   Bennett did not mention Bush by name, but said, ``We'll probably
have a good Republican president in '88 who'll be there for a
couple of terms. If I do this, this could be way in the future.''
   Bennett informed President Reagan last Monday he is quitting the
Cabinet in mid-September to write and lecture. He then declared at
a congressional hearing the next day that if the Education
Department is saved, he will deserve most of the credit.
   A lifelong Democrat, Bennett switched to the GOP in May 1986, 15
months after Reagan put him in the Cabinet. He has proven a big
draw at Republican functions across the country.
   Asked if he was now wedded to the GOP, the 44-year-old Bennett
replied, ``Probably.''
   Only probably?
   ``Well, sure. Look, I was a Democrat. I shifted to the
Republican Party because the Democrats left the ranch and deserted
their principles. I don't see that happening in the Republican
Party. But I put country above party, always have,'' he said.
   ``This will no doubt shock by sheer chutzpah some of my critics,
but we were not political. We were principled and a lot of our
principles ... went to the heart of what Ronald Reagan stands for
and what a lot of liberal Democrats stand against,'' he said.
   ``I know that I'm popular with audiences out there in the
country, and it doesn't seem to make much difference whether
they're Democrats or Republicans,'' he said.
   He agreed his relations with the education establishment may be
at their nadir, but ``I would bet my relations with the American
people are at an all-time high.''
   He said he ``probably drove some people crazy'' by speaking out
at Cabinet meetings on issues other than education.
   He decided early on that ``I may never have a job like this
again, so I'm going to do it all the way.''
   Sometimes, ``people rolled their eyes and said, `There he goes
again,''' he related. ``I talked about drugs a lot, use of the
military, and Justice Ginsburg, AIDS and Nicaragua, but I decided I
wasn't going to leave this job and say, `Darn it! I should have
said this! Boy, if I had it to do all over again ...'''
   Bennett took it upon himself to call Douglas Ginsburg to urge
him to withdraw as a Supreme Court nominee after Ginsburg's
admission that he smoked marijuana while a Harvard law professor.
   But Bennett said he has not considered making such a call to his

<NOTE>EDS: Ramos meets with Carlucci 10 a.m. EDT; may be led</NOTE>

   The threat to the Philippines from right-wing
soldiers has dwindled and the danger posed by communist insurgents
has leveled off, says Philippine Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos.
   Ramos, who has been welcomed by some Philippine-American
supporters as a hoped-for successor to President Corazon Aquino, is
making a 10-day visit to the United States that includes meetings
with top U.S. officials.
   His message is that his country cannot lick the communist threat
with military force alone but still needs more military aid, said
Philippine government spokesman Ben David.
   Ramos, a West Point graduate who became authoritarian ruler
Ferdinand Marcos' No. 2 military commander and then helped lead the
February 1986 revolution that overthrew him, was meeting today with
U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. He has meetings scheduled
later in his visit with Secretary of State George Shultz, members
of Congress and other officials.
   ``We are now on the upgrade. We have gotten out of the very deep
hole where we found ourselves in February 1986,'' Ramos told a
mostly Filipino-American gathering Saturday night in the Washington
area.
   But he said the country still faces serious problems, including
poverty, social injustice, the need for land reform and better
education.
   Ramos said new reforms and the failure of communist-supported
candidates in elections have helped limit growth of the insurgency
that arose during Marcos' 20-year rule.
   But he said the communist rebels are still a significant force,
with up to 23,000 fighters, about two-thirds of whom are armed. He
said that number has changed little since Aquino came to power.
   ``We have observed a leveling off in their strength,'' he said,
noting that the communists were unable to defeat ratification of
the constitution or elect more than a couple of candidates to
Congress.
   Asked about the threat from ex-Col. Gregorio Honasan, who
escaped after his arrest for attempting a coup last August, Ramos
said renegade soldiers do not have the support or power to
overthrow the government.
   ``People have been turned off against them,'' he said, noting
that more than 50 people were killed in Honasan's coup attempt.
   ``We feel that while they have the capability of hitting and
running, their ability to undo the government is now very, very
diminished,'' Ramos said.
   The military, he said, also has ``gone back to basics'' in its
training, instilling principles that will prevent other soldiers
from rebelling.
   In response to questions about whether he harbors presidential
ambitions, Ramos said only that he planned to serve the government
for two more years, which he said would not include 1992 when Mrs.
Aquino's term ends. The constitution does not allow her to run for
re-election.
   The Philippine official's visit comes as the Reagan
administration is planning a $10 billion multinational program to
aid the financially troubled Philippines. Proposed by a bipartisan
congressional group, the plan calls for the administration to lead
an effort to gather both public and private assistance from several
countries.
   At the same time, U.S. and Philippine teams are meeting in
Manila to review agreements allowing U.S. military bases in the
country. Philippine officials have talked about huge increases in
what the United States pays for use of the bases _ now about $180
million a year.
   Speaking of the multinational aid plan, Ramos said, ``I want to
express the appreciation of our people for this gesture. I hope it
will not be just a gesture but will be manifested in real material
aid because our people need it.''
   Ramos added, however, that the government is also trying to make
the country more independent by trying to foster self-reliant
attitudes, discipline and unity among its people.

<HEAD>Attention of Jackson Chairman Diverted By His Own Political
Problems</HEAD>

   The final push is on for California's
crucial presidential primary, and Jesse Jackson's national campaign
chairman, Willie Brown, should be in the thick of it.
   Instead, Brown is busy fighting a bid to oust him from his job
as speaker of the assembly, traditionally the second most powerful
post in the state.
   Twice in the last week, dissidents have tried unsuccessfully to
remove Brown from his job _ the first such attempts since he became
speaker 7{ years ago.
   Brown's own political problems could diminish his usefulness to
Jackson as the clock ticks down on the June 7 contest. However,
Brown _ as the black leader of a predominantly white legislative
body and a formidable fund-raiser _ remains a force to be reckoned
with.
   Known for his flamboyant style, Brown has already ruffled some
feathers in the rest of the Jackson campaign.
   He stirred up trouble last month when he told a New York Times
reporter that a Dukakis-Jackson matchup ``would be a good ticket.''
The comment came at a time when Jackson was trying to dampen talk
that he was interested in something other than the nomination.
   Brown tried to back off the next day, saying he meant that while
a Dukakis-Jackson ticket would be good, ``a Jackson-Dukakis ticket
would be the best for the Democrats.'' But the damage was done.
   Brown also has recently said that the sooner Democratic Party
Chairman Paul Kirk leaves, ``the better the party will be'' _ a
statement that might not have endeared him to party regulars.
   He told reporters in Washington that Dukakis ``doesn't come out
of Massachusetts with a great record'' on civil rights. And he told
the Wall Street Journal that the party should not try to register
white voters ``until we're sure every black and every Hispanic is
registered.''
   Despite such stumbles, Brown is still sounding confident _ about
keeping the speakership, and about Jackson's chances in California.
   ``I think he wins California,'' he said this week of Jackson's
prospects, dismissing polls indicating Jackson trails Dukakis.
   Brown's prominence in the Jackson's campaign is a factor,
although not a major one, in his own political troubles.
   He became speaker in December 1980 by putting together a
coalition of Republicans and Democrats after a yearlong battle for
the speakership between other Democratic legislators. His principal
opponents now are five Democrats, mostly moderates from rural
areas, who call themselves the Gang of Five.
   They were once close to Brown, enjoying prestigious committee
assignments and chairmanships. But they broke with Brown last
winter, complaining that he had stacked committees with liberals to
kill bills, particularly anti-crime measures, supported by the
public.
   Brown struck back at the Gang, stripping them of chairmanships,
moving them to the smallest offices in the Capitol and at one point
removing four of them from all committee assignments.
   One of the five, Assemblyman Charles Calderon of Montebello, has
criticized Brown for heading the Jackson campaign.
   Calderon told his hometown San Gabriel Daily Tribune last
January that Brown ``rides around in a Ferrari, wears mink coats
and competes with Clint Eastwood and other stars for notoriety.''
   ``The final straw,'' Calderon continued, ``came when Willie
Brown announced he was going to be the chair of the Jesse Jackson
campaign committee.''
   Brown's association with Jackson ``will be an extreme liability
for Democrats who are marginal'' and face GOP challenges this year,
Calderon said.
   Brown, for his part, has been attacking his foes in typically
colorful terms.
   ``In a divorce situation, give me the kids or something, don't
suggest there was something wrong with me when you slept with me
the first time,'' he said at a news conference last month.
   Even if he is feeling the heat, Brown has joked about the
attempts to get him out. Speaking to reporters, he made mention of
a luncheon he was invited to.
   ``I was invited as speaker. I would hate to go and say, `You
invited the wrong man,''' he said.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis, back at the Statehouse today after a Western campaign
swing, is making apparent Republican nominee George Bush the target
of his criticism and seeking to avoid harsh words about rival Jesse
Jackson.
   Jackson was campaigning today in Oregon, which holds its primary
Tuesday. But Dukakis, after two days of campaigning in California
and Oregon, flew home Sunday night.
   On the way home, Dukakis made a brief stop in South Orange,
N.J., for a statewide Democratic dinner, and attacked the Reagan
administration.
   ``I don't want to see another four years or another eight years
like the last seven,'' Dukakis told New Jersey Democrats. ``Our
nation can't afford it, our children don't deserve it and our
economy can't sustain it.''
   Jackson also addressed the group, and the two met briefly
beforehand. Dukakis declined to give any details, but said he and
his rival had a ``warm, pleasant, respectful'' discussion.
   In California, polls in California show him with a substantial
lead over Jackson. Dukakis aides acknowledge they are campaigning
in California with an eyes both on the June 7 contest with Jackson
and a fall meeting with Bush.
   At a stop in Los Angeles on Saturday, for instance, Dukakis
abandoned his usual appeal to ignore the polls and instead cited
the ones showing him with a lead over the vice president, both in
California and nationwide.
   ``Although I'm always skeptical of poll numbers and early
matchups,'' he said, ``I think the fact that in these early
matchups between me and the vice president, the fact that I am
leading at least gives you some sense ... that this is do-able.''
   At a weekend meeting with gay political activists in Los
Angeles, Dukakis faced perhaps the most hostile encounter of his
presidential campaign.
   He faced shouts of ``bigot'' as gay leaders challenged him on
issues of concern to homosexuals. But their central complaint
revolved around allowing homosexual couples to become foster
parents _ an issue on which Dukakis is unlikely to be hurt among
the larger voting population.
   Dukakis planned to return to California to campaign by midweek.

   Joe Duncan, whose dark-blue state trooper
uniform has been traded in for the prison whites of death row, says
if all legal appeals fail, he will beg to be executed for the
murder of his trooper girlfriend.
   ``If we develop the evidence we expect to in the next few weeks,
I'll get a new trial,'' Duncan said last week during his first
interview from death row at Holman Prison.
   But if the appeals fail, the only choices are life without
parole, or death. Duncan, 33, speaking amid clanging metal doors
and inmates' yells, said he would prefer execution.
   ``If I had no chance of getting out of this institution ... I'd
beg them to put me in the electric chair,'' he said.
   Duncan was sentenced April 12 in the shooting death of Trooper
Elizabeth Cobb, 31, whose body was found Oct. 12 in her parked
patrol car behind a church where Duncan said they used to meet. She
was shot three times in the head.
   Duncan initially denied even knowing where the church was
located. But he changed his story, saying he found Miss Cobb's
still-warm body, and failed to tell anyone for fear of being
implicated.
   Jurors recommended life without parole for Duncan after
prosecutors presented a case based mostly on circumstantial
evidence stemming from Duncan's taped statements to investigators.
   Circuit Judge J.C. Norton, however, overturned the
recommendation and sentenced him to death.
   On May 12, Duncan's attorneys formally asked Norton for a new
trial. Among their reasons was an allegation that an unidentified
juror may have known Duncan and Miss Cobb.
   Officials believe Duncan is the state's first law officer to be
sentenced to death.
   ``There is no way (to explain) what it's like to go from an
Alabama state trooper _ and I'm talking about probably the most
prestigous law enforcement job in this state _ to death row in six
months,'' said Duncan.
   Prosecutors said Duncan killed Miss Cobb to collect $350,000
from a life insurance policy that went into effect 10 days before
her death. They said the policy was taken out June 30, and that
Duncan was named as beneficiary.
   Duncan said he developed a ``romantic relationship'' with Miss
Cobb in early June and that they almost immediately began
discussing marriage.
   ``If Joe Duncan had put a gun to Elizabeth's head and killed her
for money, he ought to be put to death,'' said Duncan.
   But Duncan, a 10-year law enforcement veteran, said he could
have pulled off Miss Cobb's murder had he wanted. ``I could have
done it in a manner that wouldn't have pointed a finger at me.''
   He said the chief prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General Bill
Wasden, misrepresented the facts while the judge allowed jurors to
hear illegal evidence.
   For instance, he said the prosecution lied when it said he was
badly in debt and needed the insurance money to pay, among other
things, child support for his four children from a previous
marriage.
   Duncan said he could have presented documented evidence that
most of his debts were cleared in October.
   Duncan said he was pleased with his attorneys, but
``dissatisfied with the defense we went with.''
   Duncan did not have harsh words for the jury, saying he could
see ``where they probably came up with guilty (verdict).''
   Duncan, who is among Alabama's 96 inmates awaiting execution,
said he does not know whether anyone he helped put in jail might be
imprisoned at Holman.
   He is receiving special security arrangements. Inmates are
cleared from halls when Duncan is coming through, and he exercises
alone for 45 minutes a day in a fenced area he compared to a dog
run.
   ``The inmates have been better to me than the institution has,''
he said. ``The animals at the Birmingham zoo are in more humane
conditions than what we're in. ...
   ``In my cell, when I stand beside my bunk I can't take one step
without hitting the wall.''

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Three In Attack On Pub In Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two gunmen opened fire on a
lunch-time crowd in a pub patronized by Roman Catholics, and police
said three people were killed and six wounded.
   The gunmen escaped in a stolen taxi after the attack on Sunday.
   The incident fueled fears of reprisals in the sectarian warfare
that has ravaged this predominantly Protestant British province
since 1969.
   An anonymous telephone caller to the British Broadcasting Corp.
claimed responsibility in the name of the Protestant Action Force,
which has been linked to outlawed paramilitary groups responsible
for assassinating scores of Catholics in the early 1970s.
   However, the BBC said the caller did not give a recognized code.
   Witnesses said there were about 20 people in the Avenue Bar in
Union Street when the attack occurred. The gunmen had stolen a taxi
in the nearby Protestant Shankill Road just before the attack and
afterward drove off in the direction of the Shankill, police said.
   Police said two people died at the scene and the third was
pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. They identified the
victims as Damien Devlin, 24, Paul McBride, 27, and Stephen McGahan.
   Ten people were taken to hospitals, six with gunshot wounds and
four suffering from shock, police said.
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Tom King, called the
killings a ``revolting outrage.''
   Gerry Adams, president of the Irish Republican Army's legal
political wing, Sinn Fein, said the attack was ``an attempt at
premeditated mass murder.''
   The gunmen rang the pub bell and were admitted through the
electronically operated door, witnesses said.
   ``A guy came in and took his time looking around and then
started shooting,'' said one witness, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Then the other one came in behind him and started
shooting at people. It was just indiscriminate; people were trying
to dive for cover but they had no chance.''
   Moments after the shooting, three priests arrived to administer
last rites to the dead.
   Police and troops rushed into the area and set up roadblocks,
and an army helicopter hovered above.
   Witnesses said a patrol of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a mainly
Protestant security force, was near the pub during the attack but
appeared to have seen nothing and carried on with its normal duties.

   The close-up is a simple picture
of quiet relaxation _ a man wearing a U.S. Forest Service hat casts
his line into the water in hopes of hooking a spring Chinook salmon.
   But the wide-angle view is different _ Vice President George
Bush fishing with rafts, kayaks and boats full of Secret Service
agents, reporters, camera crews and high-tech communications gear
trailing him down the rapids.
   And above on the cliffs is the motorcade _ limousine, police
cars and ambulance moving slowly down the road Sunday.
   For presidential nominees-to-be, almost nothing is simple. Add
the complications of being an incumbent vice president and the
entourage grows even more.
   Such a break in the middle of a weeklong Western campaign swing
is not just a matter of deciding to rent a boat. Bush's seven-mile
ride down this southern Oregon river involved nearly 100 people, on
the river and on the shore.
   The trip echoed the environmental themes Bush is trying to
emphasize in advance of the Oregon primary Tuesday and to lay the
groundwork for the general election battle in the Pacific
Northwest. Bush is scheduled to visit a tree research lab near
Seattle and give an environmental speech later in the day.
   The vice president spent much of Sunday out in the brilliant
spring sunshine.
   ``One bite, one strike,'' Bush said as he climbed into the
14-foot fishing boat to start the day.
   Ducks and osprey flew overhead in the morning sunshine as Bush
floated past other fishermen and small dredges used to mine gold
from the river.
   Three hours later, Bush had to admit to a little boy on shore
that the bite never came.
   ``No, but we sure had fun,'' Bush replied, smiling, ``just being
out on that beautiful river ... We had a most relaxed morning,
clearing the mind. I feel rejuvenated.''
   At a campaign rally later in Seattle, Bush joked that his
fishing exploits were not just bad luck.
   ``They had all the fish chased away so we didn't get a bite,''
he said.
   Four separate expedition companies provided the rafts and boats
for the journey. Nineteen watercraft in all were used.
   The main Bush flotilla included seven boats, ranging from a
kayak to a jet-powered sheriff's patrol boat.
   Bush was in a 14-foot fishing boat, rowed by a guide and
accompanied by a Secret Service agent.
   Several other boats and rafts carried more agents, Bush staff,
Bureau of Land Management executives and communications gear. One
sported a complicated antenna that can _ and did _ communicate
through a satellite while in the river valley near Grants Pass, Ore.
   Two large rafts held 12 news people, including two television
camera crews.
   Bush stopped along the way to talk to several people standing on
the shore and frequently waved to onlookers from the woods and the
cliffs.
   The river trip was not a campaign swing in the usual sense, but
it had an environmental emphasis in step with the themes Bush is
hitting in Oregon and Washington.
   Bush has said he wants to take the environmental issue away from
the Democrats, that he wants to be remembered as Teddy Roosevelt
was, a president who cared greatly for the environment and worked
hard to preserve it.
   ``That's a Republican constituency,'' Bush told about 1,000
supporters at a Seattle rally late Sunday. ``I want to leave a
legacy of unspoiled land and water to our children and our
children's children.''
   On Saturday, Bush visited a U.S. Forest Service tree nursery,
where 25 million seedlings are being grown for reforesting the
Oregon and California hillsides.
   After the trip, Bush was asked if he could fish better than
likely Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis.
   ``I think so. I done it all my life. ... Fishing requires
experience,'' Bush said.
   And the GOP heir apparent was asked if he had seen any piranha
in the river _ a reference to an image he used earlier in the week.
   ``No, but I saw some on the bridge,'' Bush said.
   When there were questions about the extent of President Reagan's
fervor in endorsing him, Bush blamed it on the pundits and the
media.
   ``This is what I call a piranha circling in the water over what
they think is a drop of blood. They're going to starve to death
because there is nothing there, nothing there,'' he said in
Albuquerque, N.M. ``It's totally absurd.''
   Later, reporters covering Bush sported buttons saying ``Piranha
(voracious).''

   A bus carrying a church group home from
an amusement park became a fiery deathtrap when a pickup truck
traveling the wrong way on an interstate crashed into it, killing
27 people, authorities said.
   It was one of the worst bus accidents in U.S. history, the
National Transportation Safety Board said. Between 30 and 40 people
were injured in the crash, many suffering from burns.
   The bus, carrying 67 teen-agers and adults from the First
Assembly of God Church in Radcliff, about 35 miles south of
Louisville, was headed south on Interstate 71 when the accident
occurred about 10:55 p.m. Saturday. The group was returning from
Kings Island amusement park north of Cincinnati.
   As word of the accident spread, distraught relatives clutching
dental and medical records arrived here Sunday to help identify the
dead.
   The U.S. Army provided vans to transport family members from
Radcliff to Carrollton, about 75 miles away, and state police
escorted the parents to a local hotel.
   State Medical Examiner Dr. George Nichols met with about 60
family members at the Holiday Inn at about noon. He said he did not
want family members to view the charred remains, which he said
would be identified with dental records.
   ``The picture ... of their children in that room is not what
they have in their memories or wallets,'' he said.
   Nichols would not release a list of victims although he said all
parents had been notified. He said preliminary examinations
indicated the 19 female and eight male victims all died of smoke
inhalation.
   Nichols said it appeared all the victims were trying to flee the
flames. He said 25 bodies seemed headed toward the back of the bus,
one woman was found facing the front door, and the body of the
driver was found near the steering wheel with a fire extinguisher
pin nearby.
   At least eight of the injured, including the truck driver, were
in critical condition Sunday, according to police and hospital
officials.
   State Police Trooper Jim Mudd said blood was taken from both
drivers for testing, as is the usual practice in Kentucky in such
cases, but results probably would not be released until the case is
submitted to a grand jury.
   ``I just heard a crash, felt the impact of the car (truck) and
looked up and saw flames,'' said 14-year-old Wayne Cox, an
asthmatic who suffered smoke inhalation. ``They spread pretty fast.
... I was pinned. Everything was pretty wild. I was under a lot of
people. That's probably what saved me from getting burned.''
   The flames quickly worked their way from the front to the rear
of the bus, survivors said, leaving only the back door and windows
as escape routes.
   Cox, a Radcliff Middle School eighth-grader, said he lost his
shoes while wiggling out of the bus. His blond hair was singed by
the flames and his shirt was charred.
   Jason Booher, 13, also an eighth-grade student at Radcliff
Middle School, said he and another youth helped pull people out of
the bus.
   Booher said he assisted survivors on the ground outside the back
door, while a Meade County High School student, Jamie Hardesty,
stood just inside the door and pushed people out.
   ``Jamie, he pushed everyone out,'' Booher said. ``He was up in
the bus and I was out the back door of the bus, helping those who
were hurt.''
   Booher said Jamie, who survived but could not be reached after
he left the hospital Sunday, played ``a big part. He saved a lot.''
   Patrick Presley, a truck driver from Dallas and one of the first
on the scene, said a second explosion filled the bus with flames
and smoke and prevented more rescues after the initial impact.
   The charred hull of the bus _ with bodies still inside _ was
moved to the National Guard armory in Carrollton at 7:30 a.m. A
handful of family members looked on as the wreckage, shrouded by a
large tarp, entered the back of the armory, which is serving as the
morgue, Mudd said.
   At midafternoon, Nichols announced that the number of bodies
found on the bus was 27. Earlier, the death toll had been given as
at least 26.
   Carroll County Coroner James Dunn said the bus had been refueled
just before the accident. He speculated the gas tank may have
ruptured, spewing gas all over the bus and passengers.
   Mike Sodrel, who operates an intercity charter and tour service
and is a director of the American Bus Association trade group, said
gasoline-powered school buses like the 1977 Ford in the wreck are
not designed for high-speed highway use. He said intercity coaches
use diesel fuel, which has a higher flash point.
   Mudd said it was not known how long or why the Toyota pickup was
traveling the wrong way on the interstate.
   No charges have been filed against the driver, Larry W. Mahoney,
34, of Worthville in Carroll County.
   Nichols said ``visual identification is impossible'' and said
the process of identifying the bodies through dental charts and
other clues could take several days.
   ``This is a horrible task for anyone who cares for human life
... for such a joyous occasion to end in such sad tragedy,'' Mudd
said.
   Denny Brown, chief of the Campbellsburg Volunteer Fire
Department, the first to arrive on the scene, said the survivors
``were standing all the way up and down the road here.''
   Steve Watkins, youth minister at the Ghent Baptist Church near
Carrollton, was among those called in to help counsel the parents.
   ``They're in shock; that's all I can say,'' he said.
   The Radcliff church held a special prayer service Sunday as the
family members of those killed began their trek to Carrollton.
   Alan Pollock, a spokesman for the NTSB in Washington, D.C., said
a team of investigators had been dispatched.
   ``Obviously, they will looking at the integrity of the bus ...
and trying to find out what started the fire,'' he said.
   What is believed to be the worst bus accident in U.S. history
occurred in 1963 when a bus collided with a train near Salinas,
Calif., killing 32 farm workers.

   In 1933, Brooklyn College staged a competition
to choose an official anthem. The winner began with these
inspirational lines:
   ``On campus green, with towers of marble
   Lifting white spires in the air.
   Oh, Brooklyn is our Alma Mater,
   And she is wondrous fair.''
   Not to mention wondrous gullible. Those lyrics, it turns out a
half century later, were a joke, and the college has decided to
adopt a new alma mater.
   In 1933, the college was a new, working-class school spread out
in rented space in a half-dozen buildings in downtown Brooklyn.
There was no campus green, no towers of marble to lift white spires
in the air.
   But a professor decided that the college needed an alma mater.
   The contestants included Sylvia Fine, who would later marry
entertainer Danny Kaye and become a songwriter, and Robert Friend,
who would later move to Israel and become a serious poet.
   Miss Fine, an earnest music student, wrote her score in the
style of a 19th century German university anthem. Friend, a
rebellious young leftist, wrote his lyrics to parody the genre and
sarcastically acknowledge the school's gritty surroundings.
   But Friend's satire was lost on the college community, even
though his classmate Irwin Shaw once described the old campus as
``a scatter of buildings which we shared with running packs of
lawyers, (and) lofts whose previous tenants had gone broke. There
was a burlesque hall you hurried past on your way from Victorian
Poetry to Economics 1.''
   In the official college history, a graduate recalls pushing his
way through ``a crowd of lawyers, politicians, businessmen and
office workers ... to the sound of auto horns and trolley gongs''
on Smith Avenue. The gym, in the basement of a loft building,
featured a ceiling 8 feet high.
   Over the years, the song's words and music came to be credited,
incorrectly, to Sylvia Fine Kaye, who never cared for them. She
cleared up the misconception at a college awards luncheon two years
ago, and offered to write new music and lyrics that would
acknowledge the college's move in 1936 to a pleasant new campus
with trees and grass.
   But there was a problem: she was reluctant to proceed without
Friend's permission, and no one knew where he was.
   There things stood until two months ago, when college president
Robert L. Hess was in Jerusalem at a Brooklyn College alumni
reunion.
   In walked Friend, who recoiled when Hess hailed him as the
``Alma Mater'' lyricist.
   ``Please, I really want to forget about that,'' he said.
   Friend, it turned out, was an established poet who had published
several volumes, one dedicated to the college's students and
teachers. Now he was embarrassed by the poetic lengths to which his
youthful radicalism had pushed him.
   ``I decided I would write a parody of alma maters,'' he said.
``Brooklyn College had just opened, and I thought (a traditional
alma mater) was terribly inappropriate. Who needed it?''
   He told Hess: ``I wish you'd get a new alma mater.''
   Back in New York, Hess notified Mrs. Kaye, who produced a new
song entitled, ``A Field in Flatbush.''
   Its opening lines:
   ``On a former field in Flatbush,
   Now a campus lush and green,
   Proudly stands our Alma Mater,
   Ever lovely and serene.''
   Hess says he thinks the song is a big improvement, and not
because the composer recently donated $250,000 to the scholarship
fund.
   ``I thought the old one was unsingable,'' he said. ``The lyrics
were not right for something as down to earth as Brooklyn College.''

<HEAD>Growth Forecast But Interest Rise Prompts Recession Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for economic growth are good
this year but interest rates, if they continue to rise, threaten to
topple the United States into a recession by the end of 1989, the
country's business leaders say.
   Most members of the Business Council, composed of 61 chief
executives of some of the nation's largest companies, say business
so far in 1988 is better than they expected at the end of 1987,
when many were worried about the effects of the October stock
market crash.
   Now, the executives, with the exception of those heading
financial service firms such as brokerage and insurance companies,
report signs of moderate or better growth.
   ``The car business is going great, actually stronger than any of
us anticipated,'' said Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors
Corp.
   Other executives attending the council's twice-a-year meeting
last weekend at The Homestead, a posh resort in the mountains of
western Virginia, echoed Smith's sentiments, reporting other signs
of strong demand.
   ``We're seeing a surprising increase in demand for motor
gasoline in the United States, at least 2 percentage points above
what we expected,'' said George M. Keller, chairman of Chevron Corp.
   But amid the satisfaction over the country's more than
5-year-old business expansion, the longest since the 1960s, was
concern that possible renewed inflation could trigger rising
interest rates.
   Charles W. Parry, retired chairman of the Aluminum Company of
America, said prices of metals, chemicals and other basic
commodities are up significantly.
   Such a rise ``often has been a precursor of an increase in
inflation rates ... and that has me a little bit worried,'' Parry
said.
   A forecast, representing a consensus of economists employed by
Business Council member companies, predicts modest growth as
measured by the gross national product of 2.4 percent this year.
That compares with 3.8 percent in 1987.
   a Inflationary signs ... remain muted,'' the economists said,
predicting a rise in consumer prices of 3.9 percent this year and
4.6 percent in 1989, compared with 4.4 percent last year.
   However, the economists sounded a warning that overly robust
growth ``could produce an unavoidable rise in interest rates and a
recession before the end of 1989.''
   Underscoring the warning, major banks raised their prime lending
rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent only two days before the council
began its meeting.
   Interest rates already seem to be outstripping the council's
forecasts, which were prepared about a week in advance of the
conference.
   The average yield on 30-year bonds issued by the Treasury last
week was 9.17 percent. The executives were looking for an average
rate on 30-year bonds of 8.9 percent this year and 9.3 percent next
year.
   However, Willard C. Butcher, chairman of the Chase Manhattan
Bank, said, ``I think we're overdoing fears of inflation'' and
suggested that interest rates may fall back a bit by the end of
1988.
   Although the economy is doing a little better than expected,
growth is still moderate, he said.
   ``We tend to be more worried today about how the economy does
against how we predicted than how it actually does,'' he said.

<HEAD>Treaty Debate Could Begin Tuesday in Senate</HEAD>

   The Senate could begin debate as early as
Tuesday on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty, opening a
race to ratify it before President Reagan's summit with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Just 13 days remain before the May 29 opening of the Moscow
summit, and it is an open question whether the Senate can conclude
debate on the landmark arms control pact in the time remaining.
   The last pre-debate hurdle came today as the Senate's Foreign
Relations, Intelligence and Armed Services committee held hearings
to examine the anti-cheating arrangements agreed to in Geneva last
week by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Reagan wants to take a ratified treaty to the Kremlin to spur
further arms control progress, especially on the Strategic Arms
Reduction or START treaty aimed at cutting long-range nuclear arms
by as much as 50 percent.
   Many senators of both parties join the president in that hope.
   But hope may not carry the day.
   Most vote counts show that in the final tally the Senate will
consent to the ratification of the pact by an overwhelming margin,
far greater than the required 67 votes.
   But opponents could slow the pace of debate to a crawl,
demanding votes on amendment after amendment.
   The leading treaty foe, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., says he has
``something like a dozen'' amendments ready for debate.
   One would require the withdrawal of all U.S. military forces
from Europe on grounds that the treaty's required elimination of
U.S. medium-range Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles
would leave them defenseless.
   The amendment would have the effect of repudiating U.S.
participation in the NATO alliance and it is unlikely to be adopted.
   After a briefing on Friday by national security adviser Colin
Powell, the chairmen and ranking Republican members of those
committees told reporters their initial reaction was that Shultz
had persuaded the Soviets to back away from unacceptable
restrictions on on-site inspection on each of nine issues raised.
   But Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said
he would schedule debate on the treaties only after the three
committees met and agreed the verification arrangements are in U.S.
national security interests.
   Byrd has promised to open debate ``immediately'' once he gets
clearance from the three committees. That could mean as early as
Tuesday if no further snags develop.
   Byrd has insisted throughout that the treaty is too important to
tie its consideration to ``an artificial, arbitrary, automatic
calendar deadline'' such as the date of the summit opening.
   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces, or INF, treaty at their Washington summit last December. It
requires the total elimination of U.S. and Soviet missiles with a
range of between 300 and 3,400 miles.
   The treaty is an arms control landmark even though by itself it
requires a reduction of only about 4 percent of the missiles in
superpower nuclear arsenals.
   If ratified, it will be the first arms control treaty to go into
effect since the Anti-ballistic Missile or ABM treaty was ratified
in 1972.
   It also is the first arms control treaty actually to reduce
nuclear weapons rather than to impose ceilings on how many missiles
each side can possess. The reductions require the elimination of an
entire class of missiles designed to carry nuclear weapons to their
targets.
   Arms control supporters hope that will open the door to the much
deeper cuts in intercontinental strategic weapons envisioned in the
START treaty.
   The INF treaty also represents another sort of arms control
breakthrough _ it marks the first time the Soviet Union has ever
accepted any form of on-site inspection on Soviet soil to verify
compliance with an arms control agreement and detect cheating.
   U.S. negotiators hope Soviet acceptance of on-site inspection
for the INF can be used as a building-block precedent for a treaty
reducing strategic long-range arms by up to 50 percent.
   But such a treaty would be far more difficult to monitor because
of the far greater number of weapons involved and because not all
weapons of a single class would be destroyed.

   A ban on imports of strategic metals from
South Africa would cost the U.S. economy at least $1.85 billion a
year and bring shortages of a key component of auto pollution
control equipment, according to a Bureau of Mines study.
   About 94 percent of the costs would result from a cutoff of
South African shipments of platinum and rhodium, with the rest
spread among other metals including palladium, manganese, chromium,
titanium and vanadium, the study said.
   Platinum, palladium and rhodium are essential constituents of
pollution-control catalytic converters on automobiles in the United
States and Japan. Other members of the platinum group are
ruthenium, iridium and osmium.
   Recycling, reduced consumption, other imports and higher
domestic production could close the gap for most metals, the study
said. But ``a major domestic shortage of rhodium'' could be
expected.
   For all the metals in question, South Africa is either the
largest or second-largest producer in the world. The United States
imports half to all its supplies of all of them, though not
entirely from South Africa for any one. The Soviet Union is a major
supplier of many of the metals, and the study warned that
dependence on Soviet supplies would increase if South African
metals weren't available.
   The study was requested by the State Department after
anti-apartheid sanctions against South Africa were enacted by
Congress in 1986, measures which did not affect the metals trade.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month approved a
new bill which would end all U.S. investment in South Africa and
ban almost all trade, but would not affect strategic metals.
   Some analysts have said South Africa could forbid shipment of
the metals as a retaliation.
   The Bureau of Mines study assumed that under an embargo on
metals shipments to the United States, shipments to other countries
would continue. If South African supplies were cut off to
everybody, ``economic impacts will be greater than in the case of a
U.S. embargo.''
   It also assumed no use would be made of emergency stockpiles
held in the United States for use by the Defense Department, that
no production incentives would be applied and that no technological
improvements would be forthcoming. It limited its forecasts to the
next five years.
   No estimate was made of the effects of an overall disruption,
but figures were given from an earlier study of chromium and
manganese. An embargo would cost $30 million a year for chromium
and $31 million for manganese; a total disruption would cost an
average of $1.2 billion a year for chromium and $330 million for
manganese.
   Costs would be incurred in the form of higher prices for
alternate supplies, for expanding U.S. production and recycling and
for switching to substitutes. For example, the cost of platinum
could be expected to rise from about $1,300 an ounce to about
$8,600 an ounce, the study said.
   Rhodium shortages would arise because the metal has been used in
auto catalysts since 1981, compared with 1974 for the other two
catalyst metals, so not as much is available for recycling. Because
practically none is being recovered from cars now being junked, a
recycling system would have to be built from scratch.
   ``As a result of the embargo there are insufficient available
world supplies to meet domestic demand in the second and third
years of the embargo,'' the study said.
   ``Consumption decreases can be expected in both auto catalysts
and other industrial applications and may result in impacts on
domestic industrial production.''
   No effort was made to calculate the costs to the economy of
production losses caused by shortages.

   Japanese and U.S. naval forces today began a
weeklong joint anti-submarine drill in the Pacific Ocean, defense
officials said.
   The exercises were held in a 600-mile stretch of ocean from
Izu-Oshima island, south of Tokyo, to Japan's southwestern main
island of Kyushu, said Lt. Cmdr. Masanobu Ohtsuka, spokesman for
the Maritime Self-Defense Force.
   It is the 66th joint anti-submarine drill between the two forces
since 1957 and the first time both sides contributed military
transport vessels, he said.
   The exercise involves 12 Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels,
including transport ships, destroyers, submarines and
anti-submarine patrol planes.
   Six vessels, including one transport ship and two destroyers,
joined the exercises from the U.S. Seventh Fleet based in Yokosuka,
Ohtsuka said.
   Officials planned to stage a mock battle to defend a group of
transport vessels from a hypothetical attack by enemy submarines,
Ohtsuka said.

   About 20 medium-security inmates agreed
early Mondayto peacefully end their 3-day-old prison uprising after
authorities said the surrender could be televised, according to
officials.
   Late Sunday, the inmates released one of three guards they were
holding hostage, authorities said.
   The inmates, whose rebellion at the Mack Alford Correctional
Center began late Friday and resulted in $2.5 million in damages,
agreed to surrender at 8:30 a.m. CDT Monday if the surrender is
televised, Warden Ted Wallman said through a spokesman.
   Prison officials agreed to that demand and a demand that state
legislators observe the surrender, said the spokesman, Jerry Massie.
   The guard was released in exchange for food and a meeting with
three state legislators, officials said.
   ``We gave, them some pop, ice cream, and cigarettes and they
talked to some legislators,'' Corrections Department spokeswoman
Joy Hadwiger said.
   The inmates, who hung bedsheet banners that called for ``White
Power'' and accused corrections officials of lying as the siege
stretched into a third day, released prison Capt. Lewis McGee, she
said.
   He was in apparently good health, she added, and the other
hostages were also thought to be unharmed.
   Anita Trammell, another spokeswoman for the prison, said earlier
that no resolution was in sight with the inmates, believed armed
with crude knives.
   The prison administration for the first time Sunday night
released a list of the captors' demands.
   Ms. Trammell said that besides the ice cream and cigarettes, the
demands included having the electricity turned back on in their
area, and having meetings with reporters and with Lou Bullock, an
American Civil Liberties attorney who has helped prisoners in the
past.
   The inmates also asked for the return of a bus that was made
available to take the inmates to a federal prison late Saturday as
they requested, but left empty when negotiations broke down.
   Late in the afternoon, two inmates took one of the guards
outside for less than 10 minutes and talked briefly to correctional
officers through a fence in a remote corner of the prison.
   A prison spokesman said the guard appeared to be all right, as
did the two other guards when they were spotted earlier in the day.
   Ms. Trammell said the guard, identified as Sgt. Harold Yoder,
was used a shield by the inmates who worked to close a hole in the
fence cut by prison officials to help other inmates surrender.
   She said the hostage takers have told the roughly 30 other
inmates locked in the ocupied south dorm that their lives would be
in danger if they try to leave. She said, however, that those
inmates said they don't feel like hostages.
   The spokeswoman also said other inmates who have been moved out
of damaged parts of the prison said the hostage takers are
``ridiculous and crazy.''
   Inmates also hung sheets with messages written on them from the
roof of the two-story dormitory where the hostages were held.
   The first sheet said ``White Power,'' while a second sheet hung
later referred to the state Department of Corrections and said:
``DOC Will Not Respond to Demands. They Have Lied to You the Public
and Press.''
   Commenting on the first banner, Ms. Trammell said, ``I feel like
the inmates did that for attention. Also, I feel like we have some
racists up there.''
   Of the three hostage guards, one is white, one is black and one
is an American Indian.
   There have been unconfirmed reports that a racial incident set
off the violence at the 33-year-old prison late Friday.
   Later, a third sheet was hung requesting help from the press,
but small letters and shade made it impossible to read the whole
message.
   According to authorities, the uprising began when officers tried
to move five inmates to a maximum-security prison. The five had
reportedly threatened other inmates who allegedly had stolen from
them.
   The inmates then seized eight hostages; five hostages were
released unharmed Saturday. One guard and one inmate were injured
in the violence, which also caused about $2.5 million in damage.
   It had been reported from the start that 10 inmates were
actively involved in holding the guards. However, Ms. Trammell
quoted the warden as saying the number was closer to 20.
   Most of the prisoners who were routed from their dorms were
transferred to other prisons. Corrections Department spokeswoman
Joy Hadwiger in Oklahoma City said 150 were being held in a
gymnasium area of the prison awaiting relocation, with 51 in the
south dorm where the hostages were being held.
   Carolyn Yoder, wife of one of the hostages, said earlier that
authorities should use a special weapons and tactics team to end
the standoff.
   ``Those boys are smart enough to know what they're doing,'' she
said. ``I'd feel a lot safer with them going in there to take my
husband.''
   The prison, opened in 1955, is located in southeastern Oklahoma
about 130 miles from Oklahoma City. It has the sixth-largest prison
population in Oklahoma with 652 inmates but has an operational
capacity of just 492, corrections officials said.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Alarmed at Erosion of Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress fear a recent court ruling
may have stripped away two centuries of legal protection for their
official activities, exposing them to lawsuits for monetary damages.
   The House has gone on record against the decision and an appeal
by the House lawyer of the case involving Rep. Don Sundquist says a
``Pandora's box'' of law suits may have been opened.
   Lawmakers are protected by the Constitution from suits over
their activities on the floor and in committee.
   But legal experts say an appelate court ruling on the Sundquist
case has left members of Congress without a wider immunity granted
throughout the nation's history by federal courts.
   Members believed these earlier rulings protected them against
damage suits based on their actions at news conferences, in
communications with government agencies and related activities.
   This wider protection still extends to other federal employees
from Cabinet members to custodians, according to House legal
experts.
   In the case of Sundquist, R-Tenn., the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia ruled 2-1 last November that lawmakers are
not immune from civil suits arising from their attempts to
influence the conduct of executive agencies.
   In an appeal asking the Supreme Court to review the case, chief
House counsel Steven R. Ross said, ``The two-judge panel decision
threatens to open a Pandora's box of tort suits by those who
disagree with, or are offended by, members of Congress.
   ``The panel's decision announces that every state and district
in the country has sent to the Capitol a walking deep pocket. The
causes of action to be filed against this singularly exposed group
will know no limit.''
   Outraged by the appellate court decision, the House last week
voted 413-0 for a resolution demanding that members performing
official duties be ``treated by the courts with the same respect
and protection ... afforded ... all other public officials.''
   The resolution also urged that the Supreme Court review the
decision, written by U.S. Circuit Judge James Buckley, a former
Republican senator from New York.
   The suit against Sundquist was filed after the lawmaker wrote
former Attorney General William French Smith in 1985, criticizing
Memphis Area Legal Services in a dispute over its representation of
clients in child support cases.
   Sundquist wrote that the agency supplying legal services to the
poor ``seems to be employing at least one attorney, Wayne Chastain,
to do nothing but harass'' juvenile court officials. He also said
Chastain ``works in concert with two convicted felons.'' Sundquist
made his letter public.
   Chastain filed a $1 million defamation suit. A U.S. District
judge in Washington ruled Sundquist had official immunity, but the
appellate court overturned that ruling.
   The appellate court said Sundquist ``has every right to monitor
and challenge the manner in which the Legal Services Corp.
operates'' if he does so ``within the halls of Congress. ...''
   But the court added, ``No imperative of office requires that a
member of Congress, while acting outside the scope of his
legislative duties, be free to reach out with impunity and name
names without regard for the consequence to individual
reputations.''
   The Constitution gives members of Congress full protection from
civil suits and criminal charges resulting from their direct
legislative actions, such as speeches on the floor or in committee.
   But until now, court decisions also gave members of Congress the
wider protection enjoyed by federal employees carrying out their
duties in good faith.
   Ross said the wider immunity has always been a safety net when
the constitutional protection didn't apply.
   ``We regained protection by pushing the alternative form of
protection _ official immunity,'' Ross said. ``The danger of this
decision is that it cuts away the safety net of backup immunity.''
   After the Sundquist ruling, Ross tried to get the full U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington to hear the case.
   Six of 11 judges agreed with him. But seven votes were needed.

   The deadliest bus accident recorded in the Guinness Book of
World Records occurred in 1973 in Egypt, when a bus plunged into a
canal, killing 127 people.
   What is believed to be the worst bus accident in U.S. history
occurred on Sept. 17, 1963, when a bus collided with a train near
Salinas, Calif., killing 32 farm workers.
   Here is a list of some other recent domestic bus accidents:
   _May 21, 1976, a school bus carrying 53 Yuba City, Calif., High
School students plunged off a freeway ramp near Martinez.
Twenty-eight students and a teacher were killed.
   _A school bus from Prestonsburg, Ky., plunged into the Levisa
Fork of the Big Sandy River on Feb. 28, 1958, killing 26 students
and the bus driver.
   _A speeding Starline Sightseeing Tours coach wrecked in a
California canyon on May 30, 1986, killing 21 passengers. The
driver was sentenced to four years in prison.
   _A tour bus carrying mostly senior citizens from Dallas to
Branson, Mo., plunged into a 40-foot ravine near Jasper, Ark., on

   The foreign secretary today said the
United States should pay more for its military bases in the
Philippines.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the United States
should pay the increase regardless of whether the Philippine
government gives assurances that the bases will be allowed to stay
after their lease expires in 1991.
   ``If the U.S. cannot afford it, I don't think they should be
here at all,'' Manglapus told reporters. ``It's all up to the
United States. If they can afford it, they can stay. If they
cannot, they should go.''
   Manglapus is chief of a Filipino panel which is reviewing along
with a U.S. panel the status of the 1947 pact under which the
Americans maintain Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and
four smaller installations.
   A successful review is expected to influence Manila's decision
on allowing the bases to remain after the current agreement expires.
   Filipino officials have demanded a substantial increase in the
$180 million they receive yearly for use of the bases.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt, the chief American negotiator,
has warned that budget constraints may make it difficult for
Washington to provide a substantial increase.
   U.S. officials say they are working with Japan, West Germany and
other American allies to put together a major new aid package for
the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino has said she does not want the new aid
linked to the future of the bases.
   Mrs. Aquino has pledged to honor the bases agreement through
1991 but refuses to say whether she would support an extension.
   A growing number of Filipinos want to close the bases, which
they see as a vestige of American colonial rule.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
resident of each home who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that
theoretically the results would be within 3 percentage points of
the same 19 times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the
same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five
points for Republicans, for example, and nine points for
respondents who have done postgraduate work.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. Do you think the president of the United States and the
leader of the Soviet Union should meet at regular intervals even
without any major items on the agenda, or should they meet only to
complete major treaties?
   Regular intervals: 78 percent. Major treaties: 16 percent. Don't
know or no answer: 6 percent.
   2. The United States and the Soviets recently agreed on a treaty
to abolish each country's medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
Do you think that will increase the chance of non-nuclear war in
Europe, decrease the chance of non-nuclear war in Europe, or won't
it make much of a difference?
   Increase: 11 percent. Decrease: 26 percent. Not much difference:
55 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   3. Do you support or oppose the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
each country's medium-range nuclear weapons?
   Support: 73 percent. Oppose: 15 percent. Don't know, no answer:
12 percent.
   4. Would you support or oppose a U.S.-Soviet treaty to abolish
50 percent of each country's long-range nuclear weapons?
   Support: 73 percent. Oppose: 15 percent. Don't know or no
answer: 12 percent.
   5. If the United States and the Soviet Union abolished all their
nuclear weapons, do you think that would increase the chance of
non-nuclear war, decrease it, or wouldn't it make much of a
difference?
   Increase, 22 percent. Decrease, 30 percent. Not much difference,
40 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   6. Ronald Reagan has proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as Star Wars, as a missile defense system. Do you think the
United States should drop SDI in exchange for a Soviet agreement to
a big cut in nuclear weapons?
   Yes, 33 percent. No, 49 percent. Don't know or no answer, 18
percent.
   7. Without an arms agreement with the Soviets, do you think work
on SDI should proceed as it is now, or should it be increased, or
reduced, or dropped?
   Proceed as now, 37 percent. Increase, 19 percent. Reduce, 13
percent. Drop, 17 percent. Don't know or no answer, 14 percent.
   8. Which country do you think has more political influence in
the world right now _ the United States, or the Soviet Union, or
are they about equal?
   United States, 41 percent. Soviet Union, 14 percent. About
equal, 38 percent. Don't know or no answer, 7 percent.
   9. Which country do you think is stronger militarily right now _
the United States, or the Soviet Union, or are they about equal?
   United States 28 percent. Soviet Union 33 percent. About equal
29 percent. Don't know or no answer, 10 percent.
   10. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev?
   Favorable, 54 percent. Unfavorable, 20 percent. Don't know or no
answer, 26 percent.
   11. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
President Reagan?
   Favorable, 59 percent. Unfavorable, 31 percent. Don't know or no
answer, 10 percent.
   12. Do you approve or disapprove of the way President Reagan is
handling relations with the Soviet Union?
   Approve, 71 percent. Disapprove, 17 percent. Don't know or no
answer, 12 percent.
   13. Do you think the Soviets can be trusted to live up to their
arms control agreements?
   Yes, 24 percent. No, 61 percent. Don't know or no answer, 15
percent.

   Most of the survivors of a fatal church bus
crash were asleep when the accident occurred and awakened to a
nightmare of ``bodies on top of bodies and orange everywhere,'' a
passenger says.
   ``I didn't know what had happened until I was out of the bus and
I saw it blow up,'' said Allen Tennison, 15, the son of the pastor
of the First Assembly Church of God at Radcliff.
   ``I chased after some of my friends to find out what had
happened. I thought it was a dream; I asked one of my friends if I
was dreaming.''
   Tennison said the fire that engulfed the converted school bus
after the accident about 10:55 p.m. Saturday that left 27 people,
most of them teen-agers, dead was ``like a fireball shooting
straight through the bus.''
   Most of the survivors were in the back of the bus and got out
the emergency exit, he said.
   Tennison was interviewed at the church parsonage where he lives.
His father, the Rev. Don. Tennison, did not accompany the group on
the trip.
   ``I felt it (crash) but it didn't wake me up. I heard a scream
and I remember seeing bodies on top of bodies and orange
everywhere. I was pushed out the back door; most were pushed out,''
he said Sunday.
   John Pearman, a church official who is missing and believed to
be among the dead, had hollered for everyone to get out of the bus
before the explosion, he said.
   Tennison said the mood at the scene was relatively calm.
   ``There's one thing I'm proud of. Everyone was helping someone
else,'' he said. ``They didn't panic. They remained calm. Everyone
was a hero in their own way.
   ``It freaked me out to seem them (friends) coal black but I knew
they needed someone to help them. I'm lucky because few people
escaped with no injuries.
   ``We knew we were in God's hands and it calmed people to pray.''
   Most of those aboard the bus were from the Radcliff church. Some
church members had brought friends from other congregations in the
area on the outing to King's Island amusement park north of
Cincinnati.
   The bus was struck head-on by a pickup truck traveling in the
wrong lane of Interstate 71 near Carrollton.
   ``I just heard a crash, felt the impact of the car (truck) and
looked up and saw flames,'' said 14-year-old Wayne Cox, a Radcliff
Middle School eighth-grader. ``They spread pretty fast. ... I was
pinned. Everything was pretty wild. I was under a lot of people.
That's probably what saved me from getting burned.''
   Jason Booher, 13, also an eighth-grade student at Radcliff
Middle School, said he and another youth helped pull people out of
the bus.
   Booher said he assisted survivors on the ground outside the back
door, while a Meade County High School student, Jamie Hardesty,
stood just inside the door and pushed people out.
   ``Jamie, he pushed everyone out,'' Booher said. ``He was up in
the bus and I was out the back door of the bus, helping those who
were hurt.''
   Booher said Jamie played ``a big part. He saved a lot.''
   Tennison also credited Hardesty with directing medical personnel
to the more seriously injured survivors.

   School buses like the one involved in a
fatal wreck near here Saturday are not designed for high-speed
highway use, a bus company executive says.
   ``A school bus is a specialized vehicle, designed to transport a
high number of students over rural roads at relatively low speed,''
said Mike Sodrel, who operates an intercity charter and tour
service.
   ``A typical intercity coach, like a Greyhound, weighs 26,000 to
28,000 pounds empty. A typical school bus will weigh less than half
that,'' he said.
   A pickup truck traveling in the wrong direction on Interstate 71
north of Louisville plowed into a former school bus operated by a
church in Radcliff, Ky., just before midnight Saturday. The bus,
which had just been refueled, burst into flames and many victims
were not able to flee the wreckage.
   Sodrel is president of The Free Enterprise System Inc., an
intercity charter and tour service with 17 buses based in
Jeffersonville, Ind., across the Ohio River from Louisville. He
also is a director of the American Bus Association, a trade group
based in Washington, D.C.
   ``The fuel tanks on our coaches are mounted forward of the rear
axle and are inboard,`` he said. ``What's more significant is that
intercity coaches are diesel-powered and diesel fumes are not
explosive. Diesel fuel will burn but the flash point is
considerably higher than gasoline.''
   Saturday's crash involved a 1977 Ford school bus that took
regular gasoline, authorities said.
   Sodrel said he had no special knowledge of the bus-truck
collision and was speaking in general terms about bus safety.
   He said in an interview Sunday that the U.S. Department of
Transportation has the authority to enforce certain safety
regulations on private buses in addition to for-hire coaches, but
``they have not yet elected to do that.''
   He said legislation is pending in the U.S. House to direct the
DOT to do that.
   John Snyder, executive director of the trade association, said
the group has encouraged enforcement of the rules remaining since
partial deregulation of the industry in the mid-1980s. Deregulation
led to an increase in bus companies across the country, and
competitive pressures, he said.
   ``When you start cutting costs, safety sometimes starts to
suffer,'' he said.
   ``That is why our association and our board are so strong in
support of safety. We have seen a strengthening of the enforcement
process in the last couple of years,'' he said, referring to both
official efforts and industry adherance.
   Snyder made his remarks in a telephone interview from his home
in Indianapolis.

   A dancer suffered a punctured lung after he was
accidentally stabbed during a performance of ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   Richard McLeod, 20, was in fair condition Sunday night at
Georgia Baptist Hospital.
   He was stabbed Friday night when a protective board under his
costume slipped during a first-act fight scene involving supporters
of the Capulet and Montague families. Since McLeod's character was
supposed to die when the accident occurred, the ballet composed by
Sergei Prokofiev continued with the audience unaware of the injury.
   ``He was not knocked unconscious,'' said Atlanta Ballet
President Kenneth Hertz. ``He retained all his senses. He fell and
said to another dancer, `I have been stabbed. Get me off the
stage.'''
   Hertz said Sunday that McLeod is expected to be dancing again in
about three weeks.

   Americans overwhelmingly favor the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range nuclear missile treaty but share fears in Congress
that Moscow cannot be trusted to comply, according to a Media
General-Associated Press poll.
   The poll also found that Americans view Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev nearly as favorably as they do President Reagan, and
Gorbachev out-polls Reagan among college-educated Americans.
   Seventy-three percent of those polled in the national survey
supported the accord to eliminate medium-range missiles, and as
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nation's long-range
arsenal in half.
   But 61 percent said the Soviets can't be trusted to live up to
their arms control agreements. That reflected sentiment in the
Senate, which last week demanded clarification of the anti-cheating
rules in the pact.
   The poll was conducted among a random sample of 1,204 adults
interviewed by telephone from April 29-May 8, ending less than a
month before Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Moscow.
   As strongly pro-treaty as they were, a near-majority of
Americans were not willing to drop Reagan's proposed missile
defense system known as ``Star Wars'' in exchange for a Soviet
agreement to a big cut in nuclear arms. Forty-nine percent opposed
such a trade while just one-third supported it.
   The public was split on the issue along political and
ideological lines: Republicans and conservatives strongly opposed
dropping Star Wars for a big missile cut, while Democrats and
liberals favored such an agreement.
   Without an agreement, 56 percent said work on Star Wars should
proceed as it is now or be increased, while 30 percent said it
should be reduced or dropped. There again was a political division:
73 percent of Republicans wanted work on Star Wars kept up,
compared with 41 percent of Democrats.
   Similarly, there was an ideological division in support for the
medium-range treaty and for a treaty, if one can be reached, to
halve the long-range arsenals. The pacts fared worst among
conservatives _ 20 percent were opposed _ and best with liberals,
whose opposition was in single digits. About 67 percent of
conservatives and 83 percent of liberals were in favor.
   The survey found broad support for Reagan's handling of
U.S.-Soviet relations, with 71 percent approving, and a high
positive view of Reagan generally, with 59 percent rating him
favorably.
   Nearly as many _ 54 percent _ expressed a positive view of
Gorbachev, the poll found. Among college graduates, 71 percent
rated Gorbachev favorably while 62 percent viewed Reagan favorably;
among those who have done postgraduate work, 76 percent saw
Gorbachev favorably, compared with 50 percent favorable for Reagan.
   Reagan had the approval of the poll's respondents for his May
29-June 2 summit with Gorbachev in Moscow. Seventy-eight percent
said the president and the Soviet leader should meet at regular
intervals even without any major items on the agenda.
   The survey gave a mixed report on U.S.-Soviet competition.
Forty-one percent said the United States had more political
influence in the world and just 14 percent said the Soviets had
more political influence. Thirty-eight percent said the countries
were about equally influential.
   The rating was closer on military strength: 33 percent said the
Soviets were stronger militarily, 28 percent said the United States
was stronger and 29 percent said the countries were about equally
strong.
   Poll respondents largely rejected the opinion of critics that
nuclear arms treaties may increase the chance of non-nuclear war. A
majority said the medium-range missile treaty would not make much
difference in the chance of conventional war in Europe, and 26
percent said it would decrease the chance.
   Just 11 percent said the treaty would increase the chance of
conventional war in Europe. That figure doubled, though, when
respondents were asked if abolition of all U.S. and Soviet nuclear
weapons would increase the chance of non-nuclear war; 22 percent,
still a minority, said it would.
   The poll had a margin of sampling error of three points. Media
General Inc., a communications company based in Richmond, Va.,
publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader,
the Tampa (Fla). Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parasitic mite attacking bee colonies around the
country threatens to leave America's cranberry growers without
enough bees for pollination this year and hurt production of other
crops and honey, officials say.
   Massachusetts, the nation's leader in cranberry production, is
hiring more bee inspectors to keep out the pinhead-size mite known
as Varroa jacobsoni, which can quickly destroy bee colonies and has
been found in 13 states.
   ``There won't be enough bees for a good, thorough job of
pollination,'' said Irving Demoranville, director of the University
of Massachusetts' Cranberry Experiment Station in Wareham.
   The nation's more than 900 cranberry growers last year produced
350 million pounds valued at $188 million, according to David
Farrimond, general manager of the Wareham-based Cranberry Marketing
Committee.
   Growers rely on migratory beekeepers, now heading north for work
pollinating fruit and vegetable crops this spring and summer.
   Last month, the federal government imposed a quarantine on
interstate bee transportation in the 13 states, about six months
after the Varroa mite was detected in Wisconsin. But the quarantine
was lifted after proving too costly and unmanageable, and
inspection was turned over to states.
   ``We clearly did not have a workable quarantine to assure that
we were going to be able to control the spread. We found it likely
that a lot of them were going to move their bees regardless,'' said
Nancy Robinson, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Sevice.
   Beekeepers eager to assuage growers are taking out ads in
Cranberries Magazine, a national trade publication, saying their
bees are clean.
   Cranberry growers say beekeepers with contaminated bees who
cross state lines could spead the infestation. Massachusetts
farmers say the mite has reached the state, although that has not
been confirmed.
   Growers say the spread of the mite could have a long-term impact
on fruit, vegetable and honey production.
   ``There is a lot of concern,'' said Douglas Beaton, president of
the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association. ``If it goes unchecked,
then our crops will most surely be threatened in two or three
years.''
   Massachusetts last year produced 160 million pounds of
cranberries worth $83 milllion on 11,600 acres, according to state
Food and Agriculture Department figures. Ninety-eight percent of
the crop depends on wild domestic honeybees for pollination.
   The national cranberry crop would suffer a 30 percent to 50
percent drop without bees to pollinate them, said Jon Gottschalk, a
Phillips, Wis., cranberry grower and board member of Ocean Spray
Cranberries Inc., the industry cooperative.
   As apple buds begin to blossom in Massachusetts this month,
migratory beekeepers from out of state have started arriving and
their bees and equipment are being checked for the mite.
   The state has hired two inspectors to monitor migratory
beekeepers, said Peter C. Kuzmiski, chief of the state Plant and
Pest Control Bureau. He said five or six inspectors would be on
duty by mid-June, when cranberries begin to blossom.
   Beekeepers are not optimistic about preventing the mite's spread.
   ``There's no way possible that they will keep them out of the
state,'' said Joseph Mello, past president of the Massachusetts
Federation of Beekeepers. ``They will make it in, and eventually we
will have the problem throughout the entire state. It's a problem
that will be here to stay.''
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency in January approved
use of the chemical fluvalinate to fumigate bees and hives for the
mites. A plastic strip containing fluvalinate kills the mite, but
not enough is believed to be available to treat all the bees now
contaminated.
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae. It decreases the number of larvae, deforms bees
and weakens a colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce
honey.
   The 13 states where the bee mite has been found are Florida,
Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Washington and
Wisconsin.
   In addition to honey production, a bee shortage would reduce
pollination of apples, blueberries, cucumbers, squash and other
fuits and vegetables.

<HEAD>Wild Falcons Migrating To Cities Across America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High above downtown, two wild peregrine falcon
chicks pecked out of their shells in a nest on a skyscraper ledge.
   To Baltimoreans, the hatching of another clutch of the
endangered species is almost old hat. A pair of peregrines have
been raising families on the 33rd-floor ledge of the United States
Fidelity & Guaranty Corp. building since 1984 and at least one
peregrine has lived on the building since 1979.
   But the migration of falcons to cities is a surprising
development in a successful experiment begun by Cornell University
in 1970 to reintroduce the predatory bird to southern Canada and
the continental United States after DDT and other pesticides
decimated the species.
   Baltimore was the first city the falcons chose. The first of the
birds, which were raised in captivity, drifted down from a New
Jersey marsh. The latest chicks were hatched two weeks ago by
falcons named Blythe and Beauregard.
   Today, released peregrines and their offspring nest in 20 U.S.
cities, according to experts. Urban homes include skyscrapers along
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, on a bridge over the Schuylkill
River in Philadelphia, on the San Francisco and Oakland ends of the
Bay Bridge, in New York City and on the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake
City.
   Falcons also have settled in the mountains of New England and in
cliffs and rock quarries in the Carolinas and Virginia.
   To falcons, skyscrapers and bridges resemble cliffs and mountain
peaks.
   ``All they have to do is become accustomed to helicopters and
human noises, and they'll do fine,'' said John Barber, falcon
guardian and data manager at USF&G. Peregrines mate for life and
live 15 to 20 years.
   Barber said falcons chose cities partly because pigeons had no
predators.
   ``And most cities are cheering them on because obviously the
pigeon population is way out of control,'' he said.
   In Los Angeles, two pairs of peregrines set up housekeeping
seven miles apart on Wilshire Boulevard, said Brian Walton,
coordinator of the Predatory Bird Group at the University of
California, Santa Cruz.
   ``The peregrines fly up and down that street, using the
skyscrapers like a string of mountain peaks,'' he said.
   Most of the birds were released from artificial structures, such
as towers in marshes, which may explain their attraction to bridges
and tall buildings, said Cornell ornithology professor Tom Cade.
   ``I think they develop some sort of association or fixation
early in life for these structures. Every tower we built is now
occupied by a nesting pair,'' said Cade, chairman of the Peregrine
Fund Inc.
   The fund, a non-profit organization that co-sponsors the
repopulation project, has received inquiries about using peregrines
to keep pigeons in check. However, Cade said falcons aren't the
answer to urban pigeon blight because each pair takes 10 square
miles for its territory.
   The immediate area benefits, as pigeons avoid peregrine perches,
Cade said.
   Historically, peregrines have not shunned human beings, although
they kept their distance, Cade said. Peregrines raised chicks on
the pyramids of Egypt and European castles and cathedrals have been
traditional nesting sites. Kings hunted with the falcons, which can
be trained but not tamed.

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rocket-firing Israeli helicopter gunships
destroyed a radical Palestinian group's guerrilla base on the
outskirts of this southern port city, police reported today.
   They said three guerrillas of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command were wounded Sunday night
in the 10-minute attack by two gunships on the southern fringes of
Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp.
   The Israeli command said the helicopters destroyed an old
building near Sidon used as a guerrilla command post, without
naming the Palestinian faction.
   An Israeli gunboat with powerful searchlights cruised in the
Mediterranean off Sidon, training the lights on the shore as the
helicopters made three runs firing rockets. The gunships also
dropped parachute flares before each run and drew anti-aircraft
fire from guerrilla positions in and around Ein el-Hilweh.
   The gunship attack was the ninth Israeli air raid on targets in
Lebanon this year. Altogether, 49 people have been killed and 75
wounded in the attacks. Three of them struck Popular Front bases.
   The group claimed responsibility for a Nov. 25 hang-glider
assault by a guerilla who flew from southeast Lebanon into northern
Israel, killing six Israelis and wounding eight before he was shot
and killed.
   The Popular Front is headed by former Syrian army captain Ahmed
Jibril. The group is based in Syria and receives financial support
from Libya.

   The dollar closed at 124.73 yen, up 0.03 yen from Friday's
close. It had opened the day at 124.83 yen and moved in a narrow
range of 124.71 yen and 124.85 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225

291.56 points to close at 27,759.87.
   Traders said Wall Street, which firmed Friday on news that the
U.S. producer price index rose a modest 0.4 percent, spurred the
Tokyo market's strength.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
dollar would stay in a narrow range ahead of the release of U.S.
monthly trade figures for March. The U.S. Commerce Department is
scheduled to announce the trade data in Washington Tuesday.

   Share prices closed at a record high today on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the dollar edged up against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the market's main barometer,
rose 291.56 points to close at 27,759.87, surpassing the previous
record close of 27,669.72 set on May 1.
   Securities brokers said investors shared the view with Wall
Street where share prices gained sharply on Friday. They also said
many investors sat out trading today, waiting for the release of
U.S. trade figures for March, which the Commerce Department is
scheduled to announce Tuesday in Washington.
   A broker at a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said high-technology issues such as Toshiba and
Mitsubishi Electric led the market.
   ``The good result of the Producers Price Index in the U.S.
relieved the investors from the concern over inflation and possible
interest rate rise,'' the broker said.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 124.73 yen, 0.03 yen higher than
Friday's close. The dollar was traded in a narrow range of 124.71
yen and 124.85 yen.
   ``The market had no enthusiasm today ahead of the release of
(U.S.) trade figures,'' said Hiroaki Shukuzawa of Sumitomo Bank.
``But even after the release, the market will not be affected too
much unless the figure is way out of an expected range.''

   Big Chick Huntsberry has turned to God, but
the 340-pound former professional wrestler and bodyguard for rock
star Prince says turning-the-other-cheek is still hard to swallow.
   ``I might be a Christian, but I'm not an idiot,'' says the
6-foot-6 Huntsberry, who has become an evangelical sensation since
rejecting drugs and rock 'n' roll and devoting his considerable
self to Jesus.
   ``If some dude smacked me, I'd probably smack him back. But I'd
pray for him afterwards. ... You don't have to be a sissy to love
Jesus.''
   Huntsberry, 47, said he once had a $1,000-a-day cocaine habit.
He found religion when his 6-year-old grandson, Jeremy, recovered
from a choking episode last summer.
   In January, he started ``Big Chick Ministries'' and began
thundering across the nation warning teen-agers and their parents
about drugs, suicide and rock music. Looking like Grizzly Adams on
steroids, he still wears studded leather from his rock 'n' roll
days.
   ``You know I used to work for a man named Prince,'' he tells
audiences. ``I protected him. But now I work for another Prince.
The Prince of Peace. And this Prince protects me.''

<TEXT>
   Thirty-one people were killed last month when a
young farmer, upset after a fight with his mother, set off dynamite
in a room crowded with people watching television.
   The Hebei Daily, in a report seen in Beijing today, said 18
others were injured in the April 14 blast in Yujia village in the
central Hebei province.
   It said the ``rare and catastrophic'' explosion was set off by
Yu Xiugang, 21, and linked it to an argument he had the previous
day with his mother.
   Yu bought five batteries and installed an igniter to sticks of
dynamite he had, the report said. That evening he went to the home
of Yu Mengjuan, where 50 people had gathered to watch a film on
television.
   The daily said Yu set off the dynamite, killing himself and 30
others. It was not clear whether Yu Mengjuan was his mother and
whether she was killed in the blast.
   Televisions are still rare in many parts of rural China, and it
is common for crowds to congregate at the homes of people with TVs.

<TEXT>
   A videotape shows an ex-prep school student who
strangled a woman in Central Park acting out strangulations and
partying with nearly naked women before testimony in his murder
trial, according to television producers.
   The videotape, obtained by the nationally syndicated program ``A
Current Affair,'' is to be used in a two-part story on the Robert
Chambers case scheduled for broadcast tonight and Tuesday.
   The tape shown to reporters Sunday was made in a Manhattan
apartment last December around the time a jury was being selected
for Chambers' trial for the 1986 death of 18-year-old Jennifer Dawn
Levin, according to Rafael Abramovitz, a reporter-producer for the
show.
   Miss Levin was killed during a sexual encounter.
   In one of the most bizarre sequences on the tape, Chambers, 21,
is seen sitting, his back to the camera, facing several young women
and playing with a doll.
   Suddenly, a grinning Chambers looks into the camera, and twists
the small doll's head.
   ``My name is ...,'' Chambers said in a falsetto, his voice
trailing off. ``Oops, I think I've killed it. Both of its eyes are
like ...''
   At another point, Chambers performed in a game of charades by
grabbing his neck in a tight grip with his right hand and
collapsing to the floor.
   ``Death of a Salesman,'' one of the young women guessed
correctly.
   The 40-minute tape, reportedly made during a late-night party,
features four young women, who at various times wear casual
clothing, pajamas or bras and panties.
   Chambers wears a T-shirt and slacks throughout, and is the only
man present during most of the party. Another young man arrives
late in the tape.
   Throughout the taping, Chambers was aware of the camera and at
times appeared to hold it himself.
   Abramovitz and senior producer Peter Brennan would not say who
provided the tape or whether the program paid for it.
   They also declined to identify the young women seen on the tape,
except to say they were friends or acquaintances of Chambers and
Miss Levin.
   Chambers' trial came to an abrupt end March 21 when he pleaded
guilty to manslaughter. He is serving a five-to-15-year prison
sentence.
   ``A Current Affair'' is produced by WNYW-TV in New York and
distributed nationally by 20th Century Fox Syndicate.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deadly earthquakes that jolted Southern
California in July 1986 and last October may have been triggered by
abnormal air pressure patterns over the Pacific Ocean and Western
United States, a researcher says.
   Scripps Institution of Oceanography meterologist Jerome Namias
studied moderate and large quakes in the region since 1947 and
found they tended to occur a month to six weeks after the onset of
the unusual atmospheric pressure patterns and associated winds
during the summer and fall.
   ``We know so little about why earthquakes occur when they do
that we've got to keep an open mind, even on what seems like a
far-out kind of idea,'' said geologist-geophysicist Clarence Allen
of the California Institute of Technology.
   Allen said that while he guesses the correlation will turn out
to be coincidental, ``it's too early to rule out these kinds of
things. And Namias is certainly a very respected scientist.''
   The statistical correlation between earthquakes and air pressure
is weak, difficult to explain in scientifically respectable terms
and ``definitely a far-out idea,'' said Namias, who spent 30 years
as chief of the National Weather Service's extended forecast
division in Washington.
   But if atmospheric pressure patterns are related to quakes, it
may be because winds associated with the patterns raise offshore
sea levels slightly, putting more pressure on the earth, he
speculated during a recent telephone interview from La Jolla.
   Forces from unsual air pressure patterns and higher sea levels
are smaller than the moon's tidal influence on Earth and its
oceans, and seismologists still debate whether lunar gravity
triggers quakes, said Tom Heaton, scientist in charge of the U.S.
Geological Survey's Pasadena office.
   ``If we can't prove that tides do it, it seems a longshot that
(any pattern of) atmospheric pressure does it,'' Heaton said.
   Namias found quakes of at list 4.5 on the Richter scale were
associated with an abnormally strong gradient between very high,
sea-level atmospheric pressure over the eastern half of the North
Pacific and very low, surface-level pressure over the interior
portion of the western third of the nation.
   The unusual pattern existed before the 5.9-magnitude Whittier
Narrows quake and its aftershocks, which rocked Southern California
last October, killing eight people, injuring more than 200 and
causing $358 million in damage, Namias said.
   He said the pattern preceded three hefty jolts in 1986: the
5.9-magnitude July 8 Palm Springs quake, which caused $5.3 million
in damage; the 5.3-magnitude July 13 Oceanside quake, which killed
one, injured 28 others and caused $720,000 in damage, and the
6-magnitude July 21 Chalfant Valley quake near Bishop, which caused
$436,500 in damage.
   The abnormal pattern involved barometer readings of roughly 30.1
inches of mercury offshore and roughly 29.75 over the interior,
Namias said, adding that some of the pattern existed last week, but
was very weak.
   Namias said the unusual large-scale air pressure pattern is
unrelated to local weather or to what some people contend is
``earthquake weather,'' unseasonably hot, dry, windy conditions
such as those last October.
   Namias said he noticed the quake-air pressure pattern
correlation years ago, but even after the 1986 quakes he decided
``I'd keep my mouth shut on the topic'' because he knew
seismologists would be dubious.
   He changed his mind after last October's shocks, writing a paper
published last month in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
   Namias said he noted the quake-air pressure correlation only
during summer and fall months.
   In addition to speculating that winds related to the pressure
pattern might raise sea levels, Namias said large-scale winds might
affect the ground directly. He said Earth's rotation, and thus the
length of a day, changes slightly over the decades because of wind
drag on Earth's surface.
   Other scientists have suggested a link between volcanic activity
in Indonesia and variations in atmospheric pressure, wind and sea
levels, Namias said.

<HEAD>Voters Paying More Attention to Presidential Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More Americans say they are paying close
attention to the presidential campaign this year than in 1984,
according to a survey published today in The New York Times.
   The Times@CBS News poll indicated widespread uneasiness about
the future, particularly the economy, were causing heightened
interest in the political races, the newspaper said.
   Since the start of February, the percentage of voters who said
they were paying a lot of attention to the presidential race has
been consistently higher than at the same time in 1984, and at
least as high as 1980, according to the Times.
   Furthermore, attention to the campaign has quickened earlier
this year than in 1980, the poll showed.
   Thirty percent of the registered voters polled said they had
been paying ``a lot'' of attention to the 1988 presidential
campaign, up from the 27 percent in February who said they were
watching the race closely.
   A similar survey in late April 1984 found 23 percent of the
adults interviewed said they were paying close attention to the
race that eventually pitted Democrat Walter Mondale against
incumbent President Reagan. A February poll that year found 16
percent paying ``a lot'' of attention.
   In 1980, 29 percent of the registered voters were watching the
race closely in April, 18 percent that February.
   The latest poll was conducted May 9-12 and surveyed 1,382
adults, including 1,056 registered voters. It has a margin of error
of plus or minus three percentage points.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms rumbled across the central Great Lakes
region and into the Southern Plains today after lightning, hail and
high wind lashed Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, ripping down power
lines and uprooting trees.
   One branch of thunderstorms edged across the Ohio Valley from
western New York into Ohio and Indiana, while another swept through
southeast Kansas and parts of Oklahoma.
   Thunderstorms across northeastern Illinois Sunday left a retired
firefighter in critical condition after he was struck by lightning
while fishing. The storms also knocked out electrical power for
about 25,000 customers in the Chicago area.
   Meanwhile, tornadoes spawned by severe thunderstorms touched
down in at least four southeastern Michigan areas Sunday, knocking
down trees and power lines.
   In Indiana, wind gusting up to 70 mph accompanied thunderstorms
that moved across the northern edge of the state on Sunday, downing
trees and power lines.
   ``We've had a lot of property damage,'' said Steuben County
Sheriff Robert Enyeart. There were no reports of injuries.
   The strongest thunderstorms early today were reported in central
and southern Oklahoma and were accompanied by large hail and gusty
wind. Golf ball-sized hail pelted Oklahoma City, along with winds
up to 80 mph.
   Elsewhere, a cold front brought showers to the Oregon coast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
northern New England and the Great Lakes region into the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys and the central and southern Appalachians;
showers and thunderstorms from Georgia across Alabama, Mississippi,
Arkansas and southeast Oklahoma into northeast Texas; showers from
the northern Pacific Coast region and northwest Nevada with a few
thunderstorms over western Idaho and northwest Montana.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s over much of
the nation; 90 over Gulf Coast states and southern Arkansas; into
the 90s and around 100 in southwest Texas, southern New Mexico and
the desert Southwest; in the 60s along the New England coast, the
California coast and much of Washington and Oregon; in the 50s and
60s over most of Michigan and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 88 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   A 19-year-old man was killed after he was

   Kenneth Wayne Knight of Finksburg apparently had been sleeping
early Saturday in the trash bin, located behind a movie theater,
said David A. Briscoe of the state police.
   Knight's body carried no identification, so police were not able
to identify the body and notify his family for about 12 hours,
Briscoe said.
   Police said the death was accidental, but an investigation was
continuing, Briscoe said.
   Results of an autopsy were not available Sunday night, he said.

<HEAD>Political Uncertainty In Thailand As Leader Leaves For Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda left
today for a visit to the Soviet Union, and a top aide said he would
ask Moscow to pressure Vietnam to end its occupation of Cambodia.
   Prem's two-week trip, which also included stops in Finland and
Hungary, comes during deep domestic political uncertainty resulting
from his decision to dissolve the legislature on April 29 and set
new elections for July 24.
   Prem said he acted because dissident legislators in the main
party of his coalition government voted against a government-backed
bill to protect copyrights. But the opposition charged that Prem's
move was designed to avoid a no-confidence motion that had been
scheduled for May 9.
   Dissolution of parliament automatically nullified censure motion.
   The elections are expected to result in a substantial
realignment of the political parties, and it is uncertain if Prem,
a former army commander who has been in office since 1980, will be
returned to power.
   Bangkok newspapers today gave front-page display to army Chief
Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's assertion on Sunday that while the
military was strong enough to do so, there would be no coup attempt
in Prem's absence.
   But Chavalit is regarded as a Prem supporter and such talk in
the Thai media often has proven to be bluster.
   There have been 15 successful and aborted coups and 14 general
elections since 1932 when Thailand converted to constitutional
monarchy.
   The Nation newspaper said today that Prem was seen off at the
airport by top military officers, including Chavalit, and
government officials who assured reporters everything would go
smoothly during Prem's absence.
   Prem is expected to make his appeal on Cambodia in talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov,
said Prasong Soonsiri, secretary-general in Prem's office.
   ``Our standpoints on the Cambodian issue still differ greatly
and the talks are aimed at narrowing and resolving those
differences,'' said Prasong, who accompanied Prem on the trip.
   ``The Soviet Union claims Vietnam is a sovereign state and that
it cannot order that country around, such as in the case of
Cambodia,'' he said. ``But we're convinced that once Moscow stops
giving aid to Hanoi, then Vietnamese troops cannot hold on in
Cambodia.''
   The Thais also hope some progress on the issue will be made at
the forthcoming superpower summit. Vietnam has been stressing its
desire for a political settlement, and also has said it wants
progress at the summit.
   The Soviet Union is the main supplier of arms to Vietnamese
forces that invaded Cambodia nine years ago and are battling
guerrillas backed by Thailand and other countries. Cambodia is on
Thailand's eastern border, and Bangkok regards the Vietnamese
occupation as its major security threat.
   Prem's agenda in the Soviet Union includes giving a speech at
the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and visits to
Kiev and Leningrad.
   He goes to Finland on May 23 and is to hold talks on trade with
President Mauno Koivisto and Prime Minister Harri Holkeri.
   Prem concludes his tour with a May 25-28 visit to Hungary at the
invitation of Prime Minister Karoly Grosz.

   The dollar firmed against most major foreign
currencies, including the strong British pound, in quiet European
trading today. Gold prices also rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar was supported by market
expectations that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in March from
February's $13.8 billion. The March trade figures are scheduled to
be released in Washington on Tuesday.
   Dealers said the pound continues to draw strength from an
apparent dispute within the British Cabinet. One British pound cost
1.8905 dollars in London at midmorning today, slightly cheaper for
buyers than late Friday's 1.8910.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an advocate of free market
policies, opposes sustained central bank intervention to stem the
pound's rise because she believes it could be inflationary. She has
stated repeatedly that controlling inflation is her primary
economic aim.
   Her top Treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, favors market intervention to prevent further rises in the
pound which could hurt British exports and corporate profits.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.03 yen to a closing 124.73. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 124.78 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   --1.6857 West German marks, up from 1.6830
   --1.4010 Swiss francs, up from 1.4000
   --5.7205 French francs, up from 5.7063
   --1.8905 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8855
   --1,254.10 Italian lire, up from 1,249.00
   --1.2317 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2336
   Gold also firmed in moderate European trading. Bullion dealers
said there was no market-affecting news, but there was some strong
buying from commission houses and by investors.
   At midmorning, London's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $453.40 a troy ounce, up from the opening bid
of $452.50 and from late Friday's 449.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $453.50, up from $450.00 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.39 to close at a bid $455.24.
   Silver was quoted in London Monday at a bid $6.65 dollars a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $6.52.

<TEXT>
   Robert Shaplen, a correspondent and staff writer
for The New Yorker magazine who became an expert on Asia in a
career that spanned five decades, has died. He was 71.
   Shaplen died Sunday weeks after returning from Southeast Asia.
   The Princeton, N.J., resident became ill on the trip and entered
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center three weeks ago for treatment of
thyroid cancer.
   Family members said the cause of death was not immediately
determined.
   Shaplen was treated for another cancer several years ago.
   Shaplen, born in Philadelphia, reported for The New York Herald
Tribune and was an Asia correspondent for Newsweek, Fortune and
Collier's magazines before joining The New Yorker, where he worked
for 36 years starting in 1952.
   He wrote 10 books, including one novel and a volume of short
stories, most of them about Asia.
   Highlights of his career included going ashore with the Marine
on Leyte in the Philippines in 1944 despite machine gun and mortar
fire, flying over Nagasaki hours after it was devastated by the
atomic bomb in August 1945 and writing strategic and battlefield
pieces from Korea and Vietnam in the 1960s.
   His last book, ``Bitter Victory,'' published by Harper & Row in
1986, stemmed from his 1984 trip to Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Robert Gottlieb, the editor of The New Yorker, said Shaplen had
recently returned from a tour of Vietnam, Korea and Hong Kong and
had planned to write several articles. His article based on a trip
to China last year is scheduled for publication this summer in the
magazine.
   ``He was a major figure at The New Yorker for three and a half
decades,'' Gottlieb said. ``He had a fierce attachment to the
magazine and the magazine had a fierce attachment to him.''
   He is survived by his wife, the former Jayjia Hsia; two sons,
Peter, of San Francisco, and Jason, of Princeton, and a daughter,
Kate, of Minneapolis.
   The family said the funeral would be private and that a memorial
service would be held later.

<HEAD>Court Sentences Two Hezbollah Guerrillas In Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOD, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court today sentenced two Lebanese
guerrillas to 13 years in prison for participating in an attack on
Israeli-backed militiamen in southern Lebanon last year.
   The guerrillas are members of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah,
or Party of God. Court sources said it was the first time Israel
had tried Lebanese guerrillas for attacks on Lebanese and not
Israeli targets.
   The judge, Lt. Col. Ahron Alpern, found the guerrillas guilty of
membership in Hezbollah, receiving illegal military training and
participating in an attack on Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
forces.
   The defendants, Kassem Kamets, 20 and Ismail Ali Zayan, 19,
responded to the sentence by shouting: ``We will liberate
Jerusalem.''
   The two men are from the Lebanese village of Qabrikha, five
miles north of the Israeli border. It has been the site of many
clashes between Hezbollah and Pro-Israeli militiamen. The
guerrillas were captured there by the South Lebanon Army in June
1987, officials said.
   The South Lebanon Army, which numbers about 1,500, patrols a
10-to-12-mile wide security strip designated by Israel north of its
border.
   Israel established the zone after withdrawing the bulk of its
forces from southern Lebanon in June 1985 after a three-year
occupation.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Gives Membership Cards To 16 Foreign Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange today gave official
certificates of membership to 16 foreign security firms, including
six from the United States.
   The move came one week before the companies are authorized to
begin trading in one of the world's largest stock markets, said an
exchange official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Michio Takeuchi, exchange chairman, gave the certificates to
members of the foreign firms and six Japanese trading houses,
completing a process that will increase the exchange membership
from 92 to 114 on May 23.
   There are currently six foreign members of the Tokyo exchange.
They joined in 1986 when Japan yielded to pressure from the United
States and Britain to open its doors to foreign traders.
   Last December, the exchange said 16 foreign firms were among the
22 traders selected from 40 applicants seeking seats on the
exchange. Entry of the new members was timed with the completion in
May of stock exchange building renovations and upgrading of the
exchange's computer system.
   The new foreign members, who paid $9.1 million to join the
exchange, include six from the United States, four from Britain and
two each from France, Switzerland and West Germany.
   The official who spoke privately said the six American firms are
First Boston (Japan) Ltd.; Kidder, Peabody International
Corporation; Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd.; Shearson
Lehman Hutton Asia, Inc.; Salomon Brothers Asia, Ltd., and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham International Inc.
   He said the four British firms are Baring Securities (Japan)
Ltd.; County NatWest Securities Japan Ltd.; Kleinwort Benson
International Inc.; and Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   The remaining firms are DB Capital Markets (Asia) Ltd. and
Dresdner-ABD Securities Ltd., both of West Germany; Sogen
Securities (North Pacific) Ltd. and W.I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd., both
of France; and SBCI Securities (Asia) Ltd., and UBS Phillips and
Drew International Ltd., both of Switzerland, the official said.
   Nine foreign security firms will actually begin trading May 23,
the exchange official said.
   ``The others are still in the process of preparing (personnel)
to begin trading on the exchange, and will be coming in gradually
from June on,'' the official said.
   All of the American firms except Prudential-Bache will begin
trading next week as will Kleinwort Benson, County NatWest, W.I.
Carr and SBCI Securities.

   A deaf man trying to save 10 people
stranded by a tide hoisted a little girl on his shoulders,
clambered up a cliff and used her to call for help, authorities
said.
   Alan Thomas and 6-year-old Sara Reinhardt were among 12 people
who were on a beach at the foot of a cliff Sunday when they were
stranded by a rising tide. Thomas volunteered to climb the 100-foot
cliff in this south Wales community, authorities said.
   Because he cannot hear and does not speak, he carried the girl
with him to a campground atop the bluff, where the youngster
telephoned for help. The 10 other people subsequently were picked
up by a rescue boat.
   ``Alice and Sara were very brave to climb the cliff,'' said
Dennis Fairfield of the Swansea coast guard.

   A fire swept through 10 homes and two
businesses, forcing up to 100 people out of their homes and sending
flames 80 feet into the air before hundreds of firefighters
contained it early today.
   Several firefighters suffered minor injuries, but residents of a
three-block area in this small community just north of Albany
escaped unharmed, said Colonie Fire Department Deputy Coordinator
Bob Winn.
   The blaze left 50 to 100 people homeless, the Red Cross
estimated. Most of the burned houses were two- or three-family
homes, said police Lt. George Donahue.
   ``I got nothing _ just a pair of shoes,'' said an elderly man
who refused to give his name. He said his apartment building was
reduced to rubble.
   The fire started shortly after 9:30 p.m. Sunday in a six-family
brick duplex in the densely packed downtown area and quickly
spread, said Cohoes Fire Chief Ray LaMora.
   The fire, which destroyed a carpet store and a pharmacy, was
contained by the 500 to 600 firefighters shortly before 1 a.m.,
LaMora said.
   The flames lit up the sky with an orange glow visible at least
three miles away. Heavy smoke filled the air, forcing residents and
firefighters to breathe through handkerchiefs. Hundreds of people
watched the blaze.
   ``I was in London during World War II during the Blitz,'' said
Lilian Foy, who lives four blocks from the area. ``London was
burning. I have not seen anything similar to that until now.''
   Some firefighters stayed on today to hose down the rubble;
police guarded empty homes.
   Roger Hordines, who lives half a block and across the street
from where the fire was stopped, said he watered down his roof with
a garden hose and ordered his wife to take everything from the
family's safe to a friend's house a few blocks away.
   His neighbor, Jim Streicher, said he became separated from his
8-year-old son in the confusion when police ordered him to leave
his home half a block from the fire. He said he found his son with
a family friend.
   ``I do feel lucky,'' Streicher said. ``I know my kid is safe and
my house is safe. My buddy owned the carpet store and he's hurting
pretty bad.''
   A church and a Salvation Army office were set up as emergency
shelters for the homeless, but most stayed with friends or
relatives, said Marion Longcoy of the Salvation Army.

<HEAD>Voters To Decide New Airport For Denver</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2nd graf with 1 graf to clarify location of proposed
airport site.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to build a $3 billion replacement for
Denver's crowded Stapleton International Airport will be decided by
voters in a special election Tuesday, with backers heavily
outspending opponents.
   The specific issue to be decided by Adams County voters is
whether to allow Denver to annex an unincorporated 45-square-mile
site in the county 10 miles northeast of Stapleton.
   The airport is the first major one planned in the United States
since Dallas-Fort Worth opened in 1974. It would replace Stapleton,
the world's fifth-busiest airport, and could become the nation's
second busiest airport by the year 2000, based on Federal Aviation
Administration predictions.
   The FAA supports the new airport because Stapleton is congested
and is predicted to lead the nation in flight delays by 1996.
   Denver's budget for buying land and building the first phase of
the airport by 1995 is $1.6 billion. Officials estimate a total $3
billion will be spent to complete the project by 2020.
   Proponents say the airport would boost Colorado's ailing economy
by providing jobs and development. The industrial and commercial
development would mean property tax relief for homeowners,
supporters say.
   Opponents contend jet noise generated by the airport would be
unbearable for homeowners, and say closing Stapleton would be a
waste of money. They also say foul air and thundering jets could
destroy the nearby 2,700-acre Barr Lake State Park bird refuge.
   The biggest push for the site east of the Rocky Mountain
Arsenal, which is adjacent to Stapleton, has been by the Adams
County Partners In Progress. The group has spent more than $825,000
in its attempt to persuade the 115,000 registered voters to approve
the annexation. The group has the support of major business, labor
and government leaders.
   Most of the opposition has come from neighborhood groups.
Ordinary People for a Better Adams County has led the effort,
spending $48,600, according to campaign financial reports filed
with the county clerk's office.
   The Committee for a Better Airport, another group opposing the
proposal, has spent $8,000 and may spend $2,000 more before
Tuesday, said spokesman Reuben Espinosa.
   Proponents point to a study that predicts a new airport would
generate 54,000 jobs by 2010.
   Armed with this projection, Gov. Roy Romer has staged his own
campaign. In the past few months, Romer has shared breakfast at
restaurants around the county with potential voters.
   ``They're looking for somebody to believe,'' said Romer. ``The
thing I've added is to help them believe somebody. I have
credibility.''
   The anti-airport side, meanwhile, picked up support recently
when major hotels near Stapleton criticized the plan. They called
it unnecessary and a waste of billions of dollars already invested
at Stapleton.
   The airlines joined the squabble early, questioning the
timetable that proposes an opening by 1995. United Airlines and
Continental Airlines, Denver's two largest carriers, say the new
airport is not needed until later in the 1990s, at the earliest.
   They also have issued minor objections, such as not being
consulted about runway configuration, and accused Mayor Federico
Pena of pushing the project to create jobs, not because the
airlines need it.
   As a result of negotiations with county officials, the proposed
site was moved three times, each time farther from Denver. The
current site is 18 miles from downtown, compared with Stapleton's
seven miles.
   ``That's why I felt it is important for Denver to have a direct
link, why annexation is so important to me,'' Pena said.
   Both sides say voter turnout will be the deciding factor.
   ``We think it's going to be tight,'' said Bill Kenyon,
communications director for Partners in Progress.

   A hot desert wind today brought a third day of
Israel's hottest weather in 18 years, sparking more than 100 forest
fires and causing the death of a tourist from heat stroke.
   In the coastal city of Tel Aviv, temperatures reached 114
degrees Sunday and were expected to reached 116 today.
   A 55-year-old Austrian tourist, Hubert Riegler of Vienna, died
Saturday after suffering heat stroke when he went on a hike in the
Dead Sea area south of Jerusalem, police said.
   The record temperatures were caused by a ``sharav,'' or hot
desert wind, which arrives from North Africa, said Marco Marcel, a
weather forecaster at the Israel Meteorological Service.
   The three-day heat wave was the worst since May 1970, when
temperatures reached 115 degrees, Marcel said.
   A 35-year-old Israeli died in Ramat Hasharon, a suburb of Tel
Aviv, when he tried to light an electric generator during a power
outage caused by record consumption of electricity. He burned to
death when the generator burst into flames, police said.
   Health officials advised people to stay indoors as much as
possible and drink 12 to 16 glasses of water a day.
   In the northern Galilee, firefighters were battling 50 fires
today that had burned for over 24 hours, Israel radio said. Small
planes were used to spray water on the flames. Another 50 blazes
have been extinquished.
   Flames that started in thorn fields near the Ein Gev kibbutz, or
communal farm, spread to uncleared mine fields left over from war,
said Danny Hanania, fire chief for the Galilee and Golan Heights
region. Hanania said.
   Fires also burned down six homes in the Mitzpe Kelil settlement,
destroying an estimated 350 acres of trees and caused at least
$500,000 damage, Israeli radio and news reports said.
   A small village in the Galilee, Moshav Ya'ara, population 350,
was evacuated because of fire, the radio said.
   The Meteorological Service issued warnings to farmers raising
chickens, which are especially sensitive to high temperatures.
   ``The poor chickens suffer terribly in this heat and must be
cooled down as much as possible,'' Marcel said.

   A car plunged over the side of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, killing the driver and marking the
first time a vehicle went off the span since it opened 51 years ago.
   The auto landed on the rocky shore of Yerba Buena Island, 130
feet below, and then rolled into the bay and sank Sunday, the
California Highway Patrol said.
   The victim's name was withheld pending notification of relatives.
   The 1978 Oldsmobile turned left after coming out of the Yerba
Buena Tunnel and drove up a metal housing for the bridge's cable
supports, investigators said.
   ``He hit the cable ramp and lofted right over the rail,'' said
Inspector Lawrence Bolger of the Navy's police department on
Treasure Island, located adjacent to Yerba Buena Island.
   ``We don't know what caused it, but the car hit an embankment,
became airborne, caught one of the cross-beams on the bridge
structure, which wound up being a ramp and propelled it over the
side into the water,'' said the patrol dispatcher in San Francisco.
   Police were still investigating the cause of the accident early
today.
   A team of San Francisco Fire Department divers searched for
other bodies but found none.

   Hundreds of charging students hurled
firebombs and rocks at riot police today after a student committed
ritual suicide to demand the release of all political prisoners.
   Fighting occurred at Korea and Sungkyunkwan universities in
different parts of Seoul after police fired tear gas to stop 1,200
students marching into the streets to honor the death of Cho
Sung-man, 24.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship,'' students screamed as
they pelted riot police with firebombs that exploded in sheets of
flaming gasoline. No serious injuries were reported.
   At least 3,000 students and dissidents staged peaceful protests
at other colleges and at Myongdong Cathedral, where Cho stabbed
himself in the stomach Sunday before jumping from the top of a
three-story building.
   Hundreds of mourners, some of them weeping, lit incense or left
white and yellow flowers at a makeshift altar outside the
cathedral. Students marched around the cathedral compound shouting
slogans and speakers urged passersby to fight the government.
   ``Free all prisoners of conscience immediately,'' the protesters
shouted.
   Cho, who shouted anti-government slogans before leaping, left a
note calling for reunification of North Korea and South Korea and
saying that the south was not a democracy. He demanded the release
of all political prisoners.
   ``As a human being born in this barren land, the Korean
peninsula, I offer this letter ernestly desiring to see the
unification of the fatherland,'' the note said.
   Cho, who had a long history of involvement in anti-government
protests and who attended Seoul National University, urged the
South Korean government to make concessions to persuade North Korea
to take part in the Olympic Games in Seoul in September. He also
compared his anguish over the division of Korea to the suffering
and death of Jesus Christ.
   Ritual political suicide is a form of protest sometimes used in
Korea in an attempt to shame the government and draw attention to
radical causes. A number of students have killed themselves in
public protests in recent years.
   Plans were being prepared for a ``democratic peoples' funeral''
to bury Cho later in the week. More protests are expected during
the week.
   The death came three days before the May 18 anniversary of the
1980 anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju in
which about 200 people were killed. The anniversary is invariably
marked by anti-government protests.
   Opposition leaders expressed regret over the death and demanded
the government free all political prisoners. The government
contends only political opponents guilty of sedition or serious
crimes remain in prison after an amnesty earlier this year.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam, who visited the morgue where
Cho's body was being held, said the death represented ``the voice
of the entire Korean people.''
   Korean newspapers reported today that the government was
considering freeing more political prisoners. But a government
spokesman said no decision had been made.
   Radical students have been calling for the reunification of the
two Koreas, divided since 1945. The two nations are bitter rivals
that have clashed repeatedly over the years.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympic Games to demand it be
allowed to co-host the Games.

<HEAD>Leukemia Victim Taunted by Schoolmates Gets `Dream Bicycle'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLCHESTER, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``dream bicycle'' has turned out to be
the best medicine for an 8-year-old girl with leukemia who was
taunted by schoolmates.
   Embarrassed when medication caused her hair to fall out, Sarah
Lambert became withdrawn as other kids teased her, according to her
mother.
   Sarah's disease, acute lymphocytic leukemia, was diagnosed in
August 1986 and has been in remission since October 1986. But the
drugs used to treat her illness caused her hair to fall out, her
mother, Diane Lambert, said.
   ``Some of the kids were cruel. They would say things about her
hair. And when she wore a wig, some of the kids would pull it
off,'' Mrs. Lambert said.
   One of Sarah's relatives contacted the Children's Hopes and
Dreams Foundation in Dover, N.J., thinking that fulfillment of the
little girl's greatest wish would, as Mrs. Lambert put it, ``help
her open up a little bit.''
   When asked what she wanted most in life, Sarah's response was
simple: she wanted a new bicycle.
   ``Most kinds want to go to Walt Disney World or meet a
television celebrity or the president,'' said Vic Franklin,
director of the dream foundation. ``A lot of kids go hog wild. But
not Sarah.''
   Franklin determined that Sarah met the foundation's criteria for
granting dreams: she's between 3 and 17, diagnosed with a
life-threatening illness, she hasn't received a dream before and
her parents were not in a position to fulfill the dream themselves.
   Mrs. Lambert said Sarah preferred a bicycle over a trip because
she wanted something she could hold on to and remember. Besides,
her old bike was falling to pieces.
   ``We try to make the children feel special, and we told her
parents to make sure they got the best bicycle they could find for
Sarah,'' Franklin said. ``If she wanted a basket, get a basket. If
she wanted a fancy paint job, get it.'' Mrs. Lambert shopped around
until she found the perfect bike: a five-speed beauty with a
hot-pink seat-cover and basket attached to the front handlebars. It
also came with a water bottle and new lock.
   ``She hit the road immediately and rides up and down the street
behind our house,'' Mrs. Lambert said.
   Things already have changed for Sarah since the bicycle arrived.
   ``It's been real exciting for her,'' Mrs. Lambert said.
``Suddenly, she's No. 1 at school. Getting a little attention ...
has made her really proud. And all her friends are treating her
like a celebrity. She loves it.''

<HEAD>Soviet Troops Begin Pullout From Afghanistan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with quotes from Najib's
speech. PICKS up 7th graf, `Soviet troops ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convoy of 1,300 Soviet soldiers
today pulled out of the Afghan capital and headed for home. Gunfire
rang out in the distance during a farewell ceremony, an ominous
reminder that the civil war rages on.
   President Najib spoke at the ceremony for the departing troops,
the first contingent of Soviet forces to leave under an
international accord to end the Soviet Union's eight-year
involvement in the war.
   The 300-vehicle convoy was the first of four from the
northeastern city of Jalalabad near the Pakistan border. It set out
early Sunday morning on the 88-mile trip to the capital, and has an
additional 200 miles to go before reaching Soviet soil.
   In a speech at the rally, Najib referred to the troops as ``my
dear friends'' who had helped his country at a time of ``life and
death.'' Afghan forces now can defend the country on their own, he
said.
   The Afghan leader and his military commanders pinned medals on
some of the 500 Soviet soldiers who stood for two hours during
review. The medals are gold and are attached to a blue ribbon
bearing the inscription, ``From a grateful Afghan people.''
   ``May your way be safe and your dishes tasty,'' Najib told the
departing Soviets.
   Military bands played and thousands of Afghan soldiers and
civilians waved flags.
   Gunshots could be heard in the distance, apparently from clashes
between the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas and pro-government forces.
   Meanwhile, the leader of a Moslem guerrilla faction vowed on
Sunday to seize Jalalabad as soon as the rest of the estimated
6,000 Soviet troops that were stationed there withdraw.
   ``We'll continue our jihad (holy war). We are fighting against
an idea,'' said Mahmood, a commander in the radical Hezb-I-Islami
guerrilla faction, who spoke from his headquarters in Peshawar,
Pakistan.
   Soviet troops are expected to complete their retreat from
Jalalabad in two weeks and be replaced by up to 12,000 Afghan army
troops.
   Mahmood said he had 10,000 men under his command but could not
predict when Jalalabad, a strategic city 45 miles from the Pakistan
border, would be in guerrilla hands.
   ``There will be a lot of army there. It will need a lot of
pressure,'' Mahmood said.
   Edmund McWilliams, deputy chief-of-mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Kabul, said Sunday the insurgents have moved closer and stepped
up their rocket attacks on the city, the capital of Nangarhar
province.
   ``It does not appear, though, at this point that the attacks ..
. will be affecting the pullout,'' he said.
   In the past month, insurgents reportedly have overrun dozens of
security posts in eastern Afghanistan as Soviet forces handed them
over to Afghan army troops.
   The Red Army convoy arrived in Kabul on Sunday at the end of its
daylong journey through mountains teeming with guerrillas.
Officials said on Sunday the convoy included 1,200 men, but today
raised that figure to 1,300.
   On Sunday, the Communist Party leadership in Moscow thanked the
departing troops. ``Days of severe trials lie behind you,'' said
the party Central Committee address, printed on the front page of
the party daily Pravda. ``You have fulfilled the order of your
homeland.''
   Twenty Western journalists were brought to Jalalabad to ride
with the convoy to Kabul, and during the night spent in Jalalabad
they heard heavy bombardment and felt the impact of a
surface-to-surface missile that landed 90 feet from their hotel.
   Information about the start of the withdrawal was provided by a
Reuters news agency pool report. Associated Press reporters were
barred from covering the event. Soviet officials said the exclusion
was the result of questions asked by the AP during a previous trip
to Kabul.
   Soviet troops and tanks moved into Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979,
to fight the anti-communist insurgency and replace one pro-Soviet
government with another. The United States has supplied arms to the
insurgents.
   About 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan to bolster
Najib's forces, but all must pull back to Soviet territory within
the next nine months to comply with U.N.-mediated peace accords
signed in Geneva last month.
   Half the troops are to leave by Aug. 15 under the agreement. Lt.
Gen. Boris Gromov told reporters on Saturday that about one-quarter
of the soldiers would be home before President Reagan visits Moscow
on May 29.
   The Soviet's departure will leave Najib's army of 50,000 alone
in its battle against about 200,000 Moslem insurgents. The
guerrillas have vowed to fight on to topple the Marxist government.
   Guerrillas and Western observers estimate that about 1.5 million
Afghans have died in the war. The U.S. State Department estimates
Soviet casualties since 1979 at 33,000 to 38,000, more than
one-third of whom were killed.
   An estimated 2.9 million Afghan refugees are in Pakistan and an
estimated 2.3 million are in Iran.

   Security forces today stepped up pressure
on Sikh extremists holed up in the Golden Temple, pounding two
lookout towers with machinegun fire and incendiary bullets amid
calls for the gunmen to surrender.
   Seven Sikhs who surrendered on Sunday were brought to the
complex to appeal to comrades still inside the holy shrine, the
center of the Sikh separatist movement.
   ``The officers are good to us. None of us have been troubled.
Please come out with your hands in the air,'' Skatter Singh pleaded
over a loudspeaker set up on a rooftop.
   There was no immediate response, but sporadic shots were heard
from inside the complex.
   Singh, a member of the Kalistan Commando Force, one of several
Sikh militant groups that has offices in the temple complex, has
been in police custody since Sunday.
   Sarabjeet Singh, deputy police commissioner, said more than 50
militants remained in the walled compound on the eight day of the
siege. He said at least 40 of them were inside the gold-domed
temple's inner sanctum, the holiest part of the shrine.
   During a 2{-hour cease-fire on Sunday, 151 people surrendered,
including 18 women and eight children. Most of 125 men who
surrendered are being detained, but Punjab state police chief
K.P.S. Gill said 17 were released today.
   Meanwhile, Sikh gunmen shot and killed 13 people in four revenge
attacks elsewhere in Punjab state, United News of India reported
today.
   The extremists have killed at least 978 people in Punjab this
year in their quest for an independent homeland.
   The recent victims included seven Hindu laborers, a Sikh
sorcerer and another Sikh. The others were not identified.
   The siege at the Golden Temple was launched May 9 after
militants in the complex opened fire on security force commanders
who were inspecting the area outside the temple's 20-foot high
walls. Five officers were injured.
   Four bodies were carried out of the temple Sunday, raising to at
least 35 the number of people who have died since the siege began.
The dead included at least five non-combatants.
   Today, bricks flew off the two towers as security forces blasted
them with bullets from nearby rooftops this afternoon.
   ``I think we will be here for quite some time,'' said one
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We will have to
starve them out or think of other alternatives.''
   Food and other supplies have been cut off since the siege
started, but the militants routinely stockpile supplies in the
complex, which contains dining halls and kitchens.
   Intermittent gunfire was heard throughout the night as the Sikh
militants and the security forces traded shots.
   The firing by the radicals increased after sunrise today, and
the security forces used rocket-propelled grenades to neutralize
their positions, Gill said.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Sunday the Golden Temple's jailed head priest, Jasbir Singh Rode,
has been asked to urge the militants to surrender.
   Rode and three of the Golden Temple's four other high priests
were detained Thursday when they tried to march to the shrine.
   Among those who surrendered Sunday was Surjit Singh Penta, 24,
who was wanted by police in connection with the deaths of more than
150 people.
   Police said that when he was recognized by security officers,
Penta asked for a glass of water and swallowed a cyanide capsule.
He died at a hospital, police said.
   The government is reluctant to send troops into the 400-year-old
Golden Temple because religious Sikhs would consider such an
onslaught an intolerable desecration of their holiest shrine.
   In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent the army into the
temple to drive out Sikh militants. More than 1,200 people, mostly
Sikhs, died in the raid.
   Less than five months later, Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated by two
of her Sikh bodyguards. The revenge slaying set off anti-Sikh riots
in New Delhi and other cities in which at least 2,000 people died,
many of them innocent Sikhs.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, say they are discriminated
against by India's Hindu majority. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.

   The pistol-packing woman who heads an
anti-crime group made her second citizen's arrest in three days
while a TV crew tried to interview her about the first.
   Lillian Jackson, coordinator of March Against Crime, was being
interviewed Saturday for a TV news report in the building where she
caught the first man.
   ``We were laughing about me catching the burglar Thursday night,
and (the reporter) said, `Come on over here, Lillian, and show me
how you did it.' We went in there, and I heard noises, ran across
the room to the stairwell, and there were two more.''
   The middle-aged Miss Jackson said she pointed her .38-caliber
pistol at the two suspects, but one got away as she took them
outside for police.
   ``I had a bead on him and was going to shoot the escaping one,
or fire over his head, and the newsman said, `Don't shoot him,
Lillian, don't shoot him, Lillian, I've got him on camera,''' she
said.
   WKRG-TV cameraman Johnny Sartin captured the entire sequence on
videotape.
   A Mobile police spokesman said Darrell Lamont Clark, 26, of
Mobile was charged with third-degree burglary. The man who escaped
remained at large.
   Thursday night, Miss Jackson and other members of her group were
moving items into the building for a garage sale when she heard
someone walking upstairs, so she called police.
   ``The officers went in through the front,'' she said. ``I went
to the back with my gun. When he came out, I told him to hold it
and marched him right to the officers.''

<HEAD>Gain Biggest in 6 Months</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities shot up 0.7 percent in April, the biggest gain in six
months, the government reported today.
   The Federal Reserve said the April advance followed increases of
0.4 percent in January and 0.2 percent in March and no change at
all in February. It was the largest advance since a 1.1 percent
surge last October.
   The increase was in line with expectations as economists had
predicted a strong showing based on a pickup in production at auto
factories.
   Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7 million units last
month, up from a rate of 6.6 million units in March.
   With the latest improvement, overall industrial production is
now 6.4 percent higher than it was a year ago, a further sign of
the resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has enjoyed
booming export sales because of the decline in the value of the
dollar.
   The Reagan administration is counting on further reductions in
the U.S. trade deficit to contribute almost half of the expected
growth in the overall economy this year.
   The April advance in industrial output followed a period of
generally sluggish activity in the first part of the year as
production gains slowed while manufacturers, particularly in the
auto industry, tried to work down an overhang of unsold goods.
   Still, the production slowdown was much less severe than had
been feared immediately after the October stock market collapse. At
that time, some economists believed that a drop in consumer
spending would force such steep cuts in production that the country
would be pushed into a recession.
   Instead, the overall economy expanded at a moderate 2.3 percent
annual rate in the first three months of the year, as measured by
the gross national product.
   The April report showed that output in the manufacturing sector
climbed 0.7 percent in April, reflecting an increase of 0.9 percent
in the production of durable goods, items expected to last three
years or more, and a 0.4 percent rise in non-durable production.
   Output in the mining industry jumped 1.3 percent in April,
following a 0.7 percent March increase. The strong gains in both of
those months followed a string of declines. This sector, which
includes oil and gas drilling, has been depressed because of
falling oil prices.
   Output at the nation's utilities fell 0.8 percent in April,
following an even larger 1.1 percent drop in March.
   The various changes left the industrial production index at
135.6 in April, up from 134.7 in March.

<HEAD>Former Governor Mecham Wins Seat As Republican Delegate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted Gov. Evan Mecham says he doesn't
think his election as an Arizona delegate to the Republican
National Convention is a litmus test of his strength in the party.
   ``This was not a referendum on me,'' Mecham said after
Saturday's state convention vote. ``I am a unity candidate. I'm
trying to keep the party together.''
   Many Republicans hoped Mecham would fade from the political
scene after they voted to remove him at his impeachment trial last
month. But at the state convention, the former governor, who failed
to be picked from his own congressional district, ran successfully
as an at-large delegate.
   He was not claimed by any presidential candidate.
   ``Hurrah,'' Mecham said when told of the results by reporters
minutes before they were announced to the convention. ``Well, for
not being on a slate, that's not too bad.'' Mecham came in 17th in
the secret balloting for 18 at-large seats.
   His supporters burst into cheers, applause and chants of ``We
want Ev!'' when Mecham's name was announced.
   All 33 delegates elected said they will support Vice President
George Bush at the national convention in New Orleans, even though
three delegates were elected from a ``conservative unity'' slate
put together by the presidential campaign of Pat Robertson. The
former television evangelist is formally leaving the race today.
   Mecham's stormy, 15-month governorship tore the state GOP apart,
and former Sen. Barry Goldwater, in a keynote address greeted by
several standing ovations, urged Republicans to try to ``heal the
wounds.''
   ``I've heard and I've read of people who want to seek vengeance
upon those who ... failed to support our former governor in his
hours of trauma,'' Goldwater said. ``I hope that doesn't happen,
because if it does, I can stand here and tell you that it will mark
the end of the Republican Party in Arizona for many, many years.''
   Goldwater had backed Mecham during the 1986 campaign but later
became one of his harshest critics.
   Mecham, who was removed as governor by a Senate court of
impeachment, is facing criminal charges in a trial due to start
Thursday. He is accused of failing to properly report a $350,000
campaign loan.
   If Mecham is convicted of a felony by the start of the national
convention, it would be up to the national party's rules committee
to decide whether he would be allowed to participate, according to
Joe Abate, the state party's legal counsel.
   U.S. Sen. John McCain had said before the state meeting that he
would be ``inclined not to attend'' the national convention if
Mecham was a delegate.
   On Saturday, however, McCain placed 10th in the at-large
balloting with 296 votes to Mecham's 271 and said he had decided to
attend no matter what.
   ``Amazing,'' he said of the vote. ``I respect the decision of
the convention. I have no other comment about it.''

<HEAD>Bloody Week of Gang Killings Pushes 1987 Death Toll To 123</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increased police presence in gang-infested
neighborhoods failed to curb weekend street attacks as five people
died and at least 10 others were wounded.
   The bloodshed pushed the week's countywide gang-related death
toll to 10, and increased the 1988 total to 123.
   The violence came despite a sweep by a 200-officer anti-gang
task force that counted 125 gang arrests during the weekend.
   In one killing, the mother of a gang member was booked for
investigation of murder after admitting she stabbed her son to
death in an argument over his refusal to pay back a Mother's Day
loan.
   Sammie McGee, 37, told police she killed her son, Bluefus Davis,
18, Saturday night after he said his gang status gave him the right
to welsh on the debt, said police Sgt. Jon Rygh.
   Meanwhile, services were held for a 13-year-old girl whose
killing May 9 began the heavy week of gang violence.
   About 200 people attended the service Saturday for Jamee Finney,
who was gunned down with friend Latonjyia Stover, 18, as the pair
returned from a fast-food restaurant.
   Authorities say gang members who were cheated in a drug deal
shot the two in their car, thinking that one was the sister of the
dealer who sold them two pounds of flour instead of cocaine for
$14,000. Five people were arrested in the slayings.
   Among the other victims of gang-related violence were a
20-year-old man who died Sunday after being stabbed by an alleged
gang member at a high school carnival two days earlier; a
23-year-old man shot dead outside a party early Sunday; a
25-year-old alleged gang leader who was killed Friday night after
an argument with three men believed to be gang rivals; and a
28-year-old man who was fatally gunned down early Saturday as he
fled pursuing gang members at a gas station, police said.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres opened
talks today with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on the stalled
U.S. plan for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Peres, who arrived Sunday night, had breakfast with Shultz at
his home in a Washington suburb. On a busy day, he was scheduled to
see Shultz, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Howard H. Baker
Jr., the White House chief of staff, at a luncheon hosted by
Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad.
   A meeting on Capitol Hill with key members of Congress and then
a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the
principal pro-Israeli lobbying group, follow.
   On Tuesday, Peres has a formal session with Shultz and then
calls on President Reagan at the White House.
   Israeli officials in Washington noted that Shultz met lest week
in Geneva with Sovier Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``He may have something from the Soviets on the Mideast peace
process,'' said one Israeli official who asked not to be identified.
   But Shultz told reporters traveling with him last week that he
discerned no major change in the Soviets' position.
   They want to play an influential role in the negotiations.
Shultz and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir are against the
idea.
   Peres also met in recent days with Soviet officials while
attending a conference of the Socialist International in Madrid,
the official said.
   Also on the agenda for Peres and Shultz was discussion of
Shultz's June 3 trip to the Middle East intended to breathe life
into his plan for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   However, the Israelis ``are not expecting any great
breakthroughs in his talks here,'' which include a 30-minute White
House meeting on Tuesday, said the official.
   A major obstacle to the Shultz plan is its rejection by Peres'
rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Shamir objects to the role
the plan gives the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council as overseers of the talks. The five are the United States,
Soviet Union, China, England and France.
   The plan calls for an international conference to launch direct
Israeli-Arab talks on self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. It envisions that
talks on the permanent fate of the territories Israel captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war would begin six months
later.
   The Soviet role in Arab-Israeli peace talks is a thorny issue
for both Israel and the United States.
   While the Arabs want Soviet participation as part of an
international peace conference, both the Israelis and the Americans
are reluctant to allow the Kremlin too much say in the process.
   Both countries have expressed willingness to let the Soviets
participate if the Kremlin renews the diplomatic links it severed
with Israel in 1967 and allows more Jews to emigrate from the
Soviet Union.
   The Soviets have in recent months increased their emigration
levels and held low-level consular talks with Israel.
   Peres is also visiting several other major American and Canadian
cities on a lecture tour and fund-raising drive.

   Israeli soldiers today killed two Arab youths
and wounded nine other protesters in clashes throughout the
occupied territories as the Moslem holy month of Ramadan drew to a
close, officials said.
   Besides the Arabs who were shot, eight demonstrators in the Gaza
Strip were treated for injuries from beatings or rubber bullets,
according to Arab sources.
   Most of the protests erupted during marches in which
Palestinians waved flags and shouted nationalistic slogans after
morning prayers at mosques for Id el Fitr, the end of a month of
fasting called Ramadan.
   PLO underground leaders of the Arab uprising have urged that Id
el Fitr be a day of ``national mourning'' for Palestinians killed
in the five-month rebellion.
   Today's deaths brought to 190 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8, according to U.N. figures. An
Israeli settler and soldier also have been killed.
   The daily newspaper Haaretz reported, meanwhile, that reserve
soldiers returning from duty in the occupied territories were
complaining that beating or humiliating Arabs was becoming routine
in the army.
   The reservists, who were not identified by name, said
humiliating tactics included stripping people naked during
questioning. Some reservists said they witnessed Arab homes being
vandalized by soldiers.
   One of today's worst clashes occurred in the Jebalya refugee
camp in Gaza where troops opened fire on marchers, killing a
17-year-old youth identified as Jiha Absi, who was shot in the
chest.
   A 10-year-old boy, Aid Hamdani, was wounded by a bullet in the
left ankle, and Rami Timraz, 13, was struck by a bullet in the left
leg, they said.
   Witnesses said Hamdani smiled and flashed a V-for-victory sign
as he was taken into the emergency room at Gaza's Ahli Arab
Hospital.
   Hospital officials said eight other protesters were beaten or
hit by rubber bullets in the camp where violence persisted
throughout the day despite a military curfew.
   The second fatality occurred in the village of Azmut near the
West Bank city of Nablus where soldiers opened fire on about 200
marchers.
   A 15-year-old boy was hit by a bullet in the chest and died
later of his wounds, and two other people also suffered bullet
wounds, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed a fatality in the village after the clash but
said the body was being examined to determine the cause of death.
   Details on the other wounded were not immediately available.
   In incidents Sunday, five Arabs were wounded in other protests
in the towns of Kalkilye and Idna near Hebron on the West Bank, the
army said.
   Soldiers also clamped curfew restrictions on the Kalandia
refugee camp north of Jerusalem after an Israeli passenger was
injured when the car he was riding in was stoned on a main highway.
   In a leaflet issued last week by PLO underground leaders of the
uprising, the 16th since the rebellion began, organizers said the
Moslem holiday should be used to protest ``the Arab and Islamic
silence'' in response to the violence.
   The day also marked a month since the slaying of PLO Chief
Yasser Arafat's deputy Khalil Wazir, who grew up in Gaza and was
also known as Abu Jihad.
   Wazir was killed in Tunisia. Israeli sources have said Israeli
security forces were responsible. The Israeli government has not
commented.
   Also today, a left-wing legislator urged further army
investigations into findings that at least one Israeli teen-ager in
a paramilitary training course beat Arab prisoners in a West Bank
jail.
   The legislator, Yair Tsaban of the socialist Mapam party, said
the incident occurred between Feb. 7-12 when a group of teen-agers
from a high school in southern Israel was brought to a base near
the West Bank city of Ramallah.
   Tsaban said the army put a military sergeant on trial for
allegedly encouraging the beatings, but that it was unclear whether
the officer was punished.
   ``I am demanding that this investigation be completed and that
this story be taught in the schools so that it won't happen
again,'' Tsaban said.
   On Sunday, thousands of Israelis attended ceremonies marking the
21st anniversary of the capture of Jerusalem's Arab sector.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed Jerusalem would remain
Israel's capital forever and said his government would never give
up the territories, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Shamir spoke at a ceremony on Ammunition Hill, site of one of
the fiercest battles in which Israel's army seized East Jerusalem
from Jordan.
   Although Jerusalem is Israel's declared capital, few countries
recognize it as such.

<HEAD>IRA Informer Freed After Serving Six Years Of Life Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish Republican Army informer was released
from prison after serving less than six years of a life sentence
for murdering three Protestants, the Northern Ireland Office said
today.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King used his ministerial power
to free Kevin McGrady at the end of April, King's office reported.
   McGrady surrendered to police in January 1982 after becoming a
born-again Christian while hiding from police in the Netherlands.
He confessed to the 1973 murders of three Protestants and was
sentenced to life imprisonment.
   Later that year he was the key government witness in a case
involving several former associates in the outlawed IRA. Seven men
were convicted of murder and other crimes on fthe basis of
McGrady's uncorroborated testimony.
   The spokeswoman, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity, could not give a specific reason for the early release,
but said King would have taken into account McGrady's cooperation
with the authorities.
   ``He (King) must also be satisfied that there is adequate reason
to believe the person will not commit another violent crime,'' she
said.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said
McGrady has left the country. The Northern Ireland Office would not
comment on his whereabouts.
   The IRA is fighting a guerrilla war to oust the British from
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the
mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling Allowing Abortions for Prison Inmates in
New Jersey Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that pregnant prison inmates have the right to free abortions if
they cannot afford them.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by
prison officials in Monmouth County, N.J., that no such right
exists if an abortion is unnecessary to preserve an inmate's life
or health.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Nov. 25 _ in a
decision binding on all local, state and federal prisons in New
Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania _ that inmates have a
constitutional right to even elective, non-therapeutic abortions.
   The appeals court barred enforcement of a Monmouth County
Correctional Institution policy that required inmates to get a
court order allowing them to get a non-therapeutic abortion. The
policy also required the inmates themselves to pay for such
abortions.
   ``The challenged regulation fails to provide inmates with a
meaningful opportunity to exercise their constitutionally protected
right to choose to abort their pregnancies,'' the 3rd Circuit court
ruled.
   A 1973 Supreme Court decision legalized abortion, based on the
right of privacy. The court said women have a fundamental
constitutional right to choose to end their pregnancies.
   But the court since has ruled that the federal government and
states are not obligated to pay for even medically necessary
abortions sought by women on welfare.
   Women behind bars present a special case because the high court
has ruled that the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, banning cruel
and unusual punishment, requires prisons to provide adequate
medical care.
   In the New Jersey case, the appeals court ruled that a federal
judge was justified in ruling that the inmates ``demonstrated a
likelihood of success on their Eighth Amendment claim that denial
of abortion-related services constitutes deliberate indifference to
a serious medical need.''
   The appeals court rejected the county's argument that its
responsibility to an inmate requesting a non-therapeutic abortion
is the same as its responsibility to one who wants a facelift for
purely cosmetic reasons.
   The 3rd Circuit court stopped short of ruling that denial of
abortion funding for inmates also is unconstitutional, but it did
order Monmouth County authorities to pay.
   ``County defendants shall assume responsibility for insuring the
availability of funding for all inmate abortions. If alternative
means of funding are non-existent, the county must assume the full
cost of all inmate abortions,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, prison officials said, ``The
Eighth Amendment clearly does not protect all medical needs; the
test is one of medical necessity, not simply that which may be
considered desireable.''
   The appeal warned against ``the somewhat anomalous situation of
allowing a person who cannot otherwise obtain an elective abortion
to obtain one by virtue of being temporarily confined in the county
jail.''
   The case is Lazaro vs. Monmouth County Correctional Institution
Inmates, 87-1431.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Pelton Espionage Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand the
espionage conviction of a U.S. spy agency employee who sold
surveillance secrets to Soviet agents.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that Ronald
W. Pelton was denied a fair trial when convicted of selling
classified information about his agency's electronic eavesdropping
programs.
   Pelton, 46, worked for the National Security Agency for 14 years
as a technician before quitting in 1979. Prosecutors said he
contacted Soviet agents shortly thereafter.
   Following a federal trial in Baltimore two years ago, Pelton was
convicted of espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, attempted
espionage and unauthorized disclosure of classified information. He
was sentenced to three life terms plus 10 years.
   Pelton testified that the Soviets paid him more than $35,000
over a period of years. His activities were exposed by a Soviet
defector.
   His conviction was upheld by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last Dec. 18, sparking the appeal acted on today.
   In it, Pelton's lawyers attacked the constitutionality of a 1978
federal law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
   The law allows government agents to obtain court warrants
authorizing wiretaps and other forms of surveillance with less
proof of suspected wrongdoing than police generally are required to
show before obtaining such warrants.
   ``It is Mr. Pelton's position that (the law) is unconstitutional
because it allows unreasonable governmental intrusion upon personal
security contrary to the proscription of the Fourth Amendment,''
his appeal said.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable searches
and seizures.
   FBI agents secretly tape-recorded conversations between Pelton
and the Soviets with whom he was doing business.
   Although the Supreme Court has never ruled definitively on the
1978 law's constitutionality, three federal appeals courts have
upheld it.
   Pelton's appeal raised an alternate challenge to his
prosecution. It said that even if the 1978 law is valid, it should
not be allowed to authorize governmental investigations ``conducted
primarily in contemplation of criminal prosecution.''
   The appeal contended that the law was designed only to help the
government answer threats to the national security _ and not to
help prosecute those who pose such threats.
   The case is Pelton vs. U.S., 87-6433.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to review Texas
death row inmate Phillip Tompkins' 1981 murder conviction for
killing a woman in Houston.
   The justices said they will study arguments that Tompkins was
denied a fair trial because, among other things, prosecutors
excluded potential jurors who are black.
   Tompkins was convicted of killing Mary D. Berry, who was last
seen alive leaving her Houston job on Jan. 25, 1981. Her body was
found two days later _ bound and gagged and tied to a tree.
   Police, who said Ms. Berry was not abused in any other way,
listed suffocation as the cause of death.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide If New Jersey Unfairly Forcing Oil Companies to
Pay Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in an important case for
state treasuries, today agreed to decide whether New Jersey
unfairly is forcing 13 major oil companies to pay millions of
dollars in taxes.
   The court said it will review a ruling that allows New Jersey
officials to deny state tax deductions for what the companies pay
in federal windfall profits taxes.
   Lawyers for the oil industry, mining interests and natural gas
producers say the New Jersey case could have broad impact in
encouraging other states to adopt similar taxes.
   Reagan administration lawyers recommended that the high court
review the New Jersey case, stating, ``We have not ourselves come
to a conclusion on the question.''
   The oil companies, which operate numerous refineries in New
Jersey, challenged a state business tax law that disallows a
deduction for windfall profits tax payments.
   The companies said the state tax is unfair because the windfall
profits tax is based on oil production, none of which takes place
in New Jersey.
   The windfall profits tax was imposed after President Carter
announced he gradually would remove controls on domestic crude oil
prices beginning in June 1979. The price controls were put in place
by President Nixon in 1971.
   Through the windfall profits tax, the federal government seeks
to recover billions of dollars in extra profit the oil companies
realize by the jump in oil prices resulting from decontrol.
   For example, in mid-1979 the controlled price of previously
discovered oil was $5.86 a barrel and the price of newly discovered
oil was $13.06 a barrel. The uncontrolled world price then was
approaching $20 a barrel, and would reach $30 a barrel before
dropping dramatically in recent years.
   The windfall profits tax is imposed on production at the
wellhead rather than on net profits or income calculated on gross
sales and net profits as measured at the pump.
   The windfall profits tax, which has produced more than $78
billion in federal revenue, will remain in effect until December
1990 or until it yields $227.3 billion in revenue.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the state tax last June,
saying it does not discriminate unfairly against the oil companies.
   The oil companies paid an extra $88.5 million in taxes to New
Jersey from 1980 through 1984 because they were not allowed to
deduct the windfall profits taxes.
   The companies said six other states also disallow income tax
deductions for windfall profits taxes. They are Georgia, Iowa,
Minnesota, New York, South Carolina and Wisconsin.
   The tax challenge was mounted by Amerada Hess, Atlantic
Richfield, Conoco, Cities Service, Exxon, Phillips Petroleum,
Chevron, Mobil Oil, Union Oil of California, Gulf Oil, Shell Oil,
Tenneco Oil and Texaco.
   The cases are Amerada Hess vs. Division of Taxation, 87-453, and
Texaco vs. Division of Taxation, 87-464.

<HEAD>Court Reaffirms Denial of Tax Exemption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand rulings that
denied the Church of Scientology of California federal tax-exempt
status for three years.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that, among
other things, stripping the church of its tax exemption for the
years 1970-72 ``threatens the rights of all churches to proselytize
through the sale of religious literature.''
   The religion of Scientology was founded by L. Ron Hubbard, who
died in 1986.
   Scientologists believe they can progress toward spiritual
awareness through private sessions in which members' skin responses
to questions are monitored by an electronic device called an
E-meter, which Hubbard invented.
   Hubbard's collective writings comprise the religion's scriptures.
   For the tax years at issue in this case, the Church of
Scientology of California was the ``Mother Church'' of all
Scientology churches in the United States.
   The Internal Revenue Service in 1957 officially recognized the
Church of Scientology of California as a tax-exempt religious
organization, but revoked that exemption in 1967.
   In 1977, the IRS told the church it owed $1.43 million in taxes
and late-filing penalties for the years 1970, 1971 and 1972.
   The church sued the IRS in U.S. Tax Court, which upheld the IRS
tax assessment.
   The tax court ruled that, under the Internal Revenue Code, the
church was not entitled to tax-exempt status for the three years at
issue because some of the church's revenues ``inured to the benefit
of'' Hubbard and his wife, Susan.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last
July 28.
   ``The cumulative effect of Hubbard's use of the church to
promote royalty income (through sale of copyright materials),
Hubbard's unfettered control over millions of dollars of church
assets, and his receipt of untold thousands of dollars worth of
`debt repayments' strongly demonstrate inurement,'' the appeals
court said.
   The federal tax code gives tax-exempt status to religious or
charitable organizations if ``no part of the net earnings of which
inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.''
   Payment of reasonable salaries to church officials doe not
amount to inurement.
   In the appeal acted on today, the church argued that the appeals
court ruling ``is an unconstitutional intrusion into churches'
internal affairs.''
   The case is Church of Scientology of California vs. IRS, 87-1377.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Reinstatement of Fired Pilot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand an
arbitrator's reinstatement of an airline pilot fired for allegedly
flying drunk.
   The justices, without comment, refused to use the case of former
Northwest Airlines pilot Larry W. Morrison to study the power of
federal courts to overturn labor arbitrator's awards deemed
contrary to public policy.
   In deciding a case from Louisiana last year, the court adhered
to previous rulings that limit severely such federal court power.
   The court unanimously ruled that an arbitrator's award may be
overturned on public policy grounds only when the award creates an
explicit conflict with laws or legal precedent.
   Last month, the justices backed out of reaching a ``public
policy grounds'' decision in the case of a Postal Service letter
carrier reinstated after he was fired for failing to deliver more
than 3,500 pieces of mail.
   In the pilot's case, Morrison was fired for violating his
employer's policy against drinking alcoholic beverages within 24
hours of flying.
   A Northwest pilot for 16 years, Morrison was given a blood test
more than two hours after serving as a co-pilot on a jetliner
flight carrying 79 people from Las Vegas to San Francisco on Aug.
1, 1982. His blood alcohol level was enough to create a presumption
of intoxication under California law.
   Morrison, through the Air Line Pilots Association, challenged
his ensuing dismissal. The challenge said he was fired without
``just cause'' because his misconduct was ``the unavoidable
consequence of his alcoholism.''
   Northwest allows reformed alcoholics to be pilots. But the
airline said Morrison failed to seek help until his problem had
endangered lives, and so he had to be fired.
   Morrison has since completed a treatment program successfully.
The Federal Aviation Administration has ruled him eligible to
resume piloting commercial aircraft.
   An airline arbitration board in 1984 ordered Northwest to
reinstate Morrison but U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green here
reversed that ruling in 1985.
   She said Morrison's reinstatement would be contrary to public
policy.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here reversed the trial
judge's ruling last year.
   The appeals court interpreted a key 1983 ruling by the Supreme
Court to mean that an arbitrator's award contravenes public policy
only if the award itself violates a law or compels unlawful conduct.
   In seeking Supreme Court review, Northwest lawyers said the
appeals court's ruling in Morrison's case conflicts with other
federal appeals court interpretations of the justices' 1983
decision.
   Northwest's appeal argued that the ruling in Morrison's case is
based on a ``crimped view'' of the public policy exception created
in the 1983 decision.
   The case is Northwest Airlines vs. Air Line Pilots Association,
86-1548.

<HEAD>Court Rules States May Tax Costs of Producing Catalogsin Louisiana
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States may tax the costs of producing
merchandise catalogs mailed directly to in-state residents even
when the catalogs are published in other states, the Supreme Court
ruled today.
   The court unanimously rejected a department store chain's
attempt to avoid paying taxes for catalogs received by its
Louisiana customers.
   Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said
Louisiana's imposition of a ``use tax'' on catalogs produced for
the New Orleans-based D.H. Holmes Co. does not interfere unduly
with interstate commerce.
   ``The Louisiana tax structure does not discriminate against
interstate commerce,'' Rehnquist wrote. ``The use tax is designed
to compensate the state for revenue lost when residents purchase
out-of-state goods for use within the state. It is equal to the
sales tax applicable to the same tangible personal property
purchased in-state.''
   The chief justice also noted that Holmes, with 13 department
stores in Louisiana, initiated the catalog deliveries to improve
its sales and name-recognition among Louisiana residents.
   He said the department store chain's ``significant presence'' in
Louisiana provided what lawyers call the required ``nexus'' _
contact with the state _ to justify the tax.
   ``There is `nexus' aplenty here,'' Rehnquist said.
   The court rejected arguments that because Holmes never actually
possessed the catalogs, it never really owned them _ and therefore
should not be subject to the tax.
   D.H. Holmes Co. also operates stores in Mississippi, Alabama and
Florida but 82 percent of its catalogs are mailed to about 400,000
Louisiana customers.
   The state tax imposed on Holmes is based on 82 percent of the
catalogs' value. The company paid more than $2 million to produce
the catalogs for three years.
   Today's decision upheld state court rulings that the tax is
valid.
   The case is D.H. Holmes Co. vs. McNamara, 87-267.

<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
continued to gain steam among Iowa Democrats, winning the bulk of
delegates selected at congressional district conventions.
   Dukakis won 12 of the 34 delegates at stake over the weekend,
while backers of Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt elected nine
delegates who are technically uncommitted.
   Gephardt won the state's Feb. 8 precinct caucuses, but has since
dropped out of the race. Many of the nine uncommitted delegates are
expected to endorse Dukakis.
   Jesse Jackson, Dukakis' sole remaining active opponent, won
seven delegates, while Illinois Sen. Paul Simon collected six.
Simon has put his campaign on hold, but is still technically an
active candidate and eligible for delegates.
   Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder predicted Dukakis'
margin would grow during the month leading to the party's state
convention on June 25, when 18 more delegates will be selected.

the GOP national convention is heating up even though Vice
President George Bush trounced Sen. Bob Dole in the Republican
presidential primary in March.
   ``He's not a candidate, and there ought not to be a Dole
delegation,'' said state GOP chairman Robert S. Poliner. ``The
rules are kind of clear.''
   In dispute are the 10 delegates Dole won in the March 29, held
the same day the Kansas senator withdrew from the race. Bush won
the other 25 delegates at stake in Connecticut.
   Dole delegates are resisting attempts to keep them away from the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans, saying they are
prepared to cast their votes for Bush and just want to attend the
event.

<HEAD>American Gymnast Remains Paralyzed After Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old American who hurt her neck during a
gymnastic competition 11 days ago remains paralyzed but is
conscious, a sports official said today.
   Ryoji Itsukaichi, spokesman of the Japan Gymnastics Association,
said the condition of Julissa Gomez of Blue Springs, Mo.,
``remained almost unchanged'' since the May 5 accident.
   He said she was receiving oxygen because she has been unable to
breath regularly, and that her arms and legs are paralyzed.
   Itsukaichi quoted a doctor at the Tokyo University hospital as
saying ``it is too early to say whether she can recover from the
injuries, but since she is young, she may have a chance.''
   Miss Gomez damaged her cervical vertebrae while warming up for
the vault competition at an international gymnastics tournament
held here in conjunction with the Tokyo International Sports Fair.
   After a long runup, Miss Gomez failed to plant her feet firmly
on the springboard in front of the vault apparatus. She was
propelled into the vault head first, and carried to the other side,
where she fell on a small space of bare floor between the vault and
the mat, according to the gymnastics association.
   The technique she was attempting, in which a gymnast does a back
flip to the springboard, was introduced about 10 years ago and,
through difficult, is widely used by female gymnasts, an
association spokesman said recently.
   Last Wednesday, doctors fitted her with a tight body jacket and
inserted metal pins in the right and left sides of her skull to
secure the position of her neck.
   Itsukaichi said if her condition stabilizes, she may be flown to
the United States. But doctors say it is too dangerous to move her
now.
   The official said Miss Gomez still can not talk because of the
respirator.
   She communicates with her parents, who flew to Japan after the
accident, by blinking her eyes, Itsukaichi said.
   In this way, her parents have been able to ask her if she is in
pain or what kinds of music she wants to listen to, he said.
   Miss Gomez's grandmother and younger sister also flew to Tokyo
last week.
   According to the athletic association, Miss Gomez, named to the
U.S. junior national team in 1986, began training as a gymnast at
age 5. She became interested in gymnastics after seeing Nadia
Comeneci compete in the 1976 Olympic Games.
   Before the accident, she scored a 9.6 in the vault and was
leading her team in that event.
   A 4-foot-7-inch, 73-pound high school freshman, Miss Gomez was
born in San Antonio, Texas, and resides with her father in Blue
Springs.

   Five reputed organized crime figures convicted
two years ago of skimming $2 million in gambling proceeds from two
Las Vegas casinos lost Supreme Court appeals today.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
five were denied a fair trial and were not properly sentenced on a
variety of criminal-conspiracy charges.
   The five include Joseph J. Aiuppa, 80, and John P. Cerone, 71,
described by federal prosecutors as the boss and underboss of the
mob in Chicago.
   Also convicted were Joseph ``Joey the Clown'' Lombardo, 60, a
reputed mob assassin from Chicago; Angelo LaPietra, 67, of Chicago;
and Milton J. Rockman, 75, described as the financial brains of
organized crime in Cleveland.
   Their sentences _ some of which were amended last February by
U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Stevens Jr. _ include lengthy prison
terms, fines and restitution payments. All five are now imprisoned.
   Auippa was sentenced to 28{ years in prison, Cerone to 24{
years, Lombardo and LaPietra to 14 years, and Rockman to 21.
   Federal prosecutors said the five participated in a conspiracy
to gain and maintain a hidden interest in the Stardust and Fremont
casinos, owned by Allen Glick's Argent Corp.
   The government said the conspiracy was put into motion through
influence over trustees of the Central States Pension Fund of the
Teamsters Union. The trustees lent Glick $87.7 million in 1974 to
buy and remodel his two casinos.
   Glick testified as a government witness at the 1986 trial that
he was told to contact Frank P. Balistrieri, reputed head of the
Milwaukee mob, when he sought a $62.7 million pension fund loan to
buy the casinos.
   Glick said Balistrieri said he could help Glick get the loan,
and that the trustees soon approved it and an additional $25
million for remodeling. Glick testified that he later was forced
out of Argent Corp.
   Balistrieri, 69, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Four others named in the federal government's 1983 indictment _
Anthony Chiavola Sr. and his son, Anthony Jr., both of Chicago, and
Carl Civella and Peter Tamburello, both of Kansas City _ also
pleaded guilty.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions
last Oct. 8.
   Its opinion noted that from 1979 to 1981 Aiuppa, Cerone,
Lombardo and Rockman ``took measures to support Roy Williams to
succeed Frank Fitzsimmons as Teamsters president and later to
support Jackie Presser to succeed Williams in order to maintain the
conspirators' influence with the Teamsters union.''
   Presser was elevated to the Teamsters presidency in 1983 after
Williams was convicted of conspiring to offer a bribe to former
U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., in an effort to defeat
deregulation of the trucking industry. Williams is serving a
10-year prison sentence.
   Presser, who has been receiving cancer treatments, last week
announced he is taking a temporary leave of absence from his union
presidency. He is scheduled to stand trial in July on federal
charges in connection with an allegedly mob-inspired scheme to pad
the payroll at a Teamsters local in Cleveland that Presser also
leads.
   The cases are Aiuppa vs. U.S., 87-1365; LaPietra vs. U.S.,
87-1409; Cerone vs. U.S., 87-1419; Lombardo vs. U.S., 87-1446; and
Rockman vs. U.S., 87-1543.

   The only instruction being given today at
Radcliff Middle School was in how to cope with grief as
schoolchildren gathered to mourn classmates killed in a fiery bus
accident.
   ``Today we've got to be more concerned with feelings than
education,'' said principal Charlie Jones as school opened.
   Saturday night's crash of a church bus, which burst into flames
after it collided with a pickup truck, killed 27 people including
16 children from the middle school listed as missing and presumed
dead.
   Additional counselors were on hand to help students face the
empty desks of classmates killed in the crash.
   ``I'm just trying to use good common sense and I'm trying to
make it an hour at a time,'' Jones said. ``It's going to be hard to
mesh this big a tragedy to meet everybody's different problems.''
   Enrollment at the school totals 775 pupils, most of whom seemed
to be present today, Jones said. He described them as ``pretty
quiet, not as much emotion as I figured.''
   The victims included 13 of Radcliff Middle School's
eight-graders, one seventh-grader and two sixth-graders. Three
other middle school pupils were hospitalized and three were at home.
   Additional counselors are also going to be available at North
Hardin High School, said Principal Ray Story. He said teachers will
be encouraged to allow the students to talk about the accident.
   ``It's silent, and that's the hardest part ...,'' said Lori
Coffey, an 18-year-old senior, after school opened at North Hardin
High. ``You walk down the hall and see the hurt, but no one is
saying anything.'' The high school lost three students in the crash.
   On Sunday evening, more than 700 friends and relatives turned
out for a subdued service at the Assembly of God Church. Some of
the 40 people injured in the crash attended the service, which
attracted a standing-room-only crowd.
   ``At an hour like this, there's not much you can say,'' said
Martha Tennison, wife of the Rev. W. Don Tennison, pastor of the
Assembly of God Church. ``You can just be there for them.
   ``Our faith in God will be just as strong or stronger than it
has ever been,'' she said after the service.
   ``Our hope in God is an anchor to the soul,'' said Dan
Mattingly, who led the evening prayers. ``We're in the midst of a
storm and we need an anchor.''
   The bus, with 67 aboard, was packed with teen-agers returning
from Kings Island amusement park north of Cincinnati. The trip was
an annual outing for the youths, who raised money for the event
through car washes and mowing lawns.
   Many friends and family members said their faith would help them
cope with their tragedy.
   ``I don't have any answers for you this morning,'' Mrs. Tennison
said during an informal service Sunday morning. ``I can't figure it
out. I wish I had the answers. I don't.''
   She said the task at hand was to gather strength to share with
the families of the dead.
   ``If there's ever been an hour when they needed us the most,
it's now. We'll be there for them,'' she said.
   One church member said the community also would band together
through its military ties. Radcliff, population 20,000, is adjacent
to Fort Knox, a military installation where many of the families
work.
   ``Our congregation is about 80 percent military families,'' Fred
Rishel said. ``We're close in the military, and we're close in the
church.''
   Condolences poured in by telephone Sunday from churches as far
away as Germany.
   A Roman Catholic priest also helped out at the evangelical
church, celebrating Mass early Sunday to help console gathering
members.
   ``The whole community is in a state of shock,'' said the priest,
the Rev. Leo Craycroft. ``We are praying for the families and doing
whatever we can to support them.''

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal of 90-Year-Old Boston Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to help a
90-year-old Boston man who faces prison for refusing to testify
before a federal grand jury reportedly investigating organized
crime in New England.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Harry
Sagansky, who said imprisonment could kill him.
   Sagansky, twice convicted more than 20 years ago of illegal
bookmaking, was arrested last year in an FBI investigation of the
underworld organization of the late Raymond Patriarca, long-time
reputed New England crime boss.
   Sagansky was held in contempt for refusing to testify before a
grand jury after he was granted immunity from prosecution.
   He has been ordered imprisoned until he breaks his silence.
Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan on Feb. 29 allowed
Sagansky to remain free pending review of his appeal.
   Federal prosecutors said Sagansky would be incarcerated in a
federal prison medical facility in Springfield, Mo., and said he
would be flown there accompanied by a nurse to protect his health.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Sagansky's
arguments that putting him in prison will endanger his health and
could kill him.
   A federal court ``must have the means to enforce its lawful
order of contempt,'' the appeals court said. It added, ``We must
not lose sight of the fact that, although the witness labels it a
`cliche argument,' it is nonethless true that the witness himself
holds the key to his freedom. The government is validly seeking his
testimony, not his confinement.''
   Sagansky was imprisoned for 20 days in January after he refused
to testify, but then was released pending further appeals. He also
has said he has been the target of unlawful electronic surveillance
by the FBI.
   The case is Sagansky vs. U.S., 87-1590.

   Michael Dukakis leads George Bush in a trial
heat between the likely presidential nominees, a Harris poll says.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, the front-runner for the Democratic
nomination, was supported by 50 percent of 2,138 likely voters
interviewed by Harris, while Vice President Bush, who has clinched
the Republican nomination, was favored by 43 percent. Seven percent
were undecided.
   Louis Harris & Associates conducted the poll in two segments,
with telephone interviews April 1-5 and May 5-10, company
spokeswoman Jill Hodge said today. Harris released the poll to
subscribers Sunday.
   Other recent polls have had Dukakis even with Bush or slightly
ahead, but analysts agree that polls conducted so far in advance of
the November election cannot be considered predictive of the
outcome.
   The margin of error for the poll was 3 percentage points.

   Two 16-year-olds helped pull their
friends from a bus that burst into a fireball after it collided
head-on with a pickup truck on an interstate highway, killing 27 in
one of the nation's deadliest bus crashes.
   ``They were just laying down in the back door, stacked up on top
of each other, and no one could get out 'cause they all fell down
on top of each other,'' said Larry Flowers, who escaped from the
bus and helped evacuate it with Jamie Hardesty. ``I grabbed their
arms and pulled.''
   A pickup truck going the wrong way on southbound Interstate 71
late Saturday plowed into the right front side of the bus, which
was filled mostly with teen-agers from the Assembly of God Church
in Radcliff returning home from an amusement park outing near
Cincinnati, police said.
   This morning, five National Transportation Safety Board
investigators set to work. One investigator went to the crash site,
and the probers also were interviewing witnesses and examining the
wreckage from the crash, which was brought to a National Guard
armory here.
   The NTSB also requested to examine blood samples taken from the
driver of the truck, and to study both his and the bus driver's
driving records, said Alan Pollock, an NTSB spokesman.
   The investigators' preliminary findings were expected to be
discussed at a news conference this evening.
   Meanwhile, in another part of the armory building, other experts
continued to examine the badly burned bodies of the victims,
comparing dental records and other clues in an effort to provide
positive identifications.
   Nine of the 40 hurt sustained critical injuries; four people
were seriously injured, including the driver of the pickup truck,
who was alone.
   Survivors said that as flames erupted in the bus' front,
screaming passengers rushed toward the rear emergency door.
   ``Everyone started screaming and hollering,'' said Hardesty, a
high school sophomore. ``Everyone was trying to get off as fast as
they could.''
   A passing truck driver, Patrick Presley of Dallas, and an
unidentified trucker, rushed to the bus and yanked the rear door
open.
   Hardesty was among the first to escape.
   ``I thought maybe if I broke out the windows I could help some
of them get out or at least let some of the smoke out,'' he said.
``I busted windows hoping they could get out, but I don't guess
they could.''
   ``When I jumped off the bus, I saw him (Hardesty) carrying
somebody and laid them down, and ran back up and was trying to get
some more people,'' said 17-year-old Juan Holt.
   ``He ripped off my shirt, and he used it for bandages. ... He
put ice on people. He was like a doctor.''
   Jason Booher, 13, credited Hardesty with ``saving a lot.''
Hardesty pushed burning victims from the bus and Booher said he
then rolled them in grass.
   Holt said Hardesty and Allen Tennison, 15-year-old son of the
church's pastor, directed paramedics to those seriously injured.
   The church held two special services Sunday.
   The bus had been refueled with gasoline just before the
accident, said Carroll County Coroner James Dunn. The fuel tank on
the 1977 Ford school bus was on the right side, and ruptured upon
impact, police said.
   State Medical Examiner Dr. George Nichols met with about 60
family members in Carrollton and told them he did not want them to
view the remains.
   ``The picture ... of their children in that room is not what
they have in their memories or wallets,'' he said.
   Nichols said 19 females and eight males were killed. Preliminary
examinations of 22 bodies indicated the smoke inhalation as the
cause of death, he said. He expected to finish the examinations
today.
   The victims apparently died trying to flee, and the body of the
driver was found near the steering wheel with a fire extinguisher
between his legs, Nichols said.
   A woman's body was found facing the front door, while the other
bodies were headed toward the back of the bus.
   As word of the accident spread, distraught relatives clutching
dental and medical records arrived here Sunday to help identify the
dead. Many came in a bus donated by Fort Knox, a military
installation near Radcliff where most of the church members work,
officials said.
   Early Sunday, the hull of the bus _ with bodies still inside _
was moved to the National Guard armory in Carrollton, 75 miles
northeast of Radcliff and 45 miles northeast of Louisville.
   State Police Trooper Jim Mudd said it was not known how long or
why the pickup was traveling the wrong way.
   Its driver, 34-year-old Larry W. Mahoney, of Worthville, was
listed in serious condition at Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville.
   What is believed to be the worst bus accident in U.S. history
occurred Sept. 17, 1963, when a bus collided with a train near
Salinas, Calif., killing 32 farm workers.

<HEAD>Court Upholds $1.8 Million Judgment Against Insurance Company in
Mississippi Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a $1.8 million
judgment against an insurance company ordered to pay the money to
an injured Mississippi man whose $20,000 claim it wrongfully
rejected.
   But, in one of the most closely watched cases of the year, the
justices declined to decide the constitutionality of such enormous
punitive damage awards in personal injury cases.
   The court, in a ruling based on procedural grounds, said the
issue was not properly presented in the case.
   The justices did decide a lesser issue raised in the dispute,
upholding a Mississippi law that imposed a 15 percent penalty _
$243,000 _ against the insurance company for unsuccesfully
appealing the case to the Mississippi Supreme Court.
   The vote on that issue was 6-1, with Justice Harry A. Blackmun
the lone dissenter. Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony M.
Kennedy did not take part in the case.
   The court left for another day the overriding question of
skyrocketing damage awards, a development that has touched off a
wave of legislative activity.
   Some states, reacting to soaring insurance rates, have imposed
ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal injury
lawsuits.
   ``Any ultimate review of the question that we might undertake
will gain the benefit of a well-developed record and a reasoned
opinion on the merits,'' said Justice Thurgood Marshall for the
court.
   He said settling the issue now would ``short-circuit a number of
less intrusive and possibly more appropriate resolutions.''
   Marshall said those possibilities include further action by the
Mississippi legislature or the courts of that state addressing the
issue.
   The case arose when Lloyd Crenshaw of Pascagoula, Miss., was
repairing a car alternator in his garage in 1979 and part of the
alternator fell on his right foot.
   Less than two weeks later, surgeons amputated his leg below the
knee after gangrene developed.
   Crenshaw, 61 at the time, worked at the White Stores in
Pascagoula. His employer had a group insurance policy with Bankers
Life and Casualty Co.
   A state jury ruled that Bankers Life acted in bad faith in
denying Crenshaw's claim, and awarded him $20,000 in actual damages
and $1.6 million in punitive damages.
   The insurance company said the punitive damage judgment violates
the Constitution. But that issue was not raised or passed upon by
the Mississippi courts.
   Bankers Life also was ordered to pay an additional 15 percent _
$243,000 _ after it appealed unsuccessfully to the Mississippi
Supreme Court.
   Marshall said today that the 15 percent penalty is an
appropriate deterrent to frivolous lawsuits.
   Three other states, Virginia, Kentucky and Alabama, have similar
penalty laws.
   The case is Bankers Life vs. Crenshaw, 85-1765.

   The surgeon general declared today that
nicotine is addictive like heroin and cocaine, a finding that came
as no surprise to researchers but which will provide new ammunition
for anti-smoking forces.
   The significance of the report by C. Everett Koop is not that it
unveils new scientific evidence, but that he organized existing
research into a systematic presentation lumping nicotine with
heroin and cocaine as physiologically addictive substances.
   ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes
and other forms of tobacco are addicting,'' Koop wrote in a
preface. ``An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is
the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.
   ``Moreover, the processes that determine tobacco addiction are
similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin
and cocaine.''
   Although his report places nicotine in essentially the same
medical category as those two illicit drugs, Koop noted at a news
conference that tobacco has a ``favored place'' in the United
States and is not likely to be banned.
   ``I don't think we are every going to get to a point in our
society where we can bring about prohibition of tobacco,'' he said.
``I don't think this would be a practical solution. I think we
learned this during the prohibition on alcohol.''
   He said steps should be taken to ``protect children'' from being
exposed to nicotine, noting that 43 states already have laws,
albeit ``poorly enforced,'' against the sale of cigarettes to
minors.
   ``I think we need a license to sell tobacco just they way we
require one to sell alcohol,'' said Koop.
   Asked later where he would set the age on banning sales to young
people, the surgeon general noted that different states set
different ages for such things as driving and buying alcohol and
said that practice probably would continue with stricter
anti-tobacco laws.
   ``I would set it at about 75,'' added the 71-year-old physician.
   Asked whether his new report might highten antagonism between
smokers and nonsmokers, Koop said, ``That would be hard to predict.
I think it would mean in general more sympathy for the person who
can't quit. That certainly is the position I've taken ever since I
have been in this job. You might get annoyed at people who smoke in
your presense and make your eyes burn and your sinuses clog up and
so forth, but your anger has to be abated by the fact that these
people are addicted to a drug and I think this will make people
more tolerant of the problems a smoker faces when he is trying to
quit.''
   The report says nicotine can be addictive no matter how it
enters the body, noting that so-called smokeless tobacco enters the
blood stream through absorbtion in the mouth and that pipe and
cigar smokers who do not inhale subject themselves to the same kind
of absorbtion.
   The report cites 171 separate studies, most of them conducted
during the past decade, as references.
   In a letter to Congress accompanying the report, Health and
Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said, ``A warning label on
the addicting nature of tobacco use should be rotated with other
health warnings now required on cigarette and smokeless tobacco
packages and advertisements.''
   Bowen said cigarette smoking is ``the chief avoidable cause of
premature death in this country,'' causing more than 300,000 such
deaths each year.
   ``The disease impact of smoking justifies placing the problem of
tobacco use at the top of the public health agenda,'' Bowen wrote.
``The conclusions of this report provide another compelling reason
for strengthening our efforts to reduce tobacco use in our
society.''
   In his opening remarks, Koop also called for an addiction
warning on cigarette labels and advertising and said, ``Treatment
of tobacco addiction should be more widely available and should be
considered at least as favorably by third-party payers as treatment
of alcoholism and illicit drug addiction.''
   Koop handled some other controversial ideas as questions:
   ``With the evidence that tobacco is addicting, is it appropriate
for tobacco products to be sold through vending machines, which are
easily accessible to children?
   ``Is it appropriate for free samples of tobacco products to be
sent through the mail or distributed on public property, where
verification of age is difficult if not impossible? Should the sale
of tobacco be treated less seriously than the sale of alcoholic
beverages, for which a specific license is required (and revoked
for repeated sales to minors)?
   ``In the face of overwhelming evidence that tobacco is
addicting, policy-makers should address these questions without
delay,'' Koop said.
   Reaction was swift and predictable.
   ``This report and the surgeon general's findings should compel
federal and state authorities to treat tobacco as the addictivve
drug that it is,'' said Dr. Alan R. Nelson, chairman of the board
of trustees of the American Medical Association.
   Nelson said federal and state authorities should raise the age
of those allowed to purchase cigarettes to 21, ban the access of
tobacco products through vending machines, label tobacco products
as addictive, ban the advertising of tobacco products and regulate
the development of new nicotine products.
   Although details of the report were not made public until today,
one of the many federal health officials that helped prepare it
disclosed the essential finding _ that nicotine is addictive _ in a
television interview earlier this month.
   A Tobacco Institute spokesman, Walker Merryman, reacted to that
disclosure by Ronald M. Davis, director of the federal Office of
Smoking and Health, by saying it showed ``anti-tobacco zeal has
overtaken common sense and good judgment.''
   In a statement today, the Tobacco Institute said ``Smoking is
truly a personal choice which can be stopped if and when a person
decides to do so. The surgeon general's own Public Health Service
figures indicate that about 40 million Americans are former smokers
and that 95 percent of them quit smoking without help. These
figures, and common sense, contradict any claim that smoking is an
`addiction'.''
   The institute said the report ``trivializes the serious drug
problem faced by society. The claim that cigarette smoking is a
drug addiction similar to cocaine or heroin use, or alcohol abuse,
is unfortunate and unwarranted. The message to the American public
is that using illegal drugs, such as crack or heroin, has the same
risk of addiction as smoking.''
   Koop's last smoking report concluded _ again based on a
compilation of existing studies _ that nonsmokers' health was
endangered by inhaling smoke from other people's cigarettes.
   Issued just over a year ago, that report has reverberated
quickly throughout society, providing impetus for a growing move
toward smoke-free environments in the workplace, restaurants and
public buildings. The latest example: the federal ban on smoking
aboard commercial jetliners for flights of two hours or less that
took effect April 23.

   Police arrested three Middle Eastern men
armed with submachine guns after seven people, including a British
family of four, were killed in terrorist attacks, authorities said
today.
   At least 21 others, including three Americans, were injured in
two bomb blasts at a hotel dining hall and a raid on a nearby
nightclub.
   The young family and two Sudanese, including a Sudan army
brigadier, were cut down by the bomb blasts as they ate dinner
Sunday at the Acropol Hotel, said police Col. Mutasim Osman Karim.
   An unidentified foreign man was killed in an attack with
automatic weapons at the Sudan Club near the Acropol, police said.
They earlier had identified him as a Briton.
   A police statement broadcast over the government's Radio
Omdurman said passers-by helped capture the three suspects, who had
weapons, ammunition and other items ``that provide material
evidence of their involvement in the attacks.''
   The statement said the three carried Lebanese passports and had
entered Sudan in the guise of businessmen. Informed sources said
earlier that the suspects were wearing the traditional flowing
white robes of the Sudanese when caught.
   Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency reported from
Khartoum police had arrested 35 people, including an unspecified
number of Lebanese and Syrians.
   No motive has been advanced for the attacks, which occurred as
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi swore in a new Cabinet.
   ``Limbs of those who were killed ... were scattered on the floor
of the restaurant after the explosion,'' Karim said.
   In London, a private British relief charity, Ockenden Venture,
identifed the British family as Chris Rolfe, 35, his wife Clare,
37, and their children Thomas, 3, and Louise, 1. It said the couple
had been its employees.
   Karim said the dead Sudanese army officer as a brigadier. The
other Sudanese victim was a waiter.
   
   Both targets of Sunday night's attacks, the Acropol Hotel and
the Sudan Club, are a few blocks off Jomhuriya street. Both are
frequented by foreign relief workers and journalists.
   A European man who said he witnessed the Acropol attack said the
two explosions occurred near the dining room, which was filled with
diners. The force of the blasts blew a sheet-metal roof off the
two-story building and smashed a hole in the floor a yard wide.
   ``I'm angry because the ambulances weren't rushed to the scene
immediately,'' said the witness, who insisted on anonymity. ``I
think some of the dead could have been rescued if the ambulances
had come earlier.''
   Tahnassis Pagoulapos, the Acropol's manager, said ambulances
arrived a full hour after the explosions.
   The official Sudan News Agency said a large number of foreigners
and diplomats were in the hotel at the time of the explosions,
including a senior U.S. diplomat whom it did not name. The agency
said American diplomats helped evacuate the wounded.
   Magda Siekret, deputy director of the U.S. Embassy's information
center, said three Americans were wounded slightly.
   The Sudan News Agency said two Canadians and a Dutchman also
were wounded. It did not name them or give nationalities of the
other wounded.
   Waiters at the Sudan Club said they heard an exchange of fire
near the entrance. ``All of us just went under the tables,'' said a
waiter, who did not give his name.
   Karim said evidence was found at the Sudan Club indicating three
Soviet-made hand grenades had exploded there. There was no word on
damage.
   Police and the waiters said automatic pistols and submachine
guns were found on some of the suspects, who were apprehended near
the Sudan Club shortly after the explosions at the Acropol.

   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
appealed again today for fairness from the Democratic Party, saying
``fairness is a reasonable expectation.''
   Jackson has complained in recent weeks that his delegate total
is not proportional to his hard-won share of the popular vote in
primaries to date.
   ``Fairness is a reasonable expectation. Reciprocity is a
reasonable expectation. We expect to treat the party fair because
we expect to be treated fairly by the party,'' he told reporters
here.
   Asked what he would do if he did not win the nomination, Jackson
replied:
   ``We hope to have enough popular vote and delegates (for the
nomination),'' he said. ``And then we'll determine the ticket of
our party and the platform of our party and the priorities of our
party.''
   Jackson made a quick swing through New Jersey Sunday and today
before heading to Oregon for a final day of campaigning in advance
of the state's primary on Tuesday.
   On Sunday, under the massive dome of the Hopewell Baptist
Church, Jackson drew on religious themes of hope and faith as he
vowed to keep up his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   ``We've come too far to turn around now,'' he told the mostly
black crowd. ``In our own lifetime we've moved from the back of the
bus to three steps from the White House.''
   Jackson said he was the only candidate committed to sweeping
economic reforms that would benefit working people.
   ``This is not about black fish and white fish but about big fish
and little fish,'' Jackson said, to applause.
   Jackson called for raising the minimum wage, working to bring
women's wages in line with those of men, earmarking defense funds
to education instead and providing universal health insurance. He
also outlined plans for providing affordable housing and day care.
   He attacked the Reagan administration's foreign and domestic
policies, including Vice President George Bush, the apparent
Republican nominee, in each criticism.
   Jackson faulted the administration for a failed ``courtship''
with Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and for allowing
U.S. companies to move out of the country in order to pay cheaper
wages.
   Jackson appealed for votes in the New Jersey primary, which is
June 7.
   ``No valley is too deep when our minds are made up,'' he said.
``We're winning every day. That's what makes the New Jersey race so
important. It's a matter of pulling your weight in New Jersey.''
   At the state Democratic convention in South Orange, N.J.,
Jackson noted pointedly that he, unlike rival Michael Dukakis, has
garnered few big-name endorsements.
   ``I haven't inherited any voters. I've earned every vote I've
gained,'' he said.
   Dukakis also appeared at the Democratic event, and the two met
briefly.

<HEAD>Court Restores Oregon Surgeon's Antitrust Award Against Fellow
Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a ruling it acknowledged
could make doctors reluctant to serve on ``peer review'' panels,
today restored an Astoria, Ore., surgeon's $2.2 million antitrust
award against fellow doctors in his city.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said a federal appeals court
wrongly wiped out Dr. Timothy A. Patrick's victory.
   Patrick sued partners of The Astoria Clinic in 1981, alleging
that they conspired to revoke his staff privileges at the city's
only hospital because they resented his opening a private practice
in competition against the clinic.
   A federal jury awarded Patrick $1.95 million against the clinic
and three of its physician partners. The presiding judge ordered
the people Patrick sued to pay his lawyers $228,000.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the
ruling.
   The appeals court ruled that because Oregon law required doctors
at Astoria's only hospital, Columbia Memorial, to maintain peer
review of staff physicans, their actions taken against Patrick
represented the kind of governmental action immune from federal
antitrust law.
   Invoking what lawyers call the ``state action'' doctrine, the
appeals court threw out Patrick's victory.
   But writing for the high court, Justice Thurgood Marshall said
the ``state action'' doctrine does not apply in Oregon because no
state official reviews the doctors' peer-review decisions.
   ``Because we conclude that no state actor in Oregon actively
supervises hospital peer-review decisions, we hold that the state
action doctrine does not protect the peer-review activities
challenged in this case,'' Marshall said.
   He said the justices ``are not unmindful of the policy argument
that ... effective peer review is essential to the provision of
quality medical care and that any threat of antitrust liability
will prevent physicians from participating openly and actively in
peer-review proceedings.''
   But Marshall said Congress, not the high court, must take care
of that.
   In the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, Congress
insulated certain medical peer-review activities from antitrust
liability.
   Under the law, action by such medical panels escapes liability
if it was taken ``in the reasonable belief that it was in the
furtherance of quality health care.''
   But the law does not appear to immunize all peer-review actions
from antitrust liability, and it is not retroactive to Patrick's
lawsuit.
   ``If phsyicians believe that the act provides insufficient
immunity to protect the peer-review process fully, they must take
up that matter with Congress,'' Marshall said.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who once served as general counsel to
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disqualified himself from the
case, Patrick vs. Burget, 86-1145.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias today
blasted each other with howitzers, mortars and rockets in the slums
of south Beirut, defying a Syrian order to cease fire.
   Police said the Syrian-backed Amal militia staged a
counterattack, forcing the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, to retreat from one section of the 16-square mile shantytown.
   During the last 10 days of combat, Hezbollah has pushed Amal
from large parts of the slums.
   Police said 14 people were killed and 120 wounded in the
hostilities Sunday and today, raising the overall toll to 225 dead
and 706 injured since fighting for control of the slums broke out
May 6.
   Eighteen Western hostages, including nine Americans, are
believed held in the slums by factions linked to the Hezbollah.
   Police said Syrian commanders had massed several thousand troops
and hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles around the main gateways
into the labyrinthine slums today.
   ``We're ready to go in, but zero hour hasn't been set yet,''
said a Syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airport,
which was proclaimed reopened to normal traffic today for the first
time in 11 days.
   On Sunday, Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig.
Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, ordered Hezbollah and Amal to lay down their
arms.
   ``Our forces will shoot without hesitation any gunman on the
street and in buildings. Your lives will be spared if you comply,''
he said.
   ``It was imperative for Syria to take the decision to rescue the
people from the bloodbath,'' he told a news conference.
   Before the Amal counterattack, police said Hezbollah had seized
control of 90 percent of the slums. Hezbollah only held about
one-third of the 16 square-mile area on May 6. It was not
immediately known if Amal secured any districts in today's
counterattack.
   Radio stations reported that Amal's leader, Justice Minister
Nabih Berri, had decided to withdraw his militiamen.
   ``No gunmen should be allowed to remain in the suburbs and
Beirut, now that a legitimate force is taking charge of security,''
Berri was quoted as saying in a reference to the Syrian army.
   Hezbollah, which has fielded 3,000 fighters, has not responded
to the Syrian plan. But the fundamentalists' spiritual leader,
Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, on Sunday called the Syrian
buildup ``an act of intimidation.''
   He said ``all the suburbs will be destroyed if the Syrians
attempt to enter by force,'' indicating that Hezbollah would resist
the Syrians.
   Kenaan cut off a reporter who asked whether the Syrians would
seek to free the foreign hostages. ``There is a disaster in the
area. People are suffering distress that we will try to end,'' he
said.
   The Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio said, without naming a
source, that the hostages are now held in the basement of the
Iranian Embassy in a seaside neighborhood outside the battle zone.
   ``This report is untrue,'' an embassy spokesman said. He
declined to be named.
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa magazine reported earlier that the
captives were moved during the fighting from an exposed Hezbollah
barracks to the home of Hezbollah spokesman Sheik Ibrahim Amin in
the less vulnerable Haret Hreik neighborhood. The report could not
be verified.
   Police said most of the 250,000 people who lived in the slums,
mostly poor Shiites, have fled since the fighting erupted.

<HEAD>Chinese Peanut Production not Peanuts, While US Is Soypreme</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The soybean has an Asian-sounding name, with
its origins rooted in long-ago China. And the peanut has a real
American punch to its name, raising images of baseball parks and
street vendors.
   But the United States is the leading soybean producer, while
China is a distant third behind Brazil.
   China, meanwhile, is the biggest peanut producer, with India
second and the United States third, according to Agriculture
Department analysts.
   In all, global production of oilseeds in 1987-88 is expected to
be a record 203.7 million metric tons, up 5 percent from last
season, says the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
Projections indicate output may rise further in 1988-89.
   Based upon various USDA reports issued last week, including the
May 10 supply-and-demand projections for 1988 harvests, the United
States will continue to hold a comfortable lead in soybean
production.
   Of the 203.7 million tons of oilseeds produced in the world,
soybeans will comprise 101.1 million tons, or almost half the
global harvest. The U.S. soybean share is more than 51.8 million
tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of soybeans.
   Brazil, the leading soybean competitor for American farmers, is
expected to provide 17.6 million tons. China's harvest was
estimated at about 12.1 million tons, with Argentina next at 9
million tons.
   Globally, cottonseed is the second-rated oilseed at almost 30.7
million tons of production in 1987-88.
   China is the cottonseed leader at 7.1 million tons, followed by
the United States, 5.23 million, and the Soviet Union, 4.49 million.
   Several of the remaining major oilseeds _ peanuts, sunflowerseed
and rapeseed _ are fairly close in production totals, ranging from
19 million to 23 million tons.
   Peanut production in 1987-88 is estimated at 19.3 million tons.
China leads with 6.17 million tons, followed by India at 4.35
million, and the United States a distant third with 1.64 million
tons.
   In listing the remainder of the major oilseeds, country rankings
get a bit blurred because some of the USDA figures are reported
regionally instead of by individual countries.
   For example, the top producer of rapeseed clearly is China, with
production reported at 6.73 million tons. But the second-ranked
producer is the 12-nation trading bloc of the European Economic
Community, or EEC, shown at 5.92 million tons. Canada, with 3.85
million tons, is third. Global rapeseed production was put at 22.9
million tons.
   A similar situation was shown for sunflowerseed. The Soviet
Union is easily the world's leading producer with 6.08 million tons
in 1987-88, while once again the EEC comes in second with 3.73
million. Argentina was third with 2.8 million tons forecast. World
output was reported at 20.3 million tons.
   The United States did not appear at all in the rapeseed
production figures, and was listed at 1.18 million tons of
sunflowerseed in 1987-88.
   Another oil source is flaxseed, with a world output of 2.34
million tons this season. Canada leads with 790,000 tons, followed
by Argentina, 550,000, and India, 400,000. The U.S. production was
reported at 190,000 tons.

   U.S. cotton inventories could show a modest
rise in the 1988-89 marketing year if Agriculture Department
projectons hold up.
   Although the department's first official estimate of 1988 cotton
production won't be ready until August, analysts say the harvest
could be around 14 million bales, down from almost 14.8 million
bales in 1987.
   With a modest decline in exports expected in the marketing year
that will begin on Aug. 1 _ probably dropping to 6 million bales
from 6.6 million this season _ and a drop in demand by domestic
textile mills, total U.S. cotton use is expected to decline by
about 1 million bales in 1988-89.
   Thus, despite the projected smaller harvest, the U.S. cotton
inventory by Aug. 1, 1989, could grow to 6.2 million bales from 5.5
million forecast as the carryover this Aug. 1.
   Globally, the same thing is happening. Department projections
put the world's cotton production in 1988-89 at 83.5 million bales
and total consumption at 82 million bales.

   Hong Kong's brandy imports jumped 47 percent
last year and lower import duties which became effective in March
are expected to add further momentum, according to an Agriculture
Department trade report.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said the rise in
Hong Kong's brandy imports could lead to further sales
opportunities for U.S. suppliers.
   France is the main supplier, providing 95 percent of last year's
imports of 8.43 million liters, the agency said in Foreign
Agriculture magazine. China was second, with 206,220 liters,
followed by South Africa, 53,591; Greece 52,957; and the United
States, 26,504.
   A liter is slightly more than a quart.
   The report said the Hong Kong import duty was reduced to $55 in
Hong Kong currency per liter from $67 prior to March 2, 1988.
Officials said one U.S. dollar was equal to 7.8 Hong Kong dollars.

<HEAD>Court Rules Seven Pennsylvania Mechanics Entitled to Two Years
Back Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that seven
mechanics at a Wolmelsdorf, Pa., factory are entitled to two years,
not three, back overtime pay.
   The court's 6-3 decision resolves conflicting lower court
interpretations of a provision of the federal Fair Labor Standards
Act.
   The law currently sets for covered employees the minimum wage of
$3.35. It also generally requires employers to pay one and one-half
times an employee's regular rate for overtime hours _ those in
excess of 40 per week.
   The Labor Department sued the Richland Shoe Co. in 1984,
contending that it had been violating the federal labor law by not
paying overtime until a mechanic had worked at least 48 hours in
any week.
   The seven mechanics primarily were responsible for repairs and
maintenance of equipment at Richland's plant, which makes footwear
and other leather products.
   Under the federal law, a lawsuit seeking unpaid overtime
compensation is subject to a two-year statute of limitations. But a
three-year deadline is authorized for a ``willful'' violation of
the overtime-payment requirements.
   In other words, workers wrongly deprived of overtime pay may be
able to collect two years or three years worth of back overtime
payments after suing their employer.
   U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett ruled that Richland's
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act had been willful. He said
that determining willfulness ``requires nothing more than that the
employer has an awareness of the possible application'' of the
federal law.
   The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
previously had announced such a standard for determining
willfulness under the labor law.
   But the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed that portion of Huyett's ruling that awarded the mechanics
three years of back overtime pay.
   The 3rd Circuit court said the Richland's violation of the law
could not be ruled willful unless it was shown that Richland knew
it was doing so or displayed a reckless disregard for whether it
was violating the law.
   That ruling seemingly meant the mechanics were entitled to two,
not three, years worth of back overtime pay.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice John Paul Stevens said
the 3rd Circuit court's interpretation of willful is the correct
one.
   ``The standard ... that the employer either knew or showed
reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was
prohibited by the statute is surely a fair reading of the plain
language of the act,'' Stevens said.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan and Harry A.
Blackmun dissented. They said the 5th Circuit court's
interpretation should be adopted.
   The case is McLaughlin vs. Richland Shoe Co., 86-1520.

<HEAD>Students Clash With Police After Dissident's Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students hurled firebombs
and rocks at riot police in Seoul on Monday after a dissident
student committed suicide to demand release of political prisoners
and reunification of North and South Korea.
   Violent clashes were also reported in at least three provincial
cities as students observed the ``democratic struggle week,''
marking the May 18, 1980 anniversary of an anti-government uprising
in the southern city of Kwangju. Nearly 200 people died in the
uprising.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' students in Seoul
shouted as they clashed with police.
   Vicious fighting went on for several hours at Korea and
Sungkyunkwan universities in Seoul. Police fired tear gas to block
1,200 students from marching into the streets to protest the death
of Cho Sung-man.
   Cho, a 24-year-old student at the state-run Seoul National
University, stabbed himself in the stomach and jumped from a
four-story building in Seoul on Sunday.
   Ritual suicide is sometimes used by dissidents to dramatize
their protests and press their demands.
   Cho left a note demanding the release of all political prisoners
and calling for reunification of South Korea and North Korea,
divided since 1945.
   ``As a human being born in this barren land, the Korean
peninsula, I offer this letter ernestly desiring to see the
uday. Burial
site was not decided, they said.
   Cho's death came three days before the eighth anniversary of the
May 18, 1980 anti-government uprising in Kwangju, the worst civil
uprising in modern South Korean history. The anniversary is usually
marked by anti-government protests.
   Police fired tear gas to break up protests by 1,800 students in
Chochiwon, Chonju and Kwangju, marking the Kwangju anniversary.
There were no arrests or injuries reported.
   In Chochiwon, 50 miles south of Seoul, 50 students occupied a
rail crossing and delayed three passenger trains for 15 minutes.
Police fired tear gas to disperse them.
   In the southern opposition stronghold of Chonju, 200 students
battled police for several hours. Police also used tear gas to end
the protest.
   Fighting was also reported in Kwangju, where 1,800 students from
three universities in and near the city clashed with police,
hurling rocks and firebombs.
   Opposition leaders charged that Cho's death was blamed on the
government's ``insincerity'' in carrying out democratic reforms,
releasing all politiical prisoners.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam, who visited the morgue where
Cho's body was being held, said the death represented ``the voice
of the entire Korean people.''

   South Korean authorities were deciding
whether to permit 30 Vietnamese ``boat people'' rescued last week
to come ashore, maritime police said Monday.
   The Vietnamese, including 19 adults and 11 children, were found
Friday on a 15-ton boat adrift on the high seas off the southern
island of Mara, police said.
   Local newspapers reported that they had escaped from Vietnam in
March.
   While waiting for a government permit to dock, the boat was
moored in the waters off the nearby island of Cheju, they said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's largest insurance company has cut
war-risk rates for general cargoes passing through a large area of
the southwest Persian Gulf, a Lloyd's of London spokesman said
Monday.
   The rate reduction applies to non-oil cargoes traveling in the
gulf off much of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, most of the United
Arab Emirates and the southern tip of Oman, said the spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The new rates took effect last
Thursday.
   The cut reduces insurance rates for non-oil cargoes to 0.25
percent of the value of the cargo, down from 0.30 percent. The
affected area does not include the waters off Iran.
   The rate for oil cargoes for that sector of the Persian Gulf
remains unchanged at 0.375 percent, the spokesman said.

   A fire broke out today aboard one of five
tankers damaged in an Iraqi air raid on Iran's Larak Island oil
terminal.
   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington, meanwhile, said the wreckage
of a U.S. helicopter had been found along with the bodies of its
two crewmen.
   The aircraft was reported missing in the Persian Gulf after a
battle last month in which U.S. forces sank or disabled six Iranian
ships.
   Officials were still trying to determine today how many people
died in the Iraqi raid Saturday on the Larak terminal in the Strait
of Hormuz at the southern end of the gulf.
   The attack set fire to the Spanish supertanker Barcelona, the
Cypriot-flag tanker Argosy, the Liberian-flag supertanker Seawise
Giant, British tanker Burmah Endeavour, and the Iranian tanker
Khark.
   The Seawise Giant and the Argosy were badly damaged in fires
that raged out of control for many hours. The Burmah Endeavour and
the Khark sustained minor damage, officials reported.
   The Barcelona was beached to prevent it sinking. Although the
fire aboard it appeared to have been extinguished Sunday, it
reignited and Iranian-led salvage teams were fighting the flames
today, according to gulf shipping executives who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the
bodies of 16 of the Seawise Giant's crew have been recovered, one
seaman was killed aboard the Barcelona and two crewmen were killed
aboard the Argosy. It said three crewmen remained missing from the
Barcelona.
   But gulf-based shipping executives said only one crewman aboard
the Seawise Giant was killed, with three missing, and that one man
aboard the Barcelona was killed, with three other crewmen missing.
   The Iraqi raid, the third on Larak in seven months, was aimed at
throttling Iran's economic lifeline, its oil exports, to force
Tehran to the negotiating table and end its 7{-year-old war with
Iraq.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, on Sunday quoted a senior
Iranian air force officer as saying the U.S. Navy aided the Iraqi
warplanes attacking Larak by jamming Iranian radar and radio
communications for nine minutes.
   U.S. officials said U.S. warships patrolling the gulf were not
involved with the Larak raid.
   The bodies of the two U.S. Marine Corps pilots and the wreckage
of their helicopter were located in the southern Persian Gulf on
Sunday, the Pentagon said, nearly a month after they disappeared
during U.S.-Iranian clashes.
   In Washington, Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman,
said the bodies of Capt. Kenneth Hill, 33, of Thomasville, N.C.,
and Capt. Stephen Leslie, 30, of New Bern, N.C. were recovered from
the Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Charles Manicer, a spokesman for the U.S.
Central Command, said the remains of the gunship will be destroyed
in place rather than pulled out of the water. He said he did not
know when the wreckage would be blown up.
   Pentagon officials said the initial report from Navy divers in
the gulf indicated they had yet to spot any ``battle damage'' on
the wreckage of the helicopter that would prove it crashed after
being hit by gunfire or a missile.
   ``So far, there is no discernible evidence of battle damage,''
said one official, who insisted on anonymity. ``But they're still
going over it as best they can.''
   Leslie and Hill were the only American casualties in the
fighting April 18, when U.S. naval forces destroyed two Iranian oil
platforms and sank or disabled six naval craft. Iran said at the
time that its forces shot down the helicopter.
   Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed during the clash.
   The fighting began after U.S. forces earlier that day destroyed
two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for a mine explosion in
the gulf four days before that damaged the USS Samuel Roberts and
wounded 10 sailors.
   The Navy had officially called off the search for the helicopter
and declared the men killed in action. The wreckage was located by
a chartered salvage tugboat in the general area where the clashes
occurred, salvage experts said.

   The grandson of one president and the daughter
of another were named Monday to a new advisory committee on
presidential libraries established by the archivist of the United
States, Dr. Don Wilson.
   The advisory committee will be a nine-member group whose job it
will be to form a closer alliance with the National Archives on
joint public programs and exhibitions. It also will work toward
increasing private support for the presidential library system,
said John Fawcett, head of presidential libraries.
   David Eisenhower, who recently wrote ``Eisenhower at War'' about
his grandfather, Dwight D. Eisenhower, is one member. Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, daughter of John F. Kennedy is another.
   They and the others will serve three-year terms. The National
Archives operates and maintains eight libraries housing the papers
of presidents Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman,
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
   Other members of the committee are Martin J. Allen Jr., chairman
of the Gerald R. Ford Foundation; George M. Elsey, president
emerityus of the American Red Cross; William J. vanden Heuvel,
president of the Franklin and Eleanor Institute; Tom Johnson,
publisher and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Times;
Robert J. Lipshutz, counsel to Carter; Jeremiah Milbank, president
of the J.M. Foundation; and Frederick J. Ryan Jr., assistant to
President Reagan.

<HEAD>Library of Congress Process May Help Preserve Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A book preservation technique developed by the
Library of Congress shows promise, but alternatives should be
considered also, according to a study by the federal Office of
Technology Assessment.
   Acids in the types of paper used to print books over the last
century or so threaten to destroy the volumes, some in as little as
50 years, according to the study made public last week.
   Chemists working for the Library developed a system using
diethylzinc vapors to remove this acid from books, the study said.
This has worked successfully.
   However, diethylzinc is a dangerous chemical which bursts into
flame on contact with air _ the pilot plant where it was made was
destroyed by fire _ and it would have to be used in a specially
enclosed environment filled with nitrogen gas, OTA said in its
study prepared for Congress.
   On the plus side, DEZ vapors permeate closed books, so it can be
used to process large numbers of books stacked together.
   But, the study adds, since the development of the DEZ process
the Library has done very little to look into alternatives,
although two other book deacidification systems also are under
development. Those alternatives may merit consideration, the report
said.
   OTA, which is an analytical agency serving Congress, said the
acid in modern book paper causes brittleness and eventual crumbling
of the paper. Already, the agency says, 25 percent of the Library's
14 million books are too brittle for regular use.
   Books can be copied onto magnetic tape, microfilm or optical
discs, but those are more costly and more difficult to use than
paper volumes, the study said.
   While chemical treatments can stop books from becoming more
brittle, they do not repair damage that already has occurred, and
the Library is working on a process for strengthening already
damaged paper.
   The eventual solution, the report added, would be use of
acid-free paper in book printing. That is being done for between 15
percent and 25 percent of books published currently.

<HEAD>Peace In Afghanistan Will Require Massive Reconstruction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If peace ever returns to the mountains
and deserts of Afghanistan, the war-ravaged country will require
one of the most massive reconstruction efforts since World War II.
   The first stage will be the relocation of about 3 million Afghan
refugees from Pakistan and 2 million from Iran. Western observers
believe that 4 million more Afghans are refugees inside their own
country.
   Anthony Land, head of the Peshawar, Pakistan, office of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, said the return will be the largest
human migration in the organization's history.
   Inside Afghanistan, 10 years of civil war between the communist
government and Moslem insurgents, the last 8{ years with Soviet
military involvement, have left much of the country in ruins.
   Pakistanis, Western diplomats, guerrillas and refugees seem to
agree that even if the fighting stops in Afghanistan, the country
will never be the same.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, chairman of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance based in Pakistan, estimated that 60 percent of the houses
in Afghanistan have been destroyed, along with an equal percentage
of arable land.
   ``The whole country is in ruins,'' said the guerrilla leader.
``Canals and irrigation systems are badly damaged or destroyed.''
   Hekmatyar said the Afghans' ability to restore the irrigation
systems will be crucial to avoid mass starvation once the refugees
return.
   U.N. agencies and several countries have started making plans
for Afghanistan's reconstruction, but they say it is too early
gauge the project's exact size or expense.
   One of the first and most dangerous tasks will be clearing mines
planted or scattered across the countryside by Soviet-Afghan
aircraft.
   U.S. diplomats estimate there may be 3 million of them. The
guerrillas say the number is closer to 5.5 million.
   Then comes what officials predict will be a massive infusion of
emergency food and shelter, medical supplies, seeds and farm
implements.
   Some officials believe that fields left fallow under years of
blazing sun will be too hard to be worked by the Afghans'
traditional wooden plows.
   Few officials care to venture what all this will cost, but the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jean-Pierre Hocke, recently
mentioned a figure of $300 million. Western diplomats in Islamabad
have guessed up to $1.5 billion dollars.
   When the refugees return is anybody's guess, but several
interviewed in the camps of Pakistan's northwest frontier province
said they won't venture back until all Soviets are gone and the
Marxist Kabul government has fallen.
   ``I will go first and see what is left of my home and my farm,''
said Isayal Ghairad, 34, who lives with his wife, two daughters and
son in the sun-baked Munda No. 6 camp, a half-hour's drive from
Peshawar.
   He said he will not send for his family until he is certain he
can feed and house them.
   U.N. and Pakistani officials agree they won't see the refugee
exodus begin until after next spring's thaw.
   A squabble has already broken out over which government the
reconstruction aid should be channeled through: the existing Kabul
regime, Islamabad, or the guerrillas, who are creating a government
of their own.
   ``Looking at Afghanistan, we see no efforts of any kind from the
other side for preparations to receive refugees,'' said a Pakistan
Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on the usual condition that he
not be named.
   Kabul's own Foreign Ministry spokesman responded with his own
broadside broadcast by official Radio Kabul.
   ``These groundless allegations, which are being made in order to
mislead public opinion, are far from the truth and are counted as
another design for creating obstacles in the way of the return of
the refugees ... ,''the radio quoted him as saying.
   He said the measures taken were ``political, social and
economic,'' but he gave no details.

<TEXT>
   PTL expected to file a revised
reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court this afternoon that
essentially puts the $200 million, 2,200-acre evangelical empire on
the auction block, officials said today.
   PTL wants to sell Heritage USA in Fort Mill, or at least enough
of it to pay off its debts, and then lease the property required to
carry on its church and network television ministries, according to
a draft of the plan.
   Several proposed buyers already have surfaced, including George
Shinn, a sports entrepreneur from Charlotte, N.C.
   Judge Rufus Reynolds ordered PTL last month to devise an orderly
plan of liquidation of its assets to pay its debts. The ministry
had failed to raise enough money to meet its operating expenses and
pay the first installment of its debt as specified under the
original reorganization plan filed in December.
   Under the revised plan, Reynolds would appoint a board of three
businessmen, possibly headed by PTL Vice President M.C. ``Red''
Benton, to preside over PTL as a self-liquidating trust, said David
West, PTL director of public relations.
   PTL's assets, including a hotel and convention center, a water
park, a residential development and about 1,700 acres of
undeveloped land a few miles south of Charlotte, are worth an
estimated $160 million to $200 million. The organization's debts
are estimated to range between $75 million and $130 million.
   Whatever money or property remained after debts were paid would
go back to the non-profit arm of the ministry, Heritage Ministries,
which would operate the church and television network, the
spokesman said.
   The Charlotte Observer reported Sunday that several groups
apparently are planning to compete with Shinn in bidding on
Heritage USA. The newspaper reported that at least one group of
creditors, dubious about Shinn's willingness to provide up-front
cash in his bid to buy PTL, is seeking a buyer more to its liking.
   Another offer is expected from a new Salt Lake City corporation,
Tango Trading Co. The company, whose principals include former PTL
Vice President Dale Hill, has announced that it will submit a bid
to buy Heritage USA.
   PTL has been in financial straits since founders Jim and Tammy
Bakker left the ministry last year amid a sex-and-money scandal.

<HEAD>Court Says Prisoners Entitled to Inspect Pre-Sentence Reports in
California Cases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal prisoners are entitled to inspect
substantial portions of their pre-sentence investigative reports
prepared by the government, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The 5-3 ruling in two cases from California was labeled ``a
bombshell'' by dissenters who said it may trigger a flood of new
requests for government reports under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA).
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion,
denying sweeping authority sought by the Reagan administration to
withhold pre-sentence reports from prisoners.
   Rehnquist said the government's privilege against disclosing
some confidential information does not apply with the same force
when the request for files is made by the subject of the report
rather than someone else.
   Federal laws ``speak so strongly against the existence of a
privilege on the part of the government when the request is from
the subject of the report that we think it accsed from that which may be
withheld will be
time-consuming and expensive.
   Officials also argued that giving the information to inmates
will have a chilling effect on individuals questioned by
investigators who fear their identities will be dislcosed.
   The case is U.S. vs. Julian, 86-1357.

<TEXT>
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, having won
Republicans' attention but few delegates, abandoned his
presidential bid today and said he hoped George Bush would win this
year and again in 1992. Jesse Jackson, still in the Democratic race
though trailing badly, renewed his call for fairness in choosing
delegates.
   Meanwhile, a new poll showed Democrat Michael Dukakis ahead of
Republican Bush in a trial heat between the likely nominees. Nearly
six months before the general election, according to a Harris poll,
Dukakis was favored by 50 percent of likely voters who were
surveyed, Bush was supported by 43 percent and 7 percent were
undecided.
   The survey of 2,138 people had a 3 percentage-point margin of
potential sampling error.
   Robertson, who had not been a major GOP contender for two
months, ended his campaigning officially in a brief meeting with
reporters in front of his home on the grounds of CBN University in
Virginia Beach, Va.
   He had dropped his operating control of the Christian
Broadcasting Network to run for president and said today he would
``resume the leadership of CBN tomorrow.''
   ``Today I suspend my candidacy for the Republican nomination in
1988 but I do not now nor will I ever suspend my advocacy of
conservative and moral principles,'' he said. ``George Bush has won
the nomination. I applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse
his candidacy.''
   He said he had filed incorporation papers for Americans for the
Republic, a group to be used as ``a rallying point for future
political action.'' But he said of his own possible candidacy in
1992, ``That remains a moot question until the 1988 election. I
hope Mr. Bush is elected and then re-elected again in 1992.''
   Jackson, at a breakfast appearance today in Newark, N.J., called
again for party officials and other ``super delegates'' to support
him in greater numbers, taking into account his support in
primaries this year and also his past efforts helping other
Democratic candidates and bringing in new voters.
   ``We hope to have enough popular vote and delegates'' to win the
nomination, he said. But win or lose, he added, ``fairness is a
reasonable expectation. Reciprocity is a reasonable expectation. We
expect to treat the party fair because we expect to be treated
fairly by the party.''
   Jackson and Dukakis will face off Tuesday in the Oregon primary,
with 45 delegates at stake.
   An upbeat Dukakis, addressing Democrats in New Jersey on Sunday,
declared: ``I smell victory in the air.'' But Jackson, turning a
tale of pride and perseverance into a campaign parable, urged
college students in Virginia, ``Keep hope alive.''
   Following what has become a pattern in recent contests, Jackson
was engaging in primary-eve campaigning today, while Dukakis was
home in Massachusetts devoting the day to gubernatorial business.
   Up until today, Robertson was the sole Republican remaining in
the race against Bush. Pete du Pont, Alexander Haig, Jack Kemp and
Bob Dole all fell by the wayside as Bush rolled up an
insurmountable lead.
   The vice president clinched the delegates needed to nominate
last month, in the Pennsylvania primary, and got President Reagan's
formal endorsement last week.
   Robertson, who has 46 delegates to Bush's 1,344, finally faced
facts last week. He told reporters then he was backing Bush and
would make his own exit official today. He was expected to turn his
delegates over to Bush at the Republican National Convention this
summer.
   Robertson had not been considered a serious contender since
Super Tuesday, March 8, when his bid to make a strong Southern
showing fizzled abysmally.
   The former television evangelist had come out swinging in the
first real campaign contest. In Iowa's much-watched caucuses on
Feb. 8, he stunned the Bush forces with a second-place finish _
behind Dole, but ahead of the vice president.
   Robertson soldiered on even after it became obvious that the
nomination was out of his reach. He encouraged his backers to seek
state party office and promised to use his clout to shape the
Republican platform.
   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _
running for president,'' he told a Denver congregation last month.
   ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundation
for a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... but
I am not going to quit. ... That is His plan for me and for this
nation,'' he said.
   Bush spent most of Sunday rafting on Oregon's Rogue River. He
did a little fishing too, but said he didn't catch anything.
   The vice president was starting off the day today in Washington
state, where Robertson won a straw poll on Super Tuesday. Bush
attended a Seattle fund-raiser on Sunday night.
   Jackson and Dukakis crossed paths on the campaign trail Sunday,
when both made appearances at New Jersey's state Democratic
convention. The two held a brief meeting, which Dukakis described
as ``warm, pleasant, respectful.''
   Dukakis predicted a Democratic win in the fall, and although he
didn't directly say so, his talk of beating Bush made it clear he
does not view Jackson as much of an obstacle to the nomination. By
the latest Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis has 1,610 to
Jackson's 956.
   Jackson, at a rally in Newark on Sunday, said, ``No valley is
too deep when our minds are made up. We've come too far to turn
around now.''
   The New Jersey and California primaries, along with same-day
contests in Montana and New Mexico, close the Democratic primary
season.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that Americans
have no right of privacy to their garbage once it's put out for
collection.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices reinstated drug-dealing charges
against two California residents. Police discovered evidence of
narcotics in their garbage.
   ``The police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes
from vidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by
any member of the public,'' said Justice Byron R. White for the
court.
   ``It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at
the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals,
children, scavengers, snoops and other members of the public,''
White said.
   The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution generally requires
police to obtain search warrants from a judge before conducting
searches.
   But White said the constitutional protection does not apply to
discarded trash because people have no ``expectation of privacy''
for their garbage.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said,
``Scrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted
notions of civilized behavior. I suspect, therefore, that members
of our society will be shocked to learn that the court, the
ultimate guarantor of liberty, deems unreasonable our expectation
that the aspects of our private lives that are concealed safely in
a trash bag will not become public.''
   He was joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   Joining White were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices John Paul Stevens, Harry A. Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Antonin Scalia.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the newest member of the court, did
not take part in deciding the case.
   Today's ruling overturned decisions by California courts that
said police officers must obtain warrants before searching
discarded garbage.
   Police sifted through garbage collected from outside the home of
Billy Greenwood in Laguna Beach, Calif., on April 6 and May 4, 1984.
   They found drug paraphernalia and drug residue and then obtained
a warrant to search Greenwood's house.
   There they seized marijuana, hashish and cocaine and charged
Greenwood and Dyanne Van Houten, who was also present, with
narcotics possession.
   State courts threw out the charges after ruling that police
violated the rights of Greenwood and Ms. Van Houten.
   The state courts relied in part on a 1971 California Supreme
Court decision that said residents of the state have an expectation
of privacy in their garbage.
   The effect of that ruling was overturned by Proposition 8, a
1982 initiative law known as ``The Victims' Bill of Rights'' in
which California voters approved the use of police evidence unless
it was obtained in violation of federal restrictions.
   The Supreme Court today said the initiative law does not violate
the U.S. Constitution.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Let stand a ruling that pregnant prison inmates have the right
to free abortions if they cannot afford them.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by
prison officials in Monmouth County, N.J., that no such right
exists if an abortion is unnecessary to preserve an inmate's life
or health.
   _ Ruled that federal prisoners are entitled to inspect
substantial portions of their pre-sentence investigative reports
prepared by the government.
   The 5-3 ruling in two cases from California was labeled ``a
bombshell'' by dissenters who said it may trigger a flood of new
requests for government reports under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   _ Upheld a $1.8 million judgment against an insurance company
ordered to pay the money to an injured Mississippi man whose
$20,000 claim it wrongfully rejected.
   But in one of the most closely watched cases of the year, the
justices declined to decide the constitutionality of such enormous
punitive damage awards in personal injury cases.
   The court, in a ruling based on procedural grounds, said the
issue was not properly presented in the case.
   _ Restored an Astoria, Ore., surgeon's $2.2 million antitrust
award against fellow doctors in his city.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said a federal appeals court
wrongly wiped out Dr. Timothy A. Patrick's victory.
   _ Agreed, in an important case for state treasuries, whether New
Jersey unfairly is forcing 13 major oil companies to pay millions
of dollars in taxes.
   The court said it will review a ruling that allows New Jersey
officials to deny state tax deductions for what the companies pay
in federal windfall profits taxes.
   _ Let stand the espionage conviction of a U.S. spy agency
employee who sold surveillance secrets to Soviet agents.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that Ronald
W. Pelton was denied a fair trial when convicted of selling
classified information about his agency's electronic eavesdropping
programs.
   _ Let stand rulings that denied the Church of Scientology of
California federal tax-exempt status for three years.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that, among
other things, stripping the church of its tax exemption for the
years 1970-72, ``threatens the rights of all churches to
proselytize through the sale of religious literature.''
   The garbage case is California vs. Greenwood, 86-684.

<HEAD>Court Says FCC Has Exclusive Authority to Regulate Cable Signals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
exclusive authority to regulate the technical quality of cable
television signals, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   The court rejected arguments that state and local officials
should be allowed to impose more stringent requirements for cable
TV.
   ``The commission acted within the statutory authority conferred
by Congress when it preempted state and local technical standards
governing the quality of cable television signals,'' said Justice
Byron R. White for the court.
   The FCC has divided cable services into four categories. The
first consists of cable channels that deliver signals of television
stations that are normally broadcast through the air.
   The other classes include cable channels such as Cable News
Network and ESPN; pay channels such as Home Box Office; and
channels with two-way capability that allow subscribers to return
information to the channel control point.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the FCC
has exclusive control over the signal quality of the first class of
cable channels. The appeals court also ordered the FCC to develop
standards for assuring the quality of the signals in the latter
three categories.
   The first part of the appeals court ruling was appealed to the
Supreme Court by the National League of Cities, New York City
officials and other communities.
   They said state, county and city governments should be allowed
to impose signal quality standards for cable channels that carry
television broadcast stations.
   The Supreme Court ruled today that a 1984 federal law does not
bar the FCC from preempting such authority from state and local
governments.
   The justices said the statute endorses a dual system of cable TV
regulation, giving local officials power to award franchises but
leaving control over technical quality of cable signals with the
FCC.
   Cable systems operate in more than 18,500 communities.
   The FCC said giving local control over technical matters could
impede the growth of cable TV by imposing overly burdensome
requirements and would subject cable operators to a patchwork of
different rules.
   The challenge to the FCC's power by New York City and the
National League of Cities was supported by officials from Miami;
Wheaton, Ill.; Dallas; Scottsdale, Ariz.; St. Louis; Montgomery
County, Md.; and Sacramento, Calif.
   The case is New York City vs. FCC, 87-339.

   Princess Diana is a spunky, bewitchingly natural
young woman with a magnetic charge of glamour that has dragged the
sleepy British monarchy into the age of mass media, according to a
published report.
   And the future queen likes to wear glitzy costume jewelry as
much as the real thing, according to a special issue of People
magazine, released for previews Sunday. The issue is titled ``All
About Diana: The Private World of a Princess.''
   People reports that Princess Di, who turns 27 on July 1, enjoys
a royal family fortune of $680 million. With this wealth comes a
personal collection of jewelry estimated at about $1.5 million and
use of cars that include a Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Bentley. She and
Prince Charles have an annual income of about $3 million and four
royal homes.
   The one woman Diana trusts most, the magazine reports, is her
mother, Frances Shand Kydd, 52.
   People reports that Diana enjoys greeting her sons at the palace
when they arrive home from school and reading them bedtime stories.
   While Prince Charles often spends the evening working in his
study, Diana watches her favorite television soap operas.

   Frank Zamboni, the man who made his name a
household word in hockey country, fittingly received his first
honorary degree from Clarkson University, an NCAA Division I hockey
power in upstate New York.
   Zamboni, 87, inventor of the ice resurfacing machine that bears
his name, was awarded an honorary doctor of engineering degree at
the university's commencement exercises Sunday.
   ``He's very important to us here in the North Country,'' said
Clark Bailey, assistant to acting Clarkson president R. Thomas
Williamson.
   Bailey nominated Zamboni, a man with a ninth grade education,
for the doctorate.
   ``I felt that this guy epitomized the work ethic,'' said Bailey.
   Zamboni, a Utah native, invented the machine in 1949 while
operating a California ice skating rink. The machine greatly
reduced the time needed to resurface the ice.

   Estelle Getty, one of television's
``Golden Girls,'' says her cause is the aging of America.
   Because of death, illness or divorce, many women suddenly find
they ``have to face the world alone. The world is not Noah's Ark,
and people can get by without walking two by two,'' Ms. Getty said.
   She also said she doesn't like to get specific about either her
age or her height.
   ``Don't ask me how tall I am. That's one question I don't
answer,'' the diminutive co-star of the ``Golden Girls'' situation
comedy told an audience of 300 people Sunday at a women's health
day speech at McLeod Regional Medical Center.
   ``We're all the same age,'' said Ms. Getty, who's a little under
5 feet tall and a little over 60.
   She says the living arrangement on her television show, in which
older women share a home, is ``independence through
interdependence.'' Her housemates have private bedrooms and
bathrooms but share in a household community.
   Ms. Getty is planning to publish this fall a book _ titled ``If
I Knew Then What I Know Now, So What'' _ on her observations and
philosophy from 40 years of marriage and two sons.
   ``Women marry men thinking they're going to change them, and
they never do,'' she said. ``Men marry women hoping they will never
change, but they invariably do.''

   The Dalai Lama says he's content with his simple
and meditative life, but he recognizes the historic importance of
greed, drive and ambition.
   ``To a certain extent, advancement and human progress come from
being greedy ... With too much contentment, nothing gets done,''
the Dalai Lama says in an interview in the June issue of Life
magazine.
   The leader of the world's Tibetan Buddhists, who has lived in
exile in India since a rebellion against the Chinese in 1959, says
he doesn't regret not being able to exercise normal human passions.
   ``Certain people think that without love, sex, anger, they would
be lifeless,'' he said. ``To me such things make life colorful, but
also turbulent. They make life go up and down. Without extreme
feelings, life is in one way colorless, but it is very steady.''
   Asked about the role of religious leaders such as Jesse Jackson
and Pat Robertson in politics, the Dalai Lama said ``politicians
should have more spiritual experience.''
   ``That will help them to conduct politics with more moral
principle,'' he said, adding: ``The reality of a big country like
the United States is that there are many religions, many cultures.
America might not be suited to a leader from one religion.''

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush today labeled as ``old news'' a
Newsweek magazine report that his national security adviser was the
Washington contact for a Contra arms-supply operation bankrolled
with drug money.
   ``That is the oldest, tiredest reporting,'' Bush said while
touring a research center here. ``That is old news. I'd hate to
think it is politically motivated material. You get sick and tired
of saying `I've told the truth' ... You get bombarded by these
insinuations and tired stories.''
   The magazine reported Sunday that arms dealer Richard J.
Brenneke had said in a sworn deposition to a Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee that Donald Gregg was the Washington contact
for the enterprise, called Arms Supermarket.
   Bush campaign spokesman Pete Teeley said Sunday he believed the
allegation had been raised before, and that Gregg had said he had
not spoken with Brenneke. ``Gregg has denied that,'' Teeley said.
   Bush said today of Teeley's response, ``I think Pete Teeley put
it in great perspective yesterday. It's just pure unadulterated _
I've got to watch my language.''
   Bush also implied that Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the
subcommittee that Brenneke testified before, leaked the information
to Newsweek.
   ``If Sen. Kerry and that committee of his have any allegations
to make against anybody who works for me or against me, I would
think they would have the courtesy instead of going with these
nameless stories to stand up and say what they are,'' he said.
   Bush's office told the magazine that Brenneke's story was ``just
rumors and the same old regurgitated stories we thought we'd put to
rest long ago.''
   Newsweek quoted unidentifed Senate staffers as saying they had
confirmed part of Brenneke's story from an agent with Israel's
Mossad secret service and from former Panamanian consul Jose
Blandon but are still assessing Brenneke's credibility.
   Arms Supermarket supplied the Nicaraguan rebels during the
congressional aid cutbacks of 1984-86, before the Iran-Contra
operation set up by National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver
North, the magazine said.
   It involved CIA arms merchants, Mossad agents, the intelligence
arm of the Honduran military and members of a Colombian drug
cartel, according to Newsweek.
   Brenneke, an Oregon businessman with connections in the Soviet
bloc, has done work for both Mossad and the CIA, the magazine said.
   Newsweek, quoting unidentified government sources, public
records about the Iran-Contra affair and the subcommittee's
investigation, reported that Brenneke also said the Medellin
cocaine cartel put up financing for the operation, used its planes
to fly arms to the Contras and then used the same planes to fly
some of its drug shipments from Colombia to the United States.
   Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega granted transit
privileges for the flights and took a cut of the profits, Blandon
testified at the committee hearings, according to Newsweek.
   The magazine did not say how much in arms reached the Contras.
It said the Arms Supermarket had been phased out by August 1986,
with $20 million of arms left unsold in warehouses in Honduras.
   According to Newsweek, in a July 12, 1985 notebook entry _
recently released by the Iran-contra joint committee _ North
predicted a ``bad end'' for the Arms Supermarket. ``$14 M(illion)
to finance came from drugs,'' he wrote, the magazine said.

   President Reagan's chief spokesman said today
he cannot predict when U.S. discussions with Panamanian officials
might lead Manuel Antonio Noriega to give up power.
   ``I can't comment on any course of action,'' spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, although he backed away from characterizing U.S.
discussions with Noriega as ``plea-bargaining.''
   Fitzwater said he had used the term last week, as had White
House chief of staff Howard Baker want to repeat it.
   The administration's reported willingness to drop U.S. drug
trafficking indictments in a deal to get Noriega out of power has
been widely criticized by members of Congress, U.S. att, but he did notorneys
and
law enforcement groups.
   Fitzwater said today that Reagan ``certainly is aware of'' the
criticism of proposals to dismiss indictments brought against
Noriega in Miami and Tampa, Fla., but refused to discuss the
strategy for dealing with the Panamanian strongman.
   ``We can't say what the give and take is,'' he said. ``We can't
predict time (for Noriega's departure). We can't discuss what they
are talking about, what the options are and how long it will ommittee has
``some evidence'' that
wrongdoing on the part of U.S. officials in Panama is behind the
administration's efforts to dismiss the indictments.
   But, he said, ``obviously we don't have enough that we've seen
fit to make it public or that we feel that we should talk about
publicly and I haven't for that reason.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a member of the Appropriations
subcommittee on defense and foreign operations, disagreed with the
reports that Noriega had some information on U.S. wrongdoing.
   ``The fact is that that's election-year politics,'' D'Amato said
on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   President Reagan, meanwhile, was asked Sunday on his return to
the White House after a weekend at Camp David, Md., whether a deal
had been struck with Noriega. ``I can't comment,'' he said.
   Reagan administration officials have said they were ``plea
bargaining'' with the Panamanian military chief and de facto ruler
about possibly dropping the drug indictments.
   A top State Department official, Michael Kozak, has been engaged
in secret negotiations with Noriega in Panama. Administration
sources said last week that the military chief was told that if he
left Panama for a year, perhaps in August, the indictments would be
dropped.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Friday presented arguments
to Reagan against dismissing the charges, according to U.S.
Attorney Leon Kellner of Miami, a prosecutor who obtained one of
the indictments.
   On Sunday, Robert Merkle, another U.S. attorney who secured
indictments against Noriega, said that a deal with Noriega ``would
make it impossible for me to maintain any credibility not only in
my own community ... it will make it difficult for me to look my
own kids in the eye and tell them to `just say no' to drugs.
   ``I would probably begin to say `just say maybe' because this is
the sort of equivocation I think which is absolutely
unacceptable,'' he said.

   The White House described the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan today as a ``welcome first step,'' and
expressed the hope the entire force will be gone by the end of the
year.
   ``We look forward to seeing the withdrawal proceed on schedule
and will continue to monitor the progress,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   After a bloody eight-year occupation of their neighbor, the
Soviets began withdrawing troops on Sunday.
   The spokesman said that the U.S. policy of support for the
freedom fighters that have battled the Soviets ``remains
steadfast.''
   The United States has said that it will continue to supply
weapons and other materials to the resistance fighters as long as
the Soviets continue their support of the Kabul regime.
   Under the Geneva accord on Afghanistan, half of the estimated
115,000 troops are scheduled to leave by August and the rest by
February.
   Fitzwater said the withdrawal was ``a welcome first step in the
Afghan peoples' desire for independence and self determination.''
   ``As the Soviets leave, we remain confident that a broadbased
government chosen by the Afghan people and not imposed from outside
will replace the Kabul regime,'' the spokesman added.
   Asked if the administration believes Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will pull out all his troops, Fitzwater responded in the
affirmative.
   ``We obviously hope the withdrawl can be complete by the end of
the year,'' Fitzwatar said. Asked if that included Soviet advisers
as well as troops, he responded, ``A Soviet's a Soviet.''

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa on Monday
renewed his call for increased U.S. pressure to end apartheid in
his country.
   ``What must still happen?'' to prompt the American government to
act, Tutu asked repeatedly in a commencement address at Emory
University.
   ``All the things you hold dear in this land are undermined,
destroyed, held in small account (in South Africa),'' he told the
graduates.
   Tutu dismissed arguments that economic sanctions against South
Africa only hurt black South Africans, questioning the motives of
``those who suddenly decide they feel sorry for black people.''
   Tutu further criticized U.S. news coverage of South Africa,
especially since the government there moved to limit coverage of
protests.
   ``Media in this land, with a few notable exceptions, have shown
extraordinary timidity,'' Tutu said. He said American readers do
not see the newspaper stories which appear in South Africa
detailing the injustices of apartheid.
   Tutu also made an apparent reference to a controversy at Emory
over the dismissal last fall of a black professor who was denied
tenure. Supporters of the teacher, Sondra O'Neal, demonstrated on
the campus Sunday and distributed fliers Monday protesting alleged
racism at the school.
   Tutu said Emory ``has a good record'' of seeking racial justice
in the United States and around the world.
   ``One would want to be equally concerned about similar issues
here,'' he added. ``... It is critical for this institution, with
which I am honored to be associated, to show a zeal to eradicate
something which could be a stumbling block.''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, received an honorary
doctor of divinity degree during the commencement program.

<HEAD>Lottery Picks 75 For N.H.'s First Moose Hunt In 87 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-five hunters won a lottery Monday
to participate in New Hampshire's first moose hunt since 1901.
   ``I won't be hunting moose, but I'll be out there in the
woods,'' said a disappointed Bernard Durant, who was among a dozen
hunters who watched as a computer selected the winners from 5,900
applicants.
   The random selection at Fish and Game Department headquarters
gives 65 residents and 10 out-of-state hunters a chance to shoot
one of the animals.
   Fish and game officials proposed the three-day hunt to manage
the herd, conservatively estimated at 1,600. The population has
rebounded after being decimated in the late 1800s.
   Opponents contend the hunt is being allowed simply to satisfy
hunters. Moose are so docile that shooting one is like shooting a
parked car, they claim.
   Fish and game officials say the animals appear tame on the
roadside, but are cagey in the woods. Howard Nowell, chief of game
management research, denies the state was pressured by hunters.
   New Hampshire's House this year killed legislation aimed at
stopping the hunt after a colorful debate that included a moose
call by one lawmaker meant to rally support for the hunt.
   Opponents were not nearly as vocal as those in neighboring Maine
when that state introduced a moose hunt in 1980. Maine then studied
the issue for a year before voters overwhelmingly approved an
annual hunt beginning in 1982. In Maine, 1,000 hunters are chosen
by lottery and opposition has virtually ceased.
   Six other states hold annual moose hunts _ Alaska, Montana,
Idaho, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Minnesota has one every
other year. Oregon, Colorado and Washington also have allowed moose
hunting.

<HEAD>Student Shot Boss's Husband As Act of Chivalry, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school student was being chivalrous and
acting in self-defense when he fatally shot his boss's estranged
husband, his lawyer says.
   Michael Lacour, 17, is charged with the murder last Thursday of
Frank Trevino, the husband of Lacour's supervisor at a fast-food
restaurant.
   Defense attorney Daniel Radakovich contended his client, Lacour,
shot Trevino in self-defense during a fight prompted when Lacour
confronted Trevino over allegations that he had been abusing Kathy
Trevino.
   ``Kinda sounds like King Arthur to me,'' Radakovich said. ``It
was chivalry.''
   But Assistant State's Attorney John Brady questioned the
characterization.
   ``Usually, chivalrous acts don't take place at 2:15 in the
morning,'' he said.
   Prosecutors quoted Mrs. Trevino as saying she separated from her
husband in April because he had abused her.
   When Mrs. Trevino later suggested her husband might need
``roughing up,'' Lacour offered to do it, said Assistant State's
Attorney Donald Jonker.
   Mrs. Trevino told authorities she was ``frightened'' for her
estranged husband and went to see him early Thursday.
   As she drove away, Jonker said, she saw Lacour and her husband
standing on the street and heard noises resembling the pop of
firecrackers.
   Lacour later told her, ``It's all over now,'' Jonker said.

   A $100 million communications
satellite was delivered here Monday to be readied as the cargo for
the first post-Challenger space shuttle mission.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-3, is a twin of a
payload destroyed when Challenger exploded shortly after launch on
Jan. 28, 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the
accident, with Aug. 22 now the target date for the next flight.
   TDRS-3 arrived here by C-5 cargo plane after a flight from
California. It was built for NASA by TRW's Space and Technology
Group in Redondo Beach.
   The new satellite is to be deployed from the cargo bay of
Discovery during the first day of the upcoming shuttle mission. It
will join the partially functional TDRS-1, launched from a shuttle
in April 1983.
   The satellites, a total of six of which are being built by TRW,
provide a communications link between ground stations and the
shuttle and other satellites orbiting the Earth.

   If you think a beauty pageant for turtles and
tortoises is new, you're the slow one.
   The New York Turtle And Tortoise Society sponsored the 14th such
extravaganva Sunday as 115 reptiles bid to be chosen belle of the

   They ranged in size from less than an inch to a 30-inch leopard
tortoise. All were primped for the judges as they posed in tanks
and other containers.
   As they slithered, slid and sometimes slept, about 350 members
of the society and their guests compared their health, longevity,
uniqueness and length of time in captivity, said Jim Van Abbema,
editor of the society's monthly newsletter.
   The winner is part of a turtle species from Panama.
   ``It had been in captivity for seven years and its health, shape
and configuration was flawless,'' Van Abbema said.
   Despite the fun Sunday, Van Abbema said the society remains
primarily a conservation organization and frowns on such things as

   Laundered money has a new meaning to the
Cincinnati employees of Jacor Communications.
   They spent two days cleaning honey from money that had come from
a ``Rolling In The Dough'' promotion at WYHY-FM, a Nashville,
Tenn., radio station owned by Jacor.
   Ten people had covered themselves with honey May 3, rolled over
$100,000 spread in an empty swimming pool, and took home whatever
stuck to them.
   The winners picked up $7,644 in the stunt, said WYHY-FM General
Manager Mike Kenney. But Jacor was stuck with $92,356 in gooey $1
bills.
   When the cash was returned to a Cincinnati bank May 4, the U.S.
Treasury Department was not amused.
   Jacor was ordered to clean, press and stack the cash by 5 p.m.
May 5, or corporate officers would face felony charges for defacing
currency, said Frank Wood, the company's president and chief
operating officer.
   Employees began the round-the-clock laundering operation under
the eye of an armed private security guard.
   Bills were washed in pillowcases and tumbled dry. The wrinkled
bills were steam ironed before being returned in time to meet the
deadline.

   To a lexicon already crowded with such
phrases as lucky duck, sitting duck, lame duck and even dead duck,
a group of Taylor residents wants to add another _ speeding duck.
   DuckFest, a day of community activities May 21, will include a
race for humans called the ``Duck Waddle,'' a duck egg relay and
other activities befitting a town where the high school sports
teams are the Fighting Ducks. But duck racing is the event that has
captured imaginations.
   The racing ducks will zip down wire-enclosed, 16-foot runways.
While the birds run, handlers are allowed to encourage them by
crawling along a ramp above the runway and making any kind of noise
they figure will motivate their racers.
   But if the verbal encouragement rolls off their birds' backs,
handlers are stuck. The rules say that once started, a duck can't
be touched.
   The Taylor competition is being patterned after the Great
American Duck Race held each year in Deming, N.M., where hundreds
of racing ducks and up to 20,000 spectators have gathered.
   Rules require that each racing duck be named. Among a long list
of suggestions: the intimidating moniker ``Winner or Dinner.''

   No one ever accuses Michael Dukakis of being
a spellbinding campaign speaker. But every once in a while the
Democratic presidential front-runner comes up with a line that
makes ears perk up.
   Perhaps energized by a crowd of more than 2,000 people at a
weekend street market here _ his biggest crowd in some time _
Dukakis found words that managed to meld a multitude of his themes.
   In three sentences, he reminded voters of the Reagan
administration's ties to Panama's accused drug-trading Gen. Manuel
Noriega, of its reported attempt to cut a deal dropping Noriega's
federal indictment, and of Dukakis' entirely unrelated call for a
law requiring notice to workers before companies close plants. And
at the same time he took a swipe at expected Republican opponent
George Bush.
   ``I understand the vice president was in Portland,'' Dukakis
said. ``And I understand that he said he thought the president
ought to veto the new trade bill because it contains a provision
that gives American workers 60 days notice before they're thrown
out in the streets.
   ``This from an administration that's apparently prepared to give
Noriega 90 days notice before they work out a deal.''
   His staff was pleased as punch. ``I know a new line when I hear
one,'' said Alice Travis, national political co-ordinator.

   The Massachusetts governor provided examples of his less
successful oratorical attempts, too, on his recent West Coast
campaign swing.
   Looking tired and jet-lagged by sunset Friday in San Diego,
Dukakis raised the issue of charisma.
   He's often accused of a severe charisma deficiency, and he tries
to make a positive of it by saying he offers competence instead.
But he mentions the word ``charisma'' so often as to suggest that
the whole idea nags at him.
   He sometimes contends that at least his wife Kitty finds him
charismatic and passionate. Standing before a small group of
Democratic activists gathered for poolside cocktails, Dukakis took
the claim another step.
   ``We've had a lot of discussion in this campaign about
charisma,'' he said. ``Well, out here they think I'm charismatic.
Right?''
   He was met with silence, then chuckles.
   Recovering, he invoked his ethnic roots.
   ``Anyway,'' he said, ``charisma is a Greek derivative.''

   With all the talk of Nancy Reagan and astrology, Dukakis has
developed his own interest in the subject.
   Putting away his staff's concerns that California might prove
the wrong place to do it, Dukakis poked fun at the Reagans by
referring to the stars.
   ``I don't know a horoscope from a telescope,'' he said often.
   He would add that he had decided to learn, and had taken a
reading of the stars for himself and Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.
   ``In both cases, it says we're going to be changing positions
soon,'' Dukakis said.

<TEXT>
   On Friday the 13th, the Dukakis campaign was beginning to wonder
if perhaps there might be something to the stars and superstitions.
   Arising in a fashionable hotel just off San Francisco's Union
Square, Dukakis campaign trip director Jack Weeks was chagrined to
find there were no buses to take the two busloads of traveling
press in the motorcade to the morning campaign event.
   There was a difference of opinion over who was to blame. But
Weeks quickly made a call to a local cab company, and the
reporters, photographers and network crews were soon piling into a
fleet of taxis and heading off to a high school in the city's
suburbs.
   One group _ from a television network _ proved luckier than the
rest. They managed to hail a long, black limo.

   Dukakis' trip to the West was his first with Secret Service
protection. He was the last presidential candidate to accept the
government bodyguards, and their arrival brought new rules and
restrictions to Dukakis' entourage.
   Campaign staffers began sporting new lapel pins, of a unique
design that signal to the informed who the wearer is.
   They also began spouting new phrases and words, like ``sweep the
bags,'' which doesn't mean clean them but assures the luggage is
unarmed and non-threatening, and ``EOD,'' which staffers explain as
an impenetrable acronym for the guys who do the sweeping.
   ``We're learning a new language,'' press secretary Mark Gearan
said.

<HEAD>Today's Rules of Engagement Designed to Prevent Another USS Stark
Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after the USS Stark was attacked by a
``friendly'' Iraqi jet fighter, American ships in the Persian Gulf
continue to operate under war-time rules of engagement designed to
prevent a repetition of that tragedy.
   The ground rules for fighting have been modified several times
since the Stark was attacked on May 17, 1987, primarily to expand
the number of situations in which American warships may come to the
aid of merchant ships.
   But the first change to the rules made by the Pentagon after the
attack, which killed 37 seamen, was to authorize ship commanders to
open fire on any plane or vessel that came close enough to fire on
their ship _ and those guidelines remain in place.
   ``There are really two U.S. navies _ one for peace and one for
war,'' Dr. Michael Vlahos, the director of the State Department's
Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs, observed recently. ``The
difference is mental readiness.
   ``In war, one's senses are honed for battle; in peace, even
where the threat of `inadvertent attack' is considered, one's
senses must be leashed,'' Vlahos said.
   That peace-time leashing may have left the Stark's crew
``mentally disarmed,'' Vlahos argues.
   The Stark's crew knew for an hour that a jet fighter was flying
in their direction and that it was ``assumed friendly, assumed
Iraqi.''
   No effort was made to warn the plane away until it was too late.
The fighter fired two Exocet missiles, 30 seconds apart. The first
was a dud. The second nearly sank the ship.
   One year later, the Stark sits dockside at Ingalls Shipbuilding
in Pascagoula, Miss., receiving the finishing touches of an
overhaul that will cost an estimated $100 million. The careers of
two of her officers _ including the skipper _ have come to a forced
end.
   Iraq has acknowledged its fighter pilot mistakenly fired on the
Stark _ thinking it was a tanker carrying oil for archenemy Iran.
Iraq has pledged to make restitution, although no money has changed
hands and probably won't for years.
   More than two-dozen U.S. Navy ships now operate in and around
the gulf, escorting U.S. tankers as well as 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers
reregistered to fly the American flag. The convoy work began
despite congressional opposition spawned by the Stark incident.
   U.S. ships also are now cleared to come to the aid of neutral
merchant vessels in certain circumstances. Four different battles
have been fought with Iranian forces. And the administration is
vowing to protect the right of freedom of navigation indefinitely.
   The Navy, meantime, long ago came to the conclusion the ship's
officers should have prevented the Stark tragedy. Noting that ``no
ordnance was fired in defense of Stark or in retaliation for the
attack,'' a board of inquiry concluded:
   ``The rules of engagement that were in existence on May 17,
1987, were sufficient to enable Stark to properly warn the Iraqi
aircraft ... and if the warning was not heeded ... to defend
herself against hostile intent and imminent danger without
absorbing the first hit.''
   The ship's commander, Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, ``failed to
provide combat-oriented leadership, allowing Stark's anti-air
warfare readiness to disintegrate to the point that his Combat
Information Center team was unable to defend the ship,'' the board
added.
   Brindel's tactical action officer, Lt. Basil E. Moncrief,
``failed to defend Stark as his duty required.''
   Brindel and Moncrief ultimatley accepted responsibility for the
Stark's failure to defend itself and were reprimanded rather than
court-martialed. Brindel was allowed to retire at the lower rank of
commander and Moncrief was allowed to resign without a pension.
   Brindel, now a realtor in Virginia Beach, refuses to discuss
that night in any detail. He refers reporters to a letter he wrote
the newspaper Navy Times last November, blaming the failure to
defend the ship on deficient radar and electronic sensor equipment.
   Brindel says he's bitter the Navy investigation didn't touch on
that aspect of the affair, but adds there were ``a lot of good
things that came out of it, too, like improving damage control on
the ships in the gulf; the identification of each other's forces;
rules of engagement, those sort of things.''
   Indeed, more extensive damage control training and equipment
additions have been cited as reasons the crew of the USS Samuel B.
Roberts saved that frigate after it hit a mine in the Persian Gulf
last month.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier to File Job-Discrimination Charges in
Colorado Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
people to file job-discrimination charges against employers by
allowing flexibility for meeting some deadlines imposed by a
federal anti-bias law.
   The justices, by a 5-3 vote, agreed with the Reagan
administration and revived a Colorado sex discrimination case that
was dismissed because deadlines for filing the complaint were
missed.
   The complaint was filed by Suanne Leerssen of Aurora, Colo., who
was fired on June 10, 1983, by Commercial Office Products Co.
   Ms. Leerssen filed a sex discrimination complaint against the
company with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
289 days later, on March 26, 1984.
   The 1964 Civil Rights Act says generally such charges must be
filed with the EEOC within 180 days of the occurrence of the
alleged discrimination. But the law also gives someone charging job
bias up to 300 days to file with the EEOC if the proceedings
initially are instituted with a state or local civil rights agency.
   In a related provision, the law says no charge may be filed with
the EEOC for 60 days from the time the case is filed with a state
or local civil rights agency. That provision is intended to give
the agency time to resolve the dispute while the EEOC steps aside.
   Colorado civil rights officials previously had agreed with the
EEOC that, in effect, the federal agency did not have to wait for
the 60 days to expire before intervening in cases like that of Ms.
Leerssen.
   Most states have similar work-sharing agreements with the EEOC.
The state agencies initially process certain types of claims and
the EEOC initially handles others.
   But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that despite
the state-federal agreement the EEOC must wait the full 60 days
before intervening.
   Adding 60 days to the 289 days Ms. Leerssen had waited to take
action against her employer meant that the EEOC's hands were tied
until 349 days had elapsed from her firing. And that is too late
for the EEOC to meet the 300-day limit, the appeals court said.
   The Supreme Court today overturned the appeals court ruling.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said the
300-day deadline was not missed because the EEOC had tacit approval
to act immediately, without waiting 60 days. He said Colorado
officials had waived the 60-day waiting period under their
agreement with the EEOC.
   The Reagan administration had said the 10th Circuit court
ruling, if adopted nationwide, could have forced dismissal of
thousands of discrimination complaints on a technicality.
   The case is EEOC vs. Commercial Office Products Co., 86-1696.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Finance People Raise Money for Primary Foes, Fall
Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush, within sight
of nomination and the end of their own fund-raising needs, are
turning their attention to retiring the debts of one-time rivals
and raising money for their parties.
   Bush has agreed to a request from Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole to help pay off his debt, said Bush deputy finance director
Fred Bush. Dole's debt stood at $1.8 million as of the end of
March, but he has received some $600,000 in federal matching funds
since then.
   Within two weeks, Bush will send out a mailing to his 15,000
top-dollar contributors seeking funds for the Kansas senator, said
the treasurer, who is not related to the vice president.
   On the Democratic side, such fund-raising will be done under the
auspices of the Democratic Party, not the Dukakis campaign,
although Dukakis will participate in any events, said his treasurer
Bob Farmer. Former opponent Albert Gore Jr. has the largest debt
outstanding, at more than $1.5 million.
   ``Governor Dukakis respects and likes the other candidates,''
Farmer said, but added, ``I think that because there are still
delegates outstanding, we would not want anyone to think we were
trading delegates for money. It would be more appropriate if
(Democratic Party) Chairman (Paul) Kirk put the thing together.''
   Democratic National Committee spokesman Mike McCurry said no
date has been set for the unity fund-raiser.
   In the vice president's case, Fred Bush said, the Dole mailing
``shows good faith on the vice president's part ... I think the
Dole people will help us as well.''
   He said there had been no request for help from the campaign of
Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., whose treasurer Scott Mackenzie said the
campaign expects to pay all of its remaining bills by the end of
June.
   However, the campaign still needs to raise money for close-down
costs and compliance with Federal Election Commission regulations,
which will come to under $1 million, said Mackenzie.
   ``If we could get the vice president to do a unity function or
sign a letter to his contributors on our behalf that would
certainly help,'' Mackenzie said in a telephone interview.
   Both Dukakis and Bush are beginning to refocus their
fund-raising machines on helping their parties build warchests for
the November general election.
   The candidates each will get $46 million from the
taxpayer-supported federal fund to campaign for the general
election, and cannot spend more than that amount.
   But election law also allows the parties to spend $8.3 million
to help their nominees, and they can also finance state-based
efforts which indirectly help the presidential ticket.
   With events last month, Bush raised the maximum $27 million that
primary candidates are allowed to spend under election law.
   He plans to help the GOP raise the $8.3 million, plus another
$14 million that will go to state election funds for November, said
Fred Bush.
   He said more than $1 million has already been raised for that
effort, and four large fund-raising events, at $10,000 per couple,
are planned for June. They should bring in between $4 and $5
million.
   Farmer said the Dukakis fund-raising team of 30 will embark on
general election efforts after hitting the $27 million primary
ceiling next month.
   Farmr, who has overseen Dukakis' admirable finance effort, will
remain as treasurer and if Dukakis wins the nomination as expected,
will work with the party to raise funds for both the presidential
campaign and for such state efforts as voter registration, local
races, and other party-building activities.
   Noting that the Republicans traditionally have had millions more
to spend than the Democrats, Farmer said, ``My goal would be to
create a level playing field for Democrats and Republicans'' and
raise ``as much as it takes to win.''
   Farmer said if Dukakis is the nominee, he anticipates expanding
on the system he used to raise money for Dukakis in the primary
season _ a network of 950 finance committee members who each
pledged to raise $10,000.
   Seven hundred raised the $10,000 each, and 150 raised $20,000 or
more, he said.
   ``Traditionally people went out and found a few fatcats and
depended on them to raise money. We have tried to create a
grassroots (effort) all over the country,'' Farmer said.
   In addition, Farmer said he foresees helping to raise money for
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic gubernatorial
bids.

   Inmates at a medium-security state
prison released their last two hostages today, ending a
three-day-old prison riot in which they seized eight hostages and
caused $2.5 million damage.
   ``For all practical purposes, it's over,'' prison spokesman
Jerry Massie said in Oklahoma City as corrections officials in
Stringtown examined the freed hostages. About 10 inmates who had
taken hostages were checked and loaded on a bus for transfer to
other prisons, officials said.
   Shortly after the bus pulled out of the prison parking lot at
11:20 a.m., an Oklahoma Highway Patrol tactical team packed up its
gear and began leaving, about 59 hours after the uprising started.
   Although investigators said they were told that a body was found
inside a dormitory building, a county medical examiner said no body
was found.
   Corrections Director Gary Maynard said a total of 51 inmates
were to be moved out of the medium-security prison and would be
taken to the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center or to the
Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.
   Maynard, speaking at a news conference before leaving Oklahoma
City for an inspection of the Stringtown correctional center, said
investigators will begin interviewing inmates today.
   Maynard said as far as corrections officials know now, the riot
was not racially motivated. He admitted, however, that a dispute
about theft of property reported as the cause of the riot
apparently ``involved black and white inmates.''
   Prison spokeswoman Anita Trammell said 30 to 35 inmates who were
not involved in the hostage taking and remained in their cells
during the standoff remained inside the prison.
   ``They will be contained, stripped, fed and watered,'' she said.
``We are going to determine who participated in the hostage
situation _ who set fires.''
   The last two hostages were freed after officials agreed earlier
today to televise the inmates' surrender. None of the Oklahoma City
stations showed tape of the inmates' surrender, although they did
cut into their programs with live reports.
   Ronnie Scott, a corrections officer, was freed about 10 a.m.
Thirty minutes later, Sgt. Harold Yoder was released. Both men were
undergoing medical examinations, but Massie said they were
apparently fine.
   Separate groups of inmates had held Yoder and Scott, Massie said.
   Eight hostages were initially taken in the riot that began
Friday night.
   The tentative agreement to free the last two hostages was
reached early this morning in negotations involving the inmates,
prison officials and legislators.
   Officials also agreed to a demand from the approximately 20
inmates that three state legislators the convicts met with Sunday
would witness today's surrender, Massie said.
   The agreement was reached after a guard held with the others
since the uprising began was released late Sunday, officials said.
   One inmate and one guard sustained minor injuries during the
takeover of the overcrowded, medium-security Mack Alford
Correctional Center.
   Under the agreement, the inmates were to let the hostages go
after a bus arrives to take them away, then come out of the
dormitory where they have been holed up since late Friday, Ms.
Trammell said.
   The bus to take the inmates to another prison arrived outside
the center at 8:20 a.m. but did not immediately enter the prison
grounds.
   In exchange for food and the earlier meeting with the three
state lawmakers, the inmates late Sunday released prison Capt.
Lewis McGee.
   ``He's tired; he's in good health. He's glad its over with,''
Ms. Trammell said. She said the other hostages also were thought to
be unharmed.
   Authorities gave the convicts soft drinks, ice cream and
cigarettes at their request, said corrections spokeswoman Joy
Hadwiger. Temperatures in the area Sunday were in the low 90s.
   The inmates also demanded restoration of electricity and
meetings with reporters and an American Civil Liberties Union
attorney who has helped prisoners, Ms. Trammell said. Officials did
not say if those demands would be met.
   In addition to corrections officers, an 18-member Highway Patrol
tactical unit and as many as 40 other patrol officers kept watch on
the prison.
   On Sunday afternoon, two inmates took one hostage, Yoder,
outside for less than 10 minutes and talked to officers through a
fence. Yoder was used as a shield by inmates who worked to close a
hole in the fence cut by prison officials to help other inmates
surrender, she said.
   She said the hostage-takers told the 30 to 35 other inmates
locked in the occupied south dorm that their lives would be in
danger if they tried to leave. Ms. Trammell said, however, that
those inmates said they didn't feel like hostages.
   The insurgents hung sheets with messages written on them from
the roof of the two-story south dormitory.
   The first sheet said ``White Power.'' A second said, ``DOC Will
Not Respond to Demands. They Have Lied to You the Public and
Press.'' A third requested help from news reporters.
   Of the three guards held Sunday, one was white, one black and
one an American Indian. Five guards were released unharmed
Saturday. A guard who was not taken hostage and an inmate sustained
minor injuries.
   Most of the prisoners who were routed from dormitories were
transferred to other prisons.
   Ms. Hadwiger said 150 were being held in a gymnasium area of the
prison awaiting relocation.
   The prison, located about 130 miles southeast of Oklahoma City,
had 652 inmates when the rebellion began but an operational
capacity of 492, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The United States welcomed the withdrawal
Monday of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and renewed its pledge to
support Moslem rebels as they fight to take control of the Kabul
government.
   ``The resistance has made clear its intention to continue the
struggle for self-determination against the illegitimate Kabul
regime,'' the State Department said. ``As we have said, we fully
support the resistance and their goal of an independent
Afghanistan.''
   The statement did not make clear whether the United States
supported the rebels in a civil war with the pro-Soviet government
or also in attacks on Red Army forces as they depart from the
war-torn country.
   The Soviet commander, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, said Saturday in
Kabul that the Russians would defend themselves against rebel
attacks. ``Certainly the retribution will be severe,'' he said.
   The Afghan rebels have stockpiled U.S. weapons, including
shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, while the Soviet have armed the
Afghan army. President Najib has denounced the rebels, who are
called ``freedom fighters'' by the Reagan administration, as
``terrorists'' and ``barbarians'' and ``fanatics who laughingly
preach a holy war.''
   On Monday, a convoy of 1,300 Soviet soldiers left Kabul and
headed for home. Gunfire rang out in the distance during a farewell
ceremony _ an ominous reminder that the civil war rages on.
   Gen. Gromov said Saturday that a quarter of the Soviet troops
would be pulled out of the country by the end of the month. An
estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are in the country backing the
government against the guerrillas.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said ``we welcome
the start of the withdrawal. ... This is a historic occasion,
opening up the possibility for the early restoration of
Afghanistan's independence and self-determination.''
   He said he hoped all Soviet forces would be withdrawn ``well in
advance'' of the Feb. 15 deadline set in agreements signed by
Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. official made a point of the fact the rebels had not
signed the cease-fire accord. Redman also stressed the continuing
and frequent U.S. contact with the Mujahedeen.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said in a separate
statement that U.S. support for the guerrillas ``remains
steadfast.''
   The leader of a Moslem rebel faction vowed on Sunday to seize
Jalalabad, a major strategic city, as soon as an estimated 6,000
Soviet troops withdrew.
   ``We'll continue our jihad (holy war). We are fighting against
an idea,'' said Mahmood, a commander in the radical Hezb-I-Islami
guerrilla faction, who spoke from his headquarters in Peshawar,
Pakistan.
   Soviet troops are expected to complete their retreat from
Jalalabad in two weeks and be replaced by up to 12,000 Afghan army
troops.
   Guerrillas and Western observers estimate that about 1.5 million
Afghans have died in the war. The U.S. State Department estimates
Soviet casualties since 1979 at 33,000 to 38,000, more than
one-third of whom were killed in eight years of fighting.
   An estimated 2.9 million Afghan refugees are in Pakistan and an
estimated 2.3 million are in Iran.

<HEAD>Troops Kill Two Arabs on Day of Mourning, Widespread Beatings
Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and
killed two Arab youths on Monday and wounded at least nine
protesters in widespread clashes on a ``Day of Mourning'' for Arabs
killed in the Palestinian uprising.
   The violence took place during a heat wave described as the
worst in 18 years. The temperature Monday in Tel Aviv was 108
degrees. It also came on Id el Fitr, the Moslem holiday marking the
close of the holy month of Ramadan.
   Hospital officials in Gaza City reported treating at least 46
Arabs for beating injuries.
   The respected liberal daily Haaretz quoted reserve soldiers
returning from duty in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as
complaining that beating and humiliating Arabs had become routine
army practice.
   The soldiers said a common tactic was stripping Arabs during
interrogation.
   In towns and villages throughout the occupied lands, Arabs
followed instructions issued in the latest Palestine Liberation
Organization leaflet to mourn victims of the uprising by praying
for them in mosques and laying wreaths on their graves.
   Protests erupted during marches as Moslem worshipers emerged
from prayers waving outlawed Palestinian flags, chanting
nationalist slogans and hurling stones at troops.
   The worst clash occurred in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a hotbed
of Palestinian nationalism on the outskirts of Gaza City.
   Troops opened fire when worshipers marched to a cemetery and
began throwing stones. A 17-year-old youth was killed and three
others, including a 10-year-old boy, were wounded, hospital
officials said.
   In Azmut, a village near the West Bank city of Nablus, troops
opened fire when a disturbance broke out during another Arab march,
the army said. Hospital officials said a 15-year-old boy was killed
and two people were wounded.
   The fatalities brought the Arab death toll during the uprising
to at least 190, according to U.N. figures. An Israeli teen-ager
and one soldier have died.
   In Jabaliya, witnesses said about 800 marchers made their way
from three mosques in the camp to the cemetery. As troops appeared,
some marchers began throwing stones.
   ``The soldiers started shooting everywhere,'' said 12-year-old
Rami Ahmed Demraz, who lay in Gaza City's Ahli Arab hospital with a
gunshot wound in his leg.
   Jabaliya resident Atas Abu Oshed, an 18-year-old tailor, said
two army helicopters dropped tear gas on the marchers and later
dropped baseball-sized stones on houses.
   After the morning march, Oshed said troops searched the camp for
stone-throwers, breaking into houses and beating refugees.
   ``They kicked in the door, pulled me out from behind my sewing
machine and and started to beat me with riot sticks,'' said Oshed,
who lay in a hospital bed with a bandage around his head. ``My
sister tried to help me and they beat her to the ground, knocking
her unconscious.''
   Doctors at the Ahli Arab hospital said they admitted six
Jabaliya residents with beating injuries Monday, and the city's
Shifa hospital said it admitted 20 more from the camp and an
additional 20 from other parts of Gaza.
   Yusef Hashim Kadus, 21, from Jabaliya, said 10 soldiers stopped
him as he was leaving his house and started hitting him with rifle
butts and riot sticks studded with pointed objects. Red welts
covered his back.
   Nabil Said Lubad, 22, lay nearby with a bloodied, bruised and
swollen left eye and red abrasions and black-and-blue welts on his
arms and legs. ``The troops asked me if I threw stones,'' he said.
``I said `no,' and they just kept beating me with riot sticks and
an iron pipe.''
   Residents of Beit Hanoun, a small village near Jabaliya, said
troops clashed with Arab worshipers following early morning prayers
there.
   Jaber Mohammed Kaffarneh, 24, whose two broken arms were in
casts from the wrist up, said he was surrounded by 20 soldiers.
   ``They hit me on the arms and all over my body with a tire
jack,'' said Kaffarneh, whose head and left leg were swathed in
bandages. He said he was beaten for an hour and thrown in a garbage
dumpster.
   Left-wing legislator Yair Tsaban urged the army to probe
allegations that at least one Israeli teen-ager in a paramilitary
training course beat Arab prisoners in a West Bank jail.
   Tsaban told The Associated Press the incident occurred between
February 7 and 12 when a group of high school students were brought
to a detention center near Ramallah.

<HEAD>Police Say Transvestite Burglars Deal Dresses For Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transvestite ``smash-and-grab''
burglars who recently hit dozens of stores from Titusville to Fort
Lauderdale have expensive taste in women's clothing, which they
wear or deal for cocaine, police say.
   ``They are wild people,'' said Fort Pierce police Detective Greg
Kirk told The Palm Beach Post in a story published Monday. ``The
guys we've arrested say that 99 percent smoke rock cocaine. So they
are supporting a drug habit as well as a belief that they need to
wear women's attire.''
   Police say they are tracking a ring of 30 to 40 transvestites
who live mostly in West Palm Beach and rove the eastern coast of
Florida _ shoplifting during the day and smashing windows with
concrete blocks to loot women's clothing boutiques at night.
   When they enter the stores, they grab denim miniskirts, linen
suits and silk pants with co-ordinating jackets.
   Smash-and-grab burglaries have been reported from Wilton Manors
in Broward County to stores as far north as Titusville.
   The ring has expanded from Palm Beach into other counties, and
has stolen more than $100,000 in women's clothes, said Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Sgt. Ken Deischer.
   ``One guy we arrested said they are moving around so much
because they know the heat is on,'' he said.
   Seven men _ including four wearing dresses, makeup and jewelry _
were arrested last week in suburban West Palm Beach and Fort
Pierce, police said.
   One of those arrested, Vincent Williams, 25, of West Palm Beach,
has been charged with additional burglary and grand theft counts
after authorities linked him to recent heists in Jupiter and
Tequesta, Kirk said.
   On Friday, Rodney Lowery, 21, of West Palm Beach _ who was
arrested May 9 on loitering and prowling charges _ appeared in
court wearing a dress, spike heels and gold necklaces.
   Lowery, who told the judge he prefers to be called ``Lonna,''
asked for a week's extension for his arraignment on previous
burglary and grand theft charges. The arraignment was postponed
until 8:45 a.m. Friday.
   Trying to capture transvestites is tricky, investigators said.
   ``One minute they are guys ... the next minute they are girls,''
said Sheriff's Lt. John McGuire, who heads a tactical unit
investigating the ring. ``That makes it hard for surveillance.''

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today began a
three-day visit to Paraguay, last stop on his South American tour.
His jet touched down in a torrential rainstorm as drenched
schoolgirls in white smocks chanted a greeting.
   President Alfredo Stroessner, who has ruled this nation for 34
years, awaited the pontiff inside an airport boarding area
protected from the rain.
   John Paul, who on departure from Rome on May 7 called his 12-day
trip to Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay ``a mission against
hate, violence and lies,'' arrived at 1:30 p.m. aboard a DC-8
jetliner of Peru's state airline Aeroperu.
   Gen. Stroessner's government tried last week to alter the papal
schedule in Paraguay by canceling a meeting with opposition
leaders, a move the Vatican said was unprecedented.
   The government later backed down. But the papal visit has
spotlighted deteriorating ties between the Roman Catholic Church
and the rightist government, whose members often describe clerical
critics as communists and subversives.
   In turn, clerics frequently attack alleged government
corruption, election fraud and human and civil rights violations.
   The church has criticized the decision to allow only
state-controlled radio and television to cover papal activities in
Paraguay, where about 97 percent of the 3.8 million population is
Catholic.
   In Peru on Sunday night, the pope called for an end to political
violence that has claimed 10,000 lives in recent years.
   ``May your homeland ... be a place where exploitation, violence
and terrorism do not leave their tragic sequels of oppression and
death,'' John Paul told a group of intellectuals and businessmen in
Lima, Peru's capital.
   The pope spoke in a Catholic seminary where last week leftist
guerrillas seeking the overthrow of Peru's civilian president, Alan
Garcia, interrupted a Mass and called for an armed revolution.
   In a farewell speech in Lima this morning, the pope reiterated
his concern over Peru's growing political violence.
   ``I cannot silence the sadness that invades my pastor's heart on
confirming that this noble Peruvian nation continues to suffer the
lash of violence.
   ``Attacks and crimes continue to leave pain and death in so many
homes of this country,'' he said.
   When John Paul first visited Peru in 1985, he appealed to
leftist insurgents to put down their arms. But the violence is
worse than ever.
   He recalled that appeal this morning.
   ``Before leaving this beloved soil of Peru, I renew the call I
made in February 1985 to those responsible for so much pain and
death.''
   Officials said leftist insurgents were responsible for four
dynamite blasts in Lima on Saturday that preceded the pope's
arrival. There were no reported injuries, but the explosions
knocked out electricity in a large section of the city.
   At a Mass Sunday in a park on outskirts of Lima, the pope
appealed to an estimated 1.5 million Peruvians to build ``a
civilization of love.''
   ``A civilization, which, resting on this foundation of love for
the person who is near us _ our neighbor _ will transform ... the
whole world,'' he said.
   During a meeting with Peru's bishops, he spoke of the ``blind
and insensitive violence'' plaguing the nation, Peru's poverty and
the country's major role in the South American drug trade.
   Peru is a major source of the coca leaves that yield cocaine.
   In a taped message broadcast on Peruvian radio, he referred to a
1986 prison uprising by members of the Maoist Shining Path
guerrilla movement. The army killed more than 250 guerrillas in the
clash.
   ``I know of the painful tensions which have cost lamentable
blood quotas, and I know of your sufferings and needs, which in
spite of noble and generous efforts on the part of authorities,
have not been overcome,'' he said in the message to prison inmates.
   An estimated 20,000 troops and police in riot gear sealed off
downtown Lima and guarded public buildings and hotels after the
bomb blasts Saturday.
   Heavy security was particularly evident when the pope called on
Peru's president Sunday in the government palace. As Garcia led
John Paul through a garden, they passed two armored personnel
carriers, soldiers carrying submachine guns and a special
anti-terrorist team in red berets.

   A desert wind raised temperatures across Israel
to more than 100 degrees Monday in the country's worst heat wave in
nearly two decades. More than 100 forest fires were reported, and
the death of an Austrian tourist was blamed on heat stroke.
   The hottest spot was Jericho, where the temperature reached 113,
according to the Israeli Meteorological Service. It was 109 in the
northern region of Galilee and 108 in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Jerusalem
registered 97 degrees.
   With the heat wave in its third day, health officials urged
people to stay indoors as much as possible and drink 12 to 16
glasses of water a day.
   On Saturday, temperatures in Jericho reached 116 degrees,
surpassing the record 115 degrees in May 1970, said Marco Marcel, a
forecaster at the meteorological service.
   The soaring temperatures were caused by a ``sharav,'' or hot
desert wind from north Africa, Marcel said.
   A 55-year-old tourist, Hubert Riegler of Vienna, died Saturday
after suffering heat stroke while hiking along the Dead Sea south
of Jerusalem, police said.
   Another death was indirectly blamed on the heat Sunday in Ramat
Hasharon, a Tel Aviv suburb.
   Police said a 35-year-old Israeli burned to death when he tried
to start an electric generator and the machine burst into flames.
The accident happened during a power outage caused by electricity
use estimated at 23 percent above normal.
   In the northern Galilee region, firefighters battled 50 blazes
Monday that had burned for more than 24 hours, Israel radio said.
Small planes were used to spray water on the flames. Another 50
fires have been put out in the past two days.
   About 350 residents were evacuated from the tiny village of
Moshav Ya'ara in the Galilee because of spreading flames, the radio
said.
   Fires destroyed six houses in the Mitzpe Kelil settlement,
burned through about 350 acres of trees and caused at least
$500,000 damage, radio and news reports said.
   The Jerusalem Post reported one happy result of the heat. It
said that prices for tomatoes, which soared 115 percent last month,
would soon come down because a large part of the crop was ripening
prematurely under the hot sun.

   Officials said Monday an investigation had been
launched into reports that an Israeli teen-ager in a paramilitary
youth corps severely beat an Arab prisoner after being encouraged
to do so by an army sergeant.
   The incident reportedly occurred in February, but details were
only published Monday.
   The daily Hadashot printed an interview with a 16-year-old Yuval
Aflalo from the southern town of Yeroham. Yuval was quoted as
saying he felt ``great enjoyment' after beating an Arab prisoner
``to a pulp'' with a wedge of iron. The prisoner required
hospitalization.
   ``I tell you, if I had had a submachine gun in my hands at that
moment, I would have killed him,'' the teen-ager was quoted as
saying.
   About 100,000 Israelis of high school age belong to the Gadna, a
paramilitary youth corps. Its members are taught to use weapons,
navigate and camp in preparation for entering the army at 18 for
three years' compulsory service.
   Hadashot said the teen-ager from Yeroham was one of 60 high
school students from the town's Gadna corps who spent a week at an
army base near Ramallah in the West Bank in February.
   Education Minister Yitzhak Navon said on Israel radio that a
sergeant at the Ofer camp near Ramallah invited three Gadna youths
``to come and see Arab detainees.''
   Navon said only two of the teen-agers went along and one ran
away when he saw the prisoners.
   ``Only one (teen-ager) was left. Apparently the sergeant
encouraged him to strike. How many times, I don't know. For that,
there is a committee investigating.'' Navon said. ``Presuming that
the details are correct, then this certainly is a grave affair.''
   Col. Uri Manos, who heads the Gadna, said the youth quoted in
Hadashot exaggerated his role.
   But he said the army was probing allegations that a soldier at
the base took two other teen-agers to the detention center and that
one of them may have struck a prisoner.
   Meir Tsaban, a lawmaker of the Socialist Mapam Party who
revealed the incident to Israeli newspapers, said in a telephone
interview that he learned of the incident in March after teachers
at Yeroham High School said they heard students boasting about
participating in beatings.
   Tsaban said the army told him it had put a sergeant on trial for
the incident and had issued orders barring the youth corps from
being brought to bases in the West Bank where Arab prisoners are
held. Tsaban didn't name the sergeant.
   Tsaban said he decided to publicize the case because he felt the
army investigation had been inadequate. ``The probe was
unsuccessful, and it was not even clear whether the sergeant was
punished,'' he said.
   The Haaretz daily quoted reservist troops who recently
compeleted duty in the occupied territories as complaining that
physical abuse and harassment of Arabs ``has become the norm.''
   In keeping with army policy, the newspaper did not publish the
names of the complaining soldiers. It said harassment ranged from
strip searches to beatings and vandalizing homes.
   The newspaper quoted one of its reporters who witnessed an
incident Sunday at the El Amari refugee camp near Ramallah.
   According to the witness, soldiers beat a detainee ``although he
did not resist arrest'' and that one soldier threw a stone at the
detainee's mother as she pleaded for his release.

   The State Department on Monday rejected in
``the strongest possible terms'' an alleged statement by Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat that the United
States participated in the assassination of the PLO's second
ranking official, Abu Jihad.
   ``Such irresponsible statements can only encourage further acts
of violence and terrorism,'' said department spokesman Charles
Redman.
   Redman said Arafat made the allegation in an interview on May 11.
   ``Arafat should disavow these dangerous and false allegations
immediately,'' Redman said.
   According to Redman, Arafat is reported to have said, ``The
United States also participated in the assassination of Abu Jihad.''
   The PLO leader was gunned down in Tunis on April 16. Published
reports have attributed the killing to an Israeli commando squad.
Israel has refused comment on the allegation.

   About half the Americans in a poll in January
said high school pupils should be taught that condoms can prevent
the spread of AIDS, and more than a third said schools should give
out condoms, Parents Magazine reported Monday.
   Eighty-seven percent of the 1,008 adults polled said they were
not worried or only slightly worried that they may get AIDS. Among
the roughly 200 who had teen-age children, a smaller majority _ 60
percent _ were not worried or only slightly worried about their
children getting AIDS, the poll said.
   Forty-nine percent of all the adults polled said high school
pupils should be taught that condoms are effective in preventing
the spread of AIDS, and 37 percent said schools should make condoms
available to pupils who want them, Parents Magazine reported.
   The poll was conducted by telephone Jan. 15-27 among a random
national sample, the magazine said. The margin of error was three
points.

   About 15,000 workers were poised to strike
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. as a walkout by 4,700 union members
against Firestone Inc. continued today in six states.
   On Sunday, the last of 11 United Rubber Workers locals at
Goodyear plants to vote rejected a union request to reconsider a
rejected contract proposal, defeating the union's attempt to set a
pattern for an industrywide pact.
   The union set a strike deadline of noon Tuesday for 11 Goodyear
plants in nine states.
   Mike Stanley, president of URW Local 878 in Union City, Tenn.,
said he and other union representatives have been called to Akron
to talk with Goodyear officials Tuesday morning.
   The Firestone strike began Sunday after negotiators in Cleveland
failed to reach an agreement by a 12:01 a.m. deadline. The walkout
affects plants in Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Oklahoma City;
Noblesville, Ind.; Russellville, Ark., and its tire headquarters in
Akron.
   No new talks have been scheduled, URW and Firestone spokesmen
said.
   Union leaders said Firestone officials refused to abide by the
pattern set in the tentative Goodyear contract.
   ``They did not present to us the cost-of-living allowance
provisions Goodyear granted, and there was no provision in there
for fully paid hospital insurance,'' said URW President Milan Stone.
   ``We believe that our proposal contains a number of
improvements, and in terms of Firestone's position in the industry
is equal in value and in cost to the URW settlement proposal,''
George W. Aucott, the company's executive vice president, said in a
statement.
   The third of the nation's Big Three tire makers, Uniroyal
Goodrich Tire Co., came to terms last month in a contract allowing
for the company's special needs as a result of the recent Goodrich
and Uniroyal merger.
   In the Goodyear contract, the main dispute was the lack of pay
raise in the pattern agreement, which included job security
provisions.
   Fifty-four percent of Goodyear's URW members rejected the
tentative contract on May 1. Six of the 11 Goodyear locals approved
the pact, but they did not represent a majority of the the
company's membership in the union. Under URW bylaws, ratification
must come from a majority of the membership as well as a majority
of the locals. So the union asked the locals to reconsider.
   On Sunday, the union local in Danville, Va., voted 479-339 not
to reconsider, forcing the URW to set a strike deadline.
   The vote followed a visit last week by Goodyear Chairman Robert
Mercer Jr., who urged local leaders to reconsider the proposed
contract.
   In addition to Danville, the strike would affect plants in
Akron, St. Marys and Marysville in Ohio; Gadsden, Ala.; Union City,
Tenn.; Madisonville, Ky.; Lincoln, Neb.; Topkea, Kan.; Sun Prarie,
Wis.; and New Bedford, Mass.

   Actress Christine Tudor, who plays Gwyneth
Alden on the soap opera ``Loving,'' began drinking at age 12 and is
the survivor of a violent past.
   In the May 21 issue of TV Guide, Ms. Tudor said she grew up
``angry .... Drinking fast became my way of dealing with the guilt
and torment.'' She is the youngest of five children of an alcoholic
father.
   The actress who grew up in working-class South Baltimore said
before her father left the family when she was 9, her life was
``filled with the emotional baggage of poverty, of late-night
arguments that brought violence and police intervention at home.''
   She skipped school and failed seventh grade. When she returned
to school, she met a remarkable teacher, Grace Guarino. By the end
of the eighth grade, Ms. Tudor had stopped drinking and street
fighting and was an honor student.
   Today, she spends 20 hours a week helping troubled youths,
working in the non-profit Youth at Risk Program of the Breakthrough
Foundation. She also organized the YAR Celebrity Development, where
about 50 celebrities have worked with troubled youths.

   Who knows what hits lurk on the ``American Top
40''? The Shadoe knows.
   ``Hollywood Squares'' regular Shadoe Stevens has been tabbed to
replace Casey Kasem on the ABC Radio program.
   ``The minute I heard Shadoe audition for `American Top 40,' I
knew we had found the perfect host for us,'' Tom Cuddy, vice
president of entertainment programming at the network, said Monday.
   Stevens, 41, said his new job is ``truly a dream come true for
me.''
   Born Terry Ingstad in North Dakota, Stevens said he was inspired
``in a blaze of glory'' to take his new name while standing outside
an atomic-testing range in Alamogordo, N.M., in 1969.
   His background in radio includes stints at three Los Angeles
stations.
   Stevens, who signed a seven-year contract, will take over in the
summer. Kasem left ABC to host a similar program for the Westwood
One Radio Network.

   A former Yale University professor who the
government asserts wrote ``vicious attacks on Jews'' for a
Russian-language newspaper controlled by the Nazis during World War
II lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday aimed at saving his U.S.
citizenship.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that Vladimir
Sokolov of Milford, Conn., may be stripped of his citizenship, the
first step toward deportation.
   Sokolov, who came to the United States in 1951, became a
naturalized citizen in 1957.
   Sokolov's attorney, Kevin W. Smith of Hamden, Conn., said his
client retired about eight years ago from Yale, where he taught
Russian literature.
   Government prosecutors contend that Sokolov's citizenship was
gained illegally because he falsely stated upon entering this
country that he had not ``assisted the enemy in persecuting civil
populations.''
   Sokolov, 75, was born in Orel, Russia. After Nazi Germany
invaded the Soviet Union during World War II, he worked as a writer
for Rech, a Russian-language paper.
   Government lawyers say that during his employment, Sokolov
``wrote numerous articles containing vicious attacks on Jews,'' for
which he won medals for ``bravery'' and ``merit'' from the Nazis.
   Sokolov fled the Soviet Union when the German Army retreated,
government lawyers said.
   He later wrote for Berlin-based newspapers that also featured
virulent propaganda against Jews, the government said.
   The case is Sokolov vs. U.S., 87-323.

   Of 45 people who made off with a total of $4,500
extra from a bank cash machine that went berserk last month, just
two have volunteered to return any of the money.
   ``I was surprised they did come in and very happy they were
going to give me the money right away,'' Amelia Saavedra, the
branch manager of the savings and loan that was hit for the loss,
said Monday.
   ``I was very surprised, pleasantly surprised, to say the least.''
   Those two were told to keep the money in their accounts so it
could be automatically deducted when they are billed, according to
Robert Nolan, a spokesman for First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Rochester.
   The association's branch at First Avenue and 14th Street spewed
forth the money on April 24 as users of the cash machine called
their friends to alert them that when $5 bills were requested, $20
bills were given.
   ``I called everybody I knew,'' an unidentified writer told New
York Newsday at the time.
   The cash machine transactions are automatically recorded, so the
association has a record of everyone who mistakenly received the
$20 bills. Each of the 45 people who got extra money has had or
will have the money deducted from their accounts, Nolan said.
   ``To my knowledge, we have had no protests,'' Nolan said Monday.
   The bank branch is part of a network that dispenses cash for
other banks, so the network will credit First Federal once the
accounts cough up the lost money.
   An employee of the bank had mistakenly put a canister of $20
bills into the slot for $5 bills. Theoretically, the most a
customer could get was $800 if he asked for $200.
   The clerk who loaded the machine incorrectly will not be
disciplined or reprimanded.
   ``It was an innocent chain of human events,'' Nolan said, and
procedures have been instituted to prevent it from happening again.
   The profiteering customers will not be prosecuted and there is
no investigation under way into the matter, according to Colleen
Roche, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   Meanwhile, Nolan said the bank could stand the temporary loss.
   ``We're a $4.7 billion association,'' Nolan said. ``I don't
believe it affected the cash flow.''

   Madonna says she wasn't surprised by the mixed
reviews she earned in her Broadway debut.
   ``I expected it because I get it with everything I do,'' the pop
star, who's performing on the Great White Way in David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow,'' told The New York Times.
   ``There are people who are violently opposed to the fact that I
exist on this earth.
   ``So I was just thankful there were people who liked it and also
who reviewed the play as objectively as possible and didn't let who

   In interviews published Monday, the Times also spoke with
Madonna's co-stars, Ron Silver, who was nominated for a Tony, and
Joseph Mantegna, and asked whether the hype surrounding the singer
concerned them.
   ``Speaking for myself,'' Mantegna said, ``at 40 years old I
really have to admit that the whole aura of the thing did not have
the same impact on me as perhaps it would have if, say, they had
told me I'd be doing the play with Ernie Banks'' _ referring to the
Chicago Cubs baseball star of the 1950s and '60s.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III has fired
chief Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland, and the head of
Meese's speech-writing unit abruptly quit today after Eastland's
dismissal was announced.
   William Schambra, the No. 3 official in the public affairs
office, handed in his resignation after Eastland told a reporter,
``Today's my last day; I don't have a job.''
   In a letter, Eastland said that he had been relieved of his
duties because he had provided an inadequate defense of the
attorney general in the face of a year-old criminal investigation
of Meese.
   Meese, meanwhile, said of Eastland's dismissal, ``Basically I
decided this was a good time for a change in leadership. This was a
matter basically of my determination that for the rest of the year
we could use some new leadership and he was agreeable to that.''
   Meese also told reporters he was ``very pleased'' with Eastland
and felt he had done an ``excellent'' job. Meese said that
Eastland's deputy, Patrick Korten, would become the new head of the
department's office of public affairs.
   Schambra would not discuss his resignation with reporters, but
Gary L. McDowell, himself a former Meese speechwriter himself, said
Schambra ``quit because he found that the attorney general's firing
of Terry Eastland to be unconscionable, that it was something that
Terry did not deserve, that it inflicts great harm on the
principles that everyone came here to fight for, and that Bill does
not feel obliged to continue in his office if the attorney general
sees fit to let Terry go.''
   McDowell commented after meeting with Schambra.
   At the White House, chief presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said ``I have no reaction'' to Eastland's firing. ``I
don't know anything about the Eastland case,'' he said.
   In a letter to Meese, Eastland noted that he had been relieved
of his duties Friday. He wrote to Meese, ``You have expressed to me
your desire to have as director of public affairs someone willing
to aggressively defend you against, in effect, any and all
criticism.''
   Eastland said that he had defended Meese ``to the best of my
ability,'' while ``exercising good judgment and acting in a manner
consistent with the obligations of this office.''
   ``You have concluded that my efforts have not sufficed,''
Eastland's letter said.
   Eastland's letter said that Meese had offered him 30 days in
which to conclude his work and look for a job, but ``I have decided
that the most appropriate course of action is to end my
responsibilities today.''
   ``I think this is the single greatest mistake Ed Meese has made
since becoming attorney general,'' said McDowell, a policital
conservative.
   ``I'm still a supporter of the attorney general and I still
think he would be poorly advised to resign,'' but ``I think he has
fallen prety to bad advice from those who confuse blind loyalty
with good government,'' said McDowell.
   Meese's counselor William Bradford Reynolds, and another of his
top political aides, Charles Cooper, were unaware of Meese's
decision to dismiss Eastland, according to Justice Department
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The central figure pushing for Eastland's dismissal, according
to the department sources, was Meese's former counselor, Ken Cribb,
who now heads the White House office of domestic affairs.
   Cribb, however, denied he played a role in the firing.
   ``That is an utter fabrication, and you will find that it
doesn't check out,'' Cribb said. ``The attorney general is entitled
to make personnel decisions and I support him in that.''
   Eastland, a political conservative who has written most of
Meese's speeches, has been increasingly concerned in recent months
by the effect on Justice Department operations of the ongoing probe
of Meese by independent counsel James McKay, said department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said Eastland had planned to wait until after the
independent counsel issued a report detailing Meese's activities
before deciding whether he would leave the department.
   McKay is expected to raise a number of ethical questions about
Meese's activities that will be referred to the Office of
Professional Responsibility, a Justice Department unit that
examines possible wrongdoing by department officials.
   On March 29, Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal
division chief William Weld resigned in protest over Meese's
continued tenure at the Justice Department. Burns and Weld, like
Eastland, were concerned that Meese's legal problems were damaging
department operations, morale and its public image.
   Eastland said in his letter that the public affairs office ``has
an obligation to serve not only the attorney general but also the
Department of Justice and the American people.
   ``While we may disagree about the appropriate role of the
director of this office, especially in present circumstances, I of
course recognize your prerogative to have whomever you wish serving
as director,'' said Eastland. ``I am leaving today so that you will
be at liberty to select a replacement.''
   McKay launched a criminal investigation of Meese on May 11,
1987. He has been investigating Meese's ties to the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and to a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. The
independent counsel also has been investigating $14,000 in regional
Bell telephone stock owned by the attorney general at a time when
Meese was meeting at the Justice Department with Bell executives.
Finally, McKay has been examining the $40,000-a-year job of Meese's
wife, Ursula, paid for out of a charitable contribution from a
Washington real estate family leasing space to the Justice
Department.
   Meese's longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, now under indictment
for alleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal, was involved in
each of the matters under investigation by McKay's office.

<HEAD>Iraqi Planes Attack 12 Tanker in 18 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq reported its 12th attack on an
Iranian tanker in 18 days Monday, and Persian Gulf shipping
executives said they had reports of 10 crewmen killed.
   At Iran's Larak island terminal in the Strait of Hormuz, salvage
teams fought a fire still burning on a Spanish supertanker from an
Iraqi raid Saturday.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit of London said two more names
were added to the death toll of the Saturday raid, in which five
tankers were hit. Lloyd's said 19 were dead and three missing. Gulf
shipping agents put the numbers at two dead and six missing.
   A dispatch from the official Iraqi News Agency said air force
planes made ``accurate and effective hits'' Monday on a ``big naval
target,'' the standard Iraqi term for a tanker owned or chartered
by Iran. It said all planes returned safely.
   Executives said the tanker was hit near Iran's main oil export
terminal, Kharg Island in the northern gulf, but said they did not
have the name of the vessel or further details. They said there
were reports of 10 crewmen dead.
   Iran uses the tankers to ferry oil from Kharg to makeshift
terminals on Larak and Sirri Island, in comparatively safer waters
450 miles down the gulf. Iraq raids the ships in an attempt to cut
off the oil revenue Iran needs to finance the war, which began in
September 1980.
   Of the dozen raids Iraq has reported since April 29, six have
been confirmed independently.
   U.S. military officials said the wreckage of a Marine Corps
helicopter gunship found in the southern gulf would be ``destroyed
in place'' by underwater explosives because it could not be
salvaged. The bodies of the two pilots were recovered Sunday.
   The Navy announced plans for a warship to drop a wreath in the
central gulf Tuesday, the first anniversary of an Iraqi missile
attack on the guided missile frigate USS Stark in which 37 sailors
were killed. It was hit by two Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi
pilot who mistook it for an Iranian ship.
   Shipping executives said the 325,000-ton Spanish supertanker
Barcelona continued burning and ``listing heavily,' two days after
the Iraqi raid on the Larak, but the vessel had been beached and
was not expected to sink.
   Iraqi jets flew a 1,500-mile roundtrip to hit Larak, where
foreign ships load oil brought down the gulf by shuttle tankers. It
was the third and most damaging Iraqi attack on the facility in
seven months.
   In addition to the Barcelona, the other ships damaged were the
world's largest vessel, the 564,739-ton Liberian-flag Seawise
Giant; the 457,841-ton British-flag Burmah Endeavour; the Argosy, a
152,004-ton Cypriot tanker, and the 231,712-ton Iranian-owned Khark.
   Iran has accused the United States of complicity in the raid,
claiming American warships jammed radar and radio communications
for nine minutes. U.S. officials deny the allegations.
   Some diplomatic and shipping industry observers, noting the
attack on Larak was among several recent military reversals, say
the Iranian military is under growing pressure to restore its
credibility.
   Last month, Iraq recaptured the Faw Peninsula, which Iran had
occupied since 1986, and the U.S. Navy destroyed two Iranian oil
platforms and sank or damaged six naval craft April 18. The
helicopter gunship was lost that day and Iran claimed to have shot
it down.
   Iran has threatened to avenge the setbacks.
   Iranian speedboats or frigates customarily attack a neutral
commercial vessel, most often in the southern gulf, for each tanker
hit by the Iraqis. More than 500 ships have been raided by both
sides since the war began.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, trying to ease
tensions, will arrange a meeting between presidential hopeful Jesse
Jackson and New York's Jewish leaders, it was reported Monday.
   Cuomo said the meeting would be sometime after the presidential
primaries end on June 7, the New York Daily News reported.
   During the campaign leading up to New York's April 19 primary,
Jackson refused to meet with Jewish leaders. He has antagonized
Jews by supporting Palestinian rights and referring to New York
City as ``Hymietown'' during his 1984 campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Cuomo, who met with Jackson for an hour on Friday in San
Francisco, said the black leader was concerned that Jewish leaders
would use any such meeting to attack him.
   ``I told him I would set it up personally and he could rely on
me to set up a group that was sincerely interested in communicating
and wasn't going to take advantage of him politically or any other
way,'' said Cuomo during an interview Sunday morning.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona voters will decide this November
whether to drop an unenforced constitutional provision that bars
women _ like Gov. Rose Mofford _ from holding the state's top
offices.
   The Senate voted 27-to-0 Monday for a proposed constitutional
amendment to remove language that restricts the top offices to men.
The House already has passed the proposed amendment, so the Senate
vote automatically places the issue on the November general
election ballot.
   The constitution technically now allows only men to be governor,
secretary of state, attorney general, school superintendent and
treasurer.
   Women have held those jobs for years, including Mrs. Mofford,
who had been secretary of state since 1978 and succeeded to the
governorship on April 4 when Gov. Evan Mecham was convicted on two
impeachment counts by the Senate.
   Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens said Monday he wonders what
will happen if voters reject the amendment. However, the federal
constitution supersedes the state document in any case.
   Assistant Minority Leader Lela Alston predicted the proposed
amendment will be approved. Nonetheless, she added, Arizona has
often been accused of being a backward state and the vote may show
``the level of real discrimination against women. It will be an
interesting vote.''
   A rejection of the amendment would be ``a terrible, terrible
thing to have,'' Ms. Alston said.

<HEAD>Labor Chief Pushes for Plant-Closings Plan in Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland moved to
muster support Monday for the beleaguered plant-closings provision
of the omnibus trade bill, calling it ``the human element'' in the
1,000-page package.
   ``Fairness alone dictates that workers have the right to know
about employer decisions that so drastically alter their lives,''
Kirkland said in attacking President Reagan's threatened veto of
the bill.
   ``His veto would rip the heart out of the bill by denying
workers and their communities the opportunity to avert or ease the
human catastrophe that occurs when employers move elsewhere,''
Kirkland said. He called the provision ``the human element'' in the
massive measure.
   The AFL-CIO has been running radio commericals around the
country and holding news conferences in selected cities as part of
a veto override campaign. They have focused on a provision of the
bill that would require companies with 100 or more employees to
give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs
   Kirkland urged lawmakers to fight any effort to soften or drop
the plant-closings provision as a way of making the measure more
palatable to the White House. He said the labor federation would
oppose any version of the trade bill without the provision.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, sent the bill to the White
House on Friday and the president has 10 days not including Sundays
to act upon it or allow it to become law without his signature.
That means the expected veto might not come until early next week.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper said he could not forecast
precisely when Reagan would veto the bill but added, ``I don't
think we'll bump up against the last day.''
   The centerpiece of the bill would overhaul the system under
which the United States imposes trade sanctions to retaliate
against international violations and aid American industries
threatened by stepped up overseas competition.
   Reagan has cited the plant-closings provision and Alaska oil
export restrictions in threatening to veto the measure. He has been
saying the labor-supported feature would blunt rather than sharpen
the nation's edge in global markets.
   The bill cleared the Senate 63-36 on April 27, three votes short
of what Democratic leaders believe would be needed to override a
Reagan veto.
   In gathering support, the administration has been saying that,
once the president's veto were sustained, a modified version with
more moderate provisions could be whisked through with little
difficulty.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has issued a
warning almost every day since April 27 that there can be no quick
action on a modified version of the trade bill if Reagan's veto is
sustained.
   Kirkland said the labor federation would withdraw its support if
the plant closings provision were sacrified to obtain the
president's signature. He did say in response to a question that he
would not actively campaign against such a measure.

<TEXT>
   A 74-year-old woman described by
prosecutors as ``everyone's favorite granny'' was acquitted Monday
of swindling a newspaper out of a bingo jackpot worth nearly $2
million.
   Phyllis Hanlon wept outside the courtroom in this city in
northwest England after a jury found her innocent of winning the
tabloid Sun's 1-million-pound ($1.89 million) top prize by fraud.
   ``Thank God it's all over,'' she said. ``It is the end of a
nightmare that seems to have gone on forever.''
   According to testimony, the fraud was perpetrated by printer
Arthur Sagar, whose job was to insert a winning bingo card into
every batch of 1,500 distributed to readers.
   Sagar gave winning cards to friends in return for a share of the
winnings, the prosecution said. The one he gave Mrs. Hanlon won her
more than $24,500, and she won the jackpot in a draw among 80
winners.
   Two other women, Mary Young, 44 and her mother-in-law, Margaret
Warde, 75, were cleared of charges of obtaining prizes of $18,900
each by conspiracy.
   What happens to the jackpot Mrs. Hanlon won in January 1985
remains to be decided by the courts. She said she had given about
one-third of the money to relatives and others, including two
daughters, and bought a home for $189,000.
   ``I was very happy to win it, but it brought me both happiness
and sadness,'' she said.
   The women were acquitted after the prosecution failed to
convince the jury they knew the winning cards were stolen. They
were described as ``impeccably respectable,'' with no criminal
records.
   Sagar, Mrs. Hanlon's son-in-law Kenneth Fairbrother, and two
other accomplices, John and Susan Marshall, pleaded guilty and were
to be sentenced Tuesday.
   Mrs. Hanlon said she gave Sagar and Marshall a total of 100,000
pounds, not as a reward for the winning card but because she felt
sorry for them.
   Judge Reginald Lockett told members of the jury they might
consider Mrs. Hanlon ``foolish, but you are not trying her for
that. ... May she have been duped, deluded and used shamefully by
others? If so she is, on my directions, not guilty.''

<HEAD>Sex-And-Violence Watchdog Announced; Critics Claim Censorship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Monday it was setting up
a new watchdog body to monitor sex and violence in broadcasting,
and it denied allegations that it was paving the way for censorship.
   The Broadcasting Standards Council was promised by the
Conservative Party in an election manifesto pledging to clean up
sex and violence in TV, radio and videos.
   It will be headed by Sir William Reese-Mogg, 59-year-old former
editor of The Times of London, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told
Parliament.
   The opposition Labor Party claimed the council would be used to
stifle criticism of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government.
   The government has clashed frequently with the British
Broadcasting Corp. and the Independent Broadcasting Authority,
usually over documentaries dealing with national security or
Northern Ireland.
   The temperature heated up in recent weeks after both
corporations broadcast films challenging the official version of
events in Gibraltar March 6, when British anti-terrorist agents
shot to death three Irish Republican Army members who allegedly
were plotting to plant a bomb.
   The films, which suggested the victims could have been captured
alive, were broadcast despite expressions of outrage from Mrs.
Thatcher and pleas for them to be suppressed until after the
inquest in Gibraltar.
   ``The waters of the relationship between the government and the
broadcasters are a bit choppy at the present time,'' Hurd said, but
insisted the council's task was to deal with sex and violence, not
politics.
   Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the opposition Labor Party,
called it an ``entirely authoritarian wedge.''
   ``The programs which the government objects to are not concerned
with sex, violence and taste, but concerned with the government's
political convenience. This body will eventually be expanded to
inhibit those who dare to criticize this administration,'' he said.
   Hattersley attacked the choice of Reese-Mogg, whom he accused of
playing ``an ignoble part'' in suppressing a program on Northern
Ireland when he was a BBC vice chairman.
   The council's most controversial power will be to preview
imported TV material before it is aired. Many broadcasters have
objected strongly, saying it opens the way for censorship and will
allow Reese-Mogg to stamp a conservative bias into television.
   Reese-Mogg says he asked for the right to preview programs, but
denies he intends to censor politically sensitive material.
   Government officials argue that the BBC and IBA have failed to
satisfactorily defend standards of decency on the two networks each
controls.
   Hurd said the council would be set up immediately and receive
legal powers when these were approved by Parliament.
   He said its functions would be to draw up a code of standards in
consultation with broadcasting, cable and video authorities,
monitor and report on the present intake of foreign material,
consider complaints and publicize its findings, and conduct
research into whether televised sex and violence affects behavior.

the smiling pictures of Denise Vogland, Amy Wheelock, Kristen
Williams and Chad Witt.
   At least four schools were represented on a church bus that
crashed Saturday as it returned a First Assembly of God youth group
and adult chaperones from the Kings Island amusement park north of
Cincinnati.
   Twenty-seven on the bus died when a pickup truck being driven in
the wrong direction on Interstate 71 plowed headon into the bus,
causing its fuel tanks to rupture and setting the bus ablaze.
   Sixteen people including the pickup driver, Larry Mahoney of
Worthville, remained hospitalized.
   The middle school was hardest hit, with three pupils still
hospitalized besides the 13 eighth graders, one seventh grader and
two sixth graders who were listed as missing and presumed dead.
Three other middle school pupils escaped with less serious injuries.
   The school's enrollment is 775 and ``I'm still not sure what the
effect will be of losing 16 kids, minimum,'' Jones said. ``Sixteen
kids out of our school and all of them quality, model kids.''
   Amy Wheelock, for example, was ``Miss Everything,'' Jones said.
She was captain of the cheerleaders and ``probably the most admired
girl at school.
   ``The thing that hurts me, that I can't get out of my mind, is
that we talk about leaders of tomorrow. These kids were leaders,''
Jones said.
   At nearby North Hardin High School, students were ``doing as
well as they can under the circumstance,'' said Principal Ray Story.
   Three of the school's boys _ senior Richard Gohn, freshmen
Joshua Conyers and Anthony Marks _ were among those believed dead
and eight other students remained hospitalized.
   Reporters were not allowed inside the high school, but Lori
Coffey, an 18-year-old senior, said it ``was silent.''
   ``That's the hardest part because you walk down the hall and see
the hurt but no one's saying anything,'' Ms. Coffey said. ``Most
people are in shock. Things like this don't happen at our school.''
   With an enrollment of 1,800, ``the North Hardin family is a big
family,'' Story said. ``It doesn't matter that it's a large family.
When any one member is missing, it affects the whole family.''
   The schools opened on schedule Monday, but emphasis was on grief
management rather than instruction.
   One of the bus crash survivors, sophomore Allen Tennison, said
he was back in school because ``the only way I know how to deal
with this is to talk about it.''
   ``There's times when I'm home and I look at pictures of my
friends and it hits me. But I've been numb all weekend,'' said
Tennison, the 15-year-old son of the church's pastor, Rev. Don
Tennison.
   The youth described the group on the bus as close-knit, everyone
knew everyone else.
   Signs of the tragedy were all over Radcliff, a booming town in
northcentral Kentucky just outside the Fort Knox Army base.
   Every flag that could be found in the city was at half staff and
sympathies were spelled out on marquees and display signs at
businesses and restaurants up and down the main business district.
   The message at the SunShine Cafe summed them up: ``Our hearts go
out to the families.''
   Counselors and chaplains were standing by at the high school and
teachers were encouraged to talk about the tragedy with any student
who felt the need, Story said.
   At the middle school, Jones said he and his faculty were ``just
trying to use good common sense and trying to make it an hour at a
time.''
   ``Today's a learning process, whether we want to know it or
not,'' Jones said. ``It's a tough learning process, but it is a
learning process.''

Programs</HEAD>

   Many developing countries have lost billions
of dollars through timber subsidies and giveaways that accelerate
destruction of tropical forests, a research organization said
Monday.
   ``Many of these countries have put the timber resource up for
grabs,'' said the author of the study, economist Robert Repetto.
``They collect in royalties and taxes much less than the timber is
worth. The ecological effect has been the extensive, wasteful,
rapid destruction of resources.''
   Repetto is a member of the staff of the World Resources
Institute, which studies environmental issues. In the past three
years the institute has published similar reports critical of
subsidies in developing countries for energy, water and pesticides.
   Monday's study reviewed several studies of below-cost sales of
timber by the U.S. Forest Service from the 191 million acres of
national forests. Though the service shows revenues exceeding
expenses by more than $500 million year, Repetto estimated that
once all costs are counted, the sales have been losing at least $85
million a year.
   Monday's study was meant to complement one by the institute in
1985 advocating reforestation efforts in developing countries.
   About 27 million acres (an area slightly larger than Virginia)
of forest are being lost in developing countries each year,
according to United Nations estimates. About two-thirds of it is in
the ``closed'' forests typical of the tropics where extensive
development of tree crowns prevents sunlight from reaching the
ground.
   ``The traditional assumption has been that deforestation makes
economic sense even if it makes environmental nonsense,'' said
James Gustave Speth, president of the institute. ``The work today
... punches a big hole in this traditional assumption.''
   Researchers examined 10 countries: China, Indonesia, the
Phillipines, Malaysia, Brazil, Ghana, Gabon, the Ivory Coast,
Liberia and the United States.
   In the Phillipines, for example, they found that royalties,
export taxes and other fees captured for the government only
one-sixth of the above-normal profits _ what economists call
``economic rent'' _ from the timber harvest in the years 1979-1982.
The five-sixths not captured amounted to about $860 million.
   To develop jobs, Indonesia, as well as other countries, exempts
sawn timber and plywood from export taxes and provides other tax
concessions to mills. But the mills use logs so inefficiently that
``in 1983, plywood exports worth $109 at international prices per
cubic meter of logs processed cost the rupiah equivalent of $133 to
produce, a sacrifice of potential gains possible only because of
the government's financial incentives and its forgiveness of log
export taxes,'' the report said.
   The Ivory Coast taxes plywood exports at 1 percent or 2 percent
and log exports at 25 percent to 45 percent. For the iroko species,
according to the report, this means ``more than $50 in taxes are
foregone for every $25 of extra foreign exchange earnings generated
when a cubic meter of log is processed into plywood.''
   Brazil provides so many concessions to cattle ranches carved out
of the Amazonian rain forest that over 15 years the typical rancher
can earn 2{ times his initial investment, even though the value of
the total ranch investment, counting the government's contribution,
would shrink by half.
   The 470 subsidized ranches had converted 6.4 million acres from
forest to pasture by 1983. Since there are 50,000 unsubsidized
ranches in the Amazon, the report questioned whether the subsidies
are worthwhile.

<TEXT>
   The kidnapping and murder of a prominent
local businessman who suffocated after being buried alive was part
of a ``cold, calculated'' plan to collect a $1 million ransom, a
prosecutor said Monday.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Ficaro told jurors in opening
arguments that Daniel J. Edwards, 31, abducted Stephen Small on
Sept. 2 because he was ``trying for the big score,'' and that
Edwards ``never intended Stephen Small to live.''
   But defense attorney Sheldon Reagan told jurors it was a
``tragic, but accidental death.''
   He said evidence would show no signs of injury to Small, and
that the wooden box in which he was buried contained water, candy
bars, lights and a faulty air supply system.
   The state is seeking the death penalty against Edwards.
   Edwards and Nancy Rish, 26, were arrested two days after Small's
abduction and hours before police found his body in a wooded area
between Kankakee and the Indiana border.
   Miss Rish, who lived with Edwards in Bourbonnais, also has been
charged with murder and kidnapping. Her trial date has not been set.
   Ficaro said evidence would show that Small, great-grandson of
former Illinois Gov. Len Small and a member of a prominent media
family, was restoring a Frank Lloyd Wright house last summer, while
Edwards was busy ``building the nightmare that brings us to this
court today,'' a coffin-size plywood box.
   The prosecutor said the jury would hear a tape recording Edwards
made of Small telling his family he had been kidnapped and where to
take the $1 million ransom.
   Ficaro said Edwards' fingerprints were found inside the wooden
box and on plastic pipe at the burial scene, but Edwards' biggest
mistake was assuming ``it takes a long time to trace a phone call.''
   Police traced a ransom call to a public telephone in nearby
Aroma Park, where a witness saw Edwards, Ficaro said.
   Police said Small was lured from his restored home after
midnight Sept. 2. The caller, identifying himself as a policeman,
asked Small to come to another house he owned because it had been
burglarized.
   Before dawn, Nancy Small received a call saying her husband
would be found in a box if the ransom were not paid. Late in the
day, a call with delivery instructions was unclear. The person
later promised to call back, but the family received no other calls.

   ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins is hoping that a
sweet smell will be a success _ because she gets a percentage of
the proceeds.
   Parlux Fragrances Inc. of Manhattan announced Monday that Miss
Collins has signed a contract to start a line of fragrances next
year.
   She was chosen, according to Parlux chief Gerard Semhon,
``because as a Hollywood personality she is the ultimate at this
point. She is the most visible, probably in the same league as
Elizabeth Taylor.''
   The name of the new product is undisclosed pending some legal
technicalities but will include Miss Collins' name, Semhon said.
   Miss Collins accepted a down payment of less than six figures
against future royalties of 5 percent of the net proceeds, Semhon
said. A spokeswoman for the company said first year sales are
expected to be about $10 million.
   Semhon said he was able to persuade the actress that the
start-up costs would be large and any large initial payment to her
would be a liability.
   But Semhon declined to reveal exactly how much Miss Collins was
paid because ``She's very proud. She doesn't want people to know
she accepted less than someone else.''

<TEXT>
   A metalworker was convicted of murder Monday and
sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison in connection with
ethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people in the Azerbaijani
city of Sumgait.
   Talekh Salekh Ogli Ismailov was convicted of premeditated murder
by a tribunal headed by a member of the Supreme Court of
Azerbaijan, the official Tass news agency reported. He was the
first person convicted in the February riots.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda reported last week that
Ismailov was accused of intentionally killing someone during the
unrest ``from hooligan motives.''
   Tass said legal proceedings were continuing against other
defendants accused of participating in the rioting that broke out
Feb. 28 in Sumgait, an industrial city on the Caspian Sea. No other
details of the trials were reported.
   The disorder was sparked by a campaign in neighboring Armenia
for annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. The
majority of the people in the small, mountainous region are
Christian Armenians, and Armenians say they are repressed by
Azeris, who are Moslems.
   Armenian activists said bands of Azeris hunted down and killed
Armenians during the riot in Sumgait.
   More than 80 people have been charged with criminal offenses in
the rioting, in which 26 Armenians and six Azeris died and 200
people were injured.

<HEAD>Output Surges 0.7 Percent In April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial production surged 0.7 percent
in April as a boom in demand for business equipment helped give the
country the biggest increase in factory output in six months, the
government said Monday.
   The Federal Reserve said the April advance, more than three
times as rapid as the 0.2 percent March increase, pushed overall
industrial output 6.4 percent higher than a year ago.
   Much of the strength in the past year has been credited to
booming export demand as American producers have benefited from the
weaker dollar, which makes their goods more competitive on overseas
markets.
   ``For a part of the economy that was in so much trouble just a
little over a year ago, the turnaround in manufacturing has been
amazing,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   The April increase reflected widespread output gains at
manufacturing plants, where production rose 0.7 percent. Factories
producing durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, saw output climb 0.9 percent while plants making non-durable
goods boosted output by 0.4 percent.
   There was a 0.9 percent rise in production of business
equipment, a category including everything from heavy machinery to
computers. Strong gains have been registered in this sector all
year as manufacturers have increased spending to expand their
production facilities to meet the rising export demand.
   After adjusting for inflation, business investment shot up at an
annual rate of 21 percent in the first three months of the year,
the biggest increase in more than four years.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said this
pace of investment spending was not sustainable and she predicted
slower growth in the months ahead.
   She said this was part of the reason that DRI was forecasting
that overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national
product, would not be as strong in the current quarter as the 2.3
percent advance from January through March. She predicted the GNP
would rise at a rate of just 1.5 percent from April through June.
   Auto production, which had been lagging as manufacturers tried
to work down a huge backlog of unsold cars, jumped sharply for a
second straight month with passenger cars being assembled at an
annual rate of 7 million units, up from a rate of 6.6 million in
March and 6.1 million in February.
   Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the two increases reflected the automakers'
success automakers in reducing high inventories through aggressive
sales incentive programs. But he said it was possible that supplies
would again exceed demand later in the year, triggering another
round of production cutbacks.
   The overall increase in April was the strongest since a 1.1
percent rise last October. Output slowed a bit early in the year,
reflecting in large part the drop in auto production.
   Still, the slowdown was not anywhere near as severe as some
economists had forecast immediately following the October stock
market crash, which had raised concerns that sharp production
cutbacks in the early part of this year would push the country into
a recession.
   Output in the mining industry, which includes oil and gas
drilling, jumped 1.3 percent in April, following a 0.7 percent
March increase. The strong gains in both of those months followed a
string of declines in this sector, which has been depressed because
of past declines in energy prices.
   Output at the nation's utilities fell 0.8 percent in April,
following an even larger 1.1 percent drop in March.
   The various changes left the industrial production index at
135.6 in April, up from 134.7 in March.

   President Najib bid farewell to 1,300
Soviet soldiers Monday, calling them ``my dear friends,'' and said
his forces are strong enough to fight Moslem insurgents when the
Red Army is gone.
   Najib quoted an Afghan proverb, ``May your way be safe and your
dishes tasty,'' in seeing off the Soviet convoy, which faced the
danger of guerrilla attacks on the 200-mile, three-day trip through
rugged terrain to the Soviet border.
   Gunfire could be heard in the hills around the capital,
apparently from skirmishes between insurgents and government troops.
   Soviet troops have been in Afghanistan since December 1979
helping fight the guerrillas, who launched their insurgency after a
Communist coup in April 1978. The Kremlin has agreed to withdraw
its estimated 115,000 soldiers within nine months.
   Najib's army of 40,000 men, along with an estimated 100,000
mercenaries, police and security agents, will be left to fight
about 200,000 insurgents, according to Western diplomatic sources.
   One Afghan said the withdrawal was overdue. ``We do not know
what will happen, but until the Russians left, there could be no
peace,'' he said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described
the Soviet withdrawal as a ``welcome first step'' and expressed the
hope that the entire force will be gone by the end of the year.
   About 300 vehicles were in the convoy, the first of four
scheduled to leave the northeastern city of Jalalabad near the
Pakistan border. Guerrilla leaders have vowed to attack Jalalabad
when the Soviets are gone.
   The convoy covered the 88 miles from Jalalabad to Kabul on
Sunday. It appeared lightly laden, burdened only by fuel and water
tankers.
   Soviet officials have said they will leave $1 billion worth of
equipment and bases for the Afghan army.
   Western diplomats in neighboring Pakistan said Soviet supplies
continue to pour in. They reported frequent night flights during
the past week by large transport planes.
   They also said diplomatic dispatches reported heavy fighting in
Kandahar, Logar and Zabul in the southeast, Paktia in east, Ghazni
just south of Kabul, and Shomali and Paghman north and northwest of
the capital.
   At the farewell rally, Najib said the Soviet soldiers had helped
his country at a time of ``life and death.'' The Afghan leader and
his military commanders pinned medals on some of the 500 Soviet
soldiers who had stood for two hours during review.
   Attached to the medals, made of gold, were blue ribbons with the
inscription: ``From a grateful Afghan people.''
   Military bands played, thousands of Afghan soldiers and
civilians waved flags, then the convoy lumbered away.
   Some soldiers said they felt the gorge just north of Kabul and
approaches to the Salang tunnel, 70 miles north of the city, would
be the most dangerous part of their journey.
   Information about the withdrawal came from a Reuters news agency
pool report. AP reporters were barred from covering the withdrawal.
Soviet officials said the exclusion resulted from questions asked
by the AP during a previous trip to Kabul.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda carried a
front-page report headlined ``Homeward'' about the start of
withdrawal. The article, accompanied by pictures of the convoy from
Jalalabad, praised the soldiers for fulfilling their duty and
lamented continuing strife in Afghanistan.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, called its story ``The Road
Home.''
   Some soldiers left behind said they also were eager to leave.
   ``I am a bit sad. But I am going myself in a month. I think I
can hang on a little longer,'' said a soldier identified only as
Alexander from Kaunas, Lithuania.
   Lt. Gen. Vladimir Bogdanov said convoys would leave Jalalabad on
alternate days to allow traffic in the opposite direction to use
the narrow road, but all Soviets based in the city would be
withdrawn within two weeks.
   Mahmood, a commander in the Hezb-I-Islami guerrilla faction,
told The Associated Press at his base in Pakistan his 10,000 men
would invade Jalalabad as soon as the Red Army was gone.
   Under the U.N.-mediated agreement signed in Geneva last month,
half the Soviet soldiers must be out of Afghanistan by Aug. 15.
Soviet officials have said one-quarter will be gone before
President Reagan visits Moscow on May 29.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Billions of Dollars Saved From Canceled Weapons
Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The estimated cost of the 95 major weapons
programs that underlie President Reagan's military build-up
declined sharply during the first quarter of fiscal 1988 thanks to
cancellations spawned by budget cuts, the Pentagon said Monday.
   At the close of the quarter on Dec. 31, the Pentagon said the 95
programs carried a combined pricetag of $757.25 billion, down $61.8
billion or 7.5 percent from the adjusted Sept. 30, 1987, total of
$819.05 billion.
   The Pentagon attributed the quarterly decline ``to the
cancellation or significant cutback of seven DoD programs.'' The
programs were slashed in order to comply with fiscal 1988 spending
limits adopted last fall in a compromise deficit-reduction package.
   Among the seven were production of Copperhead artillery rounds;
development and production of surveillance drone aircraft; and
development of a jam-proof high frequency radio system. Those cuts,
respectively, saved $423.3 million, $1.3 billion and $4.4 billion.
   Also killed were the ground-launched cruise missile program and
the satellite-killing ASAT rocket.
   The cruise missile program was killed as a result of the new
arms agreement with the Soviet Union barring such
intermediate-range weapons, with a savings of $154.3 million. The
ASAT rocket program was killed because of Congress' refusal to
allow additional testing of the device in space, producing savings
of $2.5 billion.
   Also eliminated was the Midgetman nuclear missile program, for a
projected savings of $41.4 billion. That savings is contingent,
however, upon congressional endorsement.
   The new cost estimates are contained in the latest version of
the ``Selected Acquisition Reports,'' a congressionally required
review of all major weapons programs.
   The reports are designed to provide a broad gauge of how well
the Pentagon is doing in managing its weapons buying. They do not
reflect any change to a program unless there are major schedule
delays or an increase of at least 5 percent in the cost, nor do
they specify when the last year of buying for each weapon is
scheduled.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of May 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.5 million head,
up 4 percent from a year ago and 6 percent from two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in April totaled 1.61 million head,
up 5 percent from a year ago but 1 percent below two years ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.53 million head, down 9 percent from a year
ago and 2 percent below April 1986.
   As of May 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year earlier
in five states and down in Arizona and Texas. The states account
for about three-fourths of the nation's beef production.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of May 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   Here are excerpts from Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop's smoking report that proclaims nicotine to be
addictive.
   The opening chapter of the 618-report is an overview that lists
``major conclusions,'' followed by eight subsequent chapters and
two appendices.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MAJOR CONCLUSIONS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   1. Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting.
   2. Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.
   3. The pharmacologic and behavioral process that determine
tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to
drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Chapter II: Nicotine: Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism and
Pharmacodynamics</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. All tobacco products contain substantial amounts of nicotine
and other alkaloids. Tobaccos from low-yield and high-yield
cigarettes contain similar amounts of nicotine.
   2. Nicotine is absorbed readily from tobacco smoke in the lungs
and from smokeless tobacco in the mouth or nose. Levels of nicotine
in the blood are similar in magnitude in people using different
forms of tobacco. With regular use, levels of nicotine accumulate
in the body during the day and persist overnight. Thus, daily
tobacco users are exposed to the effects of nicotine 24 hours each
day.
   3. Nicotine that enters the blood is rapidly distributed to the
brain. As a result, effects of nicotine on the central nervous
system occur rapidly after a puff of cigarette smoke.
   4. Acute and chronic tolerance develops to many effects of
nicotine. Such tolerance is consistent with reports that initial
use of tobacco products, such as in adolescents first beginning to
smoke, is usually accompanied by a number of unpleasant symptoms
which disappear following chronic tobacco use.

<TEXT>
   
   1. Nicotine is a powerful pharmacologic agent that acts in the
brain and throughout the body. Actions include electrocortical
activation, skeletal muscle relaxation, and cardiovascular and
endocrine effects. The many biochemical and electrocortical effects
of nicotine may act in concert to reinforce tobacco use.
   2. Nicotine acts on specific binding sites or receptors
throughout the nervous system. Nicotine readily crosses the
blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain shortly after it
enters the body. Once in the brain, it interacts with specific
receptors and alters brain energy metabolism in a pattern
consistent with the distribution of specific binding sites for the
drug.
   3. Nicotine and smoking exert effects on nearly all components
of the endocrine and neuroendocrine systems (including
catecholamines, serotonin, corticosteroids, pituitary hormones).
Some of these endocrine effects are mediated by actions of nicotine
on brain neurotransmitter systems (e.g. hypothalamic-pituitary
axis). In addition, nicotine has direct peripherally mediated
effects (e.g. on the adrenal medulla and the adrenal cortex).

<HEAD>Chapter IV: Tobacco Use as Drug Dependence</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. Patterns
of tobacco use are regular and compulsive, and a withdrawal
syndrome usually accompanies tobacco abstinence.
   2. Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.
Specifically, nicotine is psychoactive (``mood altering'') and can
provide pleasurable effects. Nicotine can serve as a reinforcer to
motivate tobacco-seeking and tobacco-using behavior. Tolerance
develops to actions of nicotine such that repeated use results in
diminished effects and can be accompanied by increased intake.
Nicotine also causes physical dependence characterized by a
withdrawal syndrome that usually accompanies nicotine abstinence.
   3. The physical characteristics of nicotine delivery systems can
affect their toxicity and addictiveness. Therefore, new nicotine
delivery systems should be evaluated for their toxic and addictive
effects.

   Chapter V: Tobacco Use Compared to other Drug Dependencies
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   1. The pharmacologic and behavorial processes that determine
tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to
drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
   2. Environmental factors including drug-associated stimuli and
social pressure are important influences of initiation, patterns of
use, quitting, and relapse to use of opioids, alcohol, nicotine and
other addicting drugs.
   3. Many persons dependent upon opioids, alcohol, nicotine or
other drugs are able to give up their drug use outside the context
of treatment programs; other persons, however, require the
assistance of formal cessation programs to achieve lasting drug
abstinence.
   4. Relapse to drug use often occurs among persons who have
achieved abstinence from opioids, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs.
   5. Behaviorial and pharmacologic intervention, techniques with
demonstrated efficacy are available for the treatment of addiction
to opioids, alcohol, nicotine and other drugs.

<HEAD>Chapter VI: Effects of Nicotine That May Promote Tobacco
Dependence</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. After smoking cigarettes or receiving nicotine, smokers
perform better on some cognitive tasks (including sustained
attention and selective attention) than they do when deprived of
cigarettes or nicotine. However, smoking and nicotine do not
improve general learning.
   2. Stress increases cigarette consumption among smokers.
Further, stress has been identified as a risk factor for initiation
of smoking in adolescence.
   3. In general, cigarette smokers weigh less (approximately 7
pounds less on average) than nonsmokers. Many smokers who quit
smoking gain weight.
   4. Food intake and probably metabolic factors are involved in
the inverse relationship between smoking and body weight. There is
evidence that nicotine plays an important role in the relationship
between smoking and body weight.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Chapter VII: Treatment of Tobacco Dependence</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. Tobacco dependence can be treated successfully.
   2. Effective interventions include behavioral approaches alone
and behavioral approaches with adjunctive pharmacologic treatment.
   3. Behavioral interventions are most effective when they include
multiple components (procedures such as aversive smoking, skills
training, group support and self-reward). Inclusion of too many
treatment procedures can lead to less successful outcome.
   4. Nicotine replacement can reduce tobacco withdrawal symptoms
and may enhance the efficacy of behavorial treatment.

<HEAD>Appendix A: Trends in Tobacco Use in the United States</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. An estimated 32.7 percent of men and 28.3 percent of women
smoked cigarettes regularly in 1985. The overall prevalence of
smoking in the United States decreased from 36.7 percent in 1976
(52.4 million adults) to 30.4 percent in 1985 (51.1 million adults).
   2. In 1985, the mean reported number of cigarettes smoked per
day was 21.8 for male smokers and 18.1 for female smokers.
   3. Smoking is more common in lower socioeconomic categories
(blue-collar workers or unemployed persons, less-educated persons
and lower-income groups) than in higher socioeconomic categories.
For example, the prevalence of smoking in 1985 among persons
without a high school diploma was 35.4 percent, compared with 16.5
percent among persons with postgraduate college education.
   4. An estimated 18.7 percent of high school seniors reported
daily use of cigarettes in 1986. The prevalence of daily use of one
or more cigarettes among high school seniors declined between 1975
and 1986 by approximately 35 percent. Most of the decline occurred
between 1977 and 1981. Since 1976, the smoking prevalence among
females has consistently been slightly higher than among males.
   5. The use of cigars and pipes has declined 80 percent since
1964.
   6. Smokeless tobacco use has increased substantially among young
men and has declined among older men since 1975. An estimated 8.2
percent of 17- to 19-year-old men were users of smokeless tobacco
products in 1986.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Appendix B: Toxicity of Nicotine</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. At high exposure levels, nicotine is a potent and potentially
lethal poison. Human poisonings occur primarily as a result of
accidental ingestion or skin contact with nicotine-containing
insecticides or, in children, after ingestion of tobacco or tobacco
juices.
   2. Mild nicotine intoxication occurs in first-time smokers,
non-smoking workers who harvest tobacco leaves and people who chew
excessive amounts of nicotine polacrilex gum. Tolerance to these
effects develops rapidly.
   3. Nicotine exposure in long-term tobacco users is substantial,
affecting many organ systems (Chapters II and III). Pharmacologic
actions of nicotine may contribute to the pathogenesis of
smoking-related diseases, although direct causation has not yet
been determined. Of particular concern are cardiovascular disease,
complications of hypertension, reproductive disorders, cancer and
gastrointestinal disorders, including peptic ulcer disease and
gastroesophageal reflux.
   4. The risks of short-term nicotine replacement therapy as an
aid to smoking cessation in healthy people are acceptable and
substantially outweighed by the risks of cigarette smoking.

   Jose Sorzano, a top Latin American affairs
aide to national security adviser Colin Powell, will leave his post
at the end of the month, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Monday.
   Sorzano, who was born in Cuba and is known for his strong
support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, declined in a telephone
interview to discuss his reasons for leaving after 16 months at the
NSC.
   But The Washington Times quoted a senior official as saying
Sorzano is leaving because deputy national security adviser John
Negroponte considered Sorzano's views to be ``too hardline'' and
``insulted him in staff meetings.''
   Sorzano was senior aide to then-United Nations Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick during President Reagan's first term.

<TEXT>
   Gov. John Sununu announced Monday he will
not seek an unprecedented fourth two-year term as New Hampshire's
chief executive.
   The announcement at a Statehouse news conference ended months of
speculation about the 48-year-old Republican's political future and
seems likely to set off a scramble in the GOP ranks.
   Sununu said he plans to return to private business to help pay
hefty tuition bills for several of his eight children. But he
wouldn't rule out taking a post in Vice President George Bush's
presidential campaign. Sununu played a key role in Bush's critical
victory in New Hampshire's leadoff presidential primary three
months ago.
   Portsmouth lawyer Paul McEachern, who lost to Sununu by eight
percentage points in 1986, appears likely to run unopposed for the
Democratic nomination.
   Former Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw has announced intentions to
run for the GOP nomination, and among others said to be interested
is Republican Rep. Judd Gregg. A half-dozen others are said to be
waiting to step in should Gregg vacate the 2nd Congressional
District seat.
   Some GOP leaders fear a primary bloodbath if Gregg leaves a seat
that has been Republican for more than 70 years _ potentially
opening the door to a Democratic victory.
   Sununu's decision also has implications for the stalled Seabrook
nuclear power plant. Sununu has been among its staunchest
supporters _ while McEachern vows never to let it open.
   A fiscally conservative governor, Sununu takes credit for
helping erase a $44 million deficit and replacing it with a surplus
under his administration. His critics accuse him of leaving too
much to communities to decide, including planning for the state's
booming growth. But Sununu has long held that the state should
offer technical assistance to cities and towns while letting them
chart their own courses.
   Sununu was a business consultant and Tufts University
engineering professor before his election as governor in 1982. He
was born in Havana, Cuba, where his father was an import-export
executive.
   He served in New Hampshire's House in 1972, then lost state
Senate bids in 1974 and 1976. In 1978, he ran unsuccessfully for
Executive Council and, in 1980, finished second in a field of 11 in
a U.S. Senate primary.
   After winning the nomination in 1982, he beat Democratic Gov.
Hugh Gallen. Sununu won re-election in 1984 by easily beating
former House Minority Leader Chris Spirou and in 1986 beat
McEachern.

<HEAD>Justice Official Remains Hopeful of Resolving Maternity Leave Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Justice Department official said Monday
he remains hopeful that a senior attorney involved in a maternity
leave dispute with the department will return to work despite her
vow not to come back.
   But Assistant Attorney General John Bolton, who heads the
department's criminal division, said a schedule cannot be arranged
until attorney Joan Bernott provides information to enable the
department to determine what duties she can perform.
   ``I said to her we will do nothing to jeopardize her health,''
said Bolton, who has offered Ms. Bernott the possibility of working
part-time.
   Bolton had ordered Ms. Bernott to return to work May 31 or
submit additional medical information from her doctor giving a
reason why her leave should be extended to mid-August.
   On May 4, Bolton rejected her request, which is supported by a
note from her doctor, to extend her leave without pay to Aug. 15.
Ms. Bernott, who went on maternity leave Jan. 25, is seeking seven
months instead of the usual three months to four months leave.
   Last week, Bolton extended her leave to May 31 pending receipt
of more information from her doctor.
   But Ms. Bernott said Monday she'll probably get fired.
   ``I'm not going to go back against my doctor's advice and my own
best judgment,'' she said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program. ``I
think I'll be AWOL, which will subject me to disciplinary
proceedings and discharge.''
   Bolton refused to speculate on what steps may be taken if Ms.
Bernott fails to return to work, but he said he remains hopeful she
will comply with the request for additional medical information.
   Ms. Bernott, 42, obtained a letter from her physician, Dr.
Sandra M. Chase, on March 28 saying she needed an additional four
months of recuperation from a difficult pregnancy.
   ``Return to work now, in my opinion, represents health risk to
this patient,'' the doctor said in a follow-up April 26 letter
submitted as a result of Bolton's request for more information.
   Ms. Bernott charged in the interview that Bolton has made
accusations and threats beyond his request for additional
information from her doctors.
   ``He is holding three letters from two of my physicians. And he
hasn't just denied my request for leave, he has issued reprisals
against me, accused me of fraud, asked me to sign waivers of
confidentiality of all my medical records,'' Ms. Bernott said. ``He
has demanded that my physicians answer 27 questions _ probing
details of their opinion and my medical condition.
   ``He has canceled a reassignment that had been arranged for me
about a year ago and has been in the works since then,'' she said.
   Bolton said the queries are consistent with information the
department normally requests in considering all any extended leave
request from an employee, including maternity leave.
   He also said he has left the door open on the subject of her
reassignment in the divison.
   Ms. Bernott, who has three children, was the department's lead
attorney in successfully defending the government against
litigation surrounding the use of the defoliant Agent Orange during
the Vietnam War.
   Bolton said the civil division faces an enormous workload and
that it was vital that its 25 senior attorney positions _ one of
which is held by Ms. Bernott _ be staffed fully.

<TEXT>
   Opposition spokesman said the last of
those arrested during a May 5 raid on steel plant strikers were
released from jail Monday.
   Among those freed was Janusz Onyszkiewicz, national spokesman
for the outlawed independent labor union federation Solidarity. He
was sentenced May 7 to six weeks in prison on charges of spreading
false information intended to incite unrest.
   He said in a telephone interview from his home that he was given
no explanation of the release and was told to appear for an appeal
hearing Thursday.
   Also released were six members of the strike committee at the
Nowa Huta steelworks in southern Poland, who were charged with
leading an illegal strike, and five people held on lesser charges,
said Zygmunt Lenyk, an opposition activist in Krakow.
   Police arrested 38 people during the raid May 5 on the Lenin
steelworks at Nowa Huta, outside Krakow. The others were freed
earlier.
   There was no official announcement of the releases. Telephone
calls to government offices were not answered Monday evening.
   After the end of a strike led by Solidarity at the Lenin
shipyard in Gdansk last week, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said
authorities planned a ``non-repressive policy'' toward strikers.
   The strikes at Nowa Huta and Gdansk were the longest of five
that occurred between April 25 and May 10 in Poland's worst labor
unrest since Solidarity was suppressed and outlawed after the
declaration of martial law Dec. 13, 1981.
   Krakow's Roman Catholic archbishop, Franciszek Macharski, met
with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak last week. Opposition
sources said he requested the release of the men arrested at Nowa
Huta.
   Onyszkiewicz said he understood he was free only pending the
appeal.
   He was sentenced in connection with interviews he gave to
Western broadcast stations, including the British Broadcasting
Corp., Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.
   Bogdan Lis, Solidarity leader in the Gdansk region, was
sentenced May 6 to three months in prison on charges of calling the
Gdansk shipyard strike. His brother Waldemar said he remained in
jail pending appeal.
   The sentences given Lis and Onyszkiewicz were the harshest
imposed on prominent Solidarity figures since a political amnesty
in 1986.
   Workers at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk ended their work
stoppage May 10, when Solidarity founder Lech Walesa led about
1,000 strikers out of the yard without a settlement. Solidarity was
born at the shipyard in August 1980.
   Authorities have taken no action against the shipyard strikers
so far.

   President Reagan told a group of American and

   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, greeted about 50 students gathered

   The president noted that the young members of the organization
known as Direct Connection had held a summit meeting recently in
Helsinki, Finland, and that they had taken positions on several
issues.
   ``You agreed to a set of resolutions on ways to develop better
communication and understanding, to protect the envirionment and to
press for increased cooperation between our countries,'' he said.
   ``Now I hope to expand our cooperative exchanges with the Soviet
Union to increase the cultural, educational and people-to-people
contacts, like yours, that are indispensable,'' Reagan said. ``And
I want you to know that I'll read your proposal carefully and take
it to heart as I leave for Moscow for my next meeting'' with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he said.
   The members of the Direct Connection group held a youth summit
in Helsinki last week, then traveled to Moscow where they met with
Gorbachev and other Soviet officials.

   Pat Robertson formally suspended his
moribund presidential campaign Monday, applauding runaway victor
George Bush but saying he was not ready to hand over his relative
handful of Republican convention delegates.
   The former television evangelist said he would return to the
Christian Broadcasting Network, which has suffered in his absence,
and would establish a new Christian political action committee.
   Asked about his own political future, he said, ``That remains a
moot question until the 1988 election. I hope Mr. Bush is elected
and then re-elected again in 1992.''
   The high point of the Robertson campaign came early, in the Feb.
8 caucuses in Iowa where he finished ahead of Bush in second place
behind Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   When it came to open primaries, Robertson's relatively small but
committed ``invisible army'' was less effective. He finished last
in New Hampshire on Feb. 16, third in South Carolina March 5, and
then was trounced in the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries in which
he had hoped to do well ``in my backyard.''
   Voters in his home state of Virginia placed him a distant third
behind Bush and Dole on Super Tuesday.
   Following the March 15 Illinois primary, in which he got less
than 10 percent of the vote, he scaled back his campaign to
concentrate only on caucus states. He talked less about being
president and more about being the conservative voice that would
speak for a conservative platform. But he kept his formal candidacy
alive long after any chance of winning was gone.
   ``I will work to ensure that the 1988 platform follows closely
the conservative principles of our 1984 platform,'' he said Monday.
That platform called for prayer in school, opposed abortion and
supported ``family values.''
   ``I call upon my friends and supporters to continue their
splendid efforts, because our struggle is not finished, it is just
beginning,'' Robertson told reporters outside his home on the CBN
University campus. He was accompanied by his wife Dede and son Tim.
   ``I suspend my candidacy ... but I do not now nor will I ever
suspend my advocacy of conservative and moral principles,'' said
Robertson, who campaigned in 34 states and won 46 delegates after
spending $22 million. Bush has more than 1,300 delegates.
   ``I will take my delegates to New Orleans,'' Robertson said.
   His new political action committee, Americans for the Republic,
will support and train conservative Christian candidates and will
be staffed by Robertson campaign workers.
   Another task Robertson faces is shoring up the ailing CBN, which
has faced a big decrease in revenues since Robertson left the air
last fall to begin his campaign. The network laid off 645 employees
last year.
   ``After today, I hope we never again have to lay off people,''
Robertson said of a new round of layoffs on Monday. He declined to
say how many employees were let go.
   Robertson will replace his son as CBN's chief executive officer.
   During the presidential race, Robertson frequently criticized
Bush, even suggesting that the vice president's campaign had
engineered the timing of the Jimmy Swaggart scandal to detract from
Robertson. But he said Monday, ``George Bush has won the
nomination. I applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse his
candidacy.''
   Robertson's campaign was marked by striking charges, including:
   _That there are Russian nuclear missiles in Cuba, an allegation
the Reagan administration as well as Fidel Castro denied.
   _That the State Department ignored intelligence gathered by CBN
people in Beirut about the location of hostages, an allegation that
brought public skepticism from President Reagan.
   Robertson's campaign specialized in mobilizing political
neophytes from charismatic and fundamentalist churches to take over
local party operations.
   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _
running for president,'' Robertson told a Denver congregation
Easter Sunday. ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a
foundation for a great victory for this nation. It may not be in
1988 ... but I am not going to quit. That is his plan for me and
for this nation.''

<TEXT>
   The once widely used Copper-7
intrauterine contraceptive device was back on trial Monday, and
plaintiffs' attorneys said they were armed with internal documents
never before used against the G.D. Searle & Co. product.
   The Minneapolis law firm Robins, Zelle, Larson & Kaplan, which
represented plaintiffs in earlier litigation against Dalkon Shield
maker A.H. Robins Co., settling 198 cases for a total of $38
million, also is representing the plaintiffs in the case against
Searle.
   Robins Zelle, which is representing more than 30 other women in
separate Copper-7 lawsuits, has said evidence introduced in the
firm's first trial against Searle is expected to set a foundation
for lawsuits to come.
   U.S. District Judge Robert G. Renner questioned potential jurors
Monday to hear the suit brought by Esther R. Kociemba, 29, of the
Melrose area northwest of here, and her husband, William. Opening
arguments were planned Tuesday.
   While 17 other cases involving the Copper-7 nationwide have gone
to trial, attorney Roger P. Brosnahan has said his law firm will
introduce internal company documents not used in those trials.
Those documents, he said, will show that Searle marketed the IUDs
without regard for women's health and safety.
   Searle, which won 14 of the earlier cases, has denied that its
IUD caused any injury to the women. One of the cases lost by Searle
is on appeal.
   When they filed the suit in October 1984, the Kociembas asked
for $500,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive
damages, plus court costs, for injuries Mrs. Kociemba allegedly
suffered as a result of using a Copper-7 IUD for just under 1{
years in 1977 and 1978. The couple later amended their lawsuit to
ask for an unspecified amount.
   According to the suit, Mrs. Kociemba has experienced
infertility, illnesses, ``great pain, suffering and mental
anguish'' that have continued since she had the IUD removed in
November 1978.
   More than a dozen attorneys for Robins Zelle have been going
through documents involved in the Searle IUD cases for more than
three years in preparation for the trial, Brosnahan said.
   ``We have gone through some 500,000 or more documents,'' he said.
   In addition, the law firm began taking the depositions of Searle
employees, former employees, outside testing groups and expert
witnesses named on Searle's behalf about 2{ years ago, he said.
   ``There have been 60 or 70 of those depositions, which consume
about 15,000 pages of transcript,'' Brosnahan said. ``Very few of
the documents and none of the deposition testimony was ever used in
the previous trials.
   ``So, in our judgment, it will be the first real trial involving
the Copper-7,'' he said.
   Spokeswoman Kay Bruno at Searle headquarters in Skokie, Ill.,
disputed that, saying Searle doesn't view the suit as much
different from earlier suits brought against the company. Many of
the documents have been used in previous court cases, she said.
   Searle withdrew the Copper-7 and its other IUD, the TATUM-T,
from the U.S. market and stopped manufacturing the two items in
January 1986, citing the cost of litigation and the unavailability
of liability insurance. However, the IUDs still are available in
foreign countries.
   Bruno said more than 800 lawsuits involving the IUD have been
filed against Searle. Of those, many have been settled out of
court. She said about 500 suits still are pending against the
company.
   The Copper-7, a small device made of plastic and copper, was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1974 and
Searle sold between 300,000 and 400,000 IUDs in the United States
annually before withdrawing the product from the U.S. market.
   In the Kociemba Copper-7 trial, Brosnahan said Robins Zelle
attorneys believe they can establish through the testimony of
Searle employees and former employees and through the company's
internal documents that Searle was not honest with physicians or
the public about potential problems related to the Copper-7.
   ``We think the evidence will clearly show that the company was
not telling the doctors or the women what they knew and, in fact,
were telling them things that were contrary to what they knew or
had every good reason to know,'' he said.

   The World Bank announced new programs Monday
to aid women in eight countries where male interests traditionally
dominate.
   The countries are Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, India, Bangladesh,
Pakistan. Morocco and Mexico.
   ``You will see pathfinding investments on behalf of women in a
wide range of activities _ in education generally, in both formal
and informal training for employment, in agricultural extension and
financing, in health and family planning services and in
environmental protection,'' said Barber B. Conable, president of
the World Bank.
   The bank is the chief source of aid to nearly 120 Third World
countries. It makes loans of $17 billion a year and is planning an
increase to well beyond the $20 billion level in the 1990s. The
United States is the largest shareholder, joined in contributions
by more than 30 others.
   Conable said there will be added support for women in other
countries as well as the eight singled out.
   He was speaking to the Overseas Education Fund of the League of
Women Voters. It gave him and his wife, Charlotte, an award in
recognition of help to women in poor countries.
   ``What you will see, and what I hope you will take part in, is a
determined drive not just to overcome discrimination and the
poverty it reinforces but to put women at the forefront of the
fight against poverty in the developing world,'' he said.
   He saw a change in policies toward women in the Third World.
   ``In access to education, to credit, to basic health services,
we are in the midst of a revolution, but one that still leaves
women too far behind,'' Conable said.
   ``So the revolution we must continue is the one that closes the
gap between men and women in the Third World by creating
opportunities for both sexes.''
   Help for women in the Third World has been the subject of a
clash between the Reagan administration and some members of
Congress. A bill supported by Democratic legislators would order
the U.S. Agency for International Development to make sure its
training programs abroad enroll as many women as men.
   AID Administrator Alan M. Woods opposes the bill on the ground
that it would hamper his agency's programs in countries that
traditionally deny many rights to women.

<HEAD>Five Gang Slayings Over Weekend Includes Mother Arrested In Death
Of Son</HEAD>

   A teen-ager told his mother, ``I'm a Crip and
nobody messes with me,'' just before she stabbed him to death
during an argument over less than $100, police said Monday.
   The killing was one of five gang-linked deaths over the weekend
despite 125 arrests by a 200-officer anti-gang task force. The
deaths pushed last week's countywide gang-related death toll to 10,
and increased the 1988 total to 123.
   Sammie McGee, 37, told police she stabbed her son, Bluefus
Davis, 18, in the heart with a steak knife Saturday night after an
argument over money loaned him on Mother's Day, said police Sgt.
Jon Rygh.
   Ms. McGee remained in custody on Monday, booked for
investigation of murder, said Detective Steven Hooks. He confirmed
her son's statement about being a member of the Crips, a notorious
Los Angeles street gang.
   The amount of money the two were arguing over ``is varying back
and forth, depending on who we talk to,'' Hooks said. ``It was
probably under $100 and over $50. There is no exact amount.''
   Hooks said Davis did not live with his mother. ``From the
indications we have, he just pretty much came over and started
arguing,'' said Hooks. Detectives were still trying Monday to find
out what the loan was about.
   ``We're still trying to sort through it. It's not a clear cut
case,'' he said. Prosecutors ave until Wednesday to decide whether
to file charges.
   ``You get mad enough to think you want to kill your kids, but to
actually do it _ that's something else,'' said police Sgt. Alfonso
Rodriguez.
   ``She nailed him,'' Rodrugues said. ``It wasn't just to scare
him _ somebody will do that when they're mad, scratch his arm or
something. But this was once right in the vital area.''

   A dozen ministers backed by a gospel
choir and soloists bade farewell to transplant patient Tabatha
Nicole Foster on Monday, urging those who followed the child's
struggle to consider the love she had for life.
   Attendants waved fans to revive several people in the
congregation of about 300 during the emotional service for the
toddler who had been the longest Survivor of a five-organ
transplant when she died Wednesday.
   The Rev. Robert L. Cottoner, pastor of the family's Oak Grove
Baptist Church here, based a eulogy on 1 Corinthians, Chapter 13:
   ``So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of
these is love.''
   ``Keep the faith, hold on to the hope, but love will bear every
burden,'' Cottoner said as members of the congregation clapped and
shouted: ``That's all right. Yes sir.''
   ``You'll find that faith testifies, hope pacifies but love
satisfies,'' Cottoner said. The service was held at First Baptist
Church moved from Oak Grove, where Tabatha's mother, Sandra Foster,
was choir director, to accommodate more guests.
   Family members and friends later placed flowers atop the child's
small, white casket before the burial.
   The 3-year-old died at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh after
an infection caused her heart, kidneys and liver to fail, hospital
officials said. The toddler, born with an intestinal deformity,
received the transplant during a 15-hour experimental operation
that ended Nov. 1.
   Contributors from across the country, including President Reagan
and singer Frank Sinatra, gave more than $300,000 to help the
family pay medical bills.
   The Rev. Sue Corlett, chaplain at Kosair Children's Hospital in
Louisville while Tabatha was treated there, attended the service
along with six nurses who had cared for the child.
   ``This is real difficult for us to see her dead because she was
always so alive,'' Corlett said. ``There are 90- and 100-year-old
people who didn't live as much as she did.''
   ``She touched everyone that got involved,'' Beverly Brangers, a
nurse at Kosair, said as she wiped tears from her eyes at the
cemetery. ``You couldn't help but love her.''
   Cottoner urged the congregation not to mourn for the girl.
   ``This is a time for rejoicing. After all the things she's
endured, she's resting peacefully,'' the minister said. ``It's time
for us to rejoice that another of God's children has been called
from labor to refreshment.''
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, preoccupied by a church bus crash that
killed 27 people outside Carrollton during the weekend, sent a
representative and a message to the family.
   ``Seldom has such a young life had such a mighty impact on a
state and a nation,'' the statement said. ``Tabatha fought a strong
and cheerful battle on behalf of us all.''

<HEAD>Protesters in Clown Masks Disrupt AIDS Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gay protesters wearing clown masks disrupted a
tense Civil Rights Commission hearing Monday on AIDS, calling the
session a farce and a waste of money that could have been better
spent on drug research.
   The protesters, about 65 members of a New York group called the
AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT UP), disrupted the meeting for
nearly an hour with humming, heckling and symbolic gestures such as
turning their backs on the commission and holding up their watches
to signify that ``time is running out'' for AIDS victims.
   The hearing, the first of three, was part of a controversial
Civil Rights Commission study of ``civil rights aspects of public
health policies and initiatives to control AIDS,'' including a
discussion of how AIDS is transmitted.
   The study has drawn fire from lawmakers and others since it was
proposed last year in a memo that, among other things, cites state
anti-sodomy laws and a court case in the same footnote as lengthy
Biblical condemnations of homosexuality.
   ``Do you still want us put to death, Clarence?'' one protester
demanded of commission chairman Clarence Pendleton, referring to a
passage from Leviticus recommending just that.
   ``It's a waste of time!'' another protester shouted.
   ``Spend the money on drug research!'' added a third.
   They all filed out, wearing their clown masks, chanting ``Shame!
Shame! Shame!''
   ``This is a total farce,'' said Duncan Osborne, a protester.
``These people ought to be taking testimony about discrimination
against people with AIDS.'' He said only three victims were
scheduled to testify in three full days of hearings.
   The protest came after a morning session dominated by friction
among commission members as well as among witnesses on the first
panel.
   Those witnesses included a blood bank official; a gay rights
activist; a religious hospice operator who said he had moved ``away
from the narcissism and contempt of my earlier life'' as a
homosexual; and a University of Minnesota radiologist who claimed
public health efforts have been thwarted by gay pressure groups.
   ``Twenty-five years ago it was Southern bullies in jeans that we
had to fight,'' said Dr. David Pence, the radiologist, a veteran of
the civil rights movement. ``Now it's Northern smoothies in ties
who use middle class conventions to prevent us from using public
health measures to protect the urban poor.''
   ``He has just likened us ... to the Ku Klux Klan,'' exploded
Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force. He said he could not continue to sit at the same table
as Pence unless the doctor apologized or retracted his statement.
   ``I will not withdraw my basic thesis,'' Pence replied. ``The
gay pressure groups have stopped us from using an effective public
health policy and they've done it in the name of civil rights. ...
The road to Selma did not lead to the right to sodomy. ... The
freedom train has been hijacked.''
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said public health officials had not been
influenced by any lobbying groups in determining AIDS policy or
interpreting AIDS research.
   ``It is totally preposterous to even imagine that any scientist
I know ... would take a stand on how the virus is transmitted based
on pressure,'' Fauci said. ``The evidence is overwhelming.''
   Levi said the gay community had never stood in the way of
measures to stop AIDS. ``It is our own lives that we are saving,''
he said.
   He said gay people support anonymous, voluntary testing but they
fear that if anyone knows they are AIDS victims or carriers, they
will face discrimination in jobs, housing, insurance and other
areas _ and maybe even prosecution for violating sodomy laws.
   He urged the commission to recommend extending protection of the
handicapped to the private sector and to support laws barring
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
   Discussion at the hearing ranged far and wide, with Pence
claiming that ``sexual addicts ... people who engage in compulsive
coital behavior outside of marriage'' need as much rehabilitation
as drug addicts.
   Bills barring discrimination against AIDS victims are pending in
both House and Senate committees. The presidential commission on
AIDS, charged with developing a national AIDS policy, was
conducting three days of hearings this week on the same days and
the same subject as the Civil Rights Commission hearings.

<HEAD>Jackson Picks Team of Insiders For Convention Organization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson will rely
on a team of Democratic Party insiders this summer to run his
convention operation, headed by former party official and civil
rights attorney Ron Brown.
   Brown, as Jackson's manager at the July convention in Atlanta,
will oversee the campaign's efforts on the standing committees, the
party platform and rules, an area where campaign officials have
hinted Jackson might orchestrate a challenge.
   Jackson has assembled an experienced convention crew that also
includes: Ann Lewis, a former Democratic National Committee
political director who has been advising the Jackson campaign;
Eleanor Holmes Norton, former chairwoman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission; attorney Harold Ickes, an expert on rules;
and John O'Leary, a logistics whiz and campaign veteran who was the
hall manager at the 1984 Democratic convention.
   Jackson campaign coordinator Yolanda Carroway, also a former DNC
official, will work directly under Brown. Brown was deputy chairman
of the DNC from 1981 to 1985, and worked for Sen. Edward Kennedy's
presidential campaign in 1980.
   Carroway said former DNC Chairman John White also will advise
Jackson at the convention.
   DNC spokesman Mike McCurry said party officials are viewing the
appointment of Brown as a good sign because of his strong links to
the party and knowledge of the establishment ropes.
   ``They're playing real good ball right now ... they're keeping
lines open with the party,'' McCurry said.
   ``It helps to have people that have been on the inside,'' said
Carroway, acknowledging that the convention team was selected with
party connections in mind.
   Asked if Jackson picked a convention team to send a message that
he will be conciliatory rather than confrontational at the
convention, Carroway said, ``I'm sure that was considered.''
   Some in the party have been concerned that Jackson might force a
rift at the convention, especially in light of his recent
insistence on ``fairness'' in the allocation of the so-called
``super delegates.'' Those individuals, who are delegates by virtue
of their elected or party offices, are free to vote for the
candidate of their choice, but Jackson says they should line up
proportionately to the popular vote.
   Carroway said Monday that the campaign has not yet decided
whether to mount a challenge on seating of delegates, but that
``it's being talked about.''
   Lewis will oversee Jackson's involvement with the standing
committees, Norton will be the campaign's representative on the
Platform Committee, and Ickes will focus on rules. O'Leary will
handle the physical and logistical arrangements.

   Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has three
musicals currently running on Broadway, received the first Triple
Play Award from the American Society of Composers, Author and
Publishers on Monday.
   Morton Gould, president of ASCAP, which licenses Lloyd Webber's
music in America, said it's the first such award because Lloyd
Webber is the first composer with three ``blockbuster hits''
simultaneously on Broadway.
   The shows _ ``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``The Phantom of
the Opera'' _ are all also running on the London stage.
   ``It is a wonderful honor for me as an English composer to be
honored by the American society,'' Lloyd Webber said.
   Lloyd Webber was accompanied to the Triple Play luncheon by his
wife, soprano Sarah Brightman, object of the Phantom's affection in
``The Phantom of the Opera.''

   Government forces on Monday bombarded
lookout towers in the Golden Temple with incendiary bombs and fired
machine guns to try to dislodge dozens of radical Sikhs.
   Police said more than 50 militants remained in the compound,
which has been surrounded by more than 2,800 police and troopers
for a week. The 400-year-old temple is the Sikh religion's holiest
shrine and center of a violent campaign for a separate Sikh nation
in Punjab state.
   At least 35 people, most of them Sikh militants, have been
killed.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, 42 people were killed in attacks by Sikh
extremists in different attacks in a 24-hour period, United News of
India reported.
   A paramilitary officer involved in the Golden Temple siege said,
``We will have to starve them out or think of other alternatives. I
think we will be here for quite some time.''
   He spoke with reporters while seven of the 146 Sikhs who
surrendered Sunday appealed to their comrades to give up.
   ``Please come out with your hands up,'' Skatter Singh said
through a loudspeaker. ``The officers are good to us. None of us
has been troubled.''
   Sporadic gunfire was the only response from militants inside the
20-foot-high walls.
   Skatter Singh belongs to the Khalistan Commando Force, one of
several Sikh separatist groups with offices in the Golden Temple
compound. Khalistan is what the Sikhs would call their nation.
   The seven made their appeals during two pauses in army firing at
two 18th century brick towers in the compound.
   At dusk, a new saffron-colored Khalistan flag fluttered from the
window of one soot-covered clock tower at the northern entrance to
the temple complex.
   On Monday evening, commandoes of the Black Cat anti-terrorist
squad were seen moving into a dining hall in front of the towers.
   Sources said an underground passage links the dining hall and
towers. They said about five militants were thought to be in the
basement of the towers.
   United News of India gave this report of the killings by Sikh
extremists in Punjab Sunday night and Monday:
   Gunmen opened fire on crowds in Samana town, killing 18 people
and wounding 18. In Samrai village, five people were shot to death.
   Sikh terrorists in a car fired at a doctor's clinic in Mukerian
town, killing a 2-month-old child and another person. The owner of
the clinic, Dr. Kewal Krishan, was wounded.
   At least 17 other people were killed in scattered attacks in the
northern state.
   The deaths raised the number of people killed in attacks blamed
on Sikh radicals to at least 1,002 this year. Most of the victims
were Hindus but some were Sikh moderates.
   Sarabjeet Singh, deputy police commissioner in Amritsar, said at
least 40 Sikh radicals were in the Golden Temple's inner sanctum,
which is surrounded by a vast pool and approachable only by a
marble walkway.
   ``We do not want to hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community by
doing anything that might harm the Harimandir Sahib (inner
sanctum),'' said Chaman Lal, inspector general of police in Punjab
state. ``But at the same time, we are trying to convey to them (the
militants) that we mean business.''
   Devout Sikhs would view any attempt to storm the inner sanctum
as desecration.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent the army into the Golden
Temple in 1984 to drive out Sikh extremists and was assassinated by
Sikh bodyguards five months later. More than 1,200 people were
killed in the assault.
   Militants have fought a terrorist war since 1982 for a Sikh
nation.
   Sikhs make up only 2 percent of India's 800 million people and
claim discrimination by Hindus, who account for 82 percent. Sikhs
are a majority in Punjab state.
   K.P.S. Gill, police chief of Punjab, told a news conference
Monday that 146 people surrendered Sunday, not 151 as another
official reported earlier.
   Gill said 17 had been freed, one committed suicide and 128 were
held on charges ranging from waging war against the state to
illegal possession of arms.

<HEAD>Financial Report Offers Some Details of Reagans' Inheritance,
Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan inherited at least $170,000 in
securities and trust assets from her mother, Edith Luckett Davis,
who died last year, it was disclosed Monday.
   A financial disclosure report filed on behalf of the first lady
and President Reagan itemized their assets in general terms. It
also showed the Reagans accepted gifts last year valued at nearly
$4,000.
   The document said Mrs. Reagan received $85,000 worth of Federal
Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp. securities and $50,000 in U.S.
Treasury notes last year.
   The assets were inherited by Mrs. Reagan from her mother, said
White House spokesman B.J. Cooper.
   In addition, she received a 50 percent interest in a trust fund
that had been set up for her mother by her husband, the late Loyal
Davis. The other half went to her brother, Dr. Richard Davis.
   The trust fund was valued at between $70,000 and $165,000,
meaning that Mrs. Reagan's share was between $35,000 and $82,500.
   The form also showed that Mrs. Reagan purchased $15,000 worth of
debt-obligation bonds in an oil and gas enterprise, Tosco Corp.,
but it was unclear whether that was part of the first lady's
inheritance.
   Apart from her inheritance, Mrs. Reagan bought $50,000 in
California state general obligation bonds, rolling over the
proceeds from state bonds that had matured last year.
   For the most part, the precise value of the Reagans' assets was
not disclosed. The reporting form listed broad categories of
amounts, such as $1,001 to $5,000, and at the highest level, above
$250,000.
   The president's 688-acre ranch near Santa Barbara, purchased in
1974 for $526,000 with $127,000 in improvements eight years later,
was listed in the highest category.
   Likewise, it was impossible to determine the value of the blind
trust that holds the bulk of Reagan's investments. It, too, was
listed as being valued at more than $250,000.
   The report showed that the president holds four life insurance
policies, the largest being worth no more than $100,000 and the
smallest worth up to $5,000. Two other polices are valued at up to
$15,000.
   In terms of gifts, Mrs. Reagan accepted an engraved crystal bowl
valued at $1,585 from the American Association of Neurological
Surgeons, and a wool shawl and leather gloves, valued at $360, from
Bernard Arnault of Paris, the chairman of the board of Christian
Dior.
   Reagan received gold cuff links valued at $800 from Beverly
Hills jeweler Marvin Hime, who made identical sets for the
president and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The president also accepted a $745 harrow, a farm implement,
from four close friends, Mr. and Mrs. Earle Jorgensen and Mr. and
Mrs. William Wilson, and a workbench valued at $337 from another
friend, Mrs. Henry Salvatori.
   A silver and bronze statuette, valued at $150, was accepted from
Italian President Giovanni Spadolini.

<HEAD>Bill Introducted To Warn of Cigarette Addiction in Wake of Koop
Report</HEAD>

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's declaration
Monday that nicotine is addictive like heroin and cocaine prompted
quick introduction of legislation to require new warnings on
cigarette packages.
   It also set off a groundswell of support from health and
anti-smoking groups and a firestorm of protest from the tobacco
industry.
   Koop, at the start of a 618-page report that was no surprise to
researchers, said, ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear
that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. An
extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in
tobacco that causes addiction.
   ``Moreover, the processes that determine tobacco addiction are
similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin
and cocaine,'' Koop wrote.
   Those three sentences in the report's preface not only summed up
the document's essential conclusion, they tacticly acknowledged
that the report was based more on a review of existing research
rather than on new scientific findings.
   It was on that ground _ that the report did not represent new
clinical research _ that the opponents based their main attack.
   ``What I think we have to do and understand is to put it in its
political context,'' said Reggie Lester, a spokesman for the
Tobacco Growers Information Committee in North Carolina, the state
that produces 67 percent of the U.S. tobacco crop.
   ``This is not a scientific report,'' he said. ``All this is a
compilation of recent literature ... but they will be able to use
it in a political context like they did with the report ... about
environmental tobacco smoke.''
   Lester referred to Koop's December 1986 report that concluded
non-smokers' health was harmed by smoke from other people's
cigarettes and gave impetus to widespread and still growing efforts
to restrict cigarette smoking in the workplace and public areas.
   Two weeks ago federal legislation went into effect banning
smoking on commercial airline flights of two hours or less duration.
   ``This report and the surgeon general's findings should compel
federal and state authorities to treat tobacco as the addictivve
drug that it is,'' said Dr. Alan R. Nelson, chairman of the board
of trustees of the American Medical Association.
   John Banzhaf, a George Washington University law professor who
also heads the anti-smoking activist group called Action on Smoking
and Health, predicted Koop's report would strengthen ``a key legal
argument for plaintiffs in law suits in which cigarette
manufacturers argue that smokers should not be permitted to recover
damages because they smoked of their own free will rather than
because of an addiction.''
   The most direct call to action in Monday's report was for new
cigarette warning labels saying nicotine is addictive.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., introducted a bill that would add a
new label to the four already alternating on cigarette packs. It
would read: ``WARNING: Smoking is addictive. Once you start, you
may not be able to stop.''
   Koop said he would like to see such a warning say nicotine is
``just as addictive as heroin or cocaine.''
   The surgeon general said he was under no illusion that tobacco
will ever be outlawed in the United States, but said: ``We need to
do all we can to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids,
banning vending machine sales, banning free samples, requiring a
license (to sell tobacco) and so forth. Forty-three of our states
do have laws that should protect children, but they are very poorly
enforced, if at all. I think we need a license to sell tobacco just
the way we require one to sell alcohol.''
   Asked if he was concerned that equating nicotine with addicting,
illicit drugs might ``trivialize'' the much-publicized war on
drugs, Koop cited federal statistics that tobacco use results in an
estimated 320,000 premature deaths per year in the United States
compared with 125,000 for alcohol, 4,000 from alcohol in
combination with other drugs, 4,000 from opioid (or heroin-like
drugs) and 2,000 from cocaine.
   ``I don't see there's any way you could consider the (nicotine)
problems that we have as trivializing other problems,'' he said.
   Koop also was asked about whether his report might create more
antagonism between smokers and non-smokers.
   ``I think it would mean in general more sympathy for the person
who can't quit,'' he said. ``You might get annoyed at people who
smoke in your presense and make your eyes burn and your sinuses
clog up and so forth, but your anger has to be abated by the fact
that these people are addicted to a drug and I think this will make
people more tolerant of the problems a smoker faces when he is
trying to quit.''
   The Tobacco Institute said ``Smoking is truly a personal choice
which can be stopped if and when a person decides to do so. The
surgeon general's own Public Health Service figures indicate that
about 40 million Americans are former smokers and that 95 percent
of them quit smoking without help. These figures, and common sense,
contradict any claim that smoking is an `addiction.'''

<HEAD>Philippine Defense Chief Urges Accelerated Military Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippine Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos
asked the Reagan administration Monday to accelerate military aid
to his country but avoided any discussion about the fate of U.S.
bases there, Pentagon officials said Monday.
   Ramos met for several hours with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   According to one official who attended the meetings, Ramos
offered ``an in-depth report on some of the gains made by the
(Philippine) military and some of the problems they still face'' in
fighting communist insurgents.
   ``It was kind of a report card, with a request to accelerate the
military aid that has already been promised,'' added the source,
who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified. ``He
didn't raise the issue of the (U.S.) bases. He said that was a
matter for the appointed negotiators and not him.''
   U.S. and Philippine teams are now meeting in Manila to review
agreements allowing U.S. military bases in the country. Philippine
officials have talked about huge increases in what the United
States pays for use of the bases _ now about $180 million a year.
   The Pentagon official said Ramos had specifically asked that
efforts be quickened to supply his army with 20 armed observation
helicopters, already promised by the administration.
   ``He also asked to accelerate funds for military education,''
the source said.
   Ramos ``discussed his budget problems, his equipment problems
and the restructuring of the military'' in the wake of various coup
attempts against Philippines President Corazon Aquino, a second
official said.
   ``He expressed his thanks for the military assistance given over
the past year and asked for continued support,'' the official said.
   Ramos, a West Point graduate who became authoritarian ruler
Ferdinand Marcos' No. 2 military commander and then helped lead the
February 1986 revolution that overthrew him, is making a 10-day
visit to the United States that includes meetings with Carlucci,
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, other officials and members of
Congress.
   His message, according to Philippine government spokesman Ben
David, is that his country cannot overcome the communist threat
with military force alone but still needs more military aid.
   ``We are now on the upgrade. We have gotten out of the very deep
hole where we found ourselves in February 1986,'' Ramos told a
mostly Filipino-American gathering Saturday night in the Washington
area.
   But he said the country still faces serious problems, including
poverty, social injustice, the need for land reform and better
education.
   Ramos said new reforms and the failure of communist-supported
candidates in elections have helped limit growth of the insurgency
that arose during Marcos' 20-year rule.
   But he said the communist rebels are still a significant force,
with up to 23,000 fighters, about two-thirds of whom are armed. He
said that number has changed little since President Corazon Aquino
came to power.

was chosen Monday as best new play of the 1987-88 theater season by
the New York Drama Critics Circle.
   ``The Road to Mecca'' by South African playwright Athol Fugard
was picked as best foreign play, while ``Into the Woods,'' a fairy

   Top U.S. and Soviet experts on African affairs
will meet in Portugal on Wednesday to prepare for discussions
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
southern African issues later this month, an administration
official said Monday.
   The American delegation will be led by Assistant Secretary of
State Chester A. Crocker and the Soviet side will be headed by
Anatoly Adamishin, a deputy foreign minister.
   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said they expect
southern African issues to be thoroughly discussed at the summit
meeting in Moscow in two weeks.
   Moscow and Washington have been supporting opposite sides in
Angola's 13-year-old civil war.
   The administration has been seeking a negotiated settlement that
will lead to both a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and
independence and black majority rule in neighboring Namibia,
administered by South Africa.
   Crocker and Adamishin discussed the southern African question
last month in London before an unprecedented four-way meeting
involving officials from the United States, South Africa, Angola
and Cuba.

<HEAD>Top High School Students Urged To Stump for Education Back Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. exhorted 20 of
the nation's top high school seniors Monday to ``stir 'em up'' back
home on behalf of education spending and opportunity for all
children.
   Weicker, R-Conn., said neither the Reagan administration,
Congress nor the public at large was sufficiently committed to
education.
   Addressing an awards luncheon for USA Today's All-USA Academic
First Team, Weicker charged that none of the current presidential
candidates has made education a cornerstone of his campaign,
despite ``a few perfunctory statements'' by Vice President George
Bush about wanting to be ``the education president.''
   ``I certainly welcome that within my own party. It will be the
first one in a long time,'' the maverick Republican said.
   ``Those of you that are the winners, do me a favor when you get
back home. Stir 'em up. Stir 'em up. Tell 'em, `Whatever
opportunity has been given me isn't shared by that much of the
nation.' Make certain that all of our children have that special
education ... that brings opportunity,'' Weicker said.
   ``You ask that candidate that stands up, `Are you for
education?' And don't be satisfied when that candidate says, `I'm
for education.' Are you willing to pay for that education?''
Weicker said.
   ``It's easy to be against drugs, and it's easy to be for
education. It's not so easy to pay for the war on drugs or pay for
education,'' Weicker said.
   The All-USA team was chosen by a panel of 10 educators from more
than 900 students nominated by their high school principals. The
contest, in its second year, is co-sponsored by the National
Education Association and the National Association of Secondary
School Principals.
   The winners, all seniors, were 10 boys and 10 girls with average
grades of 3.97 on a scale of 4.0, and average scores of 1,413 on
the Scholastic Aptitude Test and 31.3 on the American College Test.
   For most, their accomplishments outside the classroom, recited
by USA Today Editor John C. Quinn at a banquet at the newspaper's
headquarters, were as formidable as their grades.
   The winners were:
   _Pamela Abshire of Salem (Va.) High School, a licensed pilot who
has conducted research on how plants develop immunity from crown
gull tumor.
   _Deborah Cheng of Rolla (Mo.) Senior High School, who has
studied the effects of heavy salts on plants and microorganisms.
   _Charles Doran of Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Md., who
developed a new concept in statistical math.
   _Nathan Gilliland of Northwest High School in Omaha, Neb., who
will present his paper on the human immune system at a meeting of
the International Association of Pathologists.
   _Tracy Goldsmith of Falmouth (Mass.) High School, whose study on
the water supply in her hometown has influenced local planning.
   _Jonathan Gross of Miami (Fla.) Killian High School, who has
studied the effects of amino acid on liver cancer at the University
of Miami.
   _Katrin Jellema of Grand Haven (Mich.) High School, who has
designed museum exhibits on mastadon bones from the ice age.
   _David Kaufman of Altoona (Pa.) Area High School, who has
developed an original algebraic formula.
   _Alice Kim of Pittsford-Mendon High School in Pittsford, N.Y., a
concert pianist who has performed with the Rochester Philarmonic.
   _John Miller of Salesianum School in Wilmington, Del., who has
done research for the National Weather Service on calibration of
visibility sensors.
   _Beth Noveck, of Lakewood Prep in Howell, N.J., who is teaching
Russian to her Chinese teacher and who also speaks French, German
and Hebrew.
   _Jennifer Patience of Thousand Oaks (Calif.) High School, who
invented a machine that translates computer text into Braille for
her blind uncle.
   _Erik Phelps of Durand (Ill.) High School, who designed an
inventory tracking system for video rental stores and developed a
computerized editing system for the Catholic newspaper that employs
his father.
   _Marybeth Rizzo of Upper Arlington High School in Columbus,
Ohio, who built a mechanical hand for amputees that combines a hook
with a prosthetic.
   _Derek Walker of Benjamin Mays Academy of Science in Atlanta,
who built a rover that can pick up objects for the handicapped.
   _Rebecca Walkowitz of Stuyvesant High School in New York, who
has traveled to Tokyo, testified before Congress and interviewed
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in her role as senior
editor of Children's Express.

conducted research into how aging affects the human digestive
process.

<HEAD>Proposal Allowing Death Penalty for Drug Dealers Still Under
Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, trying to wrap up work on a
Pentagon budget bill, refused Monday to eliminate a proposal
permitting the death penalty for drug dealers who are convicted of
killing people.
   The Senate voted 68-27 not to table, and thus kill, the death
penalty proposal offered by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   ``The American people are entitled to this protection,'' said
D'Amato. ``I think we have to find a clearer message for those who
deal in drugs. ... The death-dealing drug lords fear no one.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and other opponents noted that
D'Amato's amendment had nothing specifically to do with the
Pentagon budget and should be considered in another forum. Senate
rules do not require that amendments be germane to pending
legislation.
   But Levin also opposed the amendment because he said studies
have shown that people sometimes are wrongly convicted of crimes.
   ``The main reason I'm opposed to capital punishment is that you
cannot correct your mistakes,'' Levin said. ``Time and time again,
we've found that we've convicted the wrong man.''
   Levin's unsuccessful move to kill D'Amato's amendment left the
D'Amato plan in limbo. It has not been adopted and thus is still
one of the unresolved issues as the Senate tries to finish work on
the Pentagon bill.
   Opponents of D'Amato's plan have threatened to filibuster his
amendment in an effort to prevent a vote on it.
   The Senate is tentatively scheduled to take a final vote Tuesday
morning on the bill, which authorizes $299.5 billion in Pentagon
spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Senate passage of the Pentagon budget would send it to a
House-Senate conference committee, where it would have to be
reconciled with the separate defense budget approved last week by
that chamber.
   The House bill does not contain any provisions similar to
D'Amato's death penalty plan and addition of the proposal could
hold up final action on the Pentagon budget for months, said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``We won't be able to get a defense bill with this amendment on
it,'' said Nunn, adding that he supported the amendment.
   He explained that addition of the D'Amato amendment would mean
that a conference committee would have to involve the House
Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over such legislation
in that chamber. That committee opposes the plan.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas responded that ``50
percent of the American people list drugs as the number one
problem. ... They don't care about our little jurisdictional
disputes.''
   D'Amato first offered his proposal last week, shortly after the
Senate voted overwhelmingly to grant new powers to the military to
enter the fight against illegal drug trafficking.
   D'Amato said, ``I am not suggesting this idea is a panacea,''
but he noted, ``I think it will help.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., echoed Levin's opposition, noting that
``our history has a number of instances where innocent persons have
been executed. ... I suggest this is not the way to go.''
   In other decisions Monday, the Senate:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Voted 63-30 to table, and thus kill, an amendment by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., which said the United States could not follow the
terms of the agreement in which the Soviet Union agreed to pull
troops out of Afghanistan unless President Reagan sent the
agreement to the Senate as a formal treaty.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   GARBAGE
   
   The court ruled today that Americans have no right of privacy to
their garbage once it's put out for collection.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices reinstated drug-dealing charges
against two California residents. Police discovered evidence of
narcotics in their garbage.
   ``The police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes
from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by
any member of the public,'' said Justice Byron R. White for the
court.
   The case is California vs. Greenwood, 86-684.
   
   ABORTION
   
   The court let stand a ruling that pregnant prison inmates have
the right to free abortions if they cannot afford them.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by
prison officials in Monmouth County, N.J., that no such right
exists if an abortion is unnecessary to preserve an inmate's life
or health.
   The case is Lazaro vs. Monmouth County Correctional Institution
Inmates, 87-1431.
   
   PRE-SENTENCE REPORTS
   
   The court ruled that federal prisoners are entitled to inspect
substantial portions of their pre-sentence investigative reports
prepared by the government.
   The 5-3 ruling in two cases from California was labeled ``a
bombshell'' by dissenters who said it may trigger a flood of new
requests for government reports under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   The case is U.S. vs. Julian, 86-1357.
   
   INSURANCE COMPANY JUDGMENT
   
   The court upheld a $1.8 million judgment against an insurance
company ordered to pay the money to an injured Mississippi man
whose $20,000 claim it wrongfully rejected.
   But in one of the most closely watched cases of the year, the
justices declined to decide the constitutionality of such enormous
punitive damage awards in personal injury cases.
   The court, in a ruling based on procedural grounds, said the
issue was not properly presented in the case.
   The case is Bankers Life vs. Crenshaw, 85-1765.
   
   ANTITRUST AWARD
   
   The court, in a ruling it acknowledged could make doctors
reluctant to serve on ``peer review'' panels, restored an Astoria,
Ore., surgeon's $2.2 million antitrust award against fellow doctors
in his city.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said a federal appeals court
wrongly wiped out Dr. Timothy A. Patrick's victory.
   The case is Patrick vs. Burget, 86-1145.
   
   OIL TAXES
   
   The court agreed, in an important case for state treasuries,
whether New Jersey unfairly is forcing 13 major oil companies to
pay millions of dollars in taxes.
   The court said it will review a ruling that allows New Jersey
officials to deny state tax deductions for what the companies pay
in federal windfall profits taxes.
   The cases are Amerada Hess vs. Division of Taxation, 87-453, and
Texaco vs. Division of Taxation, 87-464.
   
   PELTON
   
   The court let stand the espionage conviction of a U.S. spy
agency employee who sold surveillance secrets to Soviet agents.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that Ronald
W. Pelton was denied a fair trial when convicted of selling
classified information about his agency's electronic eavesdropping
programs.
   The case is Pelton vs. U.S., 87-6433.
   
   SCIENTOLOGY
   
   The court let stand rulings that denied the Church of
Scientology of California federal tax-exempt status for three years.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that, among
other things, stripping the church of its tax exemption for the
years 1970-72, ``threatens the rights of all churches to
proselytize through the sale of religious literature.''
   The case is Church of Scientology of California vs. IRS, 87-1377.

   The Supreme Court, which two years ago
included three millionaires among its members, apparently has just
one remaining _ Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The court's newest member, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, fell
short of millionaire status. He listed assets in 1987 at somewhere
between $348,000 and $920,000.
   Kennedy joined the court earlier this year.
   According to financial disclosure reports released in compliance
with the Ethics in Government Act, O'Connor listed her net worth
for 1987 as at least $1.3 million.
   The law requires only broad ranges of value for the reporting of
assets. It does not require that any asset worth less than $1,000
be listed, nor the value of personal property items and the
official's primary residence.
   O'Connor listed assets for herself and her husband, attorney
John O'Connor, worth between $1.3 million and $2.3 million or more
in 1987. For 1986, she had listed family assets worth between
$913,000 and $1.9 million.
   Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and former Justice Lewis
F. Powell, a pair of millionaires, retired during the past two
years.
   Among the more noteworthy information included in this year's
disclosure forms:
   _Justice Antonin Scalia received $12,000 in honoria as payment
for speaking to various organizations. He also earned $13,500 from
Louisiana State University and $1,300 from Tulane University for
summer teaching jobs. Scalia also received a gift, a $350 pair of
cowboy boots, for serving as a B'Nai B'rith dinner speaker in
Albuquerque, N.M.
   _Justice William J. Brennan received a $3,500 advance from a
book publisher for a compilation of his speeches that is in the
works.
   _Justice Thurgood Marshall, as he has in past years, swore that
his only asset is a savings account worth between $15,000 and
$50,000.
   The court's eight associate justices are paid $110,000 a year.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's annual salary is $115,000.
   Here are the listed 1987 assets of the court's members:
   _Rehnquist, $136,000 to $380,000, up from the $116,000 to
$210,000 listed for 1986.
   _O'Connor, $1.3 million to $2.3 million or more, up from
$913,000 to $1.9 million.
   _Scalia, $65,000 to $150,000, down from $120,000 to $285,000.
   _Kennedy, $348,000 to $920,000.
   _Brennan, $141,000 to $485,000, up from $120,000 to $395,000.
   _Marshall, $15,000 to $50,000, unchanged.
   _Justice John Paul Stevens, $177,000 to $385,000, up from
$50,000 to $165,000.
   _Justice Harry A. Blackmun, $225,000 to $680,000, up from
$195,000 to $645,000.
   _Justice Byron R. White, $145,000 to $250,000 or more, up from
the $20,000 to $60,000 listed for 1986. White's listed assets for
1985 were between $145,000 and $400,000.

<HEAD>Democrats Get the Aquarians While More Libras Lean to GOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aquarians tend to consider themselves Democrats
and Libras are more likely than others to lean toward the
Republican Party _ but don't tell the plurality of Americans who
reject astrology.
   The latest entry in the political debate over the influence of
the stars comes courtesy of Public Opinion magazine, a bimonthly
publication of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
Research in Washington.
   Picking up on the discussion sparked by disclosures that
astrological considerations have played a role in President
Reagan's schedule, Public Opinion compiled data from past polls
including these tidbits:
   _Democrats drew 47 percent of Aquarians but just 32 percent of
Libras in surveys done from 1985-87 by the National Opinion
Research Center.
   _Another 32 percent of Libras considered themselves Republicans,
but only 28 percent of Aquarians and just 25 percent of
Sagittarians backed the GOP.
   _Their sign aside, 47 percent of adults polled by the Roper
Organization in 1985 said they did not believe in astrology. Thirty
percent weren't sure, while 23 percent believed in the influence of
the stars.
   Public Opinion figured the breakdown of party identification
according to astrological sign by separating the Democrats,
Republicans and independents by birth date.
   Why bother? ``Because we never miss an opportunity to get Public
Opinion magazine's name in the press,'' said Graham Hueber, the
assistant editor.

requiring operators of city transit buses and subways to be subject
to a broad range of drug tests, including random tests, a senior
department official said Monday.
   Alfred DelliBovi, head of the Urban Mass Transportation
Administration, said local transit officials who fail to develop a
testing program for drugs would face the loss of federal transit
subsidies.
   The federal regulations that are being prepared call on transit
officials to test for illegal use of drugs during pre-employment,
after an accident, for reasonable cause and under a random
selection process, according to DelliBovi.
   Operators of buses and subway trains as well as others in
``sensitive'' jobs such as train dispatchers would be subject to
the testing, he said.
   The federal agency which DelliBovi heads provides federal
financial assistance to transit systems, although a testing program
would have to be imposed and administered by the local transit
authorities.
   DelliBovi outlined his agency's plans in a speech before the
American Public Transit Association's annual education conference.
   He noted a recent finding by investigators in the April 6 crash
of a commuter train in New York city in which traces of illegal
drugs were found in five employees involved in the accident,
including the train's engineer and the dispatcher.
   ``Similar horror stories may have occurred in your own area,''
DelliBovi told the transit officials in St. Louis, according to a
copy of his speech released through his office in Washington.
   DelliBovi criticized the transit industry for not tackling the
drug testing issue. Instead, he said, the industry has been
``debating the merits of permitting passengers to smoke in the back
of the trains.''
   The recent New York accident ``is only the current victim of an
industry-wide failure to tackle the tough issue of random (drug)
testing,'' he said. ``All too often, this reluctance to take on
such a distasteful issue produces an ineffective (anti-drug)
program instead of a steadfast policy.''
   DelliBovi gave no timetable on when the federal drug testing
requirements would be announced formally or go into effect. But he
said they will require that local transit authorities
``aggressively enforce'' them or face the loss of federal financial
assistance.

<HEAD>Ringworm Discovered in Two BLM Corrals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ringworm has been diagnosed in about 800
horses owned by the Bureau of Land Management at two corrals in
Nevada and Nebraska, the bureau said Monday.
   The contagious but treatable fungus disease was found in about
700 horses at contractor-operated corrals at Lovelock, Nev., and as
many as 100 more at Bloomfield, Neb., bureau spokesman Tim Locke
said.
   Each corral holds about 2,700 horses, Locke said. Together they
hold the major portion of the 8,600 horses the bureau has rounded
up from public lands in the West. The BLM is trying to find
suitable owners to adopt the horses.
   The bureau has continued to transfer horses from its corrals,
``But I can assure you unequivocally that none has been moved
without the veterinarian's OK,'' Locke said. Bureau policy is that
no horses are moved without a vet's approval ``and our policy is
being followed,'' he said.
   The bureau, he said, notified the Agriculture Department's
veterinarians for Nevada, and was advised by veterinarian Ron
Anderson ``to treat it. At this time he is not imposing a
quarantine,'' as some advocacy groups had asked.
   At Bloomfield, Locke said, ``the situation is under control.''
   Jim Clapp of Singletown, Calif., head of the Wild Horse
Sanctuary, said he saw horses with strangles, infections of the
lymph nodes, on a visit to Lovelock last week, but Locke said he
had no reports of that.

Israeli tactics for subduing West Bank unrest.</NOTE>

   Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
explored avenues for Arab-Israeli peacemaking during talks Monday
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, other government
officials and members of Congress.
   Peres went to Shultz's home for breakfast and met him again at a
luncheon hosted by Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad. Also present at
the luncheon were Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, White House
chief of staff Howard Baker and leaders of Congress.
   The State Department said it did not have any information about
the morning meeting, except that the two leaders discussed Shultz's
moribund plan for Arab-Israeli peace talks. Israeli officials said
neither Shultz nor Peres wanted to divulge details of their talks,
which were to continue Tuesday.
   At a luncheon toast, Shultz praised Peres' ``creativity'' in
seeking to advance peace talks. Shultz, who has scheduled his
fourth shuttle of the year to the Mideast next month, said Jordan
and Israel had neither rejected nor accepted his peace plan.
   Quoting a favorite Peres analogy, Shultz said the violent
situation in the region is ``like a pregnant woman _ it cannot
continue to be pregnant for long.''
   Peres, in his remarks, called on Shultz to press for acceptance
of the U.S. initiative, saying there were many obstacles in its way
``but the alternative is more serious. ... I prefer an imperfect
peace to a perfect war.''
   Peres supports the Shultz plan, but his rival in Israel's
coalition government, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, opposes the
blueprint. Jordan's King Hussein has also expressed reservations,
Syria has rejected the plan and Egypt is the only country to
support it openly.
   Peres was also meeting with members of Congress to discuss the
peace process, the five-month Palestinian rebellion in the
Israeli-occupied territories and planned U.S. arms sales to Saudi
Arabia.
   Dozens of members from both the Senate and House have expressed
reservations about the administration's plan to sell the Saudis a
$325 million support and maintenance package for electronic
surveillance AWACS planes and $200 million worth of Bradley
fighting vehicles.
   The congressmen are upset with the Saudis for their clandestine
purchase of Chinese-made intermediate range missiles, which could
hit Israel.
   Peres' meetings with Shultz and with President Reagan on
Tuesday, which are not expected to produce movement on the stalled
peace plan, are viewed by Israelis as a bid by Peres for U.S.
support in advance of Israel's fall election campaign.
   Peres, head of the Labor Party, will face off against Shamir,
leader of the right-wing Likud bloc.
   Shamir opposes the Shultz plan because it envisions oversight by
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council _
the United States, China, the Soviet Union, England and France.
Shamir fears the five powers would coerce Israel to give up Arab
lands it captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
   In another development Monday, Assistant Secretary of State for
Human Rights Richard Schifter told a Peres aide the United States
was concerned that Israel's tactics to subdue the five-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were
getting harsher, said an Israeli official.
   Schifter told Israeli Foreign Ministry Director Yossi Beilin
that ``he was concerned the exceptions were becoming the norm,''
said the official, who asked not to be named.
   Israel has repeatedly said cases of abuse against Palestinians
were unauthorized exceptions and the soldiers committing them would
be punished. Some 180 Palestinians have been killed in the rioting,
and thousands have been wounded by tear gas, clubs and bullets.
   Schifter himself declined to comment on the meeting. U.S. public
criticism of Israel's tactics has been muted, in keeping with a
belief that addressing the problem in private diplomatic contacts
is more effective.

<HEAD>Defense Names McFarlane as Unindicted Co-Conspirator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser Robert C.
McFarlane was identified Monday as an unindicted Iran-Contra
co-conspirator in Oliver L. North's motion to be tried separately
from his three co-defendants.
   The legal status of McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
charges of withholding information from Congress about secret
Reagan administration aid to Nicaraguan Contra rebels, was
mentioned in a footnote to North's request for a separate trial.
   The names of the unindicted co-conspirators in the case have
been sealed by the court.
   The defense brief, along with naming McFarlane, identifies the
other unindicted co-conspirators as Fawn Hall, North's former
secretary at the National Security Council; Joe Fernandez, a former
CIA agent also known as Tomas Castillo, and Marine Lt. Col. Robert
Earl, North's aide at the NSC.
   Hall and Earl are cooperating with the investigation by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh under grants of immunity from
prosecution.
   Neither McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, nor James Wieghart,
a spokesman for Walsh, would comment on the defense revelations.
   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, and
arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord, all asked to be tried separately on charges stemming
from their involvement in the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms-sale
profits to the Contras.
   In their motions for separate trials, the defendants said they
wanted to use the congressional testimony of their co-defendants to
prove their innocence.
   A joint trial of all four defendants would unfairly prejudice
the case against them because all the defendants, except Secord,
testified before Congress under limited grants of immunity from
prosecution, the defense said.
   ``The court must grant each defendant a separate trial to
protect both the Fifth Amendment right of defendants North,
Poindexter and Hakim to be tried before a jury that has not been
exposed to their immunized testimony or its fruits, and the Sixth
Amendment right of each defendant to use the immunized testimony of
his co-defendants and its fruits in his defense,'' North's lawyers
said in their brief.
   The lawyers for North, a former NSC aide, noted a further
complication involving McFarlane, who returned to the Iran-Contra
committee last year for additional questioning following North's
appearance.
   The defense noted that Walsh acknowledged in a staff memo last
summer that McFarlane's testimony ``was likely tainted'' because it
was given ``in direct response to Lt. Col. North's immunized
testimony.''
   ``The IC (independent counsel) has also made clear that
McFarlane, an alleged unindicted co-conspirator, will be a key
prosecution witness,'' the North brief said. ``Lt. Col. North's
co-defendants are certainly entitled to cross-examine McFarlane
about his tainted testimony.''
   McFarlane was identified in the defense brief as an unindicted
co-conspirator in the conspiracy to defraud the government count
that charges all four defendants. The brief says Ms. Hall,
Fernandez and Earl are also unindicted co-conspirators in that
count of the indictment.
   McFarlane, who resigned as national security adviser in late
1995, traveled with North to Tehran in May 1986 on a plane that
delivered spare parts for Hawk missiles. McFarlane carried a Bible
signed by President Reagan and a cake in the shape of a key that
were presented to the Iranians in the negotiations to free hostages
held in Lebanon in exchange for arms sales to Iran.
   McFarlane, who is also cooperating with Walsh's investigation,
could receive a prison sentence of up to four years and a $400,000
fine for his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges of withholding
information from various congressional committees that inquired
into covert aid to the Contras during a ban on direct U.S. military
assistance.
   In other developments in the case, the prosecution made another
stab at obtaining nearly 3,000 pages of diaries that North kept
while he was at the NSC.
   The recently retired Marine lieutenant colonel last week invoked
the Fifth Amendment when the diaries were subpoenaed by a Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee.
   Walsh, who has unsuccessfully tried to subpoena the material,
asked that they be produced as part of pre-trial discovery for
``any and all notebooks, journals or ledgers kept by the
defendants.''
   The request also included documents of financial transactions
involving a series of companies used by Hakim and Secord to broker
arms to the Iranians and to ferry materiel to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh also accused the defense of ignoring U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell's order to specifically challenge the application
of the Classified Information Procedures Act to the case.
   The law sets out procedures for disclosure of secret government
documents during a criminal trial. Walsh has amassed some 300,000
pages of classified documents in his investigation.
   Walsh contended that the defense ``did not attempt to
substantiate the specific problems'' they had identified with
complying with the law raising instead ``hypothetical and abstract
arguments'' about the law's constitutionality.

<HEAD>Politicans On Both Sides Fear Return To Sectarian War of 1970s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bloody attack on a pub
patronized by Roman Catholics inspired fear Monday among Catholic
and Protestant politicians of a return to the sectarian warfare of
the 1970s.
   The Protestant Action Force, an outlawed paramilitary group,
claimed responsibility for the lunchtime shooting Sunday at the
Avenue Pub in downtown Belfast.
   Three people were killed and six wounded in an attack
reminiscent of those in the 1970s by Protestant paramilitary gangs
that opened fire at random on Catholic-owned pubs, businesses and
homes.
   Politicians on both sides appealed for calm after Sunday's
attack.
   ``I don't want any innocent Protestants to be killed as a result
of this,'' said Patrick McBride, whose 27-year-old brother Paul was
one of the three slain Catholics.
   Brian Feeney, a city council member for the Social Democratic
and Labor Party, a moderate Catholic group, said he feared the
murders were an attempt to revive the sectarian war.
   ``There has to be a rapid and visible response from the police
to protect people from these murderous exploits,'' he said. ``The
whole object of this exercise is to instill maximum terror in the
Catholic community, drive them off the streets back into their own
ghettos.''
   Cecil Walker of the Official Unionist Party, the largest
Protestant political group, said the killers were bent on
``creating havoc and sectarian strife in the community ... creating
pandemonium and chaos.''
   Ed Maloney, a co-biographer of The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of
the hardline Protestant Democratic Unionist Party, said Protestant
paramilitary groups have targeted Catholic nationalists for 10
years but Sunday's shooting ``smacks of the early and mid-1970s, an
indiscriminate attack whose targets could only be innocent
Catholics.''
   The deaths of McBride, Damien Devlin, 24, and Stephen McGahan,
27, bring to 28 the number of civilians killed this year. At least
2,646 people have died since sectarian violence began in August
1969.
   In County Tyrone on Monday, a part-time soldier in the largely
Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment was seriously injured by a
booby-trap bomb on a farm where he worked.
   The Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to drive the
British out of predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland, claimed
responsibility. There was no indication of a connection with the
Belfast shooting.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis leads George Bush by 10
points in their likely presidential contest, in part on the
strength of voters who say the Democratic Party is better able to
handle key issues, a poll said Monday.
   The 1,382 adults interviewed in the CBS News-New York Times poll
listed drugs, unemployment and the federal deficit as the country's
most important problems, and said Democrats were better able to
handle them.
   Partly as a result, CBS News reported, 49 percent said they
would vote now for Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner, to 39
percent for Bush, who has clinched the Republican nomination. Ten
percent were undecided.
   Another new poll, by Louis Harris & Associates, gave Dukakis a
7-point lead. Such polls are not predictive of a contest so far off
as the November general election, but they can provide a general
sense of voter sympathies.
   The CBS-Times poll said 35 percent of the respondents had an
unfavorable view of Bush, to 33 percent favorable. Dukakis' rating
was better: 38 percent unfavorable, 14 percent unfavorable.
   However, Dukakis was less known; 21 percent said they had not
heard enough about him, and another 26 percent were undecided about
their opinion of him. For Bush, all but 10 percent had heard
enough, and 21 percent were undecided.
   Dukakis outscored Bush in several categories. Thirty-eight
percent though of Bush as ``too attached to special interests,'' to
only 17 percent who thought that of Dukakis.
   Fifty-five percent said they would be uneasy with Bush's
approach to a difficult international crisis; 42 percent said that
of Dukakis. Fifty-five percent said Bush was tough enough to make
hard choices, but 65 percent said that of Dukakis. And 49 percent
said Bush was ``hiding something that the public ought to know''
about the Iran-Contra affair.
   Respondents to the poll said the Republicans would be better at
dealing with the Soviets and at keeping America strong, but those
were not cited by a sizable number of responents as key issues.
   The most frequently cited issue was drugs, and a plurality of 37
percent said the Democrats were better able to handle the problem.
An even bigger share, 51 percent, said Democrats were better able
to handle unemployment.
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted by telephone with a random
nationwide sample of adults from May 9-12 and had a margin of
sampling error of 3 points.
   The Harris poll, of 2,138 voters, put the hypothetical race at
50 percent for Dukakis, 43 percent for Bush and 7 percent
undecided. That poll was done in two segments, April 1-5 and May
5-10, and also had a 3-point error margin.

   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., has been hospitalized
in New York City for treatment of a kidney stone, a spokesman said
here Monday.
   Weiss, 60, was in Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan,
according to Michael Timmeny, the congressman's administrative
assistant.
   ``They're going to try to dissolve it,'' Timmeny said of the
kidney stone. ``When is he going to be out? When it's dissolved.''
   Timmeny said he had spoken by telephone to Weiss several times
since he entered the hospital late Friday and ``he says everything
is fine.''
   Weiss, who has a history of heart problems, underwent quadruple
bypass surgery in 1986 after he collapsed at a Capitol Hill
banquet. He also underwent single bypass heart surgery in 1982.

   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, answering Jackson's contention that he is being

   PAT ROBERTSON, formally putting his presidential campaign on
hold to return to his faltering Christian Broadcasting System: ``I
suspend my candidacy ... but I do not now nor will I ever suspend
my advocacy of conservative and moral principles.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, stepping away from Reagan administration policies
on acid rain: ``With regard to acid rain, we can't study the
problem any more _ we've got to begin to take effective action.
There has to be a national commitment to continue to reduce the
emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides.''

<HEAD>Hatfield Said DOE May Have Covered Up Info on Iodine Contamination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy may have engaged in a
``cover up'' when it failed to include data on radioactive iodine
contamination in an environmental report on the Hanford nuclear
reservation, Sen. Mark Hatfield said Monday.
   Hatfield, R-Ore., said the General Accounting Office found the
department's handling of information on iodine 129 contamination in
the groundwater beneath the reservation in south central Washington
state was ``dominated by a pattern of activity that generally
discouraged disseminating the information within or outside the
agency.''
   At a news conference, Hatfield said the GAO report won't be
released until the Energy Department has had a chance to comment.
   But Hatfield said he was told in a briefing by officials of the
congressional watchdog agency that the ``pattern of activity was so
pervasive'' at DOE that the information may never have been
publicly released had not people outside the agency pursued the
issue.
   ``While the words `cover up'' were not specifically used in the
report, I don't know of a better phrase to describe the
actitvity,'' Hatfield said.
   Will Callicott, a DOE spokesman, said, ``Our own inspector
general's office has looked at this before and could find nothing
to substantiate any allegation of a cover up.''
   The environmental assessment of the Hanford reservation was
released in 1986 when Hanford was under consideration as one of
three sites for the nation's first high-level nuclear waste dump.
   Hatfield said there were indications that DOE was well aware of
the iodine contamination when it issued the environmental
assessment, though it made no mention of the problem.
   ``We do not know specifically who orchestrated this situation,
but GAO did inform us that there is no evidence to suggest that
this activity was the result of directives from the upper echelons
of DOE,'' Hatfield said. ``I suspect there were individuals who
didn't want the truth known.
   Hatfield said someone at DOE decided the information on the
iodine contamination was ``not important'' enough to include in the
environmental report. He also suggested the omission may have been
aimed at casting Hanford in a favorable light to validate the
department's selection of the reservation as a possible site for
the nuclear waste repository.
   Along with Reps. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Al Swift, D-Wash.,
Hatfield requested the GAO investigation last summer after DOE
finally released information on the iodine contamination at the
Hanford reservation.

   Three men with Lebanese passports were
caught while trying to get rid of weapons after attacks that killed
seven people and wounded 21, including three Americans, police said
Monday.
   The attacks Sunday night occurred at the Acropol Hotel and
nearby Sudan Club. Diplomats, relief workers and journalists
frequent the hotel, and the club is reserved for nationals of
Britain and Commonwealth countries.
   Sudanese sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
U.S. Embassy advised Americans not to leave their homes. American
clubs in Khartoum had been closed, they said.
   Police said the dead at the Acropol, their bodies mangled by a
bomb that blew the tin roof off the two-story building, included a
British family of four who had been in Sudan for two months, a
waiter and a Sudanese army officer.
   There was no word on the identity of the three Americans injured
at the hotel.
   ``Limbs of those who were killed ... were scattered on the floor
of the restaurant after the explosion,'' said Col. Mutasim Osman
Karim, an explosives expert.
   An unidentified foreigner died during the attack later on the
Sudan Club, said a police statement rad Monday over the
government's Radio Omdurman.
   The statement said the suspects, who carried Lebanese passports
but were dressed in the traditional white robes of the Sudanese
when captured, were identified by witnesses as participants in the
assaults.
   Passers-by helped capture the suspects outside the Sudan Club
after the attack as they ``tried to get rid of the clothes they
were disguised in,'' the statement said.
   Police said the suspects attempted to ditch submachine guns,
ammunition and other items ``that provide material evidence of
their involvement in the attacks.''
   Karim said evidence at the club indicated the terrorists used
grenades and automatic weapons in their raid there.
   The men came to Sudan masquerading as Lebanese businessmen, the
statement said. It was not announced whether they had connections
with terrorist groups or other organizations.
   Karim said the explosives appeared to be Soviet-made.
   In London, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office: ``We have
no means at the moment of knowing if it is an attack aimed at
British interests, or whether it is wider than that.'' He spoke on
condition of anonymity, in accordance with British practice.
   No motive has been advanced for the attacks, which occurred as
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi swore in a new Cabinet.
   In London, a private British relief charity, Ockenden Venture,
identifed the British family as Chris Rolfe, 35, his wife Clare,
37, and their children Thomas, 3, and Louise, 1. The charity said
the Rolfes were helping drought victims in eastern Sudan.
   A European man who said he witnessed the Acropol attack reported
the blasts blew the roof off the two-story building and smashed a
hole in the floor a yard wide.
   ``I'm angry because the ambulances weren't rushed to the scene
immediately,'' said the witness, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``I think some of the dead could have been rescued if
the ambulances had come earlier.''
   Tahnassis Pagoulapos, the Acropol's manager, said ambulances
arrived an hour after the explosions.
   The official Sudan News Agency said a large number of foreigners
and diplomats were in the hotel at the time of the blasts,
including a senior U.S. diplomat whom it did not identify.
   The news agency said two Canadians and a Dutchman also were
wounded. It did not name them or give nationalities of the other
wounded.
   Waiters at the Sudan Club said they heard an exchange of fire
near the entrance. ``All of us just went under the tables,'' said a
waiter, who did not give his name.
   Both the United States and Britain warn their citizens not to
travel in southern Sudan, where civil war has raged for five years,
and to take caution when traveling in other parts.
   An American communications technician was shot and gravely
wounded near the Libyan diplomatic mission on April 16, 1986.
   Hours earlier, U.S. jets raided Tripoli and Benghazi in what
Washington described as retribution for Libyan support of
international terrorism.
   The United States blamed Libya for the Khartoum attack, but
there were no arrests.

   Army radio canceled a scheduled live broadcast
of a concert by American folk singer Joan Baez because she included
an Israeli protest song it has banned, a station official said
Monday.
   The song ``Shooting and Crying'' was written by Israeli singer
Si Hi-man after the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied
territories began Dec. 8. It criticizes the army's use of beatings
and live ammunition to quell the violence.
   Shahar Ben Barak, head of the archives at army radio, said:
``The station is an army radio station. We can't allow her to sing
a song with a clear political line. The station has to be
objective.''
   Because the song was included in the concert, the station taped
the performance Sunday night and broadcast it later with the
controversial selection edited out.
   In an interview Monday with Israel television, Ms. Baez accused
the station of censorship. She said she decided before coming to
Israel to include the song.
   ``I had heard about the song in California and it appealed to
me: the idea that it was a rock singer, a young woman, that a song
could be that important that the army radio was going to censor
that song,'' she said. ``So naturally, that's the song that I
chose.''
   Ms. Hi-man said she wrote ``Shooting and Crying'' after hearing
of an incident Feb. 5 incident in which soldiers buried four
Palestinians alive, dumping 25 inches of earth on them after
beating them.
   The incident occured after soldiers dispersed protesters in Kfar
Salem, a village in the occupied West Bank. Fellow villagers
rescued the four men.
   One verse of the song says: ``They shoot and cry, burn and
laugh. When did they learn to bury people alive? They shoot and
cry, burn and laugh. When did they forget that our children have
also been killed?''
   Ms. Baez, who gave two concerts in Israel, said she came to the
country to learn about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   She met on Monday with Anatoly Sharansky, who spent 10 years in
a Soviet prison before being allowed to immigrate to Israel. She
also participated in a demonstration on behalf of Israeli reserve
soldiers jailed for refusing to serve in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Israeli authorities refused her request to visit Mubarak Awad, a
Palestinian-American who advocates using civil disobedience against
the Israeli occupation. He is in jail awaiting deportation to the
United States.
   Last Thursday, Ms. Baez visited the Jalazone refugee camp in the
West Bank where she sang to Palestinian children in Arabic.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis on Monday dismissed rival Jesse
Jackson's claim that he is being treated unfairly, saying ``we all
knew what we were doing and what we were running against.'' Pat
Robertson put his Republican presidential campaign on hold, bowing
to the inevitability of George Bush's nomination.
   On the eve of the Oregon primary, Jackson renewed his appeal for
fairness. At a stop in New Jersey, Jackson said he has helped elect
many congressmen by ``registering more Democrats than anybody else
in history'' and deserves a ``return on my investment.''
   ``We're not discussing generosity. We're discussing
reciprocity,'' Jackson told about 200 cheering supporters in Newark.
   But Dukakis, tending to gubernatorial business in Massachusetts,
said the preacher-turned-politician was well aware of the realities
of the Democratic nominating process.
   ``This is a campaign for delegates as well as votes,'' said
Dukakis, who expects to win the lion's share of 45 delegates at
stake in Oregon. ``We all knew what we were doing and what we were
running against.''
   Jackson has been unable to translate his popular vote support
into equivalent backing from the party leaders and politicians
known as ``super delegates.'' He trails Dukakis in The Associated
Press total delegate count _ 1,610 to 956 _ as well as the super
delegate tally _ 203 to 52.
   Jackson urged the super delegates to be fair to his candidacy
and close the gap in the delegate count.
   ``Super does not mean following the tail wind,'' he said.
``Super means bucking the head wind.''
   Front-runner Dukakis, who told New Jersey Democrats on Sunday
``I smell victory in the air,'' received some encouraging news from
a Harris poll that found him leading Bush in a trial heat of the
likely presidential contest.
   Dukakis was backed by 50 percent of the 2,138 likely voters
surveyed in telephone interviews April 1-5 and May 5-10. Bush was
favored by 43 percent of those polled and 7 percent were undecided.
The poll had a margin of error of 3 percent.
   And a CBS-New York Times poll suggested Dukakis had a 10-point
lead over Bush, 49 percent to 39 percent, with 10 percent
undecided. THe poll of 1,382 voters was conducted by telephone May
9-12, and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   Bush, who clinched the nomination with his win in the
Pennsylvania primary last month, lost his only remaining rival on
Monday as Robertson officially suspended his campaign.
   The former television evangelist said he would resume control of
his financially-troubled Christian Broadcasting Network, which he
left to run for president.
   ``Today I suspend my candidacy for the Republican nomination in
1988 but I do not now nor will I ever suspend my advocacy of
conservative and moral principles,'' Robertson told reporters near
his home on the grounds of CBN University in Virginia Beach, Va.
   ``George Bush has won the nomination. I applaud his magnificent
effort and warmly endorse his candidacy,'' he said.
   Robertson also said he filed incorporation papers for a new
political action committee, ``Americans for the Republic,'' a group
to be used as a ``rallying point for future political action.'' But
he said of his own possible bid in 1992, ``That remains a moot
question until the 1988 election. I hope Mr. Bush is elected and
then re-elected again in 1992.''
   Bush spent the day campaigning in Washington state, where he
defended himself against charges that one of his top aides was
involved in a Contra supply operation.
   ``That is old news,'' the vice president said. ``I'd hate to
think it is politically motivated material. You get sick and tired
of saying, `I've told the truth' ... You get bombarded by these
insinuations and tired stories.''
   Newsweek reported Sunday that arms dealer Richard J. Brenneke
said in a sworn deposition to a Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee that Bush's national security adviser, Donald Gregg,
was the Washington contact for the operation, known as ``Arms
Supermarket.''
   ``It's just pure unadulterated ... I have got to watch my
language,'' Bush said as he toured the Weyerhaeuser Technology
Center in Federal Way, Wash., with a Yale classmate from 1948 and a
member of his national finance committee, George Weyerhaeuser.

   India and Pakistan agreed Monday to take
steps to contain Sikh terrorism, arms smuggling and drug
trafficking along their lengthy border, according to an Indian
official.
   ``I hope our Pakistani friends can translate our hopes into
action,'' Home Secretary C.G. Somiah said. He spoke at a news
conference at the end of three days of talks with a Pakistani
delegation.
   India has accused Pakistan of training and helping Sikh
extremists who are fighting for a separate homeland in Punjab state
in northern India. Pakistan has denied the charge.
   The Pakistani delegation was led by Interior Secretary S.K.
Mahmud.
   A statement issued at the conclusion of the talks said the two
countries agreed to have joint border patrols in ``selected
sensitive areas of the Punjab sector of the India-Pakistan border.''
   It said officers from their border forces would hold joint
meetings once a month to ``effectively deal with all illegal
transborder movements.''
   India and Pakistan will assist each other in investigating drug
trafficking and arms smuggling and in handing over people to give
evidence in criminal cases, the statement said.
   ``We placed substantial evidence of different kinds of help they
(Pakistan) are rendering to terrorists in Punjab,'' said Somiah,
who headed the Indian negotiators.
   He said the evidence was based on interrogation of Sikh
militants, photographs of arms and ammunition recovered in Punjab,
and visits to Pakistan by Sikh militant leaders living in other
countries.
   ``The Pakistani delegation denied its complicity ... but they
assured us that positive action will be taken,'' Somiah said.
   He was asked if progress has been made since the last round of
talks on border cooperation were held in December 1986. Somiah said
those talks ``have not resulted in lessening of any activity.''
   Predominantly Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan have fought three
wars since 1947 when the subcontinent gained independence from
Britain. Sikhism is an offshoot of the Hindu religion.

<TEXT>
   West Germany, Britain and Italy signed
an agreement Monday to build a high-tech jet fighter.
   Spain, also a NATO member, is expected to be a fourth partner in
the $39 billion project but its parliament has not yet approved
participation.
   After the signing ceremony Britain's defense minister, George
Younger, praised plans to develop Fighter 90, a two-engine,
single-seat aircraft capable of flying in all weather conditions.
   ``It will play a key part in our continued success _ together
with our other allies _ in preventing war between East and West,''
Younger said.
   The first of 800 Fighter 90s are scheduled for service in 1996.
   Britain and West Germany each will pay about one third of the
project costs, Italy will cover 21 percent and Spain 13 percent.
Government officials in Bonn have said West Germany's share will be
about 22.5 billion marks ($13 billion).
   Rudi Walther, an opposition Social Democratic member of
Parliament, claimed the estimate was about half the true cost and
declared: ``This agreement has been signed totally on the basis of
wrong figures.''
   Friedhelm Ost, chief government spokesman, said the estimates
were worked out carefully and ``any other figures are fairy tales,
speculations and allegations.''
   Hermann Scheer, another Social Democrat in Parliament, said
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government was joining the project to win
points with industry leaders.
   ``It is apparent that political rather than military reasons
were the prime consideration in the decision to develop and produce
the Fighter 90,'' he said in a statement.

<HEAD>Black Labor Federation Calls For Work Stayaways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's largest black
labor federation on Monday called for a three-day worker stayaway
June 6-8 and for regular weekly demonstrations to protest recent
government crackdowns.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which claims 691,000
dues-paying members, said its weekend special session was ``marked
by a mood of worker militancy and anger.''
   The session, attended by 1,500 delegates, was called in response
to the government's February decision barring the federation from
taking part in political activity and banning 17 other
anti-apartheid groups from functioning in any capacity.
   Federation officials also are angered by a proposed Labor
Relations Amendment that would severely curtail unions' ability to
stage legal strikes and would make them liable for damages suffered
by a company that is the target of a strike.
   The federation statement Monday called for June 6-8 to be days
of ``peaceful demonstration.'' The federation cannot explicitly
call for a strike, but similar pleas in the past resulted in
widespread worker stayaways.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions also called for
``stepping up demonstrations in all organized factories every
Tuesday.'' The statement did not elaborate, but would appear to
call for brief weekly demonstrations or sit-down strikes.
Federation officials could not be reached by telephone for
additional comment.
   Under current law, management can fire workers even when they
are staging legal strikes. The new bill would expand the powers of
management and government to prevent or halt strikes.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Attorney Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes,
who won acquittal in oilman Cullen Davis' murder trial here 11
years ago, gave opening arguments Monday for a woman accused of
plotting to kill her boss' wife.
   Davis, a Fort Worth millionaire, was accused of killing his
stepdaughter, Andrea Wilborn. This time, Haynes represents Jane Ada
Calloway in the murder of Judy Saragusa, 39, who was shot to death
at home in Houston on Sept. 2, 1987.
   Ms. Calloway, a twice-divorced, 36-year-old and the former
executive secretary of businessman Michael Saragusa, is accused of
hiring Leon Hawkins Jr. to kill Mrs. Saragusa.
   During pretrial hearings, Saragusa admitted he had had an affair
with Ms. Callaway, but said it had ended two months before his
wife's slaying in the bedroom of the couple's mansion.
   Ms. Calloway is free on $50,000 bail and had to be ordered by a
judge to stop telephoning her ex-boss.
   After police identified a car seen leaving the murder scene as
belonging to Ms. Calloway, she said she lent her car to Michael
Richardson, the alleged middleman in the murder plot, on the night
of the shooting.
   Richardson has agreed to testify for the state under a plea
bargain in exchange for a 10-year prison term, said his attorney,
John Ackerman.
   Richardson's stepbrother, Leon Hawkins Jr., surrendered to
police two days after the shooting and was charged with capital
murder.
   Haynes said the trial ``may develop a lot more questions than
are answered,'' but said there are others who had motives to kill
Mrs. Saragusa.
   Haynes said Ms. Calloway was used by her boss to handle his
mounting personal bills and ``run them through the company,''
Quality Beverage Co. of Houston.
   Following the killing, Haynes said, her loyalty to Saragusa led
her to protect him by lying to police about her love affair with
him and about the car seen leaving the murder scene, Haynes said.
   Saragusa began the affair with Ms. Calloway and was involved in
an unhappy marriage, Haynes said, and Mrs. Saragusa was
``domineering and abrasive and created discussion in Quality
Beverage about her sexual practices which annoyed Mr. Michael
Saragusa.''
   His wife, who was contributing to Saragusa's $4 million to $5
million debt, spent most evenings with her horses and a female
friend, Haynes said.
   ``Judy spent thousands and thousands'' on her horses and
remodeling the couple's $1 million Houston home, he said.
   Ms. Calloway was portrayed in opening arguments as a capable
secretary who craved wealth and status and a ``perfect sitting
duck'' who was pursued and seduced by her unhappily married
employer, to whom she had great loyalty.
   Prosecutor Chuck Rosenthal said Ms. Calloway wanted Mrs.
Saragusa dead ``because she was covetous of her possessions and
covetous of her social position in Houston.''
   She wanted the wealth and status associated with being the wife
of a wealthy co-owner of the lucrative wholeale liquor business, he
said.
   Saragusa's finances were expected to be a principal component of
both defense and prosecution testimony, with several Houston
bankers on the witness list.
   Rosenthal charged that Ms. Calloway, who had the authority to
transfer money among Saragusa's accounts, transferred $135,000 the
month before the slaying to an account she controlled and used some
of the money to pay Hawkins.
   Haynes said that, despite a $400,000 annual salary, Saragusa
faced mounting debts and was sometimes overdrawn several thousand
dollars at the bank.
   Testimony is expected to last more than a month. State District
Judge Michael McSpadden ruled that a gag order, issued before the
trial for attorneys and witnesses, continue during court
proceedings.
   The murder case was moved here from Houston on a change of
venue, the same circumstance that brought Haynes from Fort Worth to
defend Davis in 1977.

<BYLINE>Coalition Talks Break Down, Political Crisis Deepens
^By FRANK POWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denmark's political crisis deepened
Monday when talks broke down to draw up a foreign and domestic
policy program for a new coalition government.
   Svend Jakobsen, the neutral mediator charged with sounding out
eight parties on a national program, said he could not bring enough
parties together to form a stable government and was giving up his
task.
   The impasse arose from last Tuesday's deadlocked parliamentary
election fought over Denmark's non-nuclear policy and its loyalty
to NATO.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's center-right minority coalition
kept its 70 seats in the 179-member legislature. The two-party
socialist opposition lost ground but still held 79 seats and kept
Schlueter from forming a new government. Schlueter continues as
caretaker premier.
   Jakobsen said he was reporting to Queen Margrethe II on his
three rounds of inconclusive talks. He refused to talk about future
negotiations saying, ``It's no longer my mandate.''
   Schlueter probably will seek approval to try to form a new
government.
   But Social Democratic leader Svend Auken told national
television he would propose that Niels Helveg Petersen of the
Social-Liberals, a 10-seat swing party, lead new negotiations.
   Earlier, it appeared the Social Democrats, Denmark's largest
single party, was on the verge of a coalition deal with the
Socialist People's Party, its junior partner in the opposition, and
the Social-Liberals. But their talks failed.
   The four parties in Schlueter's coalition are the Conservatives,
Liberals, Center Democrats and Christian People's Party.
   Negotiations so far have ignored the far-right Progress Party,
the only group to gain significantly in the election with a jump
from nine seats to 16.
   The political maneuvers overshadowed a security policy wrangle
that prompted Schlueter to call the early election only eight
months after the last vote.
   On April 14, the socialist opposition pushed a resolution
through parliament calling on Schlueter's government to notify
visiting warships of Denmark's peacetime ban on nuclear weapons.
   The government voted against the resolution and refused to
implement it.
   America and Britain pointed to their policies of never
confirming or denying the presence of nuclear weapons on their
warcraft.
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries were awaiting the
outcome of party negotiations to see how a new government coalition
will resolve the crisis in the alliance over Denmark's nuclear
policy.

   Jesse Jackson stepped up his appeal for
fairness from the Democratic Party on Monday and said he deserved
credit for ``registering more Democrats than anybody else in
history.''
   ``We're not discussing generosity. We're discussing
reciprocity,'' Jackson said to the cheers of about 200 supporters
at a breakfast address.
   The Democratic presidential contender spoke out against party
rules that have made his delegate total disproportionately smaller
than his share of the popular vote. He called for ``one person, one
vote,'' and asked the so-called ``super delegates'' to close the
gap in the delegate count. Jackson trails front-runner Michael
Dukakis by more than 650 delegates.
   Super delegates are elected leaders and party officials who
comprise almost a third of the number needed to win nomination at
the July convention in Atlanta. Super delegates have been moving
steadily into Dukakis' column.
   ``Super does not mean following the tail wind. Super means
bucking the head wind,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson told New Jersey campaign leaders that he has helped
elect many senators and representatives by ``registering more
Democrats than anybody else in history'' and that he deserved a
``return on my investment'' in the party.
   Jackson claims credit for registering 2 million new voters in
1984 and after, many of them black.
   He implied that his work registering voters helped elect New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a former professional basketball player
who has pledged his support for Dukakis.
   ``You don't become senator because you could shoot a basketball.
You become a senator because people invested in you,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson continued his theme of the last several days for
``reciprocity'' from the party, but said his appeal for fairness
was not a veiled threat.
   ``My focus now is not to be accusatory, but to make our basic
appeal, which is one of reasonable expecations: fairness,'' Jackson
said at a news conference after his speech.
   Later, Jackson flew to Oregon to make a primary-eve appeal for
votes. There are 45 delegates at stake in the state's primary on
Tuesday.
   ``I want to win in Oregon on tomorrow and take that momentum to
California, debate Bush three times, and send Reagan and Bush out
of Washington on the same plane,'' he said at an airport rally in
Eugene.
   ``If I make the most sense to you, vote for me,'' Jackson urged
the crowd. ``If I win, you win.''

   Investigators ruled out arson as
the cause of a major fire at the 13th-century Kransberg Castle, the
wartime headquarters of Nazi air force chief Hermann Goering,
officials said Monday.
   The castle is now used as a school for U.S. Army noncommissioned
officers.
   Friday night a fire started in the attic and was contained to
one wing, said Sgt. Glenda Taylor, spokeswoman for the 5th Army
Corps in nearby Frankfurt.
   She said about $600,000 in damage was caused, but there were no
injuries.
   No one was in the castle at the time, but U.S. soldiers were on
the castle grounds at Usingen, 18 miles north of Frankfurt, and
called German firemen, she said.
   Capt. Robert Jones, another 5th Corps spokesman, said
investigators ruled out arson. ``Preliminary reports suggest it was
an electrical fire,'' he said. ``The wiring in the castle dates
back to the 1930s.''
   Jones said West German authorities were still investigating.
   Goering had his World War II headquarters and residence at the
castle.
   U.S. occupation forces took it over in 1945 and it was used as a
temporary Allied jail for Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler's architect
and armaments chief, and other captured German officials before
their war crimes trials in Nuremberg.
   In 1946, Goering committed suicide inside his Nuremberg jail
cell two hours before he was to be hanged as a war criminal.

<HEAD>North African Neighbors Re-Establish Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RABAT, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morocco and Algeria announced on Monday
they have restored diplomatic ties and said they want to resolve
the Western Sahara dispute that has separated them for 12 years.
   A joint statement issued in Rabat and Algiers said relations
were being re-established immediately at the ambassadorial level.
   It noted the action followed meetings over the past week in the
two capitals.
   The North African neighbors severed diplomatic ties on March 7,
1976, after Algeria recognized the Western Sahara as the Western
Saharan Democratic Republic. Morocco had annexed the territory, the
former Spanish Sahara, in 1975.
   Algeria has sheltered and backed Polisario Front guerrillas
fighting Morocco for independence of the Western Sahara.
   The joint statement said re-establishment of ties was aimed at
contributing to the construction of the Arab Maghreb, a unified
North Africa, and at endorsing the United Nations' effort to hold a
referendum on self-determination in the disputed territory.
   It said the referendum could offer a ``just and definitive
solution.''
   The announcement precedes a scheduled June 7 Arab summit meeting
in Algiers to discuss the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   It said Morocca and Algeria have a ``firm wish to contribute to
the strengthening of Arab ranks around the sacred cause of the
Palestinian people by reinforcing their heroic uprising in the
occupied territories.''
   Fighting between the Polisario guerrillas and Moroccan soldiers
has at times brought Morocco and Algeria to the brink of war.

<HEAD>Weekend Nets Five Boats in Zero Tolerance Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five boats, including the yacht that once carried
former presidential candidate Gary Hart and model Donna Rice, were
confiscated during weekend enforcement of the ``Zero Tolerance''
drug policy, the Coast Guard said.
   About a quarter-ounce of marijuana was found in two garments on
the Monkey Business, and the largest amount of contraband found on
any of the other boats was two marijuana cigarettes, the Coast
Guard said.
   No arrests were made in the seizures by the 7th Coast Guard
District, which extends south from North Carolina to include the
Caribbean Sea and eastern Gulf of Mexico. The names of people
connected with the boats were not released by the Coast Guard.
   The Kick n Back, a Chris Craft boarded in Lake Worth Inlet late
Friday, was seized after one gram of marijuana was found in a
plastic bag in plain sight, according to a Coast Guard statement.
   The Monkey Business, a $2,500-a-day, 82-foot charter yacht, was
boarded about 22 miles northwest of the Bahamian island of Bimini.
   The boat, estimated to be worth more than $1 million, was bound
back to Miami when it was seized at 10:30 a.m. Saturday with three
men and one woman aboard. The owner was not among them.
   At 4 p.m. Sunday, the Mercator, carrying four people, was
boarded 90 miles southwest of Key West. It was taken for one-tenth
of an ounce of pot found on board, the Coast Guard said.
   Late Sunday afternoon, a Coast Guard boarding party confiscated
a 26-foot open fishing boat 15 miles east of Fort Lauderdale after
half a gram of marijuana was found on board. The boat had two
people on board, the Coast Guard said.
   In the final weekend seizure, the Skyliner, was carrying seven
people when it was seized 30 miles south of Savanah, Ga., at 9 p.m.
Sunday. A boarding party found two joints on the boat, officials
said.
   The Zero Tolerance program is a two-month-old federal policy
that allows the government to seize any boat, plane, car or other
means by which any measurable amount of an illegal drug is
conveyed. The government can auction the property and keep the
profits unless its owners prove they have no connection to the
marijuana.

<TEXT>
   Syria massed troops and tanks Monday for
a push into Beirut's southern slums after Shiite Moslem militias
defied a cease-fire order from the Syrian army and dueled with
howitzers, mortars and rocket launchers.
   There was no word on when the Syrians would enter. Lebanese army
sources said the Syrians were taking their time in hopes the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which controls nearly all the slums, could
be persuaded not to resist.
   Police said the Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
Syrian-backed Amal militias fought through the day in the enclave
where 18 Western hostages, including nine Americans, are believed
held by pro-Iranian extremists.
   They said Amal, driven to the slum fringes in 11 days of combat,
made a counterattack Monday that forced Hezbollah to retreat in the
Shiyah neighborhood.
   ``It's a significant development but not enough to turn the
tables on the victorious Hezbollah,'' said a police offical, who
spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with regulations.
``Only the Syrians can crush Hezbollah.''
   Police said 14 people were killed and 120 wounded in fighting
Sunday and Monday, raising the toll to 225 dead and 706 wounded
since fighting for control of the 16 square miles of slums began
May 6.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by kidnappeers linked to
Hezbollah, and the United States indicated Monday it would be
willing to talk with the captors.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked about reports
that the hostages had been moved from the slums, said: ``I don't
have anything to say about their whereabouts. We would only be
concerned obviously if this kind of fighting were to endanger the
hostages.''
   He said Washington was pleased by a call from the spiritual
guide of Hezbollah, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, for
negotiations about the hostages and said: ``We will talk to anyone,
to any group, to any government, about the well-being and release
of the Americans still held hostage in Lebanon.''
   In Beirut, the Iranian Embassy repeated its denial of a report
by the Voice of Lebanon, a Christian radio station, that most of
the hostages had been moved to the embassy grounds outside the
battle zone.
   Syrian commanders deployed thousands of soldiers and hundreds of
armored vehicles at the gateways to the labyrinthine slums beside
the Beirut airport.
   Mem and machines began massing two days ago under Brig. Gen. Ali
Deeb and Brig. Gen. Hisham Moalla, said to be Syria's toughest
generals.
   They commanded crackdowns on fundamentalist Moslems in the Hama,
Syria, in 1981 in which up to 30,000 people were reported killed,
and in north Lebanon's port of Tripoli in 1985.
   Deeb and Moalla had two armored brigades entrenched in sand
dunes around the airport Monday with their artillery and tank
cannons trained on the slums.
   The Syrians also want the predominantly Shiite 6th Brigade of
the Lebanese army to go in with them to minimize the risk of coming
under Hezbollah fire, the sources said.
   ``If there is a chance of confrontation, then the Syrians will
change their tactics. They will level the slums with artillery
before moving in,'' one military source said. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The sources estimated the Syrian buildup at about 7,500 soldiers
and 500 tanks and armored vehicles.
   Syria's military intelligence chief, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan,
ordered Hezbollah and Amal to lay down their arms, warning: ``Our
forces will shoot without hesitation at any gunman in the street or
in buildings. Your lives will be spared if you comply.''
   Amal's leader, Nabih Berri, who is also Lebanon's justice
minister, has declared support for a Syrian entry into the slums.
   Radio stations said he had decided to disband his 6,000-strong
militia in the suburbs and neighboring west Beirut, saying: ``No
gunmen should be allowed to remain in the suburbs and Beirut, now
that a legitimate force is taking charge of security.''
   Fadlallah said Sunday that ``all the suburbs will be destroyed
if the Syrians attempt to enter by force.''
   That would sharpen the strain on an alliance between Syria and
Iran, which has been imperiled by Hezbollah's efforts to dominate
the 1.2 million Shiites in Lebanon.
   The Syrians have 25,000 troops based in northern and eastern
Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   They also deployed 7,500 troops in west Beirut in February 1987
to curb three years of militia violence.
   But in an apparent effort to avoid a collision with Iran, the
Syrians did not venture into the slums then.
   Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, was in
Damascus on Monday for talks with Syrian officials on the Lebanon
crisis, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported in a dispatch
that was monitored in Cyprus.
   Besharati later went to Beirut and met separately with Fadlallah
and Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, head of the supreme Shiite
council, the sect's highest religious body, in the presence of
Iran's ambassadors to Syria and Lebanon.
   A statement from the Iranian Embassy said Besharati was trying
to resurrect a four-man committee representing the presidents of
Iran and Syria as well as Amal and Hezbollah to end the slums war.

<HEAD>S.F. Mayor Seeks New Plan To Base USS Missouri; Navy Secretary
Says No</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of San Francisco asked the Navy on
Monday to revise its plans for basing the battleship Missouri in
his city, but the civilian head of the service later rejected the
idea.
   Navy Secretary William Ball told Mayor Art Agnos that he expects
the city to fulfill commitments made last year to help pay for
dredging and facilities for the battleship, or else the Missouri
and its battle group won't be coming to the city, a Navy spokesman
said late Monday.
   Cmdr. Jeff Zakem, the spokesman, released a statement saying:
``The fulfillment by the city and county of San Francisco of the
commitments in the memorandum of understanding was necessary in
order to proceed with the Navy's plan for homeporting a battleship
battle group in San Francisco.
   ``Secretary Ball advised the mayor of his disappointment that
the agreement negotiated in August 1987 would not be honored by the
city. In the Navy's view, the terms of the memorandum of
understanding with the city were such that San Francisco and the
bay area would have received substantial economic benefits from
homeporting ....''
   Agnos told reporters Monday he would like to see the Navy base
the huge battleship itself at some other nearby port while placing
the smaller escorts at a rebuilt Hunters Point shipyard as
originally planned.
   The smaller warships would not require the extensive dredging
needed for the battleship, easing environmental concerns, the mayor
said.
   Moreover, the city would like the Navy to renegotiate the
memorandum of understanding so that a more balanced mix of
industry, office and residential buildings can be developed at
Hunters Point.
   The Navy has balked at that idea, saying the activation of a
naval station there for the Missouri battle group would not allow
civilian businesses to stay but that the city would benefit through
the creation of new jobs and economic activity to support the fleet.
   Pentagon officials who asked not to be named said Monday the
proposal by Agnos might kill for good the assignment of a
battleship battle group to San Francisco.
   But Reps. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
endorsed the mayor's efforts, saying the Navy should consider a
compromise.
   ``I want to commend him for taking a positive approach,'' Boxer
said in an interview Monday.
   ``He's not anti-Navy, as some people have suggested,'' Pelosi
said. ``We want Hunters Point to be developed in an environmentally
sound manner.''
   Agnos assumed office on Jan. 8, replacing Dianne Feinstein, who
had been a strong proponent of basing the ship in San Francisco.
   The Navy originally planned to get the Missouri in San Francisco
by 1990. That schedule has slipped because of congressional budget
cuts. At the same time, the Navy has been waiting to see whether
Agnos would honor the earlier memorandum.
   Beyond the extra dredging required for a battleship, Agnos said
the Navy's original plan would force the eviction of 200 small
businesses with 1,000 employees and payrolls totaling $20 million.
   A Pentagon source said Monday he wasn't sure the service would
be interested in renegotiating last year's agreement to accommodate
Agnos.
   ``San Francisco signed an agreement with the Navy; we didn't
force them to do that,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Yale Releases Previously Unavailable Performances of Clarinetist</HEAD>

   The keepers of clarinetist Benny Goodman's
musical legacy on Monday unveiled a trove of performances by the
King of Swing not previously available to collectors.
   A lilting, playful, swinging version of ``Sweet Georgia Brown,''
driven by Goodman's clarinet and spiced with a Zoot Sims saxophone
solo, reverberated through a conference room of the Yale Club.
   The number was the first cut in a 50-minute recording released
by Yale University and Musicmasters at a news conference in the
club.
   Before now, that performance had been heard only by diners at
the Rainbow Grill in Rockefeller Center in June 1967. It was part
of 400 unreleased tapes Goodman bequeathed to Yale when he died two
years ago.
   Yale music professor Harold E. Samuel said the new album is a
sampler of the tapes in the Goodman archive. Future releases will
be devoted wholly to particular playing dates or recording sessions.
   Samuel described the performances as ``a more spontaneous,
relaxed Benny Goodman than you would find on many of his other
recordings.''
   Selections on the record include ``If I Had You'' from a 1955
gig at Basin Street East in 1955, ``Poor Butterfly'' at the 1958
Brussels World Fair and ``Cherokee,'' taped at Park Recording Co.
in 1958 but never released.
   The album closes with a Fletcher Henderson arrangement of ``Blue
Room,'' performed by a Goodman band that included drummer Louie
Bellson and trumpeter Randy Sandke.
   ``I never stop being thrilled by this music,'' said Goodman's
daughter, Rachel Edelson, who said she wants to make new
generations aware of ``the scope of his contributions to the field
of music.''
   ``My children, at age 8 and 4, are learning it very very well,''
she said. ``Sometimes they complain about listening to it all the
time, but I want them to know it, and I play it nonstop.''
   She said that except for a scene in the 1938 movie ``Hollywood
Hotel,'' no film exists of the quartet composed of Goodman, drummer
Gene Krupa, pianist Teddy Wilson and vibraphonist Lionel Hampton,
because moviemakers then would not show black and white players
together.
   ``I knew about my father being the first white musician to have
hired blacks, but I simply had not been aware of the level of
resistance that he met and that he simply didn't care about,'' Mrs.
Edelson said.
   Royalties from the new releases will pay the cost of maintaining
the Goodman archive, which, in addition to the tapes, contain 1,500
arrangements, 5,000 photographs, scrapbooks and other memorabilia.
Goodman died in 1986.
   Yale already has cataloged and indexed the arrangements, which
Samuel said will be ``a boon to performers and scholars for
generations to come.''
   Preserving the tapes, dating from the 1950s, has been the first
order of business, Samuel said. Most of the 1950s tapes are acetate
and must preserved on sturdier digital stock.
   ``There might be only one playing left on some of the acetates,
and that one playing has to be a transfer onto more permanent
material,'' he said.
   Identifying the performances and choosing the best for
commercial release is being done by Loren Schoenberg, an authority
on Goodman's work.
   ``Goodman was a fantastic perfectionist, and we have an
obligation to him not to release anything that he would not have
released himself,'' said Samuel.
   The albums are being marketed in the three popular formats _
long playing record, tape cassette and compact disc.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III fired the
Justice Department's chief spokesman for allegedly not defending
him aggressively enough, and the head of Meese's speech-writing
unit then abruptly handed in his resignation Monday.
   In a letter, Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said he
had been relieved of his duties Friday and that he had defended
Meese ``to the best of my ability,'' while ``exercising good
judgment and acting in a manner consistent with the obligations of
this office.''
   ``You have concluded that my efforts have not sufficed,''
Eastland wrote the attorney general, who had appointed him public
affairs director in April 1985.
   In explaining Eastland's dismissal, Meese told reporters,
``Basically I decided this was a good time for a change in
leadership. This was a matter basically of my determination that
for the rest of the year we could use some new leadership and he
was agreeable to that.''
   At a news conference, Eastland said he felt ``no anger at all''
toward the attorney general, that he had no indication before late
last week that Meese was displeased with his work and that Meese
made no suggestion of moving Eastland to another job in the
department.
   Eastland said that with Meese under criminal investigation for
the past year, ``it would be difficult for me to be as aggressive
as he might like.''
   Independent counsel James McKay is expected to issue a report
raising numerous questions about Meese's ethical behavior, sources
familiar with the probe have said, and ``someone like me could not
be indifferent to what might be contained or flow from the
independent counsel's report,'' said Eastland.
   Meese immediately replaced Eastland with his No. 2 spokesman,
Patrick Korten, who told reporters he intends ``to be very
aggressive about every part of the job.''
   Meese's ``ethical conduct has been entirely aboveboard,'' said
Korten. ``I think he's a very ethical man. I think he's a very
moral man.''
   Eastland, 38, is a staunch political conservative who has helped
craft many of Meese's most controversial speeches on subjects
ranging from civil rights policies to criticisms of Supreme Court
rulings.
   His dismissal is the latest in a string of departures that began
March 29 when Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal
division chief William Weld quit out of concern that Meese's
continued tenure as attorney general in the face of a criminal
probe was hurting the Justice Department's operations, morale and
public image.
   Meese has been the focus of a criminal investigation by
independent counsel James McKay launched on May 11, 1987 into the
attorney general's ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and his
involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
   Three hours after Eastland publicly released the letter to
Meese, the associate head of the public affairs office, William
Schambra, quit as head of the unit that prepares speeches for the
attorney general.
   ``I am ... perplexed and deeply disturbed by the attorney
general's decision,'' Schambra said in a resignation letter to
Eastland. ``This department simply could not have asked for more
conscientious and effective a spokesman ... It is simply
astonishing to me that this formed the grounds for your
dismissal.'' Schambra had held his post less than four months.
   ``Bill (Schambra) quit because he found that the attorney
general's firing of Terry Eastland to be unconscionable, that it
was something that Terry did not deserve, that it inflicts great
harm on the principles that everyone came here to fight for,'' said
Gary L. McDowell, Meese's former speechwriter.
   Several prominent conservatives expressed dismay over the firing.
   Education Secretary William Bennett, who once wrote a book with
Eastland on the Bakke affirmative action case, immediately offered
Eastland a job at the Department of Education.
   ``I am concerned about this latest development,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.
   Thurmond, saying that ``Eastland has a fine reputation,'' added
that the committee would hold hearings after McKay issues a report
that is expected to raise numerous questions about Meese's ethical
behavior.
   At a meeting Friday, Meese told Eastland he had been hearing
both inside and outside the Justice Department that the spokesman
felt ``uncomfortable defending'' him, said department sources
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Meese also said he had heard that Eastland was ``uneasy'' over
the likelihood that McKay's report will question Meese's ethical
behavior, the sources said.
   Eastland told Meese that he had made no judgments about the
attorney general and that he would make none until the report is
issued, according to the sources. Meese responded that he didn't
want that kind of person being the chief spokesman for the Justice
Department.
   In his letter to Meese, Eastland said, ``You have expressed to
me your desire to have as director of public affairs someone
willing to aggressively defend you against, in effect, any and all
criticism.''
   Eastland added that the public affairs office ``has an
obligation to serve not only the attorney general but also the
Department of Justice and the American people.''
   In Friday's conversation, Meese went on to criticize Eastland
for not responding aggressively enough to editorial criticism of
the attorney general's continued tenure. Meese then gave Eastland
30 days to look for work and offered to throw him a going-away
party, said the sources.
   Eastland declined the offer and Monday was his last day at work.
   The central figure pushing for Eastland's dismissal was Meese's
former counselor, Ken Cribb, who now heads the White House office
of domestic affairs, according to other Justice Department sources.
   Cribb denied he played a role in the firing.
   ``That is an utter fabrication, and you will find that it
doesn't check out,'' he said. ``The attorney general is entitled to
make personnel decisions and I support him in that.''
   However, the sources emphasized that Cribb for several weeks has
been questioning Eastland's loyalty to Meese and whether the
attorney general ought to jettison him.
   Meanwhile, despite the department's annual $1.7 million public
affairs budget, the Justice Department is negotiating a contract
with Charles Crawford of the Washington office of the public
relations firm Hill & Knowlton to help Meese tout his efforts in
the department's war on drugs.
   ``I've always felt that whoever had'' Eastland's position ``had
too much to do on a day-to-day basis to spend much time on
departmental problems,'' said Hill & Knowlton's chairman Bob Gray,
who emphasized that the contract is to be a 60-day arrangement with
Crawford personally on drug enforcement and ``not a contract with
me or the firm.''

   Vice President George Bush stepped away Monday
from Reagan administration policies on acid rain, saying the time
for study is over and ``we've got to begin to take effective
action.''
   ``I don't think we've been doing enough to protect our
environment in recent years,'' he said. ``We need to do more.''
   Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be, also lashed out on Monday at
the most recent story suggesting his staff was involved in an arms
and drugs network involving the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, calling
it the ``oldest tiredest reporting.''
   He denounced the story in Newsweek that suggested his foreign
policy aide Donald Gregg was the Washington contact for an arms
operation supplying the Contras with links to drug dealers.
   ``This is old news,'' he said. ``It's not even news. ... You get
bombarded by these insinuations and tired stories. ... I'd hate to
think it is politically motivated material that has been looked
at.''
   ``It's just pure unadulterated _ I've go to watch my lanuage.''
   Later, he told local reporters in Seattle: ``I think it's
slanderous, and it's all been looked into.''
   Bush said he did not believe the report woulld hurt his campaign.
   ``No, I am not hurt and it doesn't happen to be true,'' he said.
``I've learned to defend yourself and not let somebody libel or
slander you.''
   On the subject of acid rain, Bush said specific goals to cut
down on the air pollution that contributes to it may well be
needed. Administration policy is to continue to study acid rain.
   Aides had promoted the speech _ to the Greater Seattle Chamber
of Commerce _ as a major statement on the environment, a key theme
of Bush's campaign in the Pacific Northwest.
   ``A Bush administration will enforce environmental laws
aggressively, putting the responsibility for the cleanup where it
belongs _ on those who caused the problem in the first place,'' he
said.
   An earlier text of the speech was handed out by his staff but
then was hurriedly retrieved with the explanation that the text was
not a final one. Just before Bush started speaking, another text
was distributed with no word on possible changes.
   Bush has been bringing up the subject of the environment both in
speeches and in actions on this weeklong campaign swing, which has
appeared to be aimed mostly at the general election in the fall. He
has campaigned in Oregon in advance of the Tuesday primary there,
and late Monday he headed to California, which has its primary on
June 7.
   Washington has already held its precinct caucuses, and Bush
suffered his sole loss on Super Tuesday here.
   On Monday, he toured a major forestry reserach lab and a lumber
mill near Seattle.
   As he has recently, Bush spoke favorably of Teddy Roosevelt,
declaring, ``I am proud of the leadership shown by Republicans on
protecting the environment.''
   But he moved away from President Reagan's policies on acid rain
as he seemed to suggest he would change much about Reagan's much
criticized environmental policies.
   ``With regard to acid rain, we can't study the problem any more
_ we've got to begin to take effective action,'' Bush said. ``There
has to be a national commitment to continue to reduce the emissions
of sulfur and nitrogen oxides.''
   Bush went on to say that he would pursue initiatives that have
come from the negotiations with Canada on acid rain, ``and if they
do not produce results, establish specific emission reduction goals
that promise steady progress toward cleaner air.''
   He endorsed the administration's $5 billion program to develop
new technologies to cut emissions from coal and other sources of
acid rain.
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said the acid rain position is
different from Reagan's.
   The vice president seemed to suggest he would clean house at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``A new administration is a time for change, a time for renewal.
I will put the very best people we can find to work on our
environmental agenda. I want to bring a lot of people to Washington
who don't know what they can't do,'' Bush said.
   Bush also endorsed many of the recommendations of the
President's Commission on Americans Outdoors, a study that has not
been officially released by the Reagan White House.
   However, Teeley said Bush has not agreed to the commission's
call for spending $1 billion in new federal money a year on outdoor
facilities and parks. Over the weekend, Bush had made statements
supporting the commission's work without including any
qualifications.
   On another subject, asked about Democrat Michael Dukakis' charge
that the new jobs created under Reagan have been largely low-wage
ones, Bush said:
   ``He's wrong. The jobs that have been created are for the most
part good jobs. ... The charge that the new jobs are flipping
hamburgers ... and doing someone else's laundry are wrong.''

   Two construction workers were killed Monday
when they fell from the top of a 12-story downtown building.
   Francis Middlecamp, 57, of Baltimore, and Bruce Fahrenholtz, 29,
of Chesapeake Beach, Md. were doing sheet metal work on the
penthouse of the building about 8:15 a.m. when they fell into an
alley below.
   Three other men were working nearby but did not see what caused
the two to fall, said District of Columbia police Officer Shannon
Cockett.
   Nicholas Powe, who was hosing down the sidewalk of a neighboring
store, said one of the almost hit him.
   ``I couldn't do nothing for them,'' Powe said.
   The men worked for the James Myers Co. of Beltsville, Md.
   Police were investigating the accident.

   A minor earthquake shook Jamaica early
Monday, the second quake in eight days, but no injuries or damage
were reported, officials said.
   The temblor was felt strongest in Kingston, the capital, and St.
Andrew Parish.
   The Seismic Research Unit at the University of the West Indies
said the earthquake registered 3.6 on the Richter scale, with its
epicenter off northeast Jamaica at latitude 18.2 degrees north and
longitude 76.4 degrees west, at a depth of 6.2 miles. It struck at
5:34 a.m. EDT.
   A May 9 earthquake in Jamaica lasted 90 seconds and measured 4.2
on the Richter scale, one of the strongest in Jamaica in 30 years.
A student was injured then when she jumped in panic from the second
story of her school.
   The Richter scale measures energy released by quakes as recorded
on seismographs. A quake registering 4 is capable of causing
moderate damage.

   A woman whose left arm was reattached after
it was severed by an airplane propeller last month returned home
from the hospital Monday with doctors optimistic about her ecovery.
   Dr. David Hurley, a plastic surgeon at the University of South
Alabama Medical Center, said Tracie Ellenburg, 18, would require
additional therapy, but he was optimistic for her recovery.
   ``She'll see me again on Friday, just to make sure everything is
healing well,'' the doctor said.
   Miss Ellenburg, who went back to her home in Geneva in southeast
Alabama, said she hoped to return to her job as a bookkeeper, but
her June wedding plans with fiance Scott Jordan probably would be
delayed until September.
   ``I can go and do things,'' Miss Ellenburg said during an
interview in her hospital room. ``In my right hand, I can still
write. I'm excited about going home. I just feel like the Lord's
going to give me feeling in it before long.''
   Her parents, Harold and Nell Ellenburg, stood beside their
youngest of four children. They said they received an outpouring of
support from residents of Geneva and their church.
   Miss Ellenburg said The Maple Avenue Baptist Church has declared
June 5 ``Tracie Ellenburg Day.''
   Miss Ellenburg was injured April 27, when she stepped into the
propeller at a rural airport in Geneva, a community near Dothan.
   ``We have put a skin graft on to get some skin coverage.
Everything looks great,'' Hurley said Monday.
   But he said it would take 3-6 months to determine the extent of
the arm's function. ``The nerves regenerate very slowly. They grow
about one millimeter a day. It just takes time.''
   Two military helicopters were used in the rescue and evacuation
of Miss Ellenburg from the small airport. She still remembers the
accident and described her survival as a ``miracle.''
   ``I remember walking into the propeller. The next thing I
remember was being on the ground, but I never passed out,'' she
said. ``When I got to the emergency room I was talking.''
   The twin-engine plane was operated by Miss Ellenburg's
brother-in-law, Ricky Hornsby and her fiance was a passenger.
   Hornsby recovered the severed arm immediately after the accident.

<HEAD>Dole Asks Senate to Oppose Any Deal To Drop Charges Against
Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole asked the
Senate on Monday night to oppose any U.S. deal with Manuel Noriega
which would involve dropping criminal charges against the
Panamanian strongman.
   ``The American people are never going to understand if we
dismiss indictments against Noriega,'' the Kansas Republican told
his colleagues as he introduced a non-binding resolution opposing
any deal in which charges are dropped.
   There have been numerous reports in recent days that Reagan
administration officials were negotiating an agreement with Noriega
where he would voluntarily step down and relinquish power if the
United States would drop federal drug trafficking indictments that
were brought against him in February by grand juries in Miami and
Tampa, Fla.
   Dole's proposal was a ``sense of the Senate'' resolution which
he introduced as an amendment to a pending bill authorizing
Pentagon spending for the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1.
   The Senate originally considered voting on the resolution Monday
night, but delayed a vote until at least Tuesday when Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, objected.
Nunn said he wanted to talk with members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Dole said he had no personal knowledge about the accuracy of the
reports of the proposed deal, but he referred to them as a ``golden
parachute'' for Noriega.
   ``If we send this signal, it's going to undermine the so-called
war on drugs,'' said Dole. ``Let Noriega go, but let's don't send
him off with a legal golden parachute.''
   Golden parachute is often the term used to describe benefits and
severance pay offered to top business executives when they are
fired or resign.
   ``We all want Noriega to go,'' said Dole. ``We all agree that
should be a high priority of American policy in Panama. But it is
not the only priority for American policy.
   ``If we let Noriega off the hook on the drug indictments that
have been brought against him _ no matter what the motive _ we have
sent a very regrettable message to the world,'' added Dole.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the proposed deal
``scandalous'' and said ``all we're doing is rewarding him, we're
giving him a pardon.''
   ``This administration is doing itself in,'' said D'Amato, who
then went on to praise President Reagan as a ``good man, a
courageous man.''
   ``I don't think the American people want us to drop these
charges and give testimony to the effectiveness of the (Colombian)
drug cartel and Manuel Noriega,'' said D'Amato.
   Nunn said he believes that ``you don't indict a leader of a
foreign country unless you know how you're going to follow through
on it ... apparently we did not have ways to go about it, plans for
extradition.''
   ``Certainly, we've dug ourselves into a hole now,'' said Nunn.
Dropping the charges ``is sending a very bad signal.''

<TEXT>
   A member of the Cuban cycling team who
sought American help in defecting to the United States was jailed
in this northern city Monday, the newspaper El Norte reported.
   It said Roger Vazquez Vazquez, 25, abandoned his team after a
race in Mexico City last week and went north hoping to defect to
the United States.
   Vazquez was detained Sunday as he tried to pass through a
federal migration checkpoint at Nuevo Laredo, 16 miles south of the
U.S. border city of Laredo, Texas, according to the newspaper.
   The U.S. Consulate in Monterrey declined to comment on the
report that Vazquez asked for U.S. political asylum.
   ``We are not permitted to comment on any individual case like
that. There are just too many potential ramifications,'' said
consulate spokesman Bob Brown.
   But he said U.S. policy in such cases is ``to give them
assistance if possible.''
   The Federal District Attorney's Office in Monterrey said it had
no information on the case.
   A secretary at the Loma prison where Vazquez reportedly was held
said prison directors were out of the office Monday and unavailable
for comment.
   El Norte quoted migration officials in Nuevo Laredo, who were
not identified, as saying Vazquez was in Mexico legally but was not
authorized to go to the border.
   It said Vazquez came last week to Monterrey, 135 miles south of
Laredo.
   Without identifying its sources, the newspaper said cyclists
from Monterrey who had met Vazquez in Mexico City gave him refuge
and took him to the U.S. consulate where his case was being
considered.
   Vazquez became impatient and tried to leave the country on his
own, the report said.
   El Norte reported Nuevo Laredo officials said Vazquez would be
sent to Mexico City and the Interior Department would resolve the
case.

<TEXT>
   The number of confirmed cases of AIDS
increased from 4,101 in 1986 to 9,328 last year in the European
Economic Community, the European Commission reported Monday.
   The commission, which gave no breakdown by country, said it
regretted slow action on the part of the EEC in fighting AIDS and
meager funds spent so far for common research and coordination of
measures among the 12 member countries.
   It said only $1.7 million was allocated last year on research in
Europe and fighting the disease in Africa and these funds are being
used.
   The commission report said $23 million had been earmarked for
research in the two continents but most of those funds were only
tentatively allocated and not yet used as part of a five-year
medical research program just recently decided.
   EEC health ministers will review the issue at their next
Brussels meeting on May 31.
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include sharing of contaminated hypodermic
needles or syringes by drug abusers and transfusions of tainted
blood or blood products. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   The powerful thunderstorms and showers rattled the East and
South on Monday, pelting much of the South with hail.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended Monday from western New York
across Pennsylvania, the Virginias, the Carolinas, Kentucky,
Georgia and Alabama, as well as central Texas and the northern and
central Pacific Coast by mid-day.
   Georgia authorities said a University of Georgia freshman was
struck and killed by lightning while playing golf and an Atlanta
construction worker was crushed when a building under construction
was knocked down by high winds.
   Golf ball-size hail fell in New York at Naples, Pen Yann and
Branchport and at Hancock, Md.; Berkeley Springs, W. Va.;
Fayetteville, Ga.; and in central Texas near Austin, the weather
service said.
   Smaller hail also was reported in Laurel Park, Kernersville and
Hendersonville, N.C.; Pelham, Ala.; Chesnee, S.C.; Atlanta,
Cornelia, Riverdale, Jonesboro, Hamton and Newman, Ga., and near
Austin, Texas.
   Hail also fell on Dayton and Little Valley, N.Y.
   Denver tied its high temperature record for May 16 and reached
89 degrees. The record was set in 1964.
   Havre, Mont., reached 92 degrees and broke its high temperature
record for the date, 91 degrees, set in 1901.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 98 degrees at Needles, Calif. The
nation's low temperature Monday morning was 25 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Tuesday's forecast called for showers and occasional
thunderstorms from the northern and central Atlantic states into
the southern Appalachians, as well as Florida, and from the
northern Rockies across the Northern Pacific coast.
   Predicted highs would reach the 60s for New England, the
northern Appalachians and the Great Lakes, from the northern
Rockies across the northern half of the Pacific Coast, near 70
along the California coast, near 90 degrees for the Southern
Plains, the 90s from southwest Texas through the desert Southwest,
and in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
announced Monday he will call up the U.S.-Soviet medium-range
missile treaty for debate Tuesday, opening a race to ratify it
before President Reagan meets with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at the Moscow summit.
   Byrd acted after three Senate committees formally concluded that
disputes over the on-site inspection provisions of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty have been resolved and no
longer prevent opening debate on ratifying the pact.
   The decision followed testimony in which Secretary of State
George P. Shultz said that in talks last week with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on the disputed points, ``We got what
we needed and wanted.''
   Byrd told reporters that on the recommendation of the chairmen
and senior Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations,
Intelligence and Armed Services committees, ``I feel satisfied that
we're justified in taking up the treaty and I plan to do so at some
point tomorrow.''
   The INF treaty, signed at the White House on Dec. 8 by Reagan
and Gorbachev, would require the elimination of all U.S. and Soviet
missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles.
   Byrd had refused to permit debate on ratifying the pact to
proceed until disputes on implementing the on-site inspection
provision and on futuristic weapons had been resolved.
   On Monday night, Byrd said he hoped the treaty could be ratified
by the May 29 opening of the Moscow summit but he could not
guarantee it.
   Finishing the treaty by the time of the summit will depend on
the nature of the debate and the number of amendments that are
offered, he said.
   ``I am in no position at this point to say we can finish or we
won't finish,'' Byrd said. ``I hope we can. But nobody can answer
that at this point.''
   Byrd said he plans to call up the treaty and stay on it but
noted there may be some roadblocks.
   For example, he said that if Reagan vetoes the trade bill, an
attempt to override that action would take precedence over the
treaty and would interrupt its consideration.
   In addition, a small band of treaty opponents led by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., has vowed to mount a drive to make substantial
changes in the pact, changes that would force the re-negotiation of
the accord. Helms, who denied that his objective was to delay
action on the treaty until after the summit, said last week that he
plans to offer ``something like a dozen'' amendments.
   Such anti-treaty amendments are given little chance of adoption.
   Vote counts show that when the final vote is taken, the treaty
likely will be ratified by an overwhelming Senate majority, far
greater than the required two-thirds vote.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, said he was
satisfied by the agreement worked out between Shultz and
Shevardnadze in Geneva and said: ``I believe they have done a good
job in satisfying the very serious problems that were raised.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,
told reporters that the committees concluded that the
Shultz-Shevardnadze talks resolved all nine disputed points
regarding the implementation of on-site inspection as well as a
dispute over whether the treaty embraces such futuristic weapons as
those using laser rays and particle beam generators.
   ``It is the feeling that these points that have been in dispute
now have been resolved,'' Boren said, adding he was speaking for
the Armed Services committee as well as his own.
   Shultz earlier appealed to the Senate to ratify the treaty
before the summit and said that all nine outstanding on-site
inspection issues have been ``resolved to our satisfaction.''
   He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that in dealing
with disputes with the Soviets on the implementation of on-site
inspection arrangements to detect cheating, ``what we did was
insist that precisely the terms of the treaty be lived up to on
both sides.''
   As a result of the talks with Shevardnadze, ``we and the Soviets
not only agree on the rights and obligations established in this
treaty, but also on procedures to carry them out,'' he said.
   It is clear, Shultz asserted, that the treaty is in the national
security interests of the United States because it ``removes,
forever, a Soviet nuclear threat that has confronted our NATO
allies for 30 years.''
   Responding to questions, Shultz said a recent Soviet test of a
sea-launched cruise missile from a land-based launcher does not
appear to violate the treaty for two reasons, one of them being the
fact the treaty is not yet in effect.
   The other, Shultz said, is that the test appears to have fallen
short of 300 miles and therefore does not fall within the treaty's
definition of a medium-range missile.
   But Helms, citing news accounts of the test, insisted it
represents a treaty violation and said it makes him wonder ``why we
are even talking about giving assent to ratification at all.''
   U.S. officials said the Soviets had retreated from a hardline
position on how the on-site inspection would work and would now
permit inspectors to look inside any container or vehicle large
enough to contain the smallest stage of any banned missile or large
enough to hold a partially completed SS-20 missile.
   Inspectors also will be allowed to use cameras and to look
inside any building or container inside a facility covered by the
treaty, officials said.
   Failure to consent to the ratification of the treaty by May 29
would virtually eliminate any chances Reagan might have for making
progress on a treaty aimed at reducing long-range strategic nuclear
weapons by as much as 50 percent, treaty supporters contend.

   The last two hostages in a
medium-security prison were released unharmed Monday, peacefully
ending a 59-hour uprising in which inmates took eight guards
captive and did more than $1 million damage.
   The siege at Mack Alford Correctional Facility ended about 10:30
a.m. when the inmates released Sgt. Harold Yoder, then surrendered.
The other remaining hostage, corrections officer Ronnie Scott, was
freed about a half-hour earlier.
   ``For all practical purposes, it's over,'' prison spokesman
Jerry Massie said as friends and relatives greeted the former
hostages, and nine inmates were strip-searched, dressed in red
coveralls and loaded on a bus.
   One guard and one inmate were injured in the violence that broke
out Friday night at the 33-year-old prison. Forty-two other
prisoners, suspected of aiding the nine, also would be transferred
from the prison, officials said.
   ``We assume that they were all involved (in the riot). They were
the ones who were left with the hostages,'' said Corrections
Director Gary Maynard.
   ``Some took more of a leadership role and others stood back.
We'll have to sort that out later,'' he said.
   Maynard said estimates of $1.2 million in damage to the prison
didn't include damage to a three-story dormitory gutted by fire at
the start of the uprising. He planned to compile a complete damage
assessment.
   ``The property is scattered, probably been rummaged through by
everybody,'' Maynard said. ``There was more fire damage than I
expected. ... It's very discouraging and frustrating.
   ``We will subsequent to this do the best that we can to rebuild
and replace.''
   Reporters found extensive fire damage and vandalism in three of
the prison's four dormitories. Broken glass and debris covered
floors and the prison yard, where inmates burned chairs and other
materials in bonfires.
   The nine captors had demanded that they be moved to other
prisons and that their departure be recorded by television cameras,
said Joy Hadwiger, corrections spokeswoman in Oklahoma City.
   There was no agreement made on where they would be transferred,
she said.
   The bus pulled out of the parking lot at 11:20 a.m., bound for
the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center. Warden Stephen
Kaiser said they would be housed in maximum-security facilities.
   The former hostages were examined and then allowed to go home.
   ``We had faith in the Lord and we had peace of mind there,''
said Bessie Umsted, Yoder's sister-in-law.
   Prison spokeswoman Anita Trammell said 30 to 35 inmates who were
not involved in the hostage-taking and remained in their cells
during the standoff will remain at the Stringtown facility.
   ``They will be contained, stripped, fed and watered,'' she said.
``We are going to determine who participated in the hostage
situation _ who set fires.''
   The 51 Stringtown inmates heading to other facilities would be
``dispersed throughout the system wherever we can,'' Maynard said.
   Corrections officials who swept through the building after
regaining control said early reports that a dead inmate was inside
were false.
   ``We've finished our head count and everyone's accounted for,''
said Ms. Hadwiger. ``There is no body.''
   According to authorities, the uprising began Friday when
officers tried to move five inmates to a maximum-security prison
because of a dispute between them and some other inmates.
   The inmates initially seized eight hostages _ all prison guards
_ but five were released unharmed Saturday, and on Sunday a sixth
was set free in exchange for soda pop, ice cream and cigarettes.
   The rioters agreed Sunday night to release the final two
hostages and surrender Monday morning before a press pool
television videotape camera. The transfer was not shown on live
television, but was shown later on news broadcasts.
   During the three-day siege, the rioters displayed machete-like
knives with blades about 12 inches long, and three bedsheet-banners
were unfurled from the roof of the two-story dormitory where the
hostages were held.
   The first sheet said ``White Power,'' a second one said ``DOC
Will Not Respond to Demands. They Have Lied to You the Public and
Press.'' The third requested help from the media.
   ``I feel like the inmates did that for attention,'' Ms. Trammell
said of the ``White Power'' banner. ``Also, I feel like we have
some racists up there,'' she added.
   State Rep. Gary Coffee, one of three state legislators involved
in the negotiations, said the riot started after white inmates
accused blacks of stealing from them. But state Rep. Kenneth
Converse, another negotiator, downplayed the racial angle.
   ``One or two individuals can make it look like a racist deal,''
Converse said. ``It's not a racist deal, and it's not an
overcrowding issue.''
   Maynard said he believes the riot was spontaneous and was not
primarily racial, although he acknowledged that the original fight
was among blacks and whites.
   ``It apparently was a fight over a property issue between blacks
and whites. It escalated when our officers tried to arrest the
inmates. It doesn't seem like it was racially motivated.''

   Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner
Howard Nemerov was named Monday as poet laureate of the United
States, becoming the third person to hold that job since it was
created in 1985.
   Nemerov's appointment was announced by James H. Billington, the
Librarian of Congress.
   ``Howard Nemerov has given America remarkable range of poetry
from the profound to the poignant to the comic,'' said Billington.
   ``It is a happy moment for poetry that Howard Nemerov will
become our new ambassador for the `republic of letters,''' he added.
   Billington also cited Nemerov, 68, for his work as ``an
outstanding critic, essayist, fiction writer and teacher.''
   Nemerov _ currently a distinguished professor at Washington
University i8n St. Louis _ will succeed Richard Wilbur and Robert
Penn Warren in holding the endowed chair created by Congress in
1936 for the position of Consultant in Poetry to the library.
   In that capacity, Nemerov will give a public poetry reading and
lecture, advise the library on its literary programs and recommend
new poets to be included in the library's archive of recorded
poetry and literature.
   Nemerov previously served as a consultant in poetry to the
library in 1963.
   Nemerov won both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award in
poetry in 1978. Among his collections of poetry are ``Image and the
Law,'' ``Guide to the Ruins,'' ``Mirrors and Windows'' and ``War
Stories.''
   Nemerov, who was born in New York City and was graduated in 1941
from Harvard University, has taught at Hamilton College, Bennington
College, Brandeis University and Hollins College.

   A man convicted of two murders and accused of
14 others should be executed June 27, a judge said Monday after
granting R. Gene Simmons' wish to waive his right to appeal his
death sentence.
   Simmons, 47, was convicted last week of two deaths in a Dec. 28
shooting rampage in Russellville. He is due to stand trial July 18
for the deaths of 14 members of his family, whose bodies were
discovered by police at his home.
   If no one intervenes to delay the execution, it would be one of
the swiftest in modern U.S. history. But a woman whose daughter and
grandson were killed says she wants Simmons tried again ``before
he's put to sleep.''
   No one has been executed in Arkansas since 1964.
   John Burnett, a Little Rock attorney who chairs an eight-member
committee that considers cases for intervention by the Arkansas
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said no decision had
been made about the Simmons case.
   He said possible intervention would probably be discussed by the
committee.
   Charlotte Croston, the mother of Renata Simmons and her son,
Trae, who were among those found at the Simmons home, said with
tears streaming from her eyes she wanted Simmons to stand trial for
killing his relatives.
   ``I'd like for him to suffer a little bit before he's put to
sleep,'' she said. ``I don't know if he believes in the hereafter,
but the last laugh is on him because he's going to suffer a lot
more then. I want him to die. I just want him to face justice in
this life before he does.''
   Immediately after being convicted Thursday of killing Kathy
Kendrick and James Chaffin and trying to kill five other people,
Simmons asked his trial judge, Circuit Court Judge John Patterson
to expedite his execution.
   After he was sentenced, Simmons calmly read a brief statement,
in which he said that ``anything short of death would be cruel and
unusual punishment.''
   ``I only ask for what I deserve,'' he said. ``Let the torture
and suffering in me end. Please allow me the right to be at peace.''
   Patterson said he scheduled Monday's hearing to satisfy himself
that Simmons was mentally competent to waive his right to appeal.
   Patterson reminded Simmons during Monday's 35-minute hearing
that ``any time prior to execution, you have the right to change
your mind and appeal. Do you understand that?''
   Simmons said he understood and did not think he would change his
mind, adding ``nobody better hold their breath.''
   Simmons said the decision ``actually was made on the 28th of
December'' _ the day he went on a shooting rampage that killed two
and wounded four in Russellville.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II lectured Paraguay's
authoritarian president, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, on human rights
and political freedoms Monday as the pontiff began the last swing
of his Latin American tour.
   Minutes after the pope's arrival in Paraguay, police arrested
the Rev. Donald Bahlinger of Baton Rouge, La., and three Paraguayan
labor and peasant leaders, according to local Roman Catholic Church
offcials. Bahlinger was later released, according to the Asuncion
radio station Caritas.
   The pope defended the right of the church to criticize injustice.
   ``You can't corner the church in its temples, as you can't
corner God in the conscience of man,'' the pope told Stroessner,
75, in an encounter in the presidential palace, before the
diplomatic corps and ministers of state.
   John Paul said Christian duty requires one to be ``a firm
defender of justice, peace, freedom, public and private honesty and
the defense of life and in favor of the rights of the human
person.''
   The pope did not explicitly criticize Stroessner, the
longest-ruling head of state in the Western Hemisphere. But he
said, ``The task of governing will be immensely facilitated'' by
``promoting dialogue and a greater participation of everyone in
public affairs.''
   Stroessner has been widely criticized for barring a genuine
political opposition in this nation of 3.8 million.
   The pope, who spoke Spanish, also said, ``Respect for human
rights, as is well known, is not a question of political
convenience but stems from the dignity of the person by virtue of
his condition as a creature of God.''
   Stroessner, in turn, delivered an impassioned defense of his
law-and-order government and stressed Paraguay's Catholic
traditions.
   ``This country opens its heart to the Supreme Pastor with the
vast panorama of its auspicious present: this Paraguay of today,
without political or social crises, without tumult, without street
violence, without political priosners, without hate,'' he said.
   The pontiff, in white robes, and Stroessner, in a gray suit, sat
side by side in high-backed chairs and took turns delivering
speeches before the presidential podium.
   The pontiff and Paraguayan leader also met privately for 30
minutes.
   John Paul II said in his arrival speech that priests ``fulfill
their evangelizing role'' through social teaching.
   The rightist government has sharply criticized the local
church's involvement in social and labor issues, calling some
priests subversives.
   At 1:40 p.m. EDT, 10 minutes after the pope arrived, police
detained Bahlinger, labor leader Ruben Lisboa, and peasant
activists Celestino Chamorro and Victor Benitez, according to a
communique issued by the Paraguayan Episcopal Council.
   The four were carried off to an unknown location after they
emerged from the downtown Encarnacion Church where peasants were
carrying on a protest fast and prayer service, the communique said.
   On Monday morning Bahlinger told The Associated Press that
Paraguayan peasants were repressed by the government. ``You can
taste the fear in the countryside. It's diabolical. It's evil,'' he
said.
   Bahlinger said the fast was designed to call attention to the
peasants' appeals for land reform and better working and living
conditions.
   Bahlinger, a Jesuit, said he had worked in Paraguay for eight
years and was based at San Ignacio, 125 miles south of Asuncion.
   Several peasant activists remained in the church. ``The police
have us surrounded, and they're ambushing people as they walk
out,'' Corazon Medina, general secretary of the National Peasant
Movement, said in a telephone interview.
   The Caritas radio station did not provide details on Bahlinger's
release and there was no word on where the detained Paraguayans
were.
   Last week, the government canceled a papal meeting with a
church-sponsored group, Builders of Society, made up of
intellectuals and politicians, including representatives of
opposition groups.
   Authorities lifted the ban on the meeting, scheduled for
Tuesday, after two days of talks with church officials.
   On Monday afternoon, the pope celebrated Mass for tens of
thousands of Catholic faithful.
   He canonized three Jesuit missionary priests killed by natives
in 1628, including Roque Gonzalez, born in Asuncion. He became
Paraguay's first native-born saint.
   With this visit to Paraguay, John Paul has now toured every
Latin American country except Cuba in his nearly 10-year-old
papacy. Earlier in this 12-day trip, he stopped in Uruguay, Bolivia
and Peru.
   Ninety percent of Paraguayans profess Roman Catholicism.
   Stroessner, 75, led a 1954 coup and has ruled since with the
backing of the armed forces and the Colorado Party.
   He won his eighth straight term in February. The opposition
charged the elections were fraudulent.

<HEAD>Soviet and U.S. officials to hold talks on southern Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.S. and Soviet negotiators on
southern Africa will meet in Lisbon this week to discuss the civil
war in Angola and South Africa's control of Namibia, a U.S. Embassy
official said Monday.
   Chester Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, and Anatoly Adamishin, a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, will open the talks Wednesday, embassy spokeswoman Susan
Clyde said.
   She said only Soviet and U.S. officials are expected to take
part in the talks, with Crocker due to arrive in the Portuguese
capital on Wednesday and leave Thursday or Friday.
   The Soviet and U.S. envoys have met several times recently to
discuss ways of ending the conflicts in southern Africa. President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are expected to
discuss the issue at their Moscow summit opening May 29.
   Earlier this month in London, Crocker presided over the first
face-to-face negotiations among representativs from Angola, South
Africa and Cuba.
   Cuba has an estimated 40,000 military personnel in Angola,
helping that country's Marxist government fight rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ UNITA. The
United States and South Africa back UNITA.
   South African and Angolan officials met Friday in Brazzaville,
the capital of Congo, and a second meeting among the four countries
that met in London is expected to take place in Brazzaville within
two weeks.
   Adamishin arrived in Lisbon Monday. He recently visited Angola,
Cuba and the United States.
   In another development Monday, Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos said Angola accepted the principle of a gradual
withdrawal of the Cuban military personnel from his country.
   Dos Santos, in an interview with the official Angolan news
agency ANGOP, said the United States is refusing to recognize
Angola diplomatically until the Cubans have left. He said that
position was ``absurd'' and ``without any logical explanation.''
   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon, quoted the president as
saying Namibian independence and the end of the Angolan war would
be decisive steps toward peace in southern Africa and the abolition
of racial segregation in South Africa.
   Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, is a territory between
Angola and South Africa that has been administered by South
Africa's white-dominated government since the end of World War I
under a League of Nations mandate.
   South Africa has rejected repeated demands by the United Nations
that Namibia be independent. One South African condition is the
removal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   Guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization
(SWAPO) are fighting South Africa for control of the territory.
   SWAPO has bases in southern Angola and South Africa frequently
has sent troops into Angola.
   Angola received its independence from Portugal in November 1975
and UNITA was defeated in the battle for power by the Marxist
Popular Liberation Movement of Angola.

   A spokesman for the nation's tobacco
farmers blasted the U.S. surgeon general on Monday and said his
report comparing nicotine to addictive drugs like heroin and
cocaine was nonsense.
   ``I think it is just another salvo in the political war against
tobacco and doesn't have a thing to do with science,'' said Reggie
Lester, managing director of the Tobacco Growers' Information
Committee Inc. ``It's politics as usual from the anti-tobacco
crowd.''
   Lester called Surgeon General C. Everett Koop ``a political
animal,'' called his report ``patent nonsense'' and said, ``He's
crossed the line of common sense.''
   Lester's organization is a coalition of 44 growers' groups based
in North Carolina, which produces about two-thirds of the nation's
tobacco.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem, North Carolina's
largest maker of cigarettes, would not comment on the report and
referred all calls to The Tobacco Institute in Washington.
   State Agriculture Commissioner Jim Graham was out of town and
unavailable for comment.
   Koop's report organized previously disclosed research into a
presentation lumping nicotine with heroin and cocaine as
physiologically addictive substances.
   ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes
and other forms of tobacco are addicting,'' Koop wrote in a
preface. ``An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is
the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.
   Sen. Terry Sandord, D-N.C., said that Koop's comparison of
tobacco _ a legitimate and legal substance _ to insidious narcotics
... is a direction of ``friendly fire'' at American farmers and
businessmen.
   ``Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.'' Sanford said. ``This is
the administration that declares war on drugs, and then counsels
people to `just say no.'''
   ``I concur with recent statements that we have never heard of a
smoker robbing a convenience store, a gas station or a little old
lady to obtain money to purchase cigarettes,'' said W.B. Jenkins,
North Carolina Farm Bureau president. ``There have been numerous
news reports of such robberies to obtain monies to satisfy
addiction to marijuana, heroin or cocaine.''
   Lester said the tobacco industry won't suffer from being
mentioned with drugs such as heroin and cocaine because, ``I'm not
sure that you can create a more difficult social stigma for tobacco
than already exits.''
   Lester also said it was ``erroneous'' for Koop to conclude that
children are buying cigarettes from vending machines.
   ``Almost all of the vending machines that are out there are
supervised by adults,'' Lester said. ``They go for upscale
restaurants and bars ... . They take surveys and find out that the
number of young people that buy cigarettes from vending machines is
less than 5 percent.
   ``We do not want young people as customers,'' Lester added. ``We
think smoking is an adult custom. If they (the government) want to
take some measures ... for making it harder young people to buy
cigarettes, we wouldn't have any problems with that.''

<HEAD>Struck Company Plans To Resume Dover-Calais Ferry Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ferry Pride of Kent made the voyage
from Dover to Calais, France, on Monday in a move to resume the
first passenger service on that route by P and O European Ferries
Ltd. since a strike began 15 weeks ago.
   A company official said the Pride of Kent left Dover at 10:45
a.m. (5:45 a.m. EDT) on an unscheduled sailing and returned at
about 2 p.m.
   ``It is another step in the progressive reintroduction of our
services and ships,'' said a P and O spokesman, who was not
identified in line with British custom. He acknowledged that ``not
many people'' were on board.
   Another P and O official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the company intended to resume normal passenger
sailings on the Dover-Calais run, the busy and shortest route
between England and the Continent. He said the company would
provide three round-trip sailings daily.
   P and O made its first effort to break the strike with sailings
between Dover and Zeebrugge, Belgium, beginning May 1. Its ferries
carried mainly freight and a few passengers.
   It began operating freight ferries between Dover and Calais on
Friday.
   Rival ferry companies resumed full operations Friday after
members of the National Union of Seamen decided to give up their
secondary action in support of P and O's striking workers.
   The P and O strikers are protesting changes in work schedules
that the company is instituting as cost-cutting measures. P and O
said the measures are needed to make the line competitive by the
time the Channel Tunnel opens in 1993, providing a direct
railroad-car route between Britain and France.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general secretary of the
opposition Christian Democratic Party, Ivan Romero, returned to
Panama on Monday, 10 days after he was expelled from the country.
   His return came on the same day that Commerce Minister Mario
Rognoni called ``lunacy'' the U.S. demand that Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega resign. Rognoni told a news conference here, ``Just as the
United States does not negotiate over hostages, neither do we.''
   Romero had come back on May 6 from an international conference
of Christian Democratic leaders in Miami, but was detained upon
arrival by police and held overnight.
   Party President Ricardo Arias Calderon said Romero was beaten
during an interrogation before being put on a plane back to Miami
the following day.
   On Monday, Romero told about 40 supporters who showed up to
greet him: ``This kind of action makes us tougher for the fight we
will keep up until the end.''
   The Christian Democrats oppose Noriega, who as head of the
15,000-member Defense Forces is also de facto leader in Panama.
Noriega has been under U.S. indictment in Florida since February on
drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
   The Reagan administration has been pressuring the general to
relinquish power, applying economic sanctions and freezing
Panamanian bank accounts in the United States.
   Rognoni called U.S. pressure ``a new form of state terrorism,''
and said: ``Today the world has changed and it is a brand new world
for Panama.''
   He outlined an economic recovery plan designed to definitively
and drastically reduce Panamanian dependence on the United States,
including the pursuit of new markets and sources of investment
outside North America, which has always been Panama's major
economic partner.
   ``What has happened because of the economic aggression has come
to help the Panamanian people, because it has taught them they
cannot trust or depend on the United States as a true friend,'' the
commerce minister said.
   He said secret talks here in recent weeks between State
Department envoy Michael Kozak and Noriega's representatives are
positive ``because we did not call them, we did not ask them to
come. They came on their own, which means they must be
re-evaulating and rethinking their policies toward Panama.''
   He said the discussions did not amount to negotiations because
``the U.S. can drop the indictments and lift the sanctions
unilaterally, without having to negotiate with anyone.''
   Asked if Kozak and Noriega's people were talking about Noriega's
abandoning his post, Rognoni replied: ``The United States makes a
mistake when it thinks that because of its power, because of its
arrogance or capacity to exert force, it can tell a country who
should be its president or who should be its chief of firemen or
police.
   ``To ask that a commander retire, or what's more, that he leave
the country, as if he were on some kind of parole, is lunacy.''
   Rognoni said the talks between Kozak and Noriega's
representatives included three main areas: political implications
of the crisis, economic effects of U.S. sanctions and the affairs
of Noriega with the U.S. Department of Justice.
   Rognoni said ``a full review'' of U.S.-Panamanian relations was
needed.
   ``I doubt very much that the U.S. thinks that after all they
have done all they have to do is send a secret envoy and everyone
will kiss and make up,'' he said.
   ``We need to negotiate whether we feel comfortable with the
threat from the U.S. that at any moment they can block our accounts
and close our banking center and destroy our economy depending on
the whims of whoever is in office in the U.S.
   ``And we have to rethink and retalk with them if we are going to
allow them to use their military bases in Panama for whatever
purpose in Central America without our knowledge and approval,'' he
added.
   The United States maintains about 10,000 soldiers along the
Panama Canal. According to the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, complete
control of the waterway and the bases is to be handed over to
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.

<HEAD>Scientists Look To Save Endangered Turtle Species</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ It's graduation day Tuesday for some 1,100
Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, the most endangered sea turtle.
   Marine biologists hope the turtles, released into the Gulf of
Mexico after being raised in captivity, will someday return to the
Gulf's beaches to nest. Survival of the species is the goal.
   Tuesday's freedom for members of the species known as
Lepidochelys kempi is the 10th annual turtle release, and experts
still are waiting to see if the experiment to bolster the animal's
population is a success.
   None of the 12,422 turtles raised and released by the National
Marine Fisheries Service in Galveston since the so-called ``head
start'' program began in 1977 has returned to the western Gulf of
Mexico beaches to nest.
   ``You have to be patient to be a sea turtle scientist,'' Charles
W. Caillouet, chief of the Life Studies Division at the service's
Galveston laboratory, said Monday.
   This latest senior class spent its entire lifetime
circumnavigating small circular tubs, one turtle to each container,
stored in climate-controlled greenhouses.
   Early Tuesday, three truckloads of cardboard boxes carrying the
1-and 2-year-old turtles head to Port Aransas about 200 miles away,
where they will be loaded on a boat and taken several miles into
the Gulf off Padre Island.
   ``When that last turtle hits the water, it's like a lead weight
has been lifted off our backs,'' said Tim Fontaine, a research
fishery biologist. ``We've done our job.''
   Fontaine has overseen the growth of the turtles since they were
3 to 5 days old, about the size of silver dollars and weighing less
than an ounce.
   Today the year-old turtles weigh about 2{ pounds each. And for
the first time this year, 98 2-year-old turtles weighing about 25
pounds each will be released.
   Biologists hope the more mature animals will stand a better
chance of surviving.
   Scientists are looking for the answer to attract the turtle back
to the western Gulf of Mexico beaches, its only known nesting area.
   Turtle eggs were taken a year ago to the North Padre Island
beach and the hatchlings scurried across the beach into the water
before they were captured and moved to Galveston.
   It's hoped when they reach sexual maturity, the turtles will
return instinctively to the beach.
   ``That's the critical objective,'' Caillouet said. ``It's
documented very clearly our turtles survive for a long time and mix
themselves in with the natural stocks.''
   Galveston-grown turtles marked with metal tags or special skin
grafts or electronic and magnetic devices have been found as far
away as Morocco, France and Newfoundland.
   The mystery, however, is what triggers the animal's nesting and
a return to the Gulf. ``We don't know how long it takes for them to
mature in the wild,'' Caillouet said. ``We would guess we are
looking for 8 to 10 years for early maturity in the wild, but we
really don't know.''
   In the late 1940s, as many as 40,000 turtles nested in a single
day near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, about 200 miles south of
Brownsville, Texas.
   Today, less than 600 turtles nest in the entire season from
April through July or August, Caillouet said. There may be as many
as 100 eggs incubating over 60 days in each nest. Upon hatching,
the tiny turtles flee into the Gulf.
   The decline in population came as the beaches and turtles and
eggs were exploited from the 1940s until the 1960s.
   ``That problem has been resolved, but we yet don't see any of
the increase in the number of nesters,'' Caillouet said. ``So
something's happening to the turtle at sea.''
   Once they reach adult growth, the turtles only known natural
predator is shark. ``They are the bulldogs of the sea,'' says
Fontaine. ``They are a highly agressive animal.''

   The driver of a pickup truck that
collided with a church bus in a fiery weekend crash was charged
with 27 counts of murder Monday after blood tests showed he was
legally drunk at the time.
   Larry Mahoney, 34, of Worthville was served with warrants at
Humana Hospital-University of Louisville, where he is in serious
condition, officials said. A guard has been posted at his door,
police said.
   Carroll County Commonwealth's Attorney John Ackman said he will
not hesitate to seek the death penalty in the Saturday night crash
on Interstate 71 that killed 27 people returning from a church
outing at an amusement park.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said
at a news conference that the converted school bus did not meet
post-1977 safety requirements for a caged fuel tank.
   Joseph T. Nall, an NTSB board member, said the bus's fuel tank
had a 3-inch gash in it and had been pushed back 26 inches by the
impact of the crash.
   When asked if a caged tank might have prevented the fire that
enveloped the bus after the accident, Nall said, ``That's the
ultimate question we'd like to answer, but now it would be
premature.''
   Tests on Mahoney found a .24 blood alcohol level, said Capt.
Neal Brittain of the LaGrange state police post. Under state law, a
blood alcohol level of .10 creates the legal presumption of
intoxication.
   District Judge Stanley Billingsley denied bond. Mahoney will be
arraigned once he is released from the hospital, according to the
district court order.
   The case will go to the grand jury on June 6, Ackman said.
   Federal safety officials began an inquiry Monday into the
collision. Nall said investigators attempted to interview Mahoney
on Monday, but ``he would not talk to investigators for reasons of
his own.''
   Nall also said that the 1977 Superior bus with a Ford chassis,
which the manufacturer said was equipped to carry 66 passengers and
a driver _ the number aboard the night of the crash _ did not
appear to be overloaded.
   Some survivors have said the seats that were supposed to hold
three people were too small, resulting in some people hanging in
the aisle.
   ``It is not something we have corroborated to our
satisfaction,'' said NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock.
   Pollock said investigators on Monday examined the accident site,
about 45 miles northeast of Louisville, where Mahoney's northbound
Toyota pickup truck slammed head-on into the First Assembly of God
bus in the southbound lanes.
   In addition to checking the emergency exit, investigtors would
check the rescue process, maintenance records of the bus and their
drivers' records, said Alan Pollock, a spokesman with the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   ``We also want to talk to some of the survivors and witnesses to
the accident,'' Pollock said, and investigators hope to get ``some
kind of profile on the pickup truck and what it might have been
doing that night.''
   Authorities said it still isn't known why the truck was
traveling the wrong way.
   State officials said they hope to have positive identification
of all the bodies by Tuesday.
   The state medical examiner, Dr. George Nichols, said at a news
conference Monday that all of the victims died from smoke
inhalation. ``There was no significant bodily injury,'' he said.
   The Kentucky Post reported Monday that Mahoney pleaded guilty in
1984 to drunken driving and was fined $300 plus court costs and
$140 for traffic school. His license also was suspended for six
months, the newspaper said.
   His blood-alcohol level in the 1984 case was .16 percent, the
newspaper said.
   A friend of Mahoney's, Dennis Mefford, said he was with Mahoney
until about 2{ hours before the accident occurred. He said Mahoney
was very tired from having worked a double shift at M&T Chemical
Co. in Carrollton.
   ``I can't remember seeing him drive in that bad a shape,''
Mefford said. ``It's really tore everybody up around here that
something his tragic could happen. It's unbelievable, simple
unbelievable.''
   Pollock also said the driving records of Mahoney and the bus
driver, John Pearman, would be reviewed.
   State police trooper Jim Mudd said state police investigators
talked briefly with Mahoney but did not disclose the conversation
because the case is still under investigation.
   Dental charts of the victims were sent to the University of
Louisville on Monday for matching with dental records, said David
Jones of the state medical examiner's office.

   Police on Monday arrested a prominent
leftist political exile, Maria Elena Carrera, who challenged a
banishment order issued by Chile's military regime and slipped back
into the country.
   Mrs. Carrera, a former senator and a prominent member of the
Socialist Party, was arrested at the house of a friend. She had
been staying there since her clandestine return to Chile last
Friday via a mountain road from neighboring Argentina.
   The arrest occurred after she went to Santiago's appeals court
to file a document claiming she was ``exercising my right to live
in my country.'' She had lived in exile since shortly after the
September 1973 military coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to
power and made him president.
   A brief government communique said she will be charged with
illegal entry into Chile. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in
jail.
   Mrs. Carrera is on a list of about 400 Chileans banished by the
military regime for political reasons.

   Americans overwhelmingly favor the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range nuclear missile treaty but share fears in Congress
that Moscow cannot be trusted to comply, according to a Media
General-Associated Press poll.
   The poll also found that Americans view Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev nearly as favorably as they do President Reagan, and
Gorbachev out-polls Reagan among college-educated Americans.
   Seventy-three percent of those polled in the national survey
supported the accord to eliminate medium-range missiles, and as
many said they would back a treaty to cut each nation's long-range
arsenal in half.
   But 61 percent said the Soviets can't be trusted to live up to
their arms control agreements. That reflected sentiment in the
Senate, which last week demanded clarification of the anti-cheating
rules in the pact.
   The poll was conducted among a random sample of 1,204 adults
interviewed by telephone from April 29-May 8, ending less than a
month before Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Moscow.

   U.S. experts on the Soviet Union expect little
from the Moscow summit and are looking beyond it to an early summer
Communist Party conference which by all accounts will be a
watershed in Soviet politics.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev appears likely to survive for at least a
couple more years as the party's general secretary, but he has
failed to gain full control of the policy-making Central Committee,
the 300-plus member body that so far has stymied his far-reaching
reform efforts, according to the experts.
   They view the summit primarily as part of Gorbachev's effort to
cement his control.
   Gorbachev's reforms so far have not improved Soviet living
standards, according to Western dispatches from Moscow and a recent
analysis by the Central Intelligence Agency.

   Duncan was sentenced April 12 in the shooting death of Trooper

<HEAD>India Worried about Shifting Strategic Balance in Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government
sees a shift in the strategic balance in this part of Asia and is
worried that India is losing its traditional edge.
   The fears have prompted the government to increase defense
spending to a record $10 billion this year and to reopen debate on
the development of nuclear weapons.
   ``We can't just keep escalating expenditures to meet the
challenge,'' said Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, director of the
government-funded Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New
Delhi. ``I don't want to see a nuclear India. But the most
cost-effective solution is to go nuclear.''
   India tested a nuclear device in 1974 but insisted it was for
peaceful purposes.
   The concerns about shifts in the strategic balance have been
reflected in recent headlines in Indian newspapers:
   _``Sino-Pakistan-Saudi Ties Threat to India.''
   _``The Afghan Accord _ Dangerous Implications.''
   _``Pakistan Arms Hurt Peace Process.''
   India traditionally has kept a wary eye on Pakistan, its
neighbor on the subcontinent.
   The two countries have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947, and their troops still clash
intermittently along the disputed border in India's northern
Kashmir state. India also has clashed with China over disputed
borders.
   But Pakistan is the chief concern because of repeated reports it
is close to developing a nuclear weapon and because of U.S. plans
to give the Pakistanis $1.7 billion in military aid over the next
six years.
   Indian officials and the press also speculate that with the
Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan now will be
able to turn more attention toward India.
   At the same time, the Indians worry about weapons shifts in
China to the north and Saudi Arabia to the west.
   China has been moving nuclear missiles into Tibet, according to
Western press reports and Indian military experts. It also has been
beefing up its army garrisons to tighten control over the former
Buddhist kingdom.
   Singh, the analyst, said he does not believe the Chinese moves
are aimed directly at India but added that in the long run ``they
constitute a larger level of threat against South Asia.''
   To the west, Saudi Arabia has taken delivery of an undisclosed
number of Chinese-made East Wind surface-to-surface missiles with a
range of almost 2,000 miles, making them capable of reaching India.
   The Saudi missiles are seen as a deterrent to Iran in the
Persian Gulf, but Narendra Gupta, an Indian weapons expert, wrote
in a recent article in the independent Times of India newspaper:
``The same missile system would on the one hand deter Iran for
Saudi Arabia and, on the other, it would be a threat to India on
behalf of Pakistan.''
   One fallout of end of hostilities in Afghanistan, said the
left-leaning weekly Democratic World of New Delhi, is that arms no
longer needed by the Afghan rebels could find their way to both
Pakistani and Indian insurgents, such as the Sikhs extremists in
Punjab.
   ``The other fallout ... could be that Pakistan, relieved of its
anxiety on its western borders, could move its contingents to its
eastern borders'' next to India, the magazine said.
   India has a larger military force than Pakistan _ an army with
1.1 million personnel compared to 450,000 in Pakistan, for example.
But it has China on one side and Pakistan on the other, and its
forces must be used to guard against both.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year campaign to promote
Filipino as the national language has stirred controversy in the
Philippines where more than 80 languages and dialects are spoken.
   In 1973, when he was president, Ferdinand E. Marcos mandated a
policy of using English and Filipino, a Malay language based on the
Tagalog dialect, in elementary and high schools.
   English had been used exclusively in schools since the United
States took control of the Philippines from Spain in 1899 and is
still widely spoken by the educated elite.
   The new constitution, drafted after President Corazon Aquino
took office from Marcos, reinforced the commitment to promote
Filipino while retaining English as a second official language.
Spanish was dropped as an official language.
   Last year, the Education Department declared that English would
no longer be an exclusive language for teaching science and
technology in elementary and high schools and that Filipino should
be developed ``as a linguistic symbol of national unity and
identity.''
   As part of the drive, government television switched its main
evening newscast from English to Filipino. Four of the five private
television stations have expanded the use of Filipino in newscasts.
   Ponciano Pineda, director of the Institute for Philippine
Languages, said the bilingual campaign is designed to ``make
Filipino the language of intellectual pursuit.''
   But the campaign has run into stumbling blocks because of the
nature and background of the language.
   In the 1930s, President Manuel Quezon decreed that the
Manila-area dialect, Tagalog, would become the basis of a national
language.
   But Tagalog is used as the principal language by only about 30
percent of the country's 58 million people. Speakers of various
Visayan dialects, used in the central islands and Mindanao, form a
slight majority.
   To make the decision more palatable to other linguistic groups,
the language was called ``Pilipino'' and later ``Filipino.'' Some
words and grammatical constructions from other native languages
were added.
   That has led to a debate among language scholars over spellings,
as well as the extent to which foreign words, notably English,
should be considered acceptable.
   A group of professors tried to promote phonetic spellings, such
as ``sabjek'' for the English ``subject'' and ``nawn'' for ``noun''
in an effort to mirror Filipino pronunciation.
   Pineda of the languages institute says borrowing of words can be
acceptable if they have been ``Filipinized,'' such as ``kudeta''
for ``coup d'etat.''
   But the widespread use of ``loan words'' has produced what
critics call ``Taglish'' a mix English and Tagalog.
   Educated Filipinos, especially in Manila, frequently switch from
English to Filipino in conversations, beginning a sentence in one
language and ending it in the other.
   Words such as ``magbeysbol,'' or ``to play baseball,'' have
crept into the language. The residue of 350 years of Spanish
colonialism lives on in such words as ``mesa,'' for table and
``tindahan'' from the Spanish ``tienda,'' meaning shop.
   Professor Jesus Ramos, a Filipino-language teacher at the
University of the Philippines, defends the use of English words
because it ``mirrors the use of the national language by all
Filipinos.''
   Most of the nearly 30 newspapers in Manila are published in
English, as are numerous legal documents, magazines and books.
   Mrs. Aquino, who was educated in the United States, uses English
for most of her major speeches. Debates in Congress are normally
conducted in English.
   Critics complain that the bilingual policy has resulted in a
deterioration of English skills. They believe the country should be
promoting English because it affords greater opportunity for study
and work here and abroad.
   But Pineda said: ``The purpose for which we started teaching
English in the 1900s no longer holds. We used to think that only
through the window of English could we look at the picture of life,
but we have discovered that this is not true.''
   Professor Ramos predicts that Filipino eventually will supplant
English and that the need for English loan words will fade.
   ``If English will weaken here, borrowing of English words will
also lessen,'' he said.

   If you're wanted, watch out. NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries'' or Fox Broadcasting's ``America's Most Wanted'' may
send the police to your doorstep.
   Jerry Strickland was arrested in connection with a 1987 Michigan
murder when 20 people recognized him after seeing ``Unsolved
Mysteries'' last February.
   Strickland was watching when he was arrested. He told police it
was his favorite show.
   One fugitive, James Charles Stark, was found on the basis of a
promo for an upcoming episode of ``America's Most Wanted.'' Stark,
convicted three times as a sex offender, was wanted in the murder
of a girl in Banning, Calif., and for the rape of a woman in nearby
Hemet.
   ``America's Most Wanted'' was the highest-rated show on the Fox
network in the most recent rating period.
   Fox contends that 13 dangerous criminals are behind bars today
as a result of profiles in the first 12 weeks of ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   Robert Stack, host of ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' said four cases
have been resolved as a result of that show.
   ``This is a public service,'' said Stack. ``It works. Television
is such a saturation medium. It's like Marshall McLuhan's global
village. People blame television for passive viewing. This is
active viewing, with two-way communications. You can help solve a
mystery.''
   Both shows feature re-enactments of the crimes, often with some
of the real people who were involved.
   ``This program demonstrates that people don't have to resort to
vigilantism to help catch criminals,'' said John Walsh, host of the
Fox show. Walsh has become a national spokesman for victims since
his son, Adam, was abducted and killed seven years ago. The TV
movies ``Adam'' and ``Adam: His Song Continues'' told his story.
   ``I think these shows are also popular because people are fed up
with the level of violence in this country,'' said Walsh.
``Washington is now the murder capital of the United States. Can
you imagine, the nation's capital, and it's ahead of Miami, Detroit
and New York in murders!''
   Walsh, whose diligence got Congress to pass legislation to aid
in the location of missing children and set up a center in
Washington, said, ``I think people realize this is a great country
and we have great resources and there's no reason for violence.
People are sick of it.''
   The basic difference between the shows is that ``America's Most
Wanted'' deals only with fugitive criminals. ``Unsolved Mysteries''
gets into all types of unsolved events and missing persons.
``America's Most Wanted'' is a weekly show on the Fox network.
``Unsolved Mysteries'' appears as an occasional special on NBC, the
next scheduled for Wednesday, May 25.
   ``Many of our stories deal with normal people in abnormal
situations,'' said Stack, best known for his role as Eliot Ness on
``The Untouchables'' television series a generation ago.
   ``I don't have much sympathy for hoodlums,'' he said. ``I would
never allow a hoodlum to be sympathetic on `The Untouchables.' They
recently made a movie about Frank Nitti and made him to be a normal
person. These were psychotic killers.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   A LETTER IN THE MAIL _ Viewers for Quality Television is asking
Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, to save ``A Year
in the Life.'' The organization previously helped rescue CBS'
``Cagney & Lacey'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' VQT director Dorothy
Swanson said in a letter to Tartikoff that canceling the show would
be tantamount to ``a form of book burning, because `Year' is like a
good novel, we `read' a chapter each week, and we aren't finished
with this novel yet.'' ...
   COMEDY FEST _ Canadian comic actor John Candy will be host July
23 of the sixth annual Montreal International Comedy Festival to be
carried live on HBO. Other participants will be announced later.
Candy, who recently co-starred with Steve Martin in ``Planes,
Trains and Automobiles,'' is an alumnus of ``SCTV.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Every kid with a cane pole and a can of worms
knows the joy of fishing. One of four Americans fish for fun. Among
them, the self-anointed elite are the 6.4 million fly fishermen. To
them, hooking a trout can be like a religious experience, and their
numbers are growing along with their passion. This is the first of
three articles.

   As Johnny France remembers it, he was a boy
roaming wild in the Bear Trap Canyon when he first saw her.
   ``She was standing up on her hind legs, staring straight down
into the river as it swirled around her. Every once in a while her
big paw would shoot out, splashing her, but she kept coming up
empty-handed, either missing completely, or the slippery trout
would wiggle out of her grasp. After a very long time, completely
frustrated and still hungry, that old sow grizzly let out an angry
growl, shook herself off, and walked away in disgust.''
   France likes to tell that tall tale to the fly fishermen he
guides down the Madison River of Montana. It is his home-grown
homily about the humblings of nature on man and beast, his tactful
way of saying fly fishing is the Great Leveler _ it is merciless
toward CEOs, yuppies, one-horse cowpokes, and grizzly bears alike.
   France especially likes to spin his yarn on days when the fish
aren't biting.
   ``2,994 TROUT PER MILE!'' exclaims the State of Montana in
half-page advertisements in fishing magazines, adding its own
codicil for Doubting Thomases: ``Honest...average from five
selected Montana rivers.''
   The ad implies that fishing is so easy in Montana even a child
can do it. But a fly fisherman puts away childish things, like
night crawlers and grasshoppers.
   ``Boys should learn about trout after they have learned about
girls,'' wrote Geoffrey Norman in ``A Fisherman's Seasons.''
``Trout, and trout rivers, are sensuous and unpredictable. They
frustrate more than they reward, and they have a way of making you
feel inadequate.''
   So to be a fly fisherman is to surrender to the complexities of
30,000 fly patterns, the more than 130 different fly rods sold by
the Orvis company alone, and all the nuance and subtlety of the
sport. It is, sometimes, to be skunked, to go home with an empty
creel and dreams of the one that got away.
   ``Whenever we touched the banks of the Yellowstone (River) great
numbers of trout were seen of enormous size, swimming in water
which was so clear that every motion of the fish could be
distinctly seen...Selecting my lightest fly rod, my reel and line
were soon attached...The trout were there, I knew, and I expected
to hook one the instant the flies struck, but I was doomed to
disappointment _ there was no response...I tried every color in my
book, but to no purpose...I spent an hour without a single rise,
and at length gave it up.''
   Thus wrote Gen. William Strong in 1875 during a military
expedition through the Yellowstone country of Montana and Wyoming.
   American Indians fished for food long before Plymouth Rock, but
fly fishing was imported by British and European immigrants.
There's evidence it was practiced for sport on Eastern rivers as
far back as the Revolutionary War.
   In much of the Old Country most good fishing streams are
privately owned with no public access. Democracy gave all citizens
the right to fish the United States' public waters. That equality
explains why one in four are now fishermen. Anybody with a pole, a
line, and a hook, and who buys a license, can fish on 729 million
acres of federal, state, and municipal public lands.
   But on some days, when the wind isn't just right, or the light
is wrong, or the Great Fish God simply decrees, `No, not in this
space and time,' there will be no taut lines, stopped hearts, or
sparkling rainbows flashing through the air.
   The true mystery of fly fishing is why any trout, salmon,
steelhead (a sea-going rainbow trout), bass, or bonefish is ever
caught by a man or woman dressed up in rubber britches.
   ``It kinda makes you wonder why a fish would pick you,'' mused
France, a 47-year-old cowboy and former sheriff who's fished his
whole life.
   ``Why, with all the billions of bugs flying around and under the
water, would a big brown trout decide to eat mine?''
   Because France knows how to ``read'' water, how to match live
mosquitoes with the dead feathers and hair he ties on his hook, how
to predict the time and distance in a fish's life.
   To know what he knows is a quest which sets millions of men and
more and more women off in search of perfect equipment, perfect
rivers, the angler's equivalent of biblical tomes, and companions
with whom to share the passion and wonder which envelops an angler
the instant he hooks his first fish on an artificial fly.
   ``It was an employment for his idle time, which was then not
idly spent,'' wrote fly fishing's first guru, Izaac Walton, in
``The Compleat Angler.''
   ``...A rest to his mind, a cheerer of his spirits, a diverter of
sadness, a calmer of unquiet thoughts, a moderator of passions, a
procurrer of contentedness...and that it begat habits of peace and
patience in those that professed and practiced it.''
   Three centuries later Norman Maclean published a slim volume
containing a novella and two short stories titled ``A River Runs
Through It'' which has become another classic of the genre.
   ``In our family, there was no clear line between religion and
fly fishing,'' Maclean wrote. ``We lived at the junction of great
trout rivers in western Montana, and our father was a Presbyterian
minister and a fly fisherman who tied his own flies and taught
others. He told us about Christ's disciples being fishermen, and we
were left to assume, as my brother and I did, that all first-class
fishermen on the Sea of Galilee were fly fishermen, and that John,
the favorite, was a dry-fly fisherman.''

<HEAD>ENNIS, Mont.: dry-fly fisherman.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dry flies being, in the lexicon of the sport, the equivalent of
the shoot-out at the OK Corral because they are little fake bugs
which float on top of the water and dare a fish to show itself when
it comes after them.
   Wet flies, which are made of more absorbent materials, sink
below the surface and therefore aren't considered as much fun by
purists.
   And purists there are, by the hundreds of thousands. Unlike
plunk and dunkers who use live bait or shiny lures to spin-cast for
catfish, bluegills, yellow perch, and black crappie, fly fishermen
are elitists.
   It isn't money that sets them apart from other fishermen,
although kings and presidents have commonly been fly fishermen.
   Never mind that today a serious (or just plain rich) angler can
spend thousands on equipment and costume.
   No, say fly fishermen, theirs is an intellectual exercise as
much as a physical workout. It is a sport where no one keeps score,
an avocation demanding as much concentration as a hostile takeover
or a friendly merger.
   ``Calling fishing a hobby is like calling brain surgery a job,''
said Paul Schullery, author of the new book ``American Fly Fishing:
A History.''
   The curious may collect hundreds of volumes on the subject,
dating from ``A Treatise on Fishing With A Hook,'' attributed to
Dame Juliana Berneres in 1496, to Tom Rosenbauer's ``Reading Trout
Streams,'' which is still in print.
   Some of America's noted writers (Ernest Hemingway, Zane Grey)
and artists (Winslow Homer, N. C. Wyeth) labored to transmit to the
unenlightened the joy and frustrations of fly fishing.
   Research can sometimes carry zealots to the outside of the
envelope. Professional angler A. J. McClane has wet a line in 141
countries and lived with Eskimos and Pygmies to learn techniques.
Author and publisher Nick Lyons, wearing goggles, once submerged
himself in a full bathtub to get a trout's-eye view. He said he
didn't learn much.
   The more the mystery deepens, the more the magic beckons.
   Some fly fishermen, especially after a great day on a fine
river, guess that the attraction is linked to man's primeval
origins. They wax poetic about the thrill of the hunt, the
one-on-one battle with a wild creature. Sometimes they compare the
experience to love.
   ``I've guided on the New Fork River (of Wyoming) for 25 years
but I've never landed a trophy on her,'' lamented Jack Dennis Jr.,
of Jackson, Wy. ``There's a certain mystery to that river, like
wondering whatever happened to the girl you loved in high school
but didn't marry.''
   Increasingly, fly fishermen say the thrill of catching a trout
or a steelhead is nearly matched by releasing it to hook again some
other day. On the sections of rivers designated gold medal and blue
ribbon by various agencies, barbless hooks and catch-and-release
regulations are the norm rather than the exception.
   Because cold-water game fish need clear, clean water to survive,
they can often be seen gliding just below the surface. Every year
nearly 180,000 visitors to Yellowstone National Park peer over the
edge of Fishing Bridge, where angling is outlawed, to watch the
fish go by. Just watch.
   The Roman poet Martial (A. D. 40-104) may have been the first to
use a feathered hook to land a saltwater fish. A hundred years
later Macedonian fishermen reportedly were catching trout on fake
flies.
   Through the ages, fishermen landed countless catches using all
kinds of artificial creations. Fly tying itself became an art.
   In 1658 Richard Franck, who served in Oliver Cromwell's army,
noted that the salmon ``delights in the most gaudy and Orient
colors you can choose.''
   Mary Ellen Orvis Marbury, whose father, Charles Orvis, founded
the nation's oldest mail-order company in 1856, was the first
person to organize and categorize fly patterns used in the United
States. She exhibited her own hand-tied flies at the Columbian
World Exposition in Chicago in 1893.
   Today's artificial flies imitate anything from a tiny egg to
snails. Hundreds are on display at the American Museum of Fly
Fishing in Manchester, Vt., which houses the history of the sport
in the New World.
   Men, women and children who wade into a trout stream do it for
their own reasons. But all are bound by unifying skeins. There is
peace in such places, the outer peace of scenery, the inner peace
of reflection.
   For a fly fisherman standing knee-deep in a swiftly flowing
stream of melted snow or a crystalline lake, there is harmony with
earth and sky, a condition increasingly rare in this high-tech,
high-density world.
   Never mind if it's raining. Never mind if the wind blows. Glory
be if it's bracing blue skies, if the trees on the bank are tender
green or autumnal gold, if the breeze is a caress.
   Never mind if the trout aren't biting or the salmon aren't
running. They did yesterday. They will tomorrow. If there's one
commandment all fly fishermen believe in, it is the optimism of
tomorrow.
   For that is the day they will finally land all the ones that got
away.

<DATELINE>GRAYLING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More and more often, the peace and
tranquility of world-class trout streams near here are being
invaded by the distant shriek and explosion of military training.
   It's a collision of two worlds, both economically vital to the
2,000 residents of this northern Lower Peninsula town surrounded by
woods and winding rivers.
   Northeast of town is Camp Grayling, the nation's second-largest
National Guard training post. There, men and women from across the
country train for battle.
   Also to the northeast are branches of the Au Sable River,
classified by outdoors magazines as being among the top fly fishing
streams in the nation. There, men and women seek the serenity of a
shallow river twisting through wooded hills, a favorite habitat of
the trout.
   For nearly 75 years, the two sides have coexisted in relative
harmony. But recently, as the post expands its mission to include
some wintertime training and resort development expands its
holdings, they have butted into each other.
   Within five miles of some small communities, made up partly of
summertime cabins along the Au Sable and Manistee Rivers, are
ranges the Guard periodically bombards with artillery and
air-to-ground shells.
   The Guard mostly uses marker bombs, with a small explosive
charge and plenty of dye to show where a bomb hit. Sometimes, the
real thing _ bombs containing up to 500 pounds of explosives _ are
used.
   ``The Guard activity, the night firing and everything else that
goes on totally destroys the ambiance of the fly fishermen on the
river,'' says Dan Alstott, president of the AuSable Manistee Action
Council, a coalition of conservationists and other groups.
   The branches of the Au Sable, which means ``to the sands'' in
French, wind their way east to Lake Huron.
   Rusty Gates, president of the Anglers of the Au Sable, runs the
16-room Gates' Fishing Lodge on the river, where the trout season
runs from late April through October. Fish may be caught and
released anytime during the year, however.
   ``We've had flames 150 feet high right across the river'' after
Guard bombs started fires, Gates says, adding that he has briefly
evacuated his business three times because of the fires.
   ``They'll be shooting air-to-ground incendiary rockets and
everybody else can't burn trash,'' he says.
   Alstott's group has filed a lawsuit challenging the scope of
training at the camp and seeking to enforce the original agreement,
in 1913, under which only the Michigan militia could train at the
camp.
   One problem is low-flight corridors established years ago,
before multi-engined jets, which are a lot nosier. ``We get
complaints about wrecking peace and quiet,'' says Lt. Col. Brian
Downey, spokesman for the Michigan Guard.
   Occasionally, residents near the ranges report cracked windows
and fallen plaster after an exercise. If an investigation
establishes the damage was caused by the training, the Guard pays
for the repairs.
   One of the bombing ranges is near Guthrie Lake, on the northwest
border of the camp. This spring, Otsego Lake Township Assessor
Lorrie Chapman cut the value of houses off the lake itself by 50
percent.
   ``More than likely,'' she said, ``it's because of the bombing at
the bombing range.''
   To keep the noise down and to streamline training, Downey said a
new computerized mock war zone will be built farther inside the
camp's boundaries.
   Downey said as part of the Army's ``Total Force'' concept, the
Multi-Purpose Range Complex combines tank, infantry and helicopter
training with computerized targets. The range will be nestled
between two rises in the land, which should cut noise, he added.
   Gates' group strongly opposes the complex, saying it lies in the
Au Sable watershed area and, in addition to noise, may result in
pollution of the river because of the explosives.
   In Grayling itself, many in the business community welcome the
Guard. At this summer's peak, about 8,000 troops will train at the
camp.
   ``It's an advantage,'' says Mary Holden, manager of a small
downtown hotel. ``They've kept us in business for years.''

   When Jimmy Carter as president needed to get away for a while
before he went to Camp David with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, his thoughts turned to
fly fishing.
   ``When I was president, Rosalynn and I fly fished out West,'' he
says. On the pre-Camp David trip, ``I took along with me the
briefing books that I would be using to prepare myself for the
Mideast negotiations, so it was a combination of delightful
surroundings, good companions...and also just clearing my mind when
I was ready to embark on one of the major challenges of my
presidency.''
   He now fly fishes throughout the world, but loves to come home
to north Georgia to the little log cabin he furnished with his
handmade wooden furniture.
   ``The cabin is within 20 feet of Turnip Town Creek, which has a
fairly good native population of rainbow trout. It's the perfect
environment for writing in placid, beautiful surroundings, in
almost total isolation. When Rosalynn and I are there, which is
never enough, it makes for good thoughts and productive days.''
   The former president has written a new book, ``An Outdoor
Journal: Reflections and Adventures,'' recalling favorite fishing
experiences. Writing it, he said, was ``a labor of love.''
   Jack Hemingway: ``I bet I was the only American in World War II
who parachuted into Occupied France with a fly rod. I used it,
too.''
   The son of legendary fisherman and writer Ernest Hemingway now
lives in Ketchum, Idaho, between angling excursions to distant
parts of the globe. But some of his most vivid memories are of his
happy days on clear rivers with his father.
   ``When I was 6, before I'd ever picked up a fly rod, I spent one
whole summer watching him fish the Clark's Fork River of the
Yellowstone,'' Hemingway says. ``Finally, at the very end, when I'd
spent the whole summer building up the need to fish, my father
taught me how to cast.''
   Author of ``Misadventures of a Fly Fisherman,'' Jack Hemingway
says his love for the sport has lasted throughout his life. Not so
for his late father.
   ``Dad had a big nice trunk, outfitted with all his rods and
reels and tackle, everything he had collected over his years of fly
fishing'' remembers Hemingway. ``Right after that wonderful summer
on the Clark's Fork, in the fall of 1939, he had the trunk shipped
by railway express, and they lost it. He never trout fished again.
I think it was as if he felt he'd have to start all over again and
it just wasn't worth the trouble.''
   Paul Volcker: ``I took my wife fishing on our honeymoon and she
hasn't been since,'' says the former chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Volcker now teaches at Princeton University and is chairman of a
New York investment banking firm. When he resigned from the Fed
last year, he said he planned to go fishing.
   ``I went maybe eight times last summer, I ought to be doing
more,'' says Volcker, who's cast for trout in Scotland, England,
and Yugoslavia. ``You're out with nature and all that stuff. It's
nice to be more or less alone, testing your wits and skill. But I'm
a real amateur.''
   In the winter, he ties his own flies at his Manhattan home and
plots a warm weather assault on distant rivers, perhaps in New
Zealand or Montana. ``From now on I'm going to grab fishing
whenever I can get it.''
   Linda Morgens: ``On the first date with my future husband my
train into New York was late, so he occupied his time by going to
Abercrombie & Fitch and buying some artificial flies. He was very
surprised when he showed them to me and I started identifying them.
Our mutual enthusiasm for fly fishing was certainly a plus.''
   Mrs. Morgens is a veteran member of Trout Unlimited's board of
directors and chairs the nominating committee.
   ``Both my parents were fishermen _ my mother once held a blue
marlin record _ and since I was an only child I spent a lot of time
doing male sort of things with them. I grew up before the women's
lib thing, so fishing taught me how to do things on my own, taught
me I could go off alone without needing any help. In those days
there weren't that many things which could teach women to be
independent, but fly fishing was one of them.''
   Mrs. Morgens and her husband, Ned, live in South Norwalk, Conn.
   Curt Gowdy, who for 20 years hosted The American Sportsman on
ABC: ``When we'd go fishing, my dad would say, `Curtis, remember
the buffalo. There were millions of them before the white man wiped
them out for money. That could happen to trout, too.' So from the
very beginning, when I learned to fly fish at the age of 8, I was
always a catch-and-release fisherman.''
   He fishes almost everywhere now, and wherever he goes he
preaches conservation.
   Gen. John Pietrowski, commander in chief of the United States
Space Command and the North American Aerospace Command, puts in
crowded workdays in his Colorado Springs headquarters, ``but
sometimes in the evenings I can slip away, up into the mountains,
and fly fish.
   ``I always like to match wits with a trout. It's great when you
win, but the alternative isn't desirable. It's very humbling to
come home empty-handed.''
   William Horn, assistant secretary of the interior, is partial to
fishing in Montana, Alaska and Wyoming, but spends more time
fishing on the East Coast. ``Before I was working and got married
and had kids I went fly fishing 40 or 50 times a year,'' he says.
``Now I'm lucky if I go 15 times a year. But I dream about it a
lot.''
   ``I like companions who have the same appreciation for the
sport's traditions and ethics as I do, and who provide just enough
subtle competition on the stream to make it intriguing.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's now the nation's highest ranking black
Roman Catholic prelate as Atlanta's new archbishop. Like the pope,
Eugene Antonio Marino is regarded as a conservative in theology and
a liberal on some social issues. His first challenge, he says, will
be to gather ``all the sheep into the fold, regardless of color. I
intend to make this clear by the way I exercise my ministry rather
than by anything I say.''

<TEXT>
   After Sunday Mass at the Roman Catholic church
across from the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial, parishioners were
discussing Atlanta's new archbishop, Eugene Antonio Marino.
   ``He's a bishop who happens to be a black man, the way Doug
Williams is a black man who happens to be quarterback of the
Washington Redskins,'' ventured Victor McLemore, a black lawyer who
is president of the parish council at Our Lady of Lourdes.
   ``You mean Bishop Marino already is a winner?'' said Father
Joseph Cavallo, the white pastor of the parish that for 75 years
has been the mother church for Atlanta's black Catholics.
   At Sacred Heart parish on the opposite edge of the downtown
business and hotel district, where Los Angeles manager Tom Lasorda
takes up the collection when the Dodgers are in town, the
predominantly white congregation broke into applause when it was
announced from the altar that Atlanta would have the nation's first
black archbishop.
   There was loud clapping too at the Cathedral of Christ the King
out on Peachtree Road in Buckhead, Atlanta's yuppieland, where
parish council member Richard Farnsworth hailed the appointment as
``fitting for a city so prideful of its race relations.''
   Still in ``deep shock'' over his new job, Marino arrived in town
with an episcopal motto of ``Feed My Lambs'' that told a little
about his priorities for the poor and homeless and a
self-deprecatory joke that told a lot about himself:
   ``This may have come about through misdirected prayer. Some
people were praying for a new archbishop and some were praying even
more fervently for a strong backup quarterback for the Falcons.
Somebody up there sent in the wrong Marino. Instead of Dan from the
Miami Dolphins they got Eugene from the D.C. diocese.''
   His installation on May 5 became the hottest ticket in town.
While the Atlanta Braves were drawing fewer than 4,000 after
opening the season with 10 losses, l0,000 sought admission to the
ceremony, which already had been switched from the cathedral to the
Civic Center, seating 4,600.
   Because of the pro basketball playoffs, the archdiocese was
unable to rent the Omni, where the Democrats will hold their
national convention in July and where the 54-year-old archbishop
might have matched rock star Michael Jackson in playing to a full
house.
   Born in Biloxi, Miss., where he was an altar boy and rode his
bike to ring the 6 a.m. Angelus bell at Our Mother of Sorrows, the
nation's now highest ranking black prelate is realist enough to
know there are vast problems and some murmurs of dissent lurking
beyond the applause.
   The Atlanta archdiocese stretches north to the South Carolina
line and covers 69 counties, some of them lily white and pocketed
with remnants of the Ku Klux Klan. The corporate queen city of the
Sun Belt also witnessed in recent years a white flight to the
northern suburbs just beyond the reach of the gleaming,
graffiti-free subway line.
   In some precincts, Marino's arrival is regarded as proof
positive of what cab driver Ray Herston of Smyrna tells his
passengers: ``Atlanta is a black city. They got Andy Young for
mayor, a black city council president, a black chairman of Fulton
County, and now a black archbishop.''
   In an overall population of 3.7 million, of which about 1
million are black, the archdiocese counts 156,000 Catholics. Just
under 10,000 are black.
   While acknowledging that his appointment gives the Catholic
Church more visibility in the black community and ``is a sign of
hope for all minorities,'' Marino recognizes that his first
challenge will be to gather ``all the sheep into the fold,
regardless of color. I intend to make this clear by the way I
exercise my ministry rather than by anything I say.''
   With Cubans moving in large numbers from Miami and Tampa into
booming Atlanta, the archbishop wishes he had learned more Spanish
at home.
   When his father, Jesus Maria Marino, a baker in Puerto Rico,
migrated to Biloxi and married Lottie Bradford, the family, which
soon numbered eight children, adopted Mississippi's black culture.
   Her father had helped build Our Mother of Sorrows Church, which
like Our Lady of Lourdes in Atlanta, is a national parish with no
regular boundaries serving the black community.
   There was no telephone in the house when Marino was growing up,
``but there were always people poorer than we were.'' He came
``straight home'' from the parish grammar and high school, and
knelt in the living room with the family each evening to recite the
rosary. He credits a strong Catholic upbringing with putting him on
the road to the priesthood at age 18. ``That,'' he adds with a
gentle laugh, ``and the watchful eyes of six sisters,'' one of whom
is now a nun in Baltimore.

   Marino joined the Josephites, a community of blacks and whites
founded in England after the American Civil War to evangelize the
emancipated slaves. Members have included anti-war activist Philip
Berrigan and Biloxi bishop Joseph Howzt among the 12 current
American black bishops at the head of a diocese.
   ``I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime: a black bishop in
Biloxi and now a black archbishop in Atlanta,'' Marino says.
   A few weeks after his ordination on June 6, 1962, young Marino
went into a Biloxi coin laundry with his sister, Katherine, without
seeing the ``Whites Only'' sign in the window. ``I won't say we
were thrown out,'' he wryly recalls, ``but we left in kind of a
hurry.''
   During his 14 years as an auxiliary in Washington, Marino was a
tireless advocate before congressional committees for civil rights,
the poor, homeless and unborn, and alternatives to prison.
   A jogger and physical fitness fan, he often stopped by the
Calvert winter shelter for homeless men across from St. Matthew's
Cathedral on his way to doing the ``super circuit'' of exercise
machines at the YMCA on the corner.
   The new archbishop will find the homeless on the increase in the
bustling ``Big Peach,'' where gentrification, upgrading blighted
neighborhoods with condos and town houses for yuppies and ``DINKS''
(double income, no kids) is making housing too expensive for even
blue-collar whites and blacks.
   From his pastoral work in the nation's capital, Marino is no
stranger to urban crime, the drug scene and youth gangs, which are
also on the rise with Atlanta's economic growth. He testified
movingly before a legislative committee about drugs ``turning our
cities into a nightmare of fear: l3-year-olds carrying automatic
weapons, killing for a jacket or a radio.''
   As vicar general of his order and later as secretary of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Marino gained the
reputation of being ``a priest's priest.'' Colleagues having
problems with alcohol, church discipline or doctrine often confide
in him. His skills here will be tested early in Atlanta.
   A scandal erupted when a grand jury returned an indictment on
charges of molesting four altar boys against a priest who was
quietly allowed to return to his home diocese in England. Similar
cases of pedophilia in recent years have resulted in payments of
millions of dollars to victims by the dioceses of Orlando, Fla.,
New Orleans and St.Paul-Minneapolis.
   Just before Marino took over, an associate pastor in the same
parish as the indicted priest was disciplined by church authorities
and had to apologize from the altar after preaching at Mass that
the pope was ``dead wrong about celibacy.'' The associate pastor
suggested that contributed to the child molestation charges against
his colleague and was responsible for l4 priests leaving the
archdiocese in the past six years.
   Marino's appointment automatically makes him a national black
leader at a time when the Democrats, media-spotlighted by a
powerful Jesse Jackson delegation, will convene in the city that
enshrines civil rights landmarks such as King's grave and the
Ebenezer Baptish Church and is home to Coretta King, Andrew Young,
Julian Bond and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Marino played a large role in arranging the meeting of Pope John
Paul II with black leaders in New Orleans last fall and is one of
the authors of ``What We Have Seen and Heard,'' a pastoral letter
by American black bishops on the status of minorities in the church.
   Like the pope, whom he greatly admires, he is regarded as
conservative in theology and liberal on some social issues.
   During the 19-year reign of Archbishop Thomas Donnellan, who
died in October, the Atlanta archdiocese tripled in population and
the number of parishes grew to 65, more than double.
   ``When Archbishop Donnellan came, St. Patrick's Day was big, but
now I think there'll be a different emphasis,'' mused Cavallo.
``Certainly the church will be more comfortable in the black
community, where before it was more or less by invitation.''
   Despite cross burnings and even church burnings in the past,
Catholics have always been regarded as a lucky omen in Atlanta.
   On that November day in 1864 when Gen. William Sherman's troops
burned the hotels, the jail, the slave market, freight yards,
warehouses and almost eveything else in Atlanta, including the
fire-house, Immaculate Conception Catholic Church was saved after
the Rev. Thomas O'Reilly warned that Irish draftees in Union blue
would mutiny at such a sacrilege. Sherman took the threat so
seriously he spared the Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian and
Baptist churches, and also city hall, which luckily was close by.
   And the great Atlanta fire of May 21, 1917, stopped short of the
business dictrict when Catholics wetted down the roof of Sacred
Heart Church with all available holy water.
   Come what may, Marino is grateful to be absolved from that
enduring airline joke: ``Bound for heaven or hell, change at
Atlanta.''
   ``I've changed planes at this airport countless times,'' he
says, ``but from now on out all my flights will either originate or
terminate at Atlanta.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ At age 20, Walter Polovchak looks like many of
his American peers: brown-haired, average build, casually clad and
wearing a gold chain around his neck. He works in the mail room at
a Chicago public relations firm and aspires to be a TV anchorman.
Eight years ago, he became a media figure when he refused to return
to the Soviet Union with his parents.

   When the kid next door runs away from home, he's
liable to get in trouble with his folks. When Walter Polovchak ran
away from home at age 12, he created an international incident as
``the littlest defector.''
   Eight years later, the Soviet-born Polovchak _ now a U.S.
citizen and still a celebrity of sorts _ has written a book about
his years-long fight for a future in America.
   The battle, fought in the glare of intense media scrutiny,
pitted Polovchak against his Ukrainian parents, the United States
against the Soviet Union, and bleak memories of a faraway village
against the enticements of the American dream.
   ``Everybody says it was Jell-O and bananas. Sure, that was a
little part of it,'' Polovchak says, recalling his child's
perspective when he decided to run away from his parents rather
than return with them to the Soviet Ukraine.
   ``But there were a lot of other things _ like freedoms of
religion and the freedom of movement and freedom of speech.''
   Polovchak has no doubts about the weighty decision he made as a
child.
   ``It was terrifying, but now that I look back on it, I have no
regrets or anything like that,'' he says.
   ``Freedom's Child,'' written by Polovchak with Kevin Klose,
deputy national editor at the Washington Post, and published by
Random House, is intended to serve several purposes: provide
on-the-job-training for a media career, help pay his college
expenses _ and offer a message.
   ``I'd like to get a point across to the American people that
they should appreciate freedom and not take it for granted,''
Polovchak says.
   At age 20, he looks like many of his American peers:
brown-haired, average build, casually clad and wearing a gold chain
around his neck. He works in the mail room at a Chicago public
relations firm.
   He dates _ nobody special, he says _ and likes movies, cars and
skiing.
   And after years as a media subject, Polovchak wants to be a TV
anchorman.
   His story began in 1980 when his parents, Michael and Anna
Polovchak, decided to return to the Ukraine after just six months
in the United States.
   Walter and his sister, Natalie, then 17, refused to go. In July,
they moved in with a cousin, Walter Polowczak.
   Polovchak's book chronicles the hectic years that followed _ the
court hearings, the conflicts with his parents, the times he was
guarded by special federal agents and the trauma of adjusting to a
new country.
   The fierce rebellion by a 12-year-old startled the family and
many others. The Soviet Embassy insisted young Walter had been
kidnapped. Tass, the Soviet news agency, said he had been bribed
with promises of a bike and a car.
   But Polovchak said the groundwork for his revolt was laid in the
Ukrainian village of Sambir.
   ``One of the problems was that my family was never close,''
Polovchak says.
   ``My father was home twice a week, three times a week. My mother
was working afternoons. My grandmother basically brought us up.''
   A year after his grandmother's death in 1979, the family came to
Chicago at the invitation of Walter's aunt.
   But Michael Polovchak wanted to go back home almost from the
start, his son recalls.
   Runaway Walter was granted asylum after the intervention of
then-Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher _ an action his
parents challenged in court. Natalie's decision to stay behind was
uncontested, apparently because of her age.
   The story of his years in the limelight is told in first-person
segments by Polovchak, his sister, his cousin and numerous others
with roles in the long drama _ Julian Kulas, his Ukrainian
attorney; the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented his
parents, and reporters.
   ``I was brought up with reporters on an everyday basis,''
Polovchak recalls. ``After a while, it just became part of my
life.''
   Missing are the recollections of his parents, who returned to
the Soviet Union in 1981. They now live in the Ukrainian village of
Lvov with two younger children. Walter has never seen his youngest
sister, Julia, born in 1983.
   His fight to stay began in juvenile court, after he was picked
up as a runaway.
   It ended in 1985 before a federal appeals court, which ruled his
parents' rights had been violated by U.S. government action that
barred Walter from leaving the country, and ordered a trial on the
issues.
   But by the time the case reached that stage, Polovchak was
nearly 18. He became a U.S. citizen on Oct. 8, 1985, five days
after his birthday.
   He receives little more than holiday greetings from his parents
now.
   ``I'm not mad at them,'' Walter says. ``After all, they are my
parents. I love them. I just had to do what was best for me.''
   He won't consider visiting them because he is afraid he would be
forced to stay in the Soviet Union.
   Kulas believes Polovchak's cousin, Walter, a computer operator,
and his now-married sister, Natalie, helped young Walter through
adolescent crises.
   ``Even if he did go back, I think the parents realize he would
not have been with them very long,'' Kulas says.
   ``He was the youngest defector. We kept saying this really is a
case about freedom.''
   The ACLU contends many U.S. government actions in the case were
strictly political.
   ``When all was said and done...we won every major legal
decision'' for Walter's parents, the group's Chicago director, Jay
Miller, is quoted as saying in the book.
   ``Yet, Walter won, too. The only people who lost were the
parents.''
   Movie rights are being negotiated for Polovchak's story. He
remains a believer in the American dream.
   ``This is a country where, if you want to just get a job and
barely survive, or open your own company and be a millionaire, you
could be happy,'' he says.
   ``I mean, if you've got your mind set on something, do it.
That's what I'm basically doing.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The idea was to build a new capital city to open
up and populate Brazil's empty central region. That it did. The
gleaming, futuristic city also lured throngs of miserably poor
peasants hoping to find jobs. Nobody counted on the resulting
overcrowding in a perimeter of satellite cities. Brasilia, as one
official puts it, is now ``a fantasy island surrounded by misery.''
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was called the Capital of Hope and
the Capital of the Future when it was built 28 years ago, a
modernistic city rising from scratch in the middle of a dry and
barren prairie 750 miles from the sea.
   Today Brazil's capital has become both a capital of despair and
a paradise of plenty, a city of wretched poverty and gleaming
opulence.
   Some say Brasilia is the victim of its own success.
   ``Brasilia was a modern option and was useful because it did
what it set out to do: decentralize the country, build new highways
and transfer the seat of government,'' says Oscar Niemeyer, the
architect of the slick-white linear buildings that are Brasilia's
landmarks.
   ``But Brasilia also symbolizes the spirit of Brazil, which is
discriminatory and lacks social justice,'' adds Niemeyer, now 81.
``Only a revolution will solve our problems.''
   Built to sustain 2 million people by the year 2000, Brasilia's
Federal District already has a population of 1.7 million. By the
end of the century, that number is expected to swell to 4 million,
a population the city cannot support under present conditions.
   ``When it was planned, the growth of the city was not imagined
by anyone,'' says Federal District Gov. Jose de Oliveira Aparecido.
``It is now like a beautiful woman wearing old clothes. It needs to
be modernized.''
   Today, Brasilia has the social ills of other large Brazilian
cities: overcrowding, shantytowns, land invasions, homeless
children and traffic jams.
   A lack of water, magnified by a dry season which sponges
soothing humidity from the air, adds to Brasilia's woes.
   Although Brasilia was planned to house the powerful who run the
political and administrative machinery, the poor are now the
majority.
   Lured by the very promise of the city's founders, the poor come
in tattered clothes and plastic thongs to escape the drought and
famine of the northeast.
   ``They come to find their dreams, but when they get here they
realize it's not the promised land,'' Aparecido says.
   Unable to survive in a city where only the affluent can afford
to live, they end up in one of Brasilia's 11 ``satellite cities,''
located 15 to 80 miles away.
   Federal congresswoman Maria de Lourdes Abadia has called
Brasilia ``a fantasy island surrounded by misery.''
   Ceilandia, one of the poorest satellite cities, didn't exist in
1970 and today has nearly half a million people.
   A promised land-reform program to distribute fertile land to 12
million landless peasants is stalled, attracting even more to the
Capital of Hope.
   Brazil, a developing nation larger than the continental United
States, has 143 million people and the world's eighth-largest
economy. But 70 percent of its people live in dire poverty and earn
less than $45 a week in a country which last year had inflation of
366 percent.
   Unoccupied cultivable land is scarce, and most of it belongs to
just 4 percent of the population, as it has for centuries.
   ``Without land, without money or technology to improve their
lives, the rural workers will continue to invade the city,''
Niemeyer says.
   Brasilia was erected in a flash of resolve. It was the campaign
platform of President Juscelino Kubitschek, who took office in
1956, to create a ``capital that would unite the whole nation.''
   Four years later, on April 21, 1960, as Kubitschek promised,
Brasilia was inaugurated.
   At the time, the capital was Rio de Janeiro, a tropical city of
spectacular mountains and beaches and a vibrant nightlife.
   Few wanted to move to an artificial, barren city full of red
dirt and brush land. Brasilia, far inland in the state of Goias,
didn't even have one river or spring.
   But there was no choice. Many foreign embassies were threatened
with losing accreditation if they didn't move to the new capital.
   ``There was no way of avoiding it. The lungs of Brazil are in
Brasilia. It is center of national power,'' says Aparecido, often
criticized because he spends much time visiting other capitals,
such as Paris and Rome.
   Last year, largely through Aparecido's efforts, Brasilia became
the youngest city to be named by the United Nations as a Patrimony
of Mankind, a cultural and historical heritage.
   Shaped like an airplane, Brasilia's nucleus is called the
``Pilot Plan,'' the design of architect and urbanist Lucio Costa,
now 86.
   In Brasilia's ``cockpit'' is the government, the futuristic
marbled buildings which carry the unmistakable swirling seal of
architect Niemeyer.
   Visitors are drawn to the marbled and spacious presidential
palace, where President Jose Sarney on most Fridays makes a grand
exit, walking down a swooping ramp to his limousine.
   The twin-towered, white-domed Congress, where lawmakers are
writing a new constitution inside chambers connected by underground
tunnels, becomes on weekends a playground for children who climb
the domes like ants on a hill.

   Like rows of disciplined soldiers, identical government
ministries line a wide esplanade that leads into the residential
and commercial sectors.
   In the wings of the Brasilian ``plane'' are businesses and
apartments, called the ``superquadras,'' or superblocks, identified
only by letters and numbers. Most superquadras have their own large
supermarket and smaller bread shops, a Brazilian version of
stop-and-go shopping.
   Landscape artist Roberto Burle Marx relieved Brasilia's cool
uniformity with a mosaic of gardens and trees. The idea was to
accentuate the wide horizons and open sky of a city that had no
hills, forest or sea.
   Brasilia was not planned for pedestrians. By car, it is easy and
fast to drive down its avenues and looping highways.
   But it is difficult and slow to get around if you are one of the
million who pour in daily from the satellite cities to work. There
aren't enough buses, fares are expensive and the ride can be
dangerous. Bad drivers as well as poorly maintained buses account
for 200 accidents a month.
   Maria dos Santos, a maid who works in Brasilia, earns $70
dollars a month. She she spends half that to take three buses into
the city.
   Besides the satellite cities, some 10 ``favelas,'' Portuguese
for ghettos or shantytowns, have recently sprung up, including one
a couple of miles from the Alvorada Palace where Sarney resides.
   An empty lot, usually government property, is an invitation for
squatters to build cardboard houses. Recently, 900 descended on a
plot next to a trendy apartment building.
   With no water or electricity, the settlement was a health hazard
as well as an eyesore. Eventually police on horseback torched the
shacks and dispersed the squatters.
   To keep migrants away, the government has begun paying families
to return to their home states. In its initial stage, few are
taking up the offer.
   The cost of living in Brasilia is about the same as in Rio or
Sao Paulo, but the quality of life can be better for the well-to-do
in Brasilia.
   For example, in the residential area surrounding an artificial
lake, a three-bedroom house with a pool rents for about $1,000 a
month. In Rio, it would be double that.
   Apartments in Brasilia rent for about $200 to $600 a month,
depending on the desirability of the block.
   Aparecido boasts Brasilia ``has the best quality of life of any
city in Brazil. Where else can you have such space for so little?''
   That applies only to the elite.
   In Ceilandia, a simple one-bedroom house with just a kitchen and
bath rents for about $50 a month _ about as much as the occupant
could hope to earn.
   Brasilia has expensive restaurants and cheap restaurants,
nothing in between, with prices at the fine restaurants varying
from $20 to $40 for two people.
   Middle-level professionals such as university professors and
bankers earn $800 to $1000 a month, a lot by Brazilian standards. A
member of Congress, however, gets $7,000 a month, tax exempt.
   For fun, the poor stay in their satellite cities. If they come
in, they can hang out in one of the many corner bars which sell the
popular and cheap sugar cane liquor called ``cachaca,'' or go to a
movie. A meal at a simple restaurant can be less than $5 a person.
   The affluent go to one of the dozen tennis, golf or sailing
clubs along the lake which charge a membership of $60 to $100 a
month.
   Since every other lakeside house has a swimming pool,
entertaining at home is popular. There's not much else to do, with
few museums, theaters and concerts available for either the poor or
rich.
   Niemeyer and Costa have plans for new residential areas to take
the weight off the district's overloaded plane.
   Some officials say Brasilia's most crucial problem is lack of
water.
   The main dam built in the 1960s to supply water for 350,000
people is serving at least twice that many. The artificial lake
used as a humidifier and for sewage drainage is polluted and
infested with hardy weeds.
   For nearly six months a year, Brasilia's humidity levels dip to
below 20 percent. Last year, levels dropped to 7 percent. The
average at the Sahara desert is 13 percent, what the World Health
Organizaton says is the limit for humans.
   Water rationing is now standard during the dry season, but city
water officials foresee harder times.
   ``We need funds to buy technology to clean up the lake and build
another dam and another lake'' says Valdo Roholf, vice president of
Brasilia's water company. ``We say it will be cheaper than building
a new capital.''

   ``I would guess Ted Kennedy might be the exception to the
rule,'' says Joe Grandmaison, Democratic Party chairman in New
Hampshire. ``After you've said you're not going to go for the brass
ring, there's a tendency for you to slip into a less-than-relevant
position.''
   Back in Massachusetts, Kennedy is preparing for a Senate
campaign, holding town meetings throughout the state even though
national GOP strategists hold out little hope of unseating him. His
opponent is former Republican state executive director Joe Malone.
   Kennedy has made his fifth re-election bid a family affair. His
26-year-old son, Ted, and 27-year-old daughter, Kara, are co-chairs
of the re-election effort.
   Critics say that Kennedy's liberal politics are out of step with
the American public and even his own party.
   ``He's the ultra-liberal,'' says Alexander Tennant, executive
director of the Massachusetts Republican Party. ``He's somewhat out
of touch with the average working person.
   ``He believes in government solving problems, and I think a lot
of younger people today believe in free enterprise and helping
others to help themselves, not building a huge bureaucracy where
government is Big Brother.''
   And opponents point to the Rupert Murdoch flap, started when
Kennedy quietly pushed through an amendment to prevent the
publisher from keeping both TV stations and newspapers in Boston
and New York, as an example of arrogance.
   Later this year, he likely will face another wave of controversy
when a Washington publishing house releases a new book about his
1969 accident at Chappaquiddick that killed passenger Mary Jo
Kopechne. The book charges that there was a conspiracy to cover up
Kennedy's role in the accident.
   Kennedy's popularity in Massachusetts overcame the shadows of
Chappaquiddick, but the accident loomed large in his presidential
campaign. Many believe the senator's action, swimming to safety
when Kopechne was trapped in the car and not reporting the accident
until 10 hours later, blocked him from the White House.
   Author Leo Damore says in his new book, ``Senatorial Privilege:
The Chappaquiddick Coverup,'' that Kennedy initially wanted to tell
police that Mary Jo Kopechne was alone in the car when it plunged
off the bridge.
   The book, to be published in June by Regnery Gateway, is based
on exclusive interviews with Joseph Gargan, a cousin and close
friend of the senator who along with another friend, Paul Markham,
returned to the bridge to try to rescue Miss Kopechne from the
submerged car.
   ``Kennedy was having alternative ideas about the situation,''
Damore wrote. ``Why couldn't Mary Jo have been driving the car? Why
couldn't she have let him off and driven to the ferry herself and
made a wrong turn?''
   But Gargan reportedly rejected the idea, noting that the three
did not even know if Miss Kopechne could drive or had a license.
   The book says Kennedy did not decide to tell police that he was
driving until speaking by telephone with aide David Burke. It took
about 10 hours for Kennedy to report the accident, an action that
he later called ``irrational and indefensible and inexcusable and
inexplicable.''
   Kennedy now says running for president again ``has to be
considered unlikely.''
   Yet even if a Democrat is elected this year and re-elected in
1992, Kennedy would only be 64 by the time the next presidential
year rolls around in 1996.
   ``Who knows what the future brings,'' Kerry says. ``In politics,
all things are possible.''

   The trouble with Gary, according to actor
Peter Horton, is that he doesn't want to face the fact that he's
not going to be another Homer or Milton.
   Gary Shepherd, Michael's oldest friend and best man at Michael's
marriage to Hope on ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' simply doesn't want
to grow up. He's a free spirit, and he's having too much fun.
Besides, he's terrified.
   At the moment, Gary is having a fantasy. Dressed as a Viking,
sword in hand, he is confronting the tenure board at the
Philadelphia college where he is a classics professor.
   Horton stands on a tall ladder, beside the raised camera,
looking down at the tenure committee grouped around a conference
table. Technicians blow smoke about the room to enhance the
dream-like atmosphere.
   ``In my fantasy this is the way I'd love to treat the tenure
committee,'' he explains later. ``I come in like Errol Flynn and
bellow, `I challenge you all!' I've been turned down for tenure.
   ``I've been teaching for seven years but I haven't been
conforming to the policies of the institution, so they won't give
it to me. It has to do with Gary growing up. It's eminently
satisfying but it's not a very realistic way to react. When you're
a kid you're passionate for idealism, but you have to temper it as
you grow up or your idealism is useless.''
   Horton notes that in real life he was kicked out of Principia
College in Illinois for a similar attitude. He later finished at
the University of California at Santa Barbara. ``My best course was
Milton's `Paradise Lost,''' he says. ``My worst course was Biology
202. I never studied `Beowulf' until I got this role.''
   The crew is at the Wilshire Ebell Theater to film the sequence
for the show, which focuses on a group of so-called ``yuppies'' and
has become a favorite of college students and the upwardly mobile
thirtyish generation. For the past season, it was tied for 46th
place and among new shows it was tied for eighth place.
   The show also stars Ken Olin as Michael, Mel Harris as Hope,
Timothy Busfield, Polly Draper, Melanie Mayron and Patricia Wettig.
It was created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.
   The episode, which was telecast earlier this month, ended with
Gary losing tenure and appealing the decision.
   Gary is a passionate teacher whose speciality is the classical
epic, such as ``Beowulf'' and ``The Iliad.'' Unfortunately, it
doesn't have much relevance to today's world. He would like to be
like one of his classical heroes, but his discipline melts when
there's an opportunity to go to bed with a pretty coed.
   ``Gary represents the character in all of us who is afraid to
grow up,'' says Horton, who has long blond hair and a thick growth
of stubble on his chin. ``I think the main reason for that is that
he's afraid to admit the end of his potential. When you're growing
up you have a fantasy of what your potential is, but at some point
you have to come to terms with it. He has to face the fact that
he's not going to be a Homer or a Milton or a Mozart. Or even a
college professor.
   ``He's very intelligent and on some levels very wise. He sleeps
around, but he's honest about it. He has his own morality. There's
a much deeper reality to everyday living. How do you define
yourself? Are you able to be a loyal friend and love people? Gary
is a much better friend to Michael than I am to my friends.''
   In the show, Gary and Michael were high school friends who went
to college together. They were involved in politics and
demonstrations.
   ``But as we got older he went into the corporate world and I
tried to stay the same,'' says Horton. ``That provides a lot of the
tension in our relationship. He has a sense of guilt for his
perception that he has forsaken his youthful ideals. On the other
hand, he has become a responsible adult and is a constant reminder
to me of what I should be doing.''
   Horton was born in Bellevue, Wash., but his father's shipping
business took him as a youngster to Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and
the Philippines. ``I remember once in Bangkok a monkey came flying
out of a tree and landed on my shoulders,'' he says. ``I was in
heaven. We spent some time on cargo ships. Once we hit a big storm
and my sister and I put socks on our hands and feet and slid all
over the place.''
   He got his degree in music composition and planned to become a
conductor. ``I got into acting by accident,'' he says. ``I
auditioned for a repertory company in Santa Barbara as a pianist. I
needed the money. I ended up studying with them and stayed for nine
months.''
   Horton appeared in three movies before ``thirtysomething,'' and
in his short career has done almost as much directing as acting. He
has directed several episodes of the series, an ABC Afterschool
Special, a segment of the movie ``Amazon Women on the Moon,'' and
has several projects in development.
   ``I thought I was going to be a conductor,'' he says. ``But
directing is a lot like conducting.''

<TEXT>
   Director Ingmar Bergman has said it took him 50
years to find someone to play his kind of Hamlet.
   The man he chose to portray Shakespeare's melancholy Dane was a
lanky, lean and wild-haired actor named Peter Stormare who, until
he was 22, had never seen a play.
   ``I grew up in the middle of nowhere,'' the 34-year-old Stormare
said recently, describing the small Swedish village of Arbro where
he was raised. ``It was football or drinking wine and beer or going
around in cars. You were not allowed to say `No, I'm staying home
this Saturday night to read a poem or try to write a novelette or
do a painting.' I did have that inside me.''
   It took a while, but Stormare is now a leading member of the
Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden, a world-class theater troupe that
is best known to Americans as the company which staged the world
premiere of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' in
1956.
   Stormare's Hamlet, directed by Bergman, will be seen in the
United States June 8-16 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music before the
Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden moves on to a tour of Japan and
the Soviet Union.
   Stormare looks more like a rock said. ``He was the only stagehand I
met who wanted an explanation or a motivation for bringing a chair
on stage.''
   When he wasn't moving the scenery about, Stormare took acting
lessons from Wigren.
   ``We started with a four-line poem that's very well known in
Sweden,'' Stormare remembers. ``I struggled with that poem for half
a year, trying to understand it. It's a wonderful little poem but I
hate it now.''
   Finally, Stormare was accepted by the drama school which usually
only admits 12 students out of the more than 1,000 that apply each
year.
   ``If you want to become a good actor in Sweden, you go there,''
Stormare says. He stayed for three years, taking classes for 10
months of the year.
   ``I was like a kid at a fair,'' Stormare recalls. ``The school
had everything for its students. Even guitars. We often spent the
nights playing the guitar.''
   When he graduated, Stormare joined the Royal Dramatic Theater.
Critics and audiences first noticed him in a production of ``Class
Enemy'' by British playwright Nigel Williams. Bergman also saw his
galvanizing portrayal of a young London street punk.
   The 69-year-old director cast him in a small role in the film
``Fanny and Alexander.'' Stormare later appeared in Bergman's stage
productions of ``King Lear'' and ``Miss Julie.'' Their latest
project together has been a critically praised revival of ``Long
Day's Journey into Night'' in which Stormare plays the troubled son
Edmund.
   ``Bergman is possessed by storytelling,'' says Stormare,
explaining why the man is such a great director. ``It's a kind of
simplicity. In a way, he uses plays and films to tell his own
story. His heart is in everyone. That's what makes him so
international.''

   Down through the ages, Romania (originally the
region of Dacia) has seen trouble and turmoil. In its early days it
was overrun by Goths, Huns, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars and Mogols.
After that came the Ottoman Turks and later Russians in the role of
protectors. In World War I, Romania was on the side of the Allies;
in World War II it joined the German-led Axis. It fell into the
Soviet bloc after that but more recently has asserted an
independence of Moscow, but is in trouble with the West. Today,
Romanians struggle again _ this time with privation imposed upon
them by their Communist government.

<TEXT>
   On workday mornings, Romanians bustle
through the streets and pile into buses and streetcars. Well
dressed and determined, they present the picture of a modern
society going to work.
   But a closer look reveals a people struggling, a nation with
problems.
   The first clue is the shopping bag; everyone has a shopping bag.
   The second clue is in the eyes; the eyes dart from shop window
to shop window, looking for eggs, flour, sugar, bread, cooking oil,
meat _ anything on the list of staples in short supply.
   In what was once the breadbasket of Europe, Romanians are forced
to live with food rationing, the lack of heat in winter, dim
lighting at night, little gasoline for their cars.
   They are a nation of privation, the result of President Nicolae
Ceausescu's economic gambles in 1970s and early 1980s.
   Romanians are seeing the fruits of their labors flow into the
export market while they are deprived of imported goods as
Ceausescu seeks to pay the nation's foreign debt through austerity
at home.
   Around corners, away from the main streets, people stand in
lines that sometimes stretch the length of a block, waiting for a
daily ration of bread, or a bottle of milk.
   At 6:00 a.m. one recent day, a woman was seen handing bottles of
milk out of a grating at the side of a shop. The store itself is
closed and dark. The dawn transactions seemed outside official
sanction.
   When bread is available, people tote it away by the armfuls,
sometimes biting off chunks as they make their way home.
   Pedestrians who have managed to find eggs weave precariously
through traffic, careful not to break any.
   Except in major hotels, the lighting is kept low to save
electricity. Escalators in department stores have stopped running.
   Not long ago things looked much better for Romanians. The nation
still had oil and natural gas, agricultural abundance and a budding
heavy industry. Ceausescu dealt more with the West, which made him
a maverick in the Soviet bloc.
   Ceausescu's crash economic development stressed energy-intensive
industries, such as petrochemicals, aluminum and steel. But with
dwindling domestic oil reserves, Romania had to rely on imports to
feed huge oil-refining complexes built in the 1960s and the early
1970s when oil was cheap.
   Romania also had to borrow heavily from the West and by 1981 the
foreign debt had reached more than $11 billion.
   Ceausescu has never explained his reasoning for pursuing a
course that has brought so much hardship to his 23 million people.
   Some Romanians and Western diplomats say it is personal ambition.
   Ceausescu has built a personality cult around him unrivaled by
other current Soviet-bloc leaders.
   Even his East bloc allies criticize him and he has estranged
himself from the West, which he once courted as it courted him. He
no longer has special trade privileges with the United States.
   Romania is drawing more and more into isolation as its people
struggle to live from one day to the next.
   They face cold winters in badly heated and dimly lit apartments
because of the decline in oil resources _ from an annual production
of 980 million barrels a decade ago to 70 million now.
   The use of private cars has been banned four winters in a row.
Gasoline is rationed.
   People park their cars in lines at gas stations, even though
they are closed, to be ready for the next delivery of gasoline.
   The bright spring in Romania, with flowers in full bloom, people
carrying fresh bouquets, and women chicly dressed in Western
styles, hides the strains of a hard winter just past, the daily
struggle for food and the lack of freedom of information and of
speech.
   Public dissent is muted, due to what Western diplomats call
``the Romanian character'' (Romanians have seldom revolted) and to
an effective ``repressive apparatus.''

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 people marched in the central city of Brasov this
past November to demand higher wages, more food and for Ceausescu
to resign. But the diplomats say the formation of a mass movement
like the Solidarity trade union in Poland is unlikely in Romania.
   Romanians express their dissatisfaction only in whispers.
   One whispered story, intended as a joke, is about a Romanian who
regularly asks at Communist Party meetings, ``Where has all the
meat gone?'' He soon disappears. When his companion asks what
happened to his friend, he is greeted with stony silence.
   Since the Brasov protest, diplomats have noted tightened
security and more uniformed militia in towns and cities.
Foreigners' movements are increasingly restricted; some Western
journalists have been picked up by police or expelled.
   Romanians are obliged to report any contacts with foreigners.
Many refuse even to answer a foreigner's request for directions.
   Even the few officials allowed to give interviews to foreigners
do so only on condition they are not identified by name.
   Ceausescu has come under increasing pressure from the West and
even the East bloc over human rights.
   Neighboring Hungary, an ally in the East bloc's Warsaw Pact, has
voiced unprecedented criticism of what it sees as discrimination
against Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority, a highly sensitive
issue for Romanian authorities.
   An AP reporter traveling recently through Transylvania in the
north, where most of the 2 million ethnic Hungarians and 220,000
ethnic Germans live, was picked up by police and told to return
immediately to Bucharest, the capital.
   Despite attempts to attract Western currency through tourism,
foreigners and foreign cars are rare in Romania.
   Children wave and smile when a foreign car passes. Drivers of
the Romanian-made Dacia car, which dominates the roads, often flash
their lights in greeting.
   A more common sight in the countryside are horsedrawn carts
carrying livestock or hay, and exhausted, slumbering farm workers.
   The countryside reveals lush green wheat fields, rich red earth,
freshly tilled for planting, fat pigs and large herds of sheep. But
the eye is often jarred by sprawling chemical plants puffing black
smoke out over the pastures.
   Vegetable supplies at private markets are sparse, mainly root
vegetables or great mounds of paprika spice. There is no fruit.
   While city dwellers line up for hours for food and other
essentials, peasants and villagers must often trudge miles to get
their produce to market.
   Officials say a plan to establish agro-industrial centers and to
modernize cities is aimed at improving living standards.
   An official from the National Council of City Halls said the
project is designed to put industry at the source of raw materials
and provide hospitals, schools and social services for more people.
   In the new centers, he said, one family member could work in
industry, while the rest tilled the land, thus preventing the
traditional drift from rural to urban communities.
   The average monthly wage in Romania is 3,035 lei ($347 at the
official rate of exchange), but farmers' income is lower.
   The agro-industrial centers could mean that as many 6,000
villages eventually will vanish.
   ``It's going to the heart of Romanian society,'' a diplomat
said, noting the project makes it easier to control people and will
strip peasants of what independence they now have.
   In cities, modernization has led to widespread demolition.
   In Bucharest, for example, 28 churches and synagogues have been
destroyed to make way for a palatial center to house Communist
Party headquarters. The building looks out over an avenue more than
a half mile long, lined with sculpted white apartment blocks and
derisively called the ``Champs Elysees of the Balkans'' by
Romanians.
   Work on the project is done night and day. As the city falls
into darkness with only dim street lighting, the floodlit
construction dominates the skyline.

   This picturesque city is the cultural heart
of Romania's Hungarian minority, who have become a cause of
friction between two Soviet bloc allies.
   For centuries, Hungarians, Romanians and Germans fought over and
settled the historic region of Transylvania. They developed a rich
culture and a tradition so intertwined that no part of Transylvania
seems exclusively characteristic of one nationality.
   But since the mid-1980s, this cultural blend has been upset by
an escalating war of words between Romania and Hungary, which have
long contested each other's claims to Transylvania.
   The Hungarian government charges that Romania is discriminating
against 2 million ethnic Hungarians by de-emphasizing the Hungarian
language in education, diluting Hungarian culture by moving more
Romanians into traditional Hungarian areas and sending Hungarians
to work in Romanian areas.
   Similar actions are being taken against Transylvania's 220,000
ethnic Germans, but the Germans have been emigrtating to West
Germany at a rapid rate.
   Since April, official publications in the Hungarian and German
languages have been allowed to use only Romanian versions of place
names. Reports also are circulating that Romanian authorities no
longer are registering typical Hungarian names for Hungarian babies
and that this could also lead to the banning of Hungarian family
names.
   Many street signs in Cluj are still in both Hungarian and
Romanian, but in Tirgu Mures, a town that is 50 percent Hungarian
40 miles to the east, the signs are only in Romanian.
   Hungarian is spoken openly in the region, however. In Cluj,
where about 35 to 40 percent of the population is Hungarian, Roman
Catholic Mass is celebrated daily in Hungarian.
   But the Hungarians are not allowed to subscribe to publications
from Hungary.
   Five years ago, Cluj's university offered instruction in
Hungarian and Romanian, but today Hungarian is used only in one
course, Hungarian philology, which has just five students.
   The German minority has been decreasing steadily for years,
dropping from 800,000 in 1939 to some 220,000 today.
   Ethnic German emigration to West Germany is so rapid that one
small church has seen its parishioners decline from 2,000 to just
over 300 in seven years.

   Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania is
becoming increasingly isolated from both East and West. Its austere
economic and human rights policies are under fire from both sides.
   The official media of Romania's allies in the East bloc's Warsaw
Pact frequently assail Ceausescu's economic austerity at home,
contending that the privation it has imposes upon the nation's 23
million people is excessive.
   In the West, Romania is criticized on human rights grounds. The
United States, for example, had given Most Favored Nation status.
But as a condition for continuing the trade benefits the status
afforded Romania, the United States told Ceausescu he had to
improve human rights conditions _ freedom of speech and religion
and the freedom to emigrate if one wanted to.
   Rather than submit to those conditions, Romania opted out of the
U.S. special trading privileges in February.
   The result is that Romania finds itself in virtual isolation,
although at one time it had played a role as an important mediator,
accepted by East and West, in the Middle East.
   Ceausescu maintains good relations with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestine Liberation Organization leader, and Romania was the only
Soviet bloc country not to break diplomatic relations with Israel
during the Arab-Israeli war in 1967.
   Romania also has been cool to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in
the Soviet Union and the Soviet leader countered a year ago, during
a visit to Bucharest, with an attack on corruption and nepotism.
Nepotism is a sensitive issue in Romania, where Ceausescu's wife,
son, brother and brother-in-law hold high posts in the Communist
Party and government.
   President Richard M. Nixon paved the way for improved relations
with Romania with a visit in 1969 and President Gerald R. Ford came
in 1979. Now, the most senior U.S. visitor has been Deputy
Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, who expressed regret after a
visit this year that he couldn't get the human rights concerns
through to Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu fell into further Western disfavor in January when the
Romanian press published greetings from Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II and the monarchs of Spain, Sweden and Belgium on his 70th
birthday.
   All turned out to be fakes.

   Here are some facts and figures on Romania:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ In southeastern Europe, Romania is about the size of
Oregon and shares borders with Hungary, Yugoslavia, the Soviet
Union and Bulgaria. The Danube forms most of its border with
Bulgaria before it turns northeast and empties into the Black Sea.
Much of the land is rich for farming _ wheat, corn, sugar beets,
potatoes and wine grapes. Northern Romania is dominated by the
Carpathian mountains and the Transylvanian alps.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The population of nearly 23 million includes about
2 million ethnic Hungarians and about 220,000 ethnic Germans.
Romanian is the main language, but Hungarian, Serbian, German, and
Turkish also are spoken. Eighty percent of the population is
Romanian Orthodox Christian and 10 percent are Roman Catholics.
About 22,000 Jews live in Romania.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Industry accounts for around 60 percent of the
gross national product. The economy is export-oriented to earn hard
Western currencies, but this has meant shortages at home of basic
goods. Romania exports machinery, metals, lumber, refined fuels,
textiles and farm products. Its natural resources include oil,
natural gas and coal. Romanians are living through a period of
harsh austerity as the government seeks to pay off a foreign debt
that reached $11 billion in 1981 but now is down to $4.5 billion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ After five centuries of Ottoman rule, Romania gained
its independence in 1877. A monarchy before World War II, the
country was reorganized along Fascist, pro-German lines from 1940
until Aug. 23, 1944, when Romania switched to the Allied side. With
the support of Soviet troops, a Communist-dominated government bloc
won elections in 1946 and in 1955 Romania joined the East bloc's
Warsaw Pact. President Nicolae Ceausescu, who came to power in
1965, is noted for his independent foreign policy, but is under
increasing fire for his domestic policy, including suppression of
dissent and alleged discrimination against the Hungarian minority.

<HEAD>Rambo III Revises Rambo II's Rewrite of Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last time we saw him, he had a question.
``Do we get to win this time?''
   And you did, Rambo II _ with a knife, a bow and arrow and just a
little help from a Vietnamese girlfriend. Three years later comes
``Rambo III,'' and the Vietnam War according to Sylvester Stallone
has come full circle.
   Captured by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Rambo's mentor, Col.
Trautman, explains that wars against determined opponents on their
home ground cannot be won.
   ``We've already had our Vietnam,'' Trautman snarls. ``Now you're
gonna get yours.''
   With that tip of the beret to those gritty guys in the Viet
Cong, Rambo is off to Afghanistan on another private war _ and
maybe nothing's changed at all.
   ``Rambo still thinks that way,'' said Stallone, who also writes
the scripts. ``It's just different characters, see?''
   ``Rambo III'' features more of the cartoonish
``Roadrunner''-style violence of its predecessors, with the
slow-talking, fast-shooting fighting machine joining horse-mounted
holy warriors to subdue Soviet armor.
   It's the same invincible John J. Rambo that delighted President
Reagan at the time of the TWA hijacking in Beirut in 1985. ``After
seeing `Rambo' last night, I know what to do the next time this
happens,'' Reagan joked.
   ``That's wrong,'' Stallone says hotly. ``Rambo goes in to end
conflicts, not initiate them. He didn't go in to kick the Russians'
butts, he went in to get his friends out.''
   David Morrell, the former Iowa State English professor who
introduced Rambo in the novel ``First Blood,'' says he also was
offended by Reagan's jest.
   ``I can't say I was amused,'' Morrell said, ``because I was
distressed by the interpretation of the character. But I was
bemused because it's a way of being told how powerful the character
is. So I was gratified by that.''
   ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' grossed $150 million in U.S.
theaters, spawned a line of fighting dolls and fearsome squirt guns
and made ``Rambo'' a part of the language.
   Reagan's joke marked the first time that any Associated Press
story from Washington mentioned Rambo, but other references
followed. Reagan invoked Rambo again on behalf of tax reform in
September 1985, but mostly Rambo became a term of abuse hurled by
Democrats.
   ``I see where Rambo is now `it' with the young,'' former vice
president Walter Mondale said three years ago, complaining of a
``Rambo streak'' in the White House. ``War is great. You can shoot
and won't be shot. Complexity is blown away by simple violence.''
   Stallone and Morrell, who recently came to New York to promote
the film, both say Rambo is a man of peace, not a jingoistic
murderer but a celluloid descendant of the frontier gunslinger
forced into one last battle.
   ``I find it incredible,'' Stallone says, his voice rising,
``every time some local atrocity occurs where a man puts on fatigue
pants and takes a rifle and goes into a shopping center, it's
`Rambo murderer slays three.'
   ``Rambo doesn't kill innocents. ... He's never killed unarmed
children.''
   In 1985, a 17-year-old in Missouri who had seen ``First Blood''
half a dozen times put on camouflage gear, picked up a kitchen
knife and a pistol and attacked his neighbors. He was convicted of
assault, burglary and armed criminal action.
   ``I can philosophically put it into this bag, that this child
was an accident waiting to happen,'' Stallone says. ``If it wasn't
Rambo, it was going to be another fictional character, which he
would just use as his _ I don't know _ his primer cord.''
   ``I keep close watch of this, and I know of only six cases in
which the Rambo character was blamed for violent events,'' says
Morrell. Three were in the United States, he said, and the others
in England, Australia and Canada.
   ``When I look into these things, what happened was that we were
dealing with psychotics, people who were unbalanced. If it hadn't
been one thing, it would have been that their Rice Krispies didn't
snap, crackle and pop properly in the morning.''
   So what does Rambo stand for? That depends, in part, whether
it's the books or the films.
   Morrell, who had Rambo criticizing U.S. policy in Central
America in his book of ``Rambo II,'' had suggested setting the $63
million ``Rambo III'' in Nicaragua.
   Stallone nixed that, in part because he didn't want another
jungle picture. But if Rambo fears anything, it's controversy.
   ``Until that conflict is really over, or until the line of
demarcation is drawn . . . then I can't jump into that,'' Stallone
said of Nicaragua.
   Afghanistan, however, was one place where Congress and Reagan
agreed on who wore the black hats.
   ``You have 300 million Russians vs. 12 million Afghans who are
undernourished, underarmed, undertrained and they are holding their
own. Finally, after 8{ years they are receiving some assistance,''
Stallone said.
   ``But Rambo doesn't go in to fight Russians. When they accuse me
or my characters of red-bashing, that is irresponsible, because he
never says, `I'm gonna get that dirty commie.' It never came out of
his mouth.''
   Gee, maybe it was all the exploding Russians in ``Rambo II'' or
the hulking Soviet boxer in ``Rocky IV'' that gave the impression
that Stallone harbors strong feelings about Moscow.
   ``I used to think I did,'' he said. ``I understand `glasnost,'
and the Soviets' need to do this. ... I'm all for `glasnost.' I
think the military branch is totally out of line, and they've made
mistakes, and this is their Vietnam.''

<HEAD>NEW YORK: their Vietnam.''</HEAD>

   Perhaps the real villain in Rambo's world is the U.S. government.
   In ``First Blood,'' which became a film in 1982, Rambo wages war
against a sheriff who was a decorated hero of the Korean War. The
story ends with an innocent American town in flames.
   In ``Rambo II,'' he was stranded in enemy territory by a
cynical, lying, high-level bureaucrat who was covering up the
presence of American prisoners in Vietnam.
   The worst that can be said of the U.S. Embassy official in
``Rambo III'' is that he's a little brusque.
   Morrell regards the Rambos II and III as exhibitions of special
effects.
   ``Nobody is pretending that this is great art,'' he says.
   When ``Rambo III'' was screened for critics here, Tri-Star
Pictures filled out the audience with adolescent males who cheered
the title, cheered the first glimpse of Stallone's face, cheered
Rambo's knife and cheered his bow and arrow.
   A head goes through a windshield. ``Yeah!'' Trautman is strung
up by his arms. ``Hahaha!'' Rambo turns a Soviet soldier into an
exploding yo-yo. ``YEAH!''
   ``Who are you?'' the Soviet commander radios. ``Your ... worst
... nightmare,'' Rambo grunts, and the kids dig it.
``Ooooooooooooooo!''
   As absurdities piled up, even the critics were laughing at mass
slaughter.
   In the first book, which had a body count in excess of 200 _
compared to two or three deaths in the first film _ Morrell had
this explanation for Rambo:
   ``He had killed a great many people, and he could pretend their
deaths were necessary because they were all a part of what was
pushing him, making it impossible for someone like him to get
along. But he did not totally believe it. He had enjoyed the fight
too much.''
   Stallone feels the impulse to violence. Even his Lincoln Hawk,
the gentle, arm-wrestling father in ``Over the Top,'' cracked a few
jaws and crashed a truck into a mansion.
   ``I find myself frustrated when words prove futile,'' Stallone
says. ``You're philosophically right, and you're morally right, and
you somehow cannot get your way _ you don't get respect, you don't
get listened to, so you become frustrated.
   ``Yes, I feel that way a lot,'' Stallone admits, ``but I take it
out usually in my scripts.
   ``Like, when you say the `exploding yo-yo,' the Soviet who
explodes, the reason is _ rather than just have him die or be hung,
to have him self-immolate, that to me is kind of a blatant message
that that kind of evil doesn't deserve a resting place.''
   The Rambo of the books has a Hamlet streak, to kill or not to
kill. But Stallone's Rambo won't talk about self-defense or just
wars. His audience, he says, doesn't want lectures.
   ``They know the essence of the character, and they know what he
does best and they want to get to it,'' he says.
   Stallone is already thinking about ``Rambo IV,'' scouting the
globe for a crisis where one mean dude could lend a hand.
   ``Panama is leading up to be a very interesting situation,''
says Stallone, who regards Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as the
perfect villain.
   ``Could you cast a better man? Seriously? I mean, he's God-sent
_ good guy, bad guy, the face, the look, his own private army, the
drugs _ I mean, the canal itself, the importance. Incredible!
That's a scenario.''
   So back to the jungle?
   ``Yeah, go down and teach him how to breakdance,'' Stallone
growls. ``Have a little rap session at Noriega's house this
weekend.''

<HEAD>Sticks and Stones Can't Break Rambo's Bones _ But Oh Those Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

   Sticks, stones, tanks and helicopters can't hurt
Rambo, but critical words are sharper than death for Sylvester
Stallone.
   ``Oh yeah, it hurts,'' says Stallone, and he remembers some that
stung.
   ``Like, `this is a guy who should now consider going to
Louisiana and become a bayou fisherman.' That's a little rough. Or
when someone will say, `his career is stranger than crib death.'''
   It hurts so much he laughs.
   ``In one way it is very humorous. But if I said these things to
a child ... the kid would be in an institution by the time he was
12. He would have no ego. He'd be gone,'' said Stallone, who was
grinding through a full day of interviews to promote the $63
million ``Rambo III.''
   ``I've seen a lot of actors, they get on a bad roll and they
keep descending and the critics keep pounding on them. And maybe
rightly so, but too harshly. I mean, lighten up a little bit or
you'll kill that character.''
   ``Rambo III'' follows the failure of ``Over the Top,'' in which
Stallone played a trucker who wins his son's affection, in part,
through arm-wrestling. ``In `Over the Top,' I just felt that the
movie was what it was, a simple little movie,'' he said. ``It was
sold, I think, improperly because people perceived it as this big
action epic, and it wasn't.''
   Stallone, 41, was all but unknown when ``Rocky'' burst on the
screen in 1976. Made for $1.1 million, ``Rocky'' took in more than
$45 million at the box office, won an Academy Award for best
picture, and received best-actor and best-screenplay nominations
for Stallone.
   Later films have made more money, but none has enjoyed that kind
of critical success.
   ``Rambo III'' figures to be critic-proof, returning to the
violence-laden formula that carried ``Rambo II'' to a worldwide box
office of $270 million.
   ``People say, `yeah, you're giggling all the way to the bank,'''
said Stallone, who picked up nearly $20 million for reprising his
role.
   ``No! No! The money is a result of the success of the film, but
if you are perceived as a failure in the eyes of your peers _ you
see what I mean? _ you have a problem.
   ``It reminds me of the character in `East of Eden,' Jett Rink _
remember that? _ when he has a banquet and no one shows up? He's a
billionaire, and he stands there all alone, and he collapses on the
table. Seating for a thousand, and he's all alone.''
   Stallone, though, expects to keep going for a while, and he
joked about a sequel way down the line: ``We find out that Rambo
had a brother, and it's Rocky Balboa. And they meet, and we do like
a Hayley Mills split screen,'' he said.
   ``We could keep this baby going on forever. I know we're
reaching, it's getting kind of thin on plot, but let's go for it.''
   Stallone has gotten this far on the script:
   ``Why don't you cut your hair, brother?''
   ``Noooooo.''
   Meanwhile, he's scouting ideas for ``Rambo IV,'' and getting
ready for ``Rocky V'' and even talking about ``Cobra II.''
   When it comes to his characters, Stallone is no killer.
   ``It's hard. Not if I like them, no, I really can't,'' he said.
   ``Because I think people die a hundred times over when you keep
them alive. When their honor is gone, and they've been shamed
publicly, or their manhood has been impugned irreparably _ whew!
Death is easy. Living is hard.''
   In terms of critical acceptance, Stallone thinks maybe he should
have followed David Morrell's book, ``First Blood,'' and killed
Rambo in the first film. It was shot that way at first, but wasn't
palatable to test audiences or to the star.
   ``He was a psycho in the book, and being true to that character,
he wiped out everyone,'' Stallone said.
   ``And I think it would have been a great movie on that level
too, but it would have been a harsh expose. I think it would have
received more accolades, that this was an important film like
`Platoon' or `Coming Home' if we had stayed with it, because that
really would have been an indictment.''
   Stallone has talked about playing a Hasidic cowboy, or doing a
film on religion. One project he's given up is starring as Edgar
Allen Poe in a screenplay he wrote years ago.
   Audiences just wouldn't buy it, he said.
   ``I'd be saying, `Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered
weak and weary,' and you know someone would say, `Remember when he
used to carry a gun?' The image of the long hair and headband would
like _ woooooaaaaah! _ be superimposed.
   ``What's he gonna say? `Yo! Quoth the raven! Yo! Poe!'''

<HEAD>Rambo's Creator Wrote an `Anti-War' Novel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   English profressor David Morrell had been
thinking about the returning veterans in his classes, and about a
World War II hero, when he began work in 1969 on his first novel.
   Published in 1972, ``First Blood'' had an angry hero named
Rambo. Ten years later it became a movie starring Sylvester
Stallone.
   ``The original intent was that the first novel would be an
anti-war novel ... to make vivid what it would be like to have a
war in the United States like what was going on in Asia, how
senseless it was,'' Morrell said.
   A secondary theme was the stress suffered by returning veterans.
   The inspiration came from veterans in his classes, Morrell said,
and from the life of Audie Murphy, the actor who was America's most
decorated GI in World War II.
   ``Audie Murphy had done a film called `To Hell and Back' in
which he dramatized his experiences in the war,'' Morrell said.
Before his death in 1971, he had begun a book talking about the
problems he had after coming home, Morrell added.
   The movie version of ``First Blood'' was generally faithful to
the book. Both told of a fight which began with a small-town
sheriff leaning on an unkempt drifter and ended with a town in
flames from the rage of a single Vietnam veteran.
   In the book, Rambo's body count exceeded 200, including some
National Guardsmen shot in retreat. In the film, he killed two or
three.
   Rambo ended the book full of bullet holes and with his head
blown off by his former commanding officer. In the movie, he walked
off in handcuffs, ready for sequels.
   Morrell doesn't mind at all. In fact, he wrote books based on
the first sequel, ``Rambo: First Blood Part II,'' and the upcoming
``Rambo III,'' as well as the first draft of the script for ``Rambo
III.''
   ``Rambo II'' was not only a much bigger film than ``Rambo I,''
but it made the character part of the nation's political vocabulary.
   ``I sort of have to chuckle at that, that I should have invented
a character whose name has entered the language,'' Morrell said.
``As I look back in my lifetime, I guess the only novelist who did
the same is Joseph Heller with `Catch-22.'''
   Morrell owns stock in Carolco, the production company that
bought the film and merchandising rights for Rambo.
   ``I have profit participation in the pictures, and I do have
profit participation in the merchandising, and I also get a flat
fee whenever they make a feature,'' said the author, who came to
New York with Stallone and co-star Richard Crenna to promote the
film. ``And, as you might expect, it's been lucrative.''
   Morrell owns the literary copyright, so he gets the lion's share
of book profits. ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' was a best seller
even before the film came out.
   Morrell's ``Brotherhood of the Rose,'' a book without Rambo, was
picked up by NBC-TV as the basis for a miniseries planned for next
season.
   ``First Blood'' was written while Morrell was earning a
doctorate at Penn State University, and he went on to teach at Iowa
State University before becoming a full-time writer in 1986.
   One of the ironies of the Rambo phenomenon is that neither
Morrell nor Stallone had any part in the Vietnam war. Born in
Canada, Morrell was 23 when he came to the United States in 1967.
And like Stallone, he was something of a tough kid.
   ``My father died in the Second World War. I never knew the
man,'' said Morrell, who grew up in Kitchener-Waterloo near
Toronto. ``I was raised by my mother, who was a single parent for
quite a while, and was forced to give me up at times to a foster
home.
   ``Later _ we didn't have very much money, we didn't get a phone
until I was 12 _ I spent most of my time in back alleys with street
gangs. The guys I hung around with went to prison. I became a
professor.''
   His salvation was the TV show, ``Route 66.'' Morrell identified
with George Maharis' streetwise character, and he wrote a fan
letter to series writer Sterling Silliphant.
   Silliphant's reply, encouraging his young correspondent to take
a stab at writing, is framed and hanging on a wall at home in Iowa
City, Morrell said.
   The Rambo books, he said, deal in some serious issues but are
basically escapism.
   ``Life for most people is at best boring, and I use boring
almost in an existential sense as Sartre does in `Nausea,' where it
weighs you down and you have a powerful sense of what is my reason
for getting up this morning?''
   As his 15-year-old son lay dying of cancer last year, Morrell
said books helped him survive.
   ``I'd be sitting there for like eight hours at a time, and I
would be reading a book by my friend Stephen King. And I don't know
if I could have stayed sane for those eight hours if it hadn't been
for Steve.
   ``I could not have read John Updike under those circumstances.
It would have been too real,'' Morrell said. ``What I needed to do
was get out of that room and, in a sense, get out of my head _ and
Steve did it for me. So if I can do that for somebody else, I think
I've performed a social function.''

<HEAD>Richard Crenna Accidentally Becomes Rambo's Mentor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It all started when Kirk Douglas walked out
on a movie just before the cameras rolled. Now Richard Crenna finds
himself in what could amount to a lifetime job: as mentor-father
figure to the invincible Rambo.
   ``I don't know why (Douglas) left the film, and it's really not
my business,'' recalls Crenna. ``I was sent the script of `First
Blood' and called to the wilds of British Columbia. That was a very
fortuitous call for me.
   ``It's been a real experience, finding myself in this kind of
film and, if you will, this kind of social phenomenon coming out of
the Rambo series.''
   Richard Crenna is no stranger to the show world. At 61 he has
clocked a half-century as a performer, starting as a radio actor at
11.
   ``I was playing six or seven running roles at the same time;
once I did nine,'' he recalled.
   He is a veteran of films (``The Sand Pebbles,'' ``Body Heat'')
and television (``Our Miss Brooks,'' ``The Real McCoys''), but
nothing prepared him for the impact of the ``Rambo'' movies
starring Sylvester Stallone.
   ``The audience's perception of you is related to what you are on
the screen,'' he observed. ``I've been a chameleon in my career;
the audience never knows where they're going to find me. They lift
a rock and there's Crenna.
   ```Rambo' has brought a new kind of recognition. When you're
walking down the streets of New York and you're in a series like
`The Real McCoys,' people want to take you home and give you a
barbecue. When you play an authority figure as I did in the
`Slattery's People' series, they say, `Good afternoon, Mr. Crenna,
are you enjoying your trip?'
   ``Now I'm getting hard hats 14 stories up yelling down, `Hey,
Rich, what's happenin'? Where did you leave Rambo?'''
   Crenna's role as Col. Trautman has been both complementary and
contrasting to John Rambo: the logical, level-headed commander, and
the impetuous fighting machine. Trautman usually shows up before or
after the action, but not in ``Rambo III.''
   ``In this film for the first time, Rambo and Trautman are in
action together,'' Crenna said. ``I was forewarned by Sly, who
called several months before we started and said, `You better get
in shape, Crenna, because I'm going to show you what it's like to
do what I have to do.'
   ``I said, `No, you're kidding, I'm too old to be running up and
down mountains.' He said, `Get in shape.' So for three months I got
in shape, and thank God I did. Because it was a very, very
difficult picture.''
   ``Rambo III'' filmed for 5{ months in Israel, Thailand and Yuma,
Ariz., and the experience reinforced Crenna's awe for Stallone's
dedication: ``He gets up at 5 every morning to work out so he can
stay in shape. In `First Blood' he worked in 40-below weather
wearing a tank top. The temperature reached 130 in the Negev on the
last picture.''
   A conscientious actor, Crenna has tried to bring dimension in a
film series not noted for character development: ``I approach
everything I do with enthusiasm and an attempt to bring honesty to
the character. I try to make Trautman first and foremost a human
being. Then I put on the green beret. Hopefully, I put a human
being under the beret.''
   Viewing his 50 years as an actor, Crenna marveled: ``I don't
know how I've survived. Tenacity, for one thing. Also the fact that
I've never been a so-called `movie star.' I've always considered
myself a working actor; that's what I do for a living.
   ``That's enabled me to discover a lot of things about myself and
my craft. Hopefully, I'll be able to continue until they put me in
a chair, take me out to the home and set me on the lawn.''

   A baby that wakes up and howls at night often is
befuddled and frustrated by an insolvable problem: how to fall back
to sleep.
   Going to sleep is a kind of ritual. For many people, adults as
well as babies, conditions must be just right. A grown-up's nightly
ceremony might involve reading, watching the news or simply rolling
onto one's stomach.
   Babies have going-to-sleep routines, too.
   ``Many children fall asleep on the floor in the living room with
the TV anand everybody milling around. They wake up
in the crib in a dark room in another part of the house with it
quiet,'' says Dr. Richard Ferber, who heads the Center for
Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital here.
   Imagine whad the lights on t it would be like to wake up and discover
your
pillow gone. Would you just drift back to sleep?
   Probably not, says Ferber. More likely, you would snap on the
light and look for it. And if you couldn't find it, you would be as
angry, frustrated and confused as a squalling baby.
   Eventually, everyone learns how to get back to sleep at night
without crying for help. However, Ferber says that for about a
quarter of all parents, children's nighttime crying is a probly D.W. PAGE=

   Pat Robertson suspended his
Republican presidential campaign today with a bow toward George
Bush's ``magnificent effort'' and said he would immediately return
to the helm of his financially-troubled religious broadcasting
network.
   Two months after the Super Tuesday primaries ground to a halt
Robertson's ``invisible army'' of fervent supporters, the former
television evangelist formally took himself out of the GOP
presidential race.
   ``Today I suspend my candidacy for the Republican nomination in
1988 but I do not now nor will I ever suspend my advocacy of
conservative and moral principles,'' Robertson said in front of his
Georgian-style mansion here. ``George Bush has won the nomination.
I applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse his candidacy.''
   Robertson said he filed incorporation papers today for a new
political action committee called ``Americans for the Republic,'' a
group that he said would be ``a rallying point for future political
action.''
   But when pressed about whether he would run again in 1992,
Robertson said, ``That remains a moot question until the 1988
election. I hope Mr. Bush is elected and then re-elected again in
1992.''
   Robertson was accompanied by his wife Dede, his son Tim and a
few aides. There were no other supporters present as Robertson read
his statement for reporters, in stark comparison to the throngs
that greeted Robertson at campaign rallies early in the primary
season.
   Robertson also said he would return to the Christian
Broadcasting Network he founded two decades ago.
   ``At the urging of the board of directors of CBN, I have agreed
to resume the leadership of CBN tomorrow,'' he said.
   He would not discuss further layoffs at the network.
   At the outset of the 1988 presidential race, Robertson was a
wild card.
   The Republican establishment nervously eyed his evangelical
followers and his hefty warchest and wondered what kind of a
showing he might make. Since many Robertson supporters were new to
the political process, his potential impact was difficult to gauge.
   In the end, Robertson spent $22 million and gained only 46
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   Robertson set the stage for his departure last week by endorsing
Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be, who already has a mathematical
lock on the nomination.
   The high point of the Robertson campaign came early on _ the
Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses, where he beat out Bush for second place,
behind Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   But in the next big battle _ the New Hampshire primary _
Robertson finished behind not only Bush and Dole, but also behind
New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.
   Even then, Robertson gave every indication that he expected to
make a comeback in the South, with its March 8 mega-primary.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he told his supporters after the
disappointing showing in New Hampshire, ``tomorrow I go into the
South, and then we are going to be playing in my own backyard.''
   His backyard proved an unfriendly place. In the Southern
primaries, he finished no better than second place _ in Texas _ and
was third in his home state of Virginia.
   Robertson continued to do well in the caucus states, winning in
Hawaii, Nevada, Washington and Alaska, and doing well in Minnesota
and Alaska.
   But by mid-March Robertson was no longer even competing in
states with primaries. He concentrated his scaled-down campaign on
the caucuses, started talking about 1992, and about making his mark
at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans this summer.
   ``I am the true conservative candidate and I will bring that
voice to the convention,'' he said. Robertson said he hoped to
shape the party's platform, bringing it in line with his
conservative views.
   ``I want a platform like the 1984 platform _ for school prayer,
against abortion, for family values,'' he said.
   The Robertson campaign was not without its other-worldly moments.
   On Easter Sunday, Robertson told a Denver congregation his
presidential bid was divinely inspired.
   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _
running for president,'' he said. And it wasn't over yet, he told
the faithful.
   ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundation
for a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... but
I am not going to quit ... that is his plan for me and for this
nation,'' Robertson said.
   Other signposts on the Robertson campaign trail:
   _He sued former Rep. Paul McCloskey for libel when McCloskey
said Robertson used the influence of his father _ then a U.S.
senator from Virginia _ to avoid combat in the Korean War. After
some messy preliminaries, Robertson dropped the suit because it was
to go to trial on Super Tuesday. He was ordered to pay court costs.
   _He contended it was unfair and bigoted to describe him as a
former television evangelist, although that was how he became
famous. He said cable businessman or religious broadcaster would be
more accurate.
   _His claim, in a New Hampshire debate, that there were nuclear
missiles in Cuba aimed at this country. Robertson later said he had
no firsthand information, but insisted that ``nobody really
knows.'' The contention was denied by the White House, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and others.
   _His charges that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger
``wanted to sterilize blacks, Jews, mental defectives, and
fundamentalist Christians.'' Planned Parenthood officials dismissed
the allegation. Scholars who have studied Sanger's writings said
there was no basis for the claim.
   _Robertson's claim that the State Department chose to ignore
intelligence gathered by his Christian Broadcasting Network people
in Beirut on the location of some American hostages. The former CBN
bureau chief in Beirut later said he had no such information.
   _And statements that one can get AIDS through casual contact,
contradicting medical experts' findings on the subject. He also
advocated shooting down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs into
the country.

   Virtually all children free of major medical or
neurological problems have the ability to sleep well, says Dr.
Richard Ferber.
   Ferber, a sleep expert at Children's Hospital, says that beyond
the first six months of infancy, almost every youngster is capable
of going to bed at an appropriate hour, falling asleep within
minutes and staying asleep until a reasonable hour in the morning.
   In his book ``Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems,'' (Simon &
Schuster, $7.95) Ferber lists these additional facts and opinions
about children's sleep:
   _A newborn sleeps 16 or 17 hours a day, while a 1-year-old gets
about 14 hours. By age 3 until adolescence, children gradually need
less sleep. A 12-year-old should get about 10 hours. Needs vary
from child to child.
   _The majority of children don't like to sleep in total darkness,
and there is no reason they should. A night light or hall light
helps children get their bearings if they wake up, especially after
a dream.
   _Children should be put on a regular sleeping schedule. Don't
let a 2- or 3-year-old decide what time to go to bed.
   _Once babies are about 3 months old, they no longer need to be
fed at bedtime and several times during the night. If babies beyond
this age awaken several times and must be fed to go back to sleep,
feeding is causing a sleep problem.

<HEAD>Colic, a Mystery That Causes Most Babies' Crying</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-EXP--Crying Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a baby's first months of life, the most common
cause of crying is something called colic.
   Its cause is unclear, but not its effects: Infants cry
inconsolably, often for hours on end.
   Sometimes their bellies are bulging and gassy. But experts
believe this is a result rather than a cause, because colicky
babies gulp air as they wail.
   Colic eventually goes away, but in the meantime, sleep expert
Dr. Richard Ferber of Children's Hospital says there are a few
things parents can do:
   Sometimes walking the baby or rubbing his back will help. If
this fails, simply leaving the child alone for a while may calm him
down.
   Colicky infants may cry because they are overly sensitive to
things happening around them or they are handled and stimulated too
much.
   If the baby is not easily comforted, leave him alone in his crib
for 15 to 30 minutes. Feeding or gentle, soft-spoken consoling may
then quiet him. If it doesn't, let him cry another 15 to 30 minutes.
   Ferber believes letting babies cry alone this way lets them
release their built-up tensions.

   When the Soviet Union launched Cosmos 1941 on
April 27, it added to the productive satellites in orbit but also
contributed 28 pieces to the junk that circles the Earth.
   Every time a rocket slices through the atmosphere to the void
beyond, it adds to the litter. Some of the 7,110 pieces in orbit
are destined to travel around the globe for all time.
   The United States and Soviet Union are the principal
contributors of man-made objects in space, which range in size from
a screwdriver dropped by a space-walking astronaut to the Soviet
Mir space station.
   Somewhere out there, too _ if they haven't re-entered the
atmosphere and burned up _ are 10 or 12 screws about [-inch in
diameter, missing when the 1984 shuttle mission returned from
repairing the Solar Max satellite.
   Another object that racked up millions of miles before it
finally burned up was the thermal glove that floated out of Gemini
4 in 1965 while Ed White had the hatch open for the first space
walk by an American.
   The U.S. Space Command in Colorado tracks all objects in space
and all countries are obligated to inform one another about their
launches.
   Six days after the Cosmos 1941 launch, in a weekly update, the
space command said 3,246 of the 7,110 pieces they were tracking by
radar came from the Soviet Union. The trackers said they detected
28 new pieces and that eight others had ``decayed'' _ re-entered
the atmosphere _ for a net gain of 20 pieces.
   The United States was responsible for 3,148 pieces, the European
Space Agency, 481; Japan, 82, and France, 40.
   The totals are nearly always three pieces of space debris for
every working satellite. More than half the debris comes from more
than 90 satellites that have exploded unaccountably, according to
Don Kessler, project scientist for debris studies at NASA's Johnson
Space Center.
   Dangerous chunks of shrapnel, whizzing through space at 22,000
mph, also come from spent rocket bodies that shatter when residual
fuels come in contact with each other. ``A 3-millimeter particle
has as much kinetic energy as a bowling ball going 60 miles an hour
and if it hit an electrical component, it would probably cause that
system to cease functioning,'' Kessler said.
   Space shuttle Challenger returned from a mission in June 1983
with a chip in the middle window on the right side of the cockpit.
Chemical analysis showed the culprit was a flake of the paint used
on rockets and payloads. The window had to be replaced.
   Space station planners ``are faced with a considerable design
problem'' because of the junk, Kessler said, and have added 2,000
pounds of shielding to each of the six modules that will be
occupied by astronauts.
   The explosions of satellites or rockets often aren't detected
for a year or more after they occur, he said. A French-made Ariane
rocket blew up nine months after it deposited its cargo in space.
The fragments of that explosion, probably caused by
overpressurization of gases, number 450.
   After six U.S. Delta rocket second stages exploded _ the last in
1981, three years after it was launched _ the manufacturer fixed
the flaw that caused the blasts, leaks in tanks holding fuels that
burn when they combine.

<HEAD>Finding New Tools for Agriculture in a Moldy Mess</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a federal laboratory just up the road from
the University of Georgia sit dozens of Pyrex beakers filled with
moldy Spoon Size Shredded Wheat.
   The mess in the beakers is the work of a self-described
simple-minded Briton who finds in his fungi the stuff of an
agricultural revolution: natural compounds that can do the work of
harmful chemicals.
   Hank Cutler is a plant physiologist at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Richard B. Russell Research Center, a high-rise that
borders the university campus but which few students ever visit.
   To describe his work, Cutler likes to explain how discovery of
penicillin from the penicillium mold turned medicine away from the
use of dangerous metals for drugs and toward the use of natural
antibiotics. ``The same sort of thing is happening in agriculture.
Perhaps now we need agricultural chemicals that are biodegradable
and don't impact the environment.''
   Cutler grows fungi, often using as his medium Spoon Size
Shredded Wheat; with its little cross-hatch pieces, the cereal
seems to work just fine for growing mold. Just add a little yeast
and sugar.
   He later filters the mold to fine compounds that might have some
biological action of their own.
   ``There may be 30, 40, 50 compounds in there, and I've got to
get out the one that's active. That's the art. I see something
interesting in that gunk, and I say, `How the hell am I going to
get it out of there?'''
   Some of the compounds he's found include:
   _Cyclopenin, a chemical from penicillium mold that acts as a
tranquilizer on baby chicks. ``It contains the same structural
elements as diazepam,'' the drug sold as Valium, Cutler said. It
also retards growth in some plants.
   _Cyclopenol, which kills the fungus that caused the great Irish
potato famine and still attacks crops.
   _Cytochalasin-H, which controls flowering in certain plants.
   Cutler's latest discovery is a compound he grew from special
wine grapes and dubbed cinereain.
   ``It's not terribly active, but I bet that it will have
significant pharmaceutical activity'' because structurally it
resembles other compounds used in the pharmaceutical industry, he
said. ``That's a hunch. ... I'm probably dead wrong. But I can
guarantee you it's got biological activity.''
   Cutler's findings on cinereain will be published next month by
the Japanese journal Agricultural and Biological Chemistry. ``I
like to publish on their turf, because I then know that I'm highly
competitive,'' he said.
   Cutler, who's made a career of studying fungi, the last 20 years
in Georgia for the USDA, fears the United States is falling behind
the Far East in agricultural biochemistry. American agriculture has
been liberal with non-biodegradable farm chemicals; Japan, with its
land constraints, has turned to chemicals that don't harm the
environment.
   ``I believe very strongly that within the next five to seven
years we will be importing Japanese agricultural chemicals based on
natural products,'' he said, ``and we'll be wringing our hands _
just like the automobile _ and saying, `Gee whiz, what happened?' ''

   Doxepin, a drug used to treat depression, may be
the latest way to help people quit smoking, a new study suggests.
   Smokers who took doxepin before and during abstinence showed
less craving, anxiety, restlessness and difficulty in concentrating
than those who took a placebo, said researcher Neil Edwards of the
University of Tennessee.
   After eight weeks, nine of 12 doxepin users continued to abstain
from smoking, compared with only one of 13 on the placebo,
according to Edwards, who described the results at a recent
American Psychiatric Association meeting.
   He undertook the study after three psychiatric patients who took
doxepin for depression mentioned they had quit smoking without
withdrawal symptoms.
   The crucial time for relapse extends for a year after quitting,
so studies will have to run at least that long to assess doxepin's
effectiveness, Edwards said. Other treatments also have been
effective in the short term.
   All the subjects had smoked at least five years and averaged 38
cigarettes a day. ``They were significant smokers,'' Edwards said.
   Both groups received individual counseling at weekly sessions,
he said.
   Edwards, whose study was financed by the university, said the
biochemical mechanism for the effect of doxepin in ex-smokers is
not known. Drowsiness, dry mouth and constipation are common side
effects of the drug.

   A baby that wakes up and howls at night often is
frustrated by an insolvable problem: how to fall back to sleep.
   Dr. Richard Ferber of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders
says virtually all healthy, full-term infants can sleep through the
night by age 5 or 6 months. Babies who wake up and cry can usually
develop good sleep habits in three or four nights, or at worst a
week or two.
   The most widely recommended strategy for restoring peace is to
let the child cry. Another is to check on the baby periodically but
resist the urge to give it a bottle. Then there's the relatively
new ``scheduled awakening'' method that involves rousing a child
before it normally wakes you.
   Ferber recommends creating a sleep routine for your child that
he can follow without you being there in the middle of the night.
Start by putting the child to bed while he is awake, in a
reasonably dark, quiet room without being rocked or given a back
rub or pacifier.
   If he cries, wait five minutes, then return and let him know he
hasn't been abandoned. But don't pick him up. If he still cries,
wait 10 minutes and go in briefly. The next time, wait 15 minutes.
Look in every 15 minutes until he falls asleep. Each night, add
five minutes to the waiting periods.
   Inability to get back to sleep is the most common cause of
nighttime crying. Others include ear infections, breathing
difficulties, toilet training, a new bed, starting day care or
fighting between the parents.

<HEAD>Researchers Encouraged By Bone Marrow Technique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they're encouraged by a new
method of fighting one of the main obstacles facing leukemia
victims who need bone marrow transplants: a disease in which the
transplanted marrow attacks the body.
   Graft-versus-host disease is the reverse of the reaction wherein
the body rejects a transplanted organ. Dr. Roy Wu of the National
Cancer Institute says more recipients die from GVHD than from
relapses of their leukemia.
   In the new method, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center researchers
used a centrifuge to remove T-lymphocytes, immune system components
that trigger rejection, then implanted cell-rich marrow necessary
for the production of healthy blood and for successful grafts. They
also administered cyclosporin, an anti-rejection drug that doctors
had been using as part of leukemia treatment.
   The 12-month survival rate for patients treated with cyclosporin
is only about 35 percent. Dr. Albert Donnenberg, of Johns Hopkins,
says 50 percent of patients receiving the new treatment survived
the year. Patients who began the new treatment while in remission
for leukemia had a 63 percent survival rate compared with 39
percent for patients who were in early relapse.
   Donnenberg says it is too early to claim success because the
center has not done a controlled study in which two groups are
treated and studied.

<HEAD>Stress Seems to Play Major Role in Viet Vet Health Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of more than 15,000 American soldiers
indicates that Vietnam veterans were almost twice as likely to
report medical problems as those who served elsewhere, and suggests
the difference may be stress-related.
   ``Vietnam veterans also showed more anxiety and depression in a
battery of psychological tests,'' says the Vietnam Experience
Study. ``Stress can produce anxiety, depression and a variety of
somatic (physical) symptoms.''
   The Centers for Disease Control conducted phone interviews with
7,924 GIs who served in Vietnam in 1965-1971 and 7,364 who served
elsewhere. Extensive physicals were given to a subsample of 2,490
Vietnam veterans and 1,972 others.
   The study found no physical indications of exposure to Agent
Orange and said ``perceived exposure'' to herbicides is linked with
psychological problems and with reported health problems that did
not show up in physical exams.
   Vietnam veterans were almost twice as likely (19.6 percent to
11.1 percent) to report health problems. Yet, doctors who did not
know the military history of the two groups examined them and could
detect few medical differences.
   The Vietnam veterans have a higher incidence of alcohol abuse,
anxiety and depression, greater hearing loss and a measurably lower
sperm count. Fifteen percent suffered symptoms of combat-related
post traumatic stress disorder.
   The study was ordered by Congress as part of veterans benefit
bills passed in 1979 and 1981.

   Scientists plan to entomb a
3,000-year-old mummy dubbed Lady X to test a hermetically sealed
display case designed to prevent the decay of Egypt's mummies and
other antiquities.
   The glass-walled cases will be filled with inert nitrogen gas,
silica gel to keep relative humidity at 30 percent to 40 percent,
and a special powder to destroy any oxygen. Temperatures will be
kept at 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Lady X, believed to have been a commoner, was found near Luxor
in the 1960s and was the first mummy sent out of Egypt since the
remains of Pharaoh Ramses II were taken to Paris in 1976 for
radiation treatment to halt fungal decay.
   She will rest for one to three months in the new display case as

<HEAD>Heart Recipients Have Difficulty Adjusting to New Lives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heart transplant recipients need help learning
to get the most out of life, say researchers who found that more
than half the patients in a new study suffered mood disturbances
and many faced family problems.
   Side effects of post-surgical medication, including headache,
burning pains and reduced sexual performance, cause some of the
problems, according to Peter Shapiro and Donald Kornfeld of
Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New
York. The two studied 73 heart recipients.
   One study group of 30 patients was interviewed up to a year
after surgery; another group of 43 were studied up to six years
after the transplant.
   Thirty-seven patients had mood disturbances such as
demoralization and difficulty adjusting to post-transplant life;
four cases suffered major depression. Fifteen had mood swings,
irritability and argumentativeness. Symptoms began the first few
weeks after surgery and receded as dosages of anti-rejection drugs
were tapered off.
   Twelve patients had family or marital troubles, such as children
running away from home or picking fights with their parents. The
problem was especially common with teen-age sons who resented the
father's trying to re-assert a role of disciplinarian after the
disabling heart condition was over.
   Sixteen patients complained of decreased memory.

<HEAD>Focus Turned From Replacement Artificial Heart to Assist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government, after spending $239.31
million trying to develop a completely artificial human heart, is
turning its attention to smaller pumps that can assist, rather than
replace, a failing heart.
   ``There are still a lot of problems'' that cannot soon be solved
with a total heart replacement device, according to Dr. Claude
Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
Every attempt at replacing human hearts has resulted in a patient
dying of either infection or stroke caused by blood clots that
develop within the mechanical heart.
   The National Institutes of Health now will support only four
grants for development of a self-contained, long-term ``single
ventricular'' device, which would be inserted into the left
ventricle of the heart, the chamber that endures most of the work
stress in the four-chambered human heart.
   The grants will go to Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass.; Abiomed
of Danvers, Mass.; Nimbus Inc. of Sacramento, Calif., and Novacor
of Oakland, Calif.

   Getting and holding a job in the 1990s is
going to be easier than it was this decade as the population ages
and the labor force grows more slowly.
   But getting the good jobs in the fastest-growing fields such as
health services, data processing and management, will require more
education, training and a willingness to develop new skills
periodically, according to experts.
   ``The growth will be predominantly among those occupations
generally requiring post-secondary education,'' says Janet L.
Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``The
greatest decline will be in those jobs generally requiring less
than a high school education.''
   About 38 percent of the 20 million new jobs that the American
economy is expected to create between now and the year 2000 will
require at least one year of college or more, according to
government projections.
   The greatest demand will be for skilled technicians and service
workers, particularly in the computer and medical fields, followed
by managers and sales workers in the skyrocketing number of small
businesses. Together, they will account for half of the new jobs by
the end of the century.
   Not needed are more farmers and private household, forestry and
fishing workers. Employment in all of those fields is expected to
decline from its current level by 3 percent to 6 percent over the
next 12 years.
   And for other less-skilled occupations, such as manual laborers,
operators or assembly line workers, job growth is projected to
climb only a total of 2.5 percent by 2000, in contrast to an 18
percent projected employment growth in the economy as a whole.
   ``It is going to be a lot rougher than it used to be for people
without a high school education,'' says Richard Belous, a labor
market economist for The Conference Board, a business research
group financed largely by Fortune 500 companies.
   ``There has always been a premium on education, but that premium
is increasing,'' Belous said. ``Even traditional industries for
blue-collar workers, such as mining and construction, are becoming
more skill-based, requiring people who can deal with
numerically-controlled equipment, computers and blueprints.''
   Because of the increasing complexity of hospital care, the
biggest demand for any single occupation will be registered nurses,
whose average pay now ranges between $20,000 and $27,000 a year.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment of nurses
will grow 44 percent, or by 612,000, between now and 2000, but
cautions that some career paths will be restricted to those with
bachelor's degrees in the field.
   A dramatic increase in the need for workers exists in all of the
health fields. Among them, job growth is expected to rise 30
percent for dentists, 63 percent for dental hygienists, 75 percent
for medical record technicians, 38 percent for physicians, 65
percent for radiologic tecnologists and 87 percent for physical
therapists.
   Job growth in the relatively young field of physicians
assistants, now with only 26,000 people in it, is expected to climb
57 percent over the next decade.
   And the demand for legal assistants will double, reflecting what
Belous sees as an increasing trend among professionals in all
occupations to turn more of their workload over to
paraprofessionals as the demand for their services increases.
   ``Relatively speaking, these jobs provide good salaries, job
mobility and careers for people who lack the resources or
inclination to attend college for four years,'' he said.
   ``Even the prestigious law and accounting firms are under coming
under such intense cost pressures from their clients that they are
turning more of the routine work that used to be done by senior
partners over to paralegals and para-accountants,'' Belous said.
``The model we're gravitating towards is the dentist's office where
the majority of the patient's time is spent with the hygienist.''
   For college graduates, the biggest job growth will occur among
physicians, an increase of 188,000 by the year 2000; electrical and
electronics engineers, up 192,000, and lawyers, up 191,000.
   The marketing, advertising and public relations fields also will
see a job growth of about 32 percent, according to the government,
as domestic and foreign competiton among buinesses intensifies.
   And employment of social workers is expected to increase by 33
percent in response to the needs of a growing and aging population.
   The computer fields will be the other biggest area of growth,
with the demand for programmers expected to rise 70 percent, or by
335,000, over the next 12 years and for systems analysts by 75
percent of 251,000.
   However, as with most of the new jobs, the prospects for winning
employment will be the best for programmers and systems analysts
with college educations.
   ``Applicants with less than a bachelor's degress and no
experience are likely to face strong competition,'' the Bureau of
Labor Statistics says.
   Familiarity with and knowledge about computers is going to be
more of a prerequisite for jobs in most other fields as well, says
Belous.
   ``Everyone is going to have to become more comfortable with
computers,'' he says, ``even though they are becoming more
`friendly.' And because the days of womb-to-tomb in one corporation
are over, the best advice I have is to always have a current resume
on a floppy disk. It's going to be a much more mobile job
environment.''

   College graduates this year are finding
jobs more easily than the Class of '87, but often with companies
that wouldn't have recruited on campus in the past, according to
placement experts.
   Job candidates also are facing more tests for drug use and
honesty.
   ``We see a very bright outlook for this year's graduates,'' said
Alan E. Yost, assistant executive director of the Bethlehem-based
College Placement Council. ``We are in an expanding economy.''
   Pennsylvania State University students, for example, had nearly
26,000 on-campus interviews this year with business, industry and
government representatives, up from 23,325 last year, said Ralph
DeShong, associate director of career development and placement.
   Temple University had 10 career days on campus when employers
could meet and interview students, said Neil Gutman, director of
career development. In past years it had just six, he said.
   ``The most significant factor for us has been the considerable
increase in less well-known employers,'' Gutman said.
   Pizza companies, a dairy and delicatessen association, and
discount building supply companies are among the employers that
have come to look for management prospects, Gutman said.
   These are employers that wouldn't have been here a few years
ago, he said.
   The trend in part reflects changes in major corporations that
today employ service or consulting firms for work once performed
in-house, Yost said. ``They're bringing fewer people in through the
broad front door,'' he said.
   Last fall's stock market chill appears to have had little effect
on this spring's job prospects.
   ``It did not go unnoticed. We had some students who were
concerned about it,'' DeShong said. ``But we can't say that it has
had an impact. Nor are we hearing students say that offers have
stopped.''
   In its latest survey of salary offers, the College Placement
Council reported employers are offering more money to graduates in
most disciplines.
   Offers to electrical engineering graduates as of March averaged
$2,410 monthly, a 1.4 percent increase since last July; accounting,
$1,975, up 9 percent; and marketing and distribution, $1,742, up
2.7 percent.
   Social workers were being offered an average of $1,420, up 9
percent; communications workers $1,619, up 7.1 percent; and
management consultants, $2,228, up 3.3 percent.
   Offers were lower for graduates in only a few academic
disciplines, such as economics, $1,817 monthly, down 7.8 percent
from last July; chemistry, $2,059, down 3.4 percent; and aerospace
and aeronautical engineering, $2,322, down 0.9 percent.
   Offers as financial analysts averaged $1,940, down 12.4 percent;
banking $1,687, down 10.7 percent; and transportation and
distribution, $1,824, down 2.7 percent.
   But to start earning a paycheck, graduates often must undergo
more rigorous screening than their predecessors.
   In a November 1986 survey of 497 employers, the council found
28.2 percent required tests for drug or alcohol abuse. The council
estimates nearly 60 percent of all employers now use such tests,
Yost said.
   The main reasons cited for drug screening in 1986 were safety
and security, he said.
   ``Students have adjusted fairly well to that,'' said DeShong.
``It's obviously a concern to business, industry and government.''
   Employers are also checking other aspects of employees'
backgrounds more thoroughly.
   ``They seem to be backing off from the lie-detector test, but
there's a pickup in the tests for honesty,'' Yost said, adding that
credentials get a more thorough review today as well.
   ``The employers are getting a lot more cautious about bringing
people aboard,'' Yost said. ``Given the litigiousness of society,
and what a contract implies, they want to be awfully sure going
in.''
   Where students went to college has limited bearing on their
careers.
   A prestigious degree may help a student get the first job, but
not the second one, Yost said.
   ``You can't go into your job and base your performance on your
undergraduate grade point average,'' DeShong said. ``Sooner or
later it's going to come down to productivity.''

   A national shortage of nurses has brought out the imagination in
hospital and state recruiters, who are trying enticements from
higher salaries to recruitment dinners, from pay bonuses for new
nurses to highway billboard advertising.
   Some 300,000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide, with hospital
nursing vacancies nearing 20 percent, according to the American
Nurses Association.
   The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics says the biggest demand
for any single occupation between now and the end of the century
will be registered nurses, whose average pay now ranges between
$20,000 and $27,000 a year. The agency projects the employment of
nurses will grow 44 percent or by 612,000 between now and 2000, but
cautions that some career paths will be restricted to those with
bachelor's degrees in the field.
   While some hospitals have had to close wards because of the
shortage, others are coming up with at least temporary solutions.
   Thousands of foreign nurses have been recruited from overseas in
an effort to ease the shortage in the United States, although that
program has run into some problems with immigration officials
regarding temporary visas.
   In St. Joseph, Mo., the actor who plays the grandfatherly Dr.
   Auschlander in television's ``St. Elsewhere,'' joined a
recruiting drive by Heartland Hospital East. Norman Loyd stars in a
10-minute video to be distributed nationwide in Heartland's search
for nursing personnel. ``Having him in it will be an
attention-getter _ something we hope will catch the eye of nurses
who might be looking for a position,'' said Debi Yancer, associate
director of patient care services.
   
   The video will be shown at career days, placement fairs and at
recruitment dinners that have been spurred by the nationwide
shortage of nurses.
   A plan to train welfare recipients to be registered nurses has
gotten the go-ahead from the administration of Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
G. Thompson, despite criticism from some nurses.
   
   The proposal drew criticism from representatives of the nursing
profession and lawmakers who called it demeaning because it seemed
to ignore the education, skills and dedication needed to become a
nurse.
   The plan is to be implemented through the Wisconsin Employment
and Training Program, commonly called ``workfare.''
   ``We're about 1,000 nurses short in this state. We've got 80,000
to 90,000 people on welfare,'' said state Sen. Joseph Strohl.
``We've got to have 1 percent that have the necessary ingredients
to become a nurse.'' Under the plan, counties that administer job
counseling will encourage welfare recipients to enter nursing
programs at vocational schools. The state will pick up the cost of
tuition and day care, Strohl said.
   Another Wisconsin plan to ease the nursing shortage involved
forgiving some student loans of nurses who go to work in hospitals
or nursing homes.
   In Stafford, Conn., Johnson Memorial Hospital leased a billboard
overlooking a part of an interstate highway, advertising:
``Attention health-care professionals. If you worked at Johnson
Memorial Hospital, you would be home by now.''
   Some hospitals have begun a ``nurses-for-hire'' program, for
nurses who travel the country working a few months at one hospital
before moving on to another.
   In Cincinnati, the Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing is
offering a registered nurse refresher course for those who have
been out of practice for five or more years.
   ``Nurses who left the profession to have families are often
hesitant to come back becuse they fear not understanding new
procedures,'' says Carol Perlman, School of Nursing assistant
director of program development. ``The course will help nurses gain
confidence in dealing with new technology, offer an opportunity to
gradually get back into nursing, and get re-acquainted with their
skills and knowledge of patient care.''
   The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN), which
says 82 percent of the nation's hospitals report a shortage of
critical care nurses, has published a recruitment booklet, a poster
and two videos in an attempt to lure nurses into the career.
   ``Critical care nurses provide a vital role in the quality of
hospital health care, from patient treatment, rehabilitation and
recovery to family support and counseling,'' says Jeanette
Hartshorn, president of AACN and a registered nurse.
   ``It is estimated that by the year 2000,'' she says, ``hospitals
will only care for the most seriously-ill patients. The number of
critical care beds has continued to rise, but the demand for
specially-educated and technologically sophisticated nurses has not
been able to meet the demand; and the demand continues to
increase.''
   A critically ill patient is defined by AACN as one with real or
potential life-threatening health problems.

   An unusual recruiting effort proved that
a job seeker can make progress while stuck in a traffic jam.
   Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford earlier this year leased a
billboard overlooking a busy section of Interstate 91 in Hartford
for two months, advertising openings on its nursing staff.
   The hospital was feeling the impact of the nationwide nursing
shortage, and had been forced to turn patients away or refer them
to other hospitals, officials said.
   The billboard read: ``Attention health-care professionals. If
you worked at Johnson Memorial Hospital, you would be home by now.''
   Stephen E. Torla, vice president of human resources at Johnson
Memorial, said the billboard resulted in five vacancies being
filled and inquiries about employment were received from as far
away as Missouri and New Jersey.
   The billboard was ``good as far as employee moral, good as a
recruitment tool, and good exposure,'' Torla said, adding that
there are still some nursing vacancies at the hospital.
   Elizabeth A. Nelson, vice president of financing at Johnson
Memorial, said the hospital is considering renewing the billboard's
lease to attract other hard-to-find employees such as laboratory
technicians, respiratory therapists and operating room technicians.
   Judith Insinga, planning analyst for Gov. William A. O'Neill's
task force on the nursing shortage, said the Connecticut Hospital
Association reported last December that 11.8 percent of the jobs
for registered nurses in the state are now vacant. That's nearly
1,000 jobs, Insinga said.
   Lynn Steck, national creative director for Patrick Media Group,
which designed the billboard for Johnson Memorial, said other
hospitals are leasing billboard space to draw attention to the
health-care services they offer.
   Patrick Media Group, a billboard advertising company based in
Scranton, Pa., with offices in Hartford, projects that by the end
of 1988, hospitals are projected to rank 11th among the company's
top 25 advertisers listed according to dollar expenditure, she said.
   ``Outdoor ads are a 24-hour-a-day medium which allow the
audience to be moving. It's something you can't turn off,'' Steck
said.
   Meanwhile, Johnson Memorial and other Connecticut hospitals are
using other lures to get and keep nurses.
   Johnson Memorial offers to pay nurses double-time on weekends or
pay for 40 hours if they agree to work four nine-hour shifts.
   Also, the hospital will pay the tuition of an employee who has
worked for a year or more who wishes to train as a nurse's
assistant or a licensed practical nurse.

   As computer data bases, cassettes and compact
discs join newspapers, magazines and books, the United States is
confronting a shortage of public librarians to help sort the flood
of information. ``A large number of librarians will be retiring in
the next five to 10 years and there aren't the numbers coming in to
replace them,'' said Margaret Myers, a personnel expert with the
American Library Association.
   
   She said library schools had 3,538 graduates in 1986, fewer than
half the 8,091 degrees in 1979.
   
   The shortfall comes as the public needs librarians trained to
help ``make sense of ... the new books, data bases, videocassettes,
specialist magazines and countless other media that debut daily,''
Ms. Myers said recently.
   Children's librarians, school media specialists, catalogers and
minority service personnel are in particularly short supply,
experts say. Some openings go unfilled. Others are staffed by less
qualified workers.
   ``In some geographic areas it's a crisis _ New York, Boston, the
East Coast,'' said ALA President Margaret Chisholm. ``There's such
a shortage that it is really affecting services.''
   
   Among the causes cited for the shortage are new corporate
opportunities, an overall increase in the number of public library
jobs and low pay for librarians.
   
   Average starting salaries for New York City librarians with
masters degrees in library science are $22,500, said library
spokeswoman Lauren Moye. A national survey of 1986 library school
masters graduates indicated starting salaries averaged $20,874.
   School librarians averaged $28,390 last year, reference workers
in public and academic libraries were paid an average $23,552 in
1986, and staff in special libraries, including corporations,
averaged $28,943 in 1985, according to studies.
   
   ``Librarians in the West and Southwest tend to make higher
salaries,'' said Ms. Myers. ``Lowest salaries are in the
Southeast.''
   Once one of the few professions open to women, public and school
library careers are now just one of many options.
   
   ``Libraries and nursing cannot compete with law and banking,''
said Ed Szynaka, library director in suburban Pasadena. ``You could
start with a five- figure salary in law that could be as high as
you would ever get in a library career.''
   
   Those who stick with library training are finding better pay
working in corporate libraries and data bases, rather than public
libraries. The corporate openings listed at ALA meetings outstrip
the number of interviewees, said Myers.
   
   A California Library Association report predicts 1988 will bring
364 public, academic and specialized librarian openings, 256 of
them in public libraries. Next year, 446 openings are expected
statewide.
   While the survey projected 60 percent of the openings will be in
public libraries, only 28 percent of the 162 library school
students responding to the survey want public library work.
Thirty-five percent prefer academic libraries and 26 percent
special libraries.
   ``Salaries are better in the private sector than in the public
sector,'' said Mary Sue Farrell, executive director of the state
library association. ``Salaries are better at GTE or IBM than
working for the City of San Francisco.''
   
   Along with the need for children's librarians, the survey also
pinpointed ``an underrepresentation of minorities in the profession
as compared with the population of California, especially among
Hispanics and blacks.''
   With shortages of both children's and school librarians, experts
are worried that young people may not gain the skills needed to
sort information gained from reading books or magazines, typing
queries on a computer terminal, using a microfiche reader, or
viewing from a compact disc. ``If you have a school of 3,000 kids
and you don't have a librarian there, that's a problem,'' said
Bonnie O'Brian, the Los Angeles school library
   supervisor. ``Almost every job people are going into has to do
with information. The only place they can learn that is in the
school library media center.''

   Technology is changing the image of the office secretary.
   A recent survey of 500 American corporations found that 61
percent of the employers hire secretaries with word processing
skills and 57 percent expect secretaries to use personal computers
within two years.
   The survey was conducted by Indianapolis-based ITT Educational
Services Inc., an ITT Corp. subsidiary and a private trainer of
professional secretaries.
   ``Filing and dictation are no longer considered primary
secretarial skill requirements. A secretary in today's workplace
needs to be proficient in world processing, reprographics,
communication distribution and electronic mail,'' said Rene
Champagne, president of ITT Educational Services.
   ``Those secretaries who possess the skills needed to keep up
with new technologies are becoming invaluable to their employer.''
   ``Employers are perceiving secretaries in a new light,'' says
Eleanor P. Vreeland, president of the Katharine Gibbs School, which
conducted a survey of Fortune 500 and other companies. ``The
presence of automation in every office enables secretaries to
devote more time to administrative responsibilities, thus offering
companies a more productive employee.''
   Katharine Gibbs School Inc. is a network of 11 private business
secretarial schools in the Northeast.
   In the Gibbs survey, 51 percent of the respondents acknowledged
a significant increase in the secretary's level of administrative
responsibility; 48 percent saw the need for computer literacy as
another major change.
   Ninety-three percent of the companies surveyed by the
secretarial school agreed that the role of the secretary is
different than it was five years ago. Seventy-five percent said
secretaries must have knowledge of word processing.
   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 300,000
secretarial positions will become available through the 1980s and
80,000 of these will go unfilled because of a lack of unqualified
secretaries.
   ``Good secretaries are hard to find for a number of reasons,''
Miss Vreeland said. ``The baby bust has resulted in fewer people in
the work force, there are more career options open to women, and
the rapid growth of small- to mid-sized businesses has caused
fierce competition for secretaries between companies, especially in
the Northeast.''
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 9.6 percent increase
in secretarial jobs from 1984 to 1995, despite the spread of office
automation.
   Jobs for secretaries, stenographers and typists increased by an
average of 3.3 percent a year between 1982 and 1987, below the rate
for total employment.

   Jobseekers with a disability probably shouldn't mention it on
their resume, waiting instead until they are invited for an
interview, says a University of Michigan administrator.
   Once hired, disabled people have proven themselves to be
important members of the work force in terms of both numbers and
achievement, notes Darlys Vander Beek, director of disabled student
services at the Ann Arbor, Mich., institution.
   Vander Beek says about 14 percent of the labor force has some
kind of disability, 20 percent if substance abusers are included.
   One of the most frequent questions asked by disabled persons is
whether to list a disability on a resume, she says, adding that
some say it is only fair to employers while others believe it may
eliminate the applicant from consideration.
   ``I would say to not put it on a resume unless you are applying
to a place where your disability would be a definite asset, or
where you'll be working with a lot of disabled people,'' Vander
Beek suggests.
   ``Otherwise, don't bring it up until you have been invited for
an interview.''
   Vander Beek says that, legally, potential employers cannot ask
about a disability unless they can prove job performance would be
affected. Studies show, however, that those who openly discuss the
matter with interviewers tend to be more successful in their
job-seeking, she adds.
   But if a disability is not visible and won't affect the job,
don't bring it up, because old stereotypes still linger, she says.

   Public school teachers now earn $28,031 on
average and in 10 states the typical teacher earns more than
$30,000 a year, the National Education Association reports.
   The average classroom teacher, with 15 years of experience, got
a 5.6 percent pay raise last year that boosted her or his salary by
$1,477 from the 1986-87 level of $26,534.
   The union did not estimate how much salaries will rise this
fall, but if teachers get another 5.6 percent increase, they will
be earning $29,600 on average for the 1988-89 school year.
   Teacher salaries have risen sharply in the 1980s amid widespread
concern about lagging standards in the classroom and waning
interest among college students in entering the profession.
Recently, however, with starting salaries topping $20,000 in some
places, interest in teaching has picked up.
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, in a critique on the
impact of school reforms, said teacher salaries have risen 20
percent after adjusting for inflation since 1980-81.
   But the NEA said that over the past decade, including the steep
inflation years of the late 1970s, teacher salaries are up only 7.3
percent after inflation.
   The union said there were 2,275,209 classroom teachers in the
public schools this year, 25,251 more than in 1986-87.
   The entire instructional staff, including principals,
supervisors and specialists, numbered 2,589,148. That was up by
30,190, or 1.2 percent. The average salary for all instructors was
$29,203, up 5.3 percent from $27,722 last year.
   Most teachers work on nine- or 10-month contracts.
   Eighteen states and the District of Columbia pay teachers more
than the national average; 32 states pay less.
   NEA researchers said the $28,031 figure is an estimate based on
salary data compiled from all 50 states. It was up by $1,477, or
5.6 percent, from the union's revised average salary figure of
$26,534 for the 1986-87 year.
   Although only an estimate, the NEA salary figure is widely
cited, including by the U.S. Department of Education, as the most
accurate indicator of how much the nation's nearly 2.3 million
classroom teachers in the public schools are earning. It includes
American Federation of Teachers contracts.

   Unemployment fell in April to 5.4 percent, the
lowest it has been since 1974, with export-led hiring on factory
assembly lines in the industrial heartland leading the latest spurt
of new jobs, the government said.
   The number of Americans at work rose by 606,000 in April while
those listed as unemployed fell by 191,000 to 6.6 million, dropping
joblessness 0.2 percentage points from March's rate of 5.6 percent,
the Labor Department said.
   The rate was the lowest since June 1974 when it also stood at
5.4 percent but at time when the nation was well into a steep
recesssion, in contrast to the current economic expansion.
   The Labor Department said in its report on the job market that
the average hourly wage nationwide in April rose to $9.22, a nickel
over March, for an average annual increase of 5.6 percent. That is
twice the 2.8 percent average increase in hourly wages for all of
1987.
   Growth in new factory jobs, which had been sluggish the previous
three months after rising dramatically in 1987, accounted for more
than one-fourth of the 175,000 increase in employers' payrolls in
April.
   Leading the surge were export-related industries such as
machinery and fabricated metal products. But production jobs in the
U.S. auto industry also climbed by 10,000, reversing wide-scale
layoffs in January and February.
   The jobless rate for adult men fell 0.3 percent points to 4.6
percent in April. For women, it remained unchanged at 4.8 percent.
   Hospital and business services and retail outlets such as stores
and restaurants which had been the hottest areas of job growth the
past year showed a total payroll gain of just 71,000 in April.
   The Labor Department said nearly all of the improvement in the
unemployment figures was among people who had been laid off from
their last jobs, as opposed to those who had quit or were seeking
employment for the first time.
   ``The number of unemployed job losers declined to slightly less
than 3 million and their proportion of the total jobless was at its
lowest point this decade, 44 percent,'' said Janet L. Norwood, the
commissioner of labor statistics.
   Growth in voluntary part-time jobs accounted for two-thirds of
the increase in the number of working Americans in April.
   ``We often fall into the trap of reacting negatively to any job
expansion that is not full time,'' Ms. Norwood told the
congressional Joint Economic Committee. ``But some one out of every
eight workers _ 15 million in all _ do not want full-time jobs.''
   The number of people working part-time because they could not
find full-time work actually fell by 150,000 in April to 5.2
million, still a ``level of concern,'' Ms. Norwood said.

   A liberal arts college degree often has meant prestige and
pride, but little pay in the real world. But there are some
indications that business is acknowledging that there is life after
liberal arts training.
   ``A liberally educated person is still the type of individual
needed at the highest level of corporate life,'' says Robert
Callander, president of Chemical Bank and a Dartmouth College
graduate.
   ``The technical skills are built upon this base. It is this
peculiar mix of sciences, mathematics, history and English that
produces a mind capable, in later life, of bringing mature judgment
to complex _ and sometimes great _ issues,'' he says.
   Many employers look for graduates with the writing and
analytical skills and broad-based education that liberal arts
provide, says Alan P. Goodman, career services director at the
Catholic University of America, in Washington, D.C.
   He says job-seekers should major in a liberal arts field and
take electives such as economics, management or computer sciences,
combine their studies with experience in student government and
work as a college student in a business environment.
   With this concept in mind, many colleges are seeking ways of
providing a broad-based education while preparing students for a
career.
   Many offer internships and cooperative education programs that
provide students with work experience outside the classroom.
   Concordia College, in Moorhead, Minn., offers a combination of a
liberal arts curriculum and vocational preparation _ learning and
earning. Students at Concordia are assigned to a faculty adviser
for involvement in cooperative education programs, internships, or
part-time work related to their major course of study.
   Buena Vista College, in Storm Lake, Iowa, has a program called
``Second Curriculum,'' in which students meet with a career adviser
to decide which extracurricular activities stress job-related and
personal development skills. For example, a student who plans to be
a lawyer found that involvement in the Student Activities Board
improved assertiveness and decision-making skills.
   Marymount Manhattan College in New York City offers a seminar
called Women in Management, which is offered for college credit to
honors students. It features professional women, from bankers to
ballet dancers, as guest lecturers speaking about their work.
   ``We didn't want to be only a career-oriented school,'' says Lou
Stanek, program director. ``We are convinced that the liberal arts
is the best training for leaders.''
   ``Too many students see college simply as a ticket to getting a
job when they graduate,'' says Al Splete, president of the Council
of Independent Colleges, a service organization for small liberal
arts colleges.
   ``Liberal arts graduates are problem-solvers and will be
successful because they have perception and can change as needed.''

   ``Summertime,'' the song says, ``and the livin' is easy.''
   But making a living may be something else, at least for students
who often work long hours for minimum wages during their summer
break.
   Some schools are trying to make it a little easier, by helping
students find work that pays more than undergraduates usually earn.
   At the University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y., for example, a
``SummerReach'' jobs program offers employers subsidies from donors
for hiring students.
   The university pays 36 percent of the student earnings, with
money raised from donors who see their contribution creating jobs
at salaries that help offset high educational costs.
   ``People and foundations like to contribute to education, but
especially to students who want to help themselves,'' says James
Scannell, University of Rochester vice president for enrollments,
placement and alumni affairs. ``It's been relatively easy to raise
money for this program.''
   The program has placed nearly 100 students to date in job areas
such as community planning, engineering sales, public relations,
marketing and banking.
   Average summer earnings are estimated at $2,700.
   Similar programs are offered at Duke University and Cornell
University, among others.

   More than half of all American families have two wage earners,
according to Labor Department figures, and 67 percent have children
under the age of 14.
   In many cases, this has presented a difficult problem in
balancing career and family.
   Just ask Danielle Kennedy.
   ``I learned many valuable lessons about delegating
responsibilty, communication and negotiation right from my own
living room,'' she says.
   Kennedy, 43, began her first full-time career, in real estate
sales, when she was pregnant with her fifth child. She is now a
motivational lecturer, author of two books on selling and the
mother of eight.
   Many women, she says, look for a full or part-time career for
``the added sense of personal accomplishment that working can
provide,'' along with a flexibility in hours that allows for
involvement in family affairs and child raising. ``Many quickly
discover, however, that it takes quite a balancing act to be
successful at both,'' she says.
   For those who seek to balance these two worlds, she advises:
   _ Working parents need to give equal priority to important
family and business commitments. Establish a solid dividing line
between the time dedicated to work and home.
   _ Form well-defined goals and make a commitment to achieving
them. Include the family in the process of goal-setting. ``The most
important motivating factors in my work aren't `me' goals, they are
`we' goals,'' she says.
   She once promised ski lessons to her children if she reached a
certain sales quota. ``We put up a ski poster as a reminder of what
we were all working toward, and everyone pitched in with laundry,
cooking, and cleaning up after themselves.
   ``When a family achieves `we' goals, the message kids get is
that the big, bad world isn't so bad at all,'' she says. ``It's a
big, exciting, hopeful world.''
   Sales appears to be a career area that suits many working
parents, as it often offers flexible hours.
   Some 90 percent of direct sales consultants are women and more
than 80 percent work at it part time, according to the Direct
Selling Association, Washington, D.C. Turnover can be frequent, but
many have made direct sales a long-term career.
   Mitch Allphin, for example, is a Princess House home decorator
consultant, who earns $250 to $400 for 12-to-18-hour weeks.
   ``I never considered myself a good salesperson,'' she says,
``but I love showing off the crystal and demonstrating how to use
it for decorating.''
   She schedules her demonstrations at night, three or four
evenings a week, when her husband cares for the three children.
``He calls it his `quality' time with them,'' she says.
   She takes her business with her when she travels. ``There are no
assigned territories, so it's easy to keep the business going as we
vacation,'' she says.

   Salary was not the most influential factor in making a career
choice among business administration students, according to a
Carnegie Mellon University survey.
   The Pittsburgh school study found career path and advancement
were more important than salary, with 55 percent of last year's
graduating MBA class not accepting the highest paying job offered.
   One student eventually chose a job that paid $20,000 a year less
than one he was offered. Other salary differentials were about
$5,000.
   After career path and advancement, the work itself and use of
skills was considered most important, followed by geography, the
``comfort factor,'' and people. Salary ranked ninth.
   The study was conducted by Ed Mosier, director of Carnegie
Mellon's Career Opportunities Center, among some 100 business
school graduates who received two or more job offers.
   Mosier said that being ``wined and dined'' by prospective
employers did not greatly influence final decisions.

   Nothing makes a worse impression on prospective employers than
an applicant who arrives late for a job interview, and the key to
success in the face-to-face meeting is projecting a natural and
confident manner.
   So says a job placement executive for an Indianapolis-based
technical school network.
   ``Our employers judge job candidates on first impressions,
taking particular note of enthusiasm, interest and appearance,''
according to Connie Welborn, national placement director for ITT
Educational Services Inc.
   In addition to tardiness, she advises, there are several other
common interview blunders that should be avoided, including
dressing inappropriately, asking too many questions, criticizing
former employers and not doing your homework.
   Since employers get their first impression from the applicant's
appearance, ``the safest choice (of what to wear) is a conservative
suit or dress in navy, gray or tan, with equally businesslike
accessories.''
   As for asking questions, Welborn suggests a few will demonstrate
your enthusiasm, but they should be limited to three or four about
the company and the job opening.
   Criticism and gossip about former employers will brand the
applicant as a complainer, she advises, while on the other hand the
job interviewer might be impressed by applicants who have bothered
to familiarize themselves with the company's most recent
developments.
   Other common mistakes include:
   _ Discussing personal and financial problems. (``The interviewer
wants to hear about your training and experience, not your
financial woes. Keep your personal life to yourself.'')
   _ Not knowing your strengths. (``Be prepared to speak about
yourself and why you are suited to the job opening.'')
   _ Lack of training and education. (``You shouldn't waste
someone's time if you know that your education does not meet the
minimum requirements. Remember, if you lack the skills, it's never
too late to enroll in a training program.'')
   _ Not following up. (``If you are not offered the job on the
spot, be sure to send a brief note to thank the interviewer for his
time. It is also a great way to express your interest.'')
   Irvin Marek, director of the career planning and placement
office at Chicago's Loyola University, has similar suggestions for
job-seekers, adding:
   ``Don't slouch, fidget, chew gum or smoke. Be positive. Be
courteous. Be yourself....
   ``Successful research, successful practice, successful questions
lead to success. Look forward to the job interview as an
opportunity to sell yourself to the organization you want to join.''
   One of the more important elements in a job interview may be
your voice, says a professional voice consultant.
   ``The trick is to be able to convey a strong sense of
confidence, even if you feel like jelly inside,'' says William
Rush, who is also an adviser to the Halls Voice Improvement Program.
   Some of his tips for job interviewing:
   _ Recognize that you will be nervous. Consciously slow down your
inner tempo. Take a few deep breaths to make it easier for you to
speak.
   _ Remember to enunciate consonant sounds and avoid mumbling.
   _ Watch your posture. Keep your shoulders back and spine
straight.
   _ Pause briefly after each important thought or word to add
emphasis.
   _ Try to anticipate the questions your interviewer might ask.
You will convey your messages more confidently when those topics do
come up.

   Many young people make the mistake of applying for jobs before
they know what they really want to do, according to a career
planning consultant at a California college.
   Salary alone should not determine the choice of a career, says
Lane von Herzen, director of career planning at Scripps College in
Claremont, Calif.
   ``Be wary of choosing a career, or a particular entry-level job
offer, solely because of its comparative monetary reward,'' Von
Herzen cautions. ``The extra money won't be rewarding in the long
run if that's not the direction in which you really want to go.
   ``A career that offers less money, at least in the beginning,
may turn out to be more enriching for you in the fundamental sense
of career satisfaction.''
   Another pressure to be resisted, he adds, is the suggestion from
parents or peers that a career should be chosen because it's
prestigious.
   ``Remember that it's you _ not your parents or peers _ who is
going to be devoting your life to this pursuit,'' he notes.
``You'll be more fulfilled, and probably more successful, if you
make a choice based on your own interests, goals and values.''
   Von Herzen recommends that students engage in career-research
interviewing long before they enter the job market.
   By talking to people in their intended field, he advises, career
seekers can find out what the greatest satisfactions and drawbacks
are in that particular career, the present and anticipated

   ``Try to get a gut feeling of what it's like to earn your living
in this way,'' he adds. ``If at all possible, get yourself an

   In preparing resumes, he says, job-seekers should be specific,

   Women executives climbing the corporate ladder of American
business are finding that success in their careers literally can be
a pain in the neck _ and upper back _ according to a physical
therapist.
   In shouldering new responsibilities, the executives often work
under sedentary stress, sitting for hours in a fixed position
behind a desk writing reports, dictating letters and conducting
meetings, or interviewing job applicants.
   ``Caught up in their work, most women executives simply ignore
upper back pain and steam full speed ahead,'' says Margaret Seiler,
supervising physical therapist at the back pain clinic for
outpatients at Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Chester, Pa.
   ``But if you are working under stress for prolonged periods of
time, you should stop once in a while for a mental and physical
break,'' advises Ms. Seiler, who has developed a series of
exercises intended to take a person's mind off work problems,
increase upper body circulation and relieve the muscle strain that
causes upper back pain.
   The desk exercises can be done _ by men or women _ every two
hours, or as needed.
   For after-office therapy at home, Ms. Seiler advocates a sound
night's slumber to erase vestiges of work-related tension.
   ``A bed and its mattress directly affect the quality of sleep,''
explains the therapist. ``Some like a firm mattress, others a soft
one. But regardless of personal preference, a mattress should
provide support for the heavy parts of the body _ the hips and
shoulders _ and disperse bodyweight uniformly.
   ``And, of course, it should be comfortable.''
   The stress-breaker exercises developed by Ms. Seiler are aimed
at soothing upper back pain by relaxing tired, tense musles and
creating a warm, suffused body glow due to increased circulation,
she says.
   Although designed to be done while at the desk, ``they can also
be done at home while sitting on the edge of your bed _ and are a
good waker-upper to get you on your way to work feeling relaxed and
refreshed.''
   The exercises, each repeated five times and taking no more than
one minute apiece, are:
   _ Neck circles _ Point chin to chest, chin to each shoulder, ear
to each shoulder.
   _ Shoulder rolls _ Move your shoulders up, forward, back and
down. Relax and repeat.
   _ Shoulder lifts _ Raise your shoulders up, tighten and relax;
drop your shoulders, tighten and relax.
   _ Self hug _ Stretch arms across your chest, hug yourself, hold
for five seconds and relax; bend your elbows back, tighten for five
seconds and relax.
   _ Trunk stretch _ Sit tall, look straight ahead, press shoulders
back for count of five, relax for count of five.

   A recent University of Michigan study indicates that over the
past decade young Americans _ faced with a crowded job market _ are
placing increased emphasis on job status, income and advancement.
   At the same time, they have become more conservative, quieter in
behavior and dress, and less extreme in political views and actions.
   According to a report on the continuing study by the
university's Institute for Social Research, ``young people today,
in contrast to those a decade or so earlier, are not faced with
crises such as the Vietnam war and the draft.
   ``Thus, they are freer to concentrate on the more immediate
issues in their personal lives _ their own hopes and plans.''
   For young people in general, the researchers noted, the goal of
finding steady work and succeeding in it has grown in importance
over the past decade.

are up at a sedate annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first four
months of the year, the government says.
   The April increase in the Producer Price Index was down from a
0.6 percent March advance, leading many analysts to conclude after
Friday's report by the Labor Department that worries over inflation
had been overstated by the March increase. They said if the

<HEAD>High Court Lets Stand Decision on Car Replacement Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a decision
generally barring foreign car manufacturers from forcing franchised
U.S. dealers to buy replacement parts exclusively from them.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Mercedes-Benz
of North America Inc. that had been supported by other foreign and
domestic car makers.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
Mercedes violated antitrust restrictions on tie-in arrangements by
requiring franchised dealers to use ``genuine Mercedes-Benz parts''
when servicing customers' cars.
   The appeals court rejected Mercedes' argument that a 1936
Supreme Court ruling granted car manufacturers an exemption from
antitrust enforcement for tie-in arrangements.
   The appeals court also ordered a new trial to determine how much
money Mercedes must pay in damages to Metrix Warehouse Inc., an
independent auto parts distributor.
   A federal jury had ordered Mercedes to pay Metrix $7 million in
damages. The figure was based on $2.3 million in losses Metrix said
it suffered from 1977 through 1983, with the figure tripled under a
provision of antitrust law.
   A judge overturned the jury award on grounds some of the money
Metrix claimed it lost may have been the result of lawful
competition and not illegal tie-in arrangements.
   Mercedes, which sold some 90,000 cars in the United States in
1987, said its 1 percent share of the U.S. market depends on
guarantees of high quality.
   Requiring franchised dealers to buy parts from the manufacturer
is essential to assuring that quality, Mercedes said.
   The 4th Circuit court said many of the parts sold by Metrix were
made by the same companies that supplied Mercedes. Metrix also said
most of the parts were non-warranty, quick-turnover items such as
filters, plugs, hoses and belts.
   But Mercedes said it conducted random testing of the parts to
assure they were not defective, and Metrix did not test the
products.
   Mercedes said to maintain the goodwill of its customers it must
assure ``meticulous supervison of the products, components and
services offered by its franchised dealers.''
   The 4th Circuit court said Mercedes could offer such assurance
by less restrictive means than tie-in arrangements.
   For example, the appeals court said, Mercedes could require
dealers to tell customers the origin of replacement parts, and
could require that any parts sold by dealers meet certain
specifications.
   The appeals court also rejected a counterclaim by Mercedes that
Metrix illegally offered incentives to dealers to induce them to
purchase replacement parts from Metrix.
   Automobile Importers of America Inc., representing foreign car
manufacturers, and Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the
United States Inc., representing domestic producers, supported the
Mercedes appeal.
   The case is Mercedes-Benz vs. Metrix, 87-1560.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Bankruptcy-Law Ruling in Florida Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside a bankruptcy
law ruling the federal government says could thwart efforts to
collect back taxes from failed businesses.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy the ruling
that limits the Internal Revenue Service's authority to collect
taxes owed by bankrupt taxpayers.
   The court's brief order suggested the case may have become moot,
or legally irrelevant. The justices were told the debt involved has
been paid off.
   At issue in a case from Tampa, Fla., was whether debtors who
seek protection from creditors by filing for reorganization under
federal bankruptcy law may designate which back taxes they pay off
first.
   The IRS in 1984 seized assets of A&B Heating and Air
Conditioning Inc. to satisfy the corporation's back-taxes liability.
   A&B then filed for reorganization, and a bankruptcy judge
ordered the tax agency to return the seized property to the
bankruptcy estate.
   The government then filed a claim so it could collect the back
taxes _ both those A&B owed as an employer and trust fund taxes
such as Social Security and income taxes A&B withheld from
employees' pay.
   Under the reorganization plan, A&B was to pay off all debts,
including back taxes, within six years. The plan states that all
payments to the IRS ``shall be credited first to the trust fund
portion of the claim until it is paid in full.''
   Government lawyers objected to letting the bankruptcy trustee
designate how the IRS must apply the tax payments.
   They argued that payments of priority taxes under bankruptcy
protection are involuntary, and therefore the debtor has no right
to specify how the payments are to be applied.
   A federal bankruptcy judge, a federal trial judge and the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the government. The
lower courts found that payments made under a bankruptcy
reorganization plan are voluntary and therefore subject to such
designations.
   The government's chief concern is the possibility that A&B will
not be able to comply with its six-year plan. The Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts estimates that 90 percent of all
bankruptcy reorganization plans fail.
   If back taxes were not fully paid off, the A&B reorganization
plan's designation could reduce the government's tax recovery.
   Corporate officers and other officials responsible for sending
withheld employee taxes to the federal government are personally
liable for any amounts withheld but not sent in. Those same
officers and officials are not personally responsible, however, for
other unpaid corporate taxes.
   ``Payment of only the trust fund portion of the tax liability by
the corporate debtor would eliminate the responsible officers'
potential liability but still leave the government unable to
collect the remaining tax liability,'' the government's appeal said.
   Justice Department lawyers said the IRS estimates that allowing
such designations could cost up to $25 million in lost tax revenues.
   The case is U.S. vs. A&B Heating and Air Conditioning, 87-1243.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States dropped by 14 to total 883 this week, Baker Hughes
Inc. reported.
   The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity, rose the week before by 17 to total 897.
   A year ago, the count totaled 744, Baker Hughes announced Monday.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana gained two rigs,
while New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming each added one.
   Texas saw their rig activity dip by 14, Colorado and Michigan
each dropped by two and Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania each
dropped one.
   California and Kansas had neither gains nor losses for the week.

rose marginally.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by less than 2-to-1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 728 up, 453 down and 486 unchanged.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 79 million shares after the first

   ``It is extremely quiet,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice
president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read &

strategies in one stock, GTE, with more than 37.8 million shares
changing hands at 35], down ]. Aside from that, many investors just
stayed away, partly out of concern over the impact of the March
trade deficit statistics to be released Tuesday.
   Those figures, which have come to symbolize America's economic
weakness, have jolted the market in the past when they exceeded
expectations. Most economists believe the March number will fall
between $12 billion and $13 billion, down from $13.8 billion in
February.
   ``If the number comes in under double digits, I think this
market goes a lot higher,'' Puccio said. ``But investors don't want
to buy something today and look like idiots tomorrow. That's the
reason for the dullness.''
   William King, head trader at Nikko Securities International in
New York, attributed some early strength in the market to a
carryover from a mild rally on Friday, based on expectations that
rising interest rates have stabilized for awhile. But he said
anxiety about the trade numbers stalled the rise today.
   ``When you've had worse trade numbers the market has punished
you severely,'' King said. ``So if you err, you err on the side of
caution.''

<HEAD>Surging Soybean Futures Lead Grains Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the surging soybean
market leading the way.
   Soybean contracts opened at least 19 cents a bushel higher, the
strongest opening this year, as dry weather fears continued to
provide broad support, analysts said.
   ``It's a huge opening, and it's all based on the weather,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for the investment firm Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Less rain fell in the Midwest during the weekend than traders
had expected and the latest forecasts called for dry conditions to
prevail until at least mid-week.
   Soybean futures prices, now at four-year highs, are extremely
sensitive to weather factors because U.S. soybean stockpiles are
dwindling and a good crop is needed to meet the anticipated demand.
   ``If we had had good rains over the weekend, we'd be opening 20
or 25 cents lower,'' Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was 6 cents to 8{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.12 a bushel; corn was 4{ cents
to 7 cents higher with May at $2.04 a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to
5 cents higher with May at $1.60{ a bushel; soybeans were 19{ cents
to 23 cents higher with May at $7.39 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The cattle
markets were awaiting this afternoon's release of the Agriculture
Department's monthly seven-state cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at
73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .55 cent lower
with May at 80.77 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .43 cent
higher with June at 53.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.15 cent to .40 cent higher with May at 54.80 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures were
mostly lower.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's trade surplus fell
21 percent to 8.2 billion marks in February from 10.4 billion marks
in the corresponding period a year earlier, the Federal Statistics
Office said Monday.
   The surplus was also down from 8.5 billion marks in January.
   The country's current account surplus, which includes trade in
merchandise, services, investment income and certain transfers,
stood at 5.2 billion marks, compared to 4.7 billion marks in
January, the statistics office said.
   The February trade report had been delayed for six weeks because
of the implementation of a new reporting system based on European
Community guidelines. The January report was four weeks later for
the same reason.
   The report said West German exports slumped 1.6 percent compared
to a year earlier, while imports rose 5 percent from the
year-earlier level.

<TEXT>
   E.F. Hutton & Co. paid more than $1
million in fines today for its guilty plea to three federal money
laundering charges involving its Providence office.
   Hutton attorney E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. signed the guilty plea
and turned a check for the fine over to U.S. Attorney Lincoln C.
Almond.
   The brokerage company was fined $10,000 for one count of
conspiracy and $500,000 on each of two counts of violating federal
cash transaction reporting laws.
   The plea follows the May 6 filing of criminal charges against
Hutton in U.S. District Court, accusing the company of failing to
report at least $532,000 in currency transactions at the Providence
office. Federal law requires that cash transactions of greater than
$10,000 must be reported to the IRS.
   The people for whom the transactions were allegedly made were
not named. Almond has said up to $1.2 million was involved, some of
it from organized crime figures and some from businesmen.
   In addition to the three felony counts against the firm, two
former brokers at Hutton's Providence office were also named in the
documents, known as a criminal information, filed in court.
   One of the brokers died shortly after the investigation began,
Almond said. Charges against the other broker, Brian J. Lareau, 46,
of Jamestown, R.I., were to have been filed last week.
   Hutton was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
and the company is now known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said today that after the
merger with Shearson, all of Hutton's branches adopted the Shearson
policy of prohibiting cash deposits in any amount. This should help
deter any similar schemes in the future, he said.
   ``None of the people who were involved in any of the
transactions are with the company anymore,'' O'Neill said. ``We
don't see it as having any impact on the company.''
   Almond said he did not know of wrongdoing at other Hutton
offices and said there was no evidence anyone other than the two
brokers named May 6 had participated in the scheme.
   Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, a felony
conviction of the company could result in the suspension of
investment services. Shearson said last month it expected to
receive waivers from the SEC that would allow it to continue
business.
   Last October, the SEC found Hutton had violated provisions of
the SEC law and rules relating to financial record-keeping and
reporting of currency transactions.

   Stocks barely budged this morning in extremely

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange staged a late

   Dealers said volume was light as traders awaited direction from
Tuesday's U.S. merchandise trade data for March. Economists

narrowed to $12.6 billion from $13.8 billion in February.
   In addition, several British indicators expected this week were

   K mart Corp. said Monday its earnings rose
4.6 percent during the first quarter, when sluggish sales took a
toll on the profits of most U.S. retailers.
   K mart reported net income of $120.8 million, or 60 cents a
share, for the quarter ended April 29, up from $115.5 million, or
57 cents a share, in the same period of 1987.
   The retailer reported sales of $5.84 billion, up from $5.59
billion.
   Sales on a comparable-store basis _ stores open both in the 1987
first quarter and the just-ended quarter _ rose 1.5 percent.
   ``Cooler-than-normal weather in April adversely affected sales
of outdoor patio goods and plants, both very important seasonal
lines for K mart, and also hurt sales of our apparel lines,''
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph E. Antonini said in a
statement.
   ``Despite the difficult sales environment, we were able to
report higher earnings because of our tight cost control and a
lower effective tax rate,'' he said.
   K mart is the nation's second-largest retailer, behind Sears,
Roebuck & Co. As of April 27, K mart operated 2,224 K mart discount
stores, 1,153 Waldenbooks, 118 Builders Square and 253 Pay Less
Drug stores.

<HEAD>Forbes Says Heads of Communications Firms Got Biggest Raises in
1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief executive officers of communications and
media companies got the biggest pay raises in all major industries
in 1987, according to a national survey of executive pay published
by Forbes magazine.
   The median total compensation of the communications executives
rose to $1.19 million last year from $848,000 in 1986, a 40 percent
increase, Forbes said in its May 30 issue. Median total
compensation means half the executives made more than that amount,
and half made less.
   The survey covered the 800 chief executive officers who run the
nation's biggest publicly owned companies.
   Donald L. Pels, chief executive officer of Lin Broadcasting, was
the highest-paid CEO in the media industry last year with $17.40
million. John C. Malone, the head of Tele-Communications, was the
lowest-paid at $390,000.
   Thomas S. Murphy of Capital Cities@ABC received total
compensation of $801,000. Laurence C. Tisch, the chief executive
and president of CBS, got the median pay of $1.19 million.
   The communications and media industry placed second after
financial services, which had the highest-paid chief executives in
1987 for the third consecutive year, Forbes said.
   Although they earned the highest pay, CEOs in the financial
services industry also saw that compensation drop by a median 21
percent from 1986 levels, reflecting deteriorating conditions in
the securities industry.
   The median pay of financial services chiefs fell to $1.26
million last year from $1.60 million in 1986, the survey said.
   Alan C. Greenberg of Bear Stearns Cos. was the highest-paid CEO
in financial services last year with $5.71 million, while Jess T.
Hay of Lomas & Nettleton was the lowest at $506,000.
   After financial services and communications, the 10 highest-paid
industries in 1987 and their median pay for CEOs, according to
Forbes, were:
   _Aerospace and defense, $1.17 million.
   _Health, $1.163 million.
   _Beverages and tobacco, $1.162 million.
   _Food processing, $1.12 million.
   _Retailing, $1.05 million.
   _Apparel, shoes and textiles, $1.03 million.
   _Leisure and recreation, $1.02 million.
   _Conglomerates, $1.01 million.
   The 10 best-paid CEOs and their compensation, were:
   _Charles Lazarus, Toys R Us, $60.03 million.
   _Jim P. Manzi, Lotus Development, $26.34 million.
   _Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler, $17.66 million.
   _Donald A. Pels, Lin Broadcasting, $17.40 million.
   _Paul B. Fireman, Reebok International, $15.43 million.

   Stocks were mixed today in extremely light
trading, which brokers blamed on inflation anxiety and a persistent
reluctance to risk cash in the volatile post-crash market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which seesawed in
a narrow range through much of the session, was up 1.99 to 1,992.54
by 2 p.m. EDT. Broader market indices were mixed.
   Traders said a rise in the Commodity Research Bureau commodity
futures index to highest point in more than three years contributed
to an underlying fear of inflation in the stock and bond markets.
The index is considered a key measure of inflation, which erodes
the value of stocks and bonds.
   Gaining issues narrowly outnumbered losers on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 740 up, 630 down and 512 unchanged. Volume on the

<TEXT>
   Sharp differences among the major industrialized
nations over trade and agricultural issues are expected to be aired
at a meeting of ministers from the 24-nation Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) being held Wednesday
and Thursday.
   Senior officials of the group said Monday they do not expect any
dramatic breakthroughs such as occurred last year, when the
ministers decided to measure costly subsidies to farmers as a first
step to eliminating them.
   ``The present situation does not give reason for a spectacular
shift or reversal of policies,'' said one of the officials who
spoke at a press briefing on the understanding they would not be
named.
   The officials were alluding to the U.S. presidential elections
in November, which rule out any major policy iniatives before then,
as well as continuing differences among the seven major
industrialized countries over monetary policy.
   In Britain, there is even disagreement between Prime Minister
Margeret Thatcher and her finance minister over exchange rate
policy. There has just been a change of governments in France and
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's position has been weakened.
   Sometimes referred to as the ``rich countries club,'' the OECD
groups the 24 main industrialized nations and focuses on economic
issues. For the Group of Seven main democracies, the OECD meeting
will serve as a dress rehearsal for next's month world economic
summit in Ottawa.
   On trade, the officials said the current round of Uruguay
negotations was entering its most difficult phase.
   They urged nations involved to settle their differences now and
try to give the talks a new political impetus rather than wait
until a ministerial review of the talks scheduled for Montreal in
December.
   At the OECD meeting, European nations are expected to seek a
commitment from the United States to reduce what they regard as
hostile trade practices before they will consider taking more
action on eliminating farm subsidies.
   ``Trade and agriculture are two areas of contention where there
could be some fireworks,'' the officials said.
   The officials said they hoped for free-wheeling discussions on
how to deal with the ``four dragons'' in southeast Asia: Taiwan,
Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
   They expect the end result to be instructions to the secretariat
to begin informal talks with these nations and others known as
newly industrialized countries, or NICs. They said they would not
be opposed to the NICs eventually joining OECD.
   These countries' mounting trade surpluses are expected to exceed
Japan's next year and pose a threat to reducing the U.S. trade
deficit. The effort to seek a dialogue with the NICs contrasts with
the previous practice of lecturing them on what they should do.

   Economic growth in the industrialized democracies
will be much quicker in both 1988 and 1989 than was thought at the
end of last year following the October markets crash, according to
OECD projections released Monday.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
confirmed that it has revised upward its projection for real, or
inflation-adjusted, gross national product growth to 3 percent for
1988 from its December estimate of 2.25 percent.
   The growth rate for 1989 is now expected to be around 2.5
percent, compared with a previous estimate of 1.75 percent.
   The OECD, which is made up of the world's 24 most industrialized
nations, is now projecting that real growth in the United States
will reach 2.75 percent in 1988, slowing slightly to 2.5 percent in
1989. These figures were revised upward from the December estimates
of 2.5 and 1.75 percent, respectively.
   Growth rates in other major OECD member countries have also been
adjusted. West Germany is expected to experience a 2.25 percent
expansion in 1988, slowing to 1.75 percent in 1989, compared with
earlier estimates of 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively.
   Japan will have one of the strongest growth rates among the
major industrialized countries with a projected 4.25 percent this
year and 3.75 percent in 1989, the OECD said. This compares with
December forecasts of 3.5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
   The latest OECD figures for inflation are little-changed from
those of the December 1987 outlook, with rates of 3.5 percent
expected for the 24 OECD member countries in 1988 and 3.75 percent
projected for 1989.
   On unemployment, the OECD sees the average rate for the
industrialized countries as a group at 7.5 percent in both 1988 and
1989, compared with previous estimates of 8 percent for 1988 and
8.25 percent for 1989.

<TEXT>
   The purchase by the Union Pacific Corp., of
the ``Katy'' railroad, a regional line that runs from Nebraska to
the Gulf Coast, has been approved by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the agency announced today.
   The ICC's approval requires the Union Pacific and the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, as the ``Katy'' is formally known,
to grant trackage rights to other railroads inseveral regions where
direct competition otherwise would be reduced.
   The ICC approved the merger Friday, but it was not announced
until today, agency officials said.
   The commission acknowledged that the merger would result in the
elimination of some jobs and abandonment of more than 300 miles of
tracks where the two rail systems run parallel tracks. The
railroads have said about 1,000 jobs would be eliminated.
   The commission concluded, however, that the benefits of the
merger both to the public and to rail shippers outweigh the
negative impact. ``The public benefits will be achieved through
reduced transportation costs ... and improved service for
shippers,'' said Heather Gradison, ICC chairman, in a statement.
   The ICC said about 300 miles of track has been approved for
abandonment, including a 123-mile stretch from Henriette to Durant
in Oklahoma. The railroads have said facilities would be shut down
in St. Louis, Kansas City, Fort Worth and other points along the
route system because of duplication.
   Ackowledging a concern about reduced competition for Midwest
grain shipments, the ICC said the Union Pacific must provide
trackage rights to another railroad between Omaha and Kansas City
to preserve the current level of competition.
   It also required agreements with other rail lines in south Texas
where there were competitive concerns about the shipment of crushed
rock from various Texas points to Houston. An agreement with the
Southern Pacific has alleviated that concern, ICC officials said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Exempt International Banks from Local Taxes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to note bank is Continental Illinois
subsidiary.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to exempt
federally chartered international banks from being taxed by states
and cities where the banks have branch offices.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' let stand a ruling that Continental Bank International,
a subsidiary of Chicago-based Continental Illinois National Bank &
Trust Co., must pay more than $6 million in taxes, penalties and
interest to New York City.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear the bank's appeal but four
votes are needed to grant such review.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
last February Continental is not exempt from the city's financial
corporation tax.
   City officials said the bank's New York City branch owed $6.075
million for the periods Sept. 1, 1980 to Dec. 31, 1980 and Jan. 1,
1981 to Dec. 31, 1981.
   Congress authorized federally chartered international banks in a
1919 law _ the Edge Act _ to supply international credit and to
secure foreign trade markets for U.S. exports.
   The Federal Reserve Board regulates the banks, which were given
expanded power by Congress in 1978 to mobilize resources to
increase American overseas trade.
   There are some 90 such banks, with most of their offices
concentrated in California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas.
   Continental International argued that, like a federally
chartered national bank, it should be exempt from state and local
taxes unless Congress specifically authorized otherwise.
   But the New York court said international banks ``are not
federal instrumentalities entitled to constitutional immunity from
tax.''
   The state court also said there is nothing in federal law to
suggest Congress intended to exempt branch offices of such banks
from state and city taxes.
   ``An intention of Congress to deny the state's power to tax Edge
Act bank branches cannot be inferred from the language of the
statute, which is at best ambiguous on that subject,'' the state
court said.
   The Reagan administration endorsed the state court ruling.
   Justice Department lawyers, responding to a Supreme Court
invitation to comment, said the 1919 law's ``fairest reading'' is
that it ``should not be interpreted to preclude taxation'' by
states in which branch offices are located.
   The case is Continental Bank vs. New York City, 86-1857.

   Stocks drifted today in extremely light trading,
which brokers attributed to inflation anxiety and a persistent
reluctance to risk cash in the volatile post-crash market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which seesawed in
a narrow range through much of the session, was up 7.79 points to
1,998.34 by 3 p.m. EDT. Broader market indices were mixed.
   Traders said a sharp rise in the Commodity Research Bureau
commodity futures index contributed to an underlying fear of
inflation in the stock and bond markets. The index is considered a
key measure of inflation, which erodes the value of stocks and
bonds.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 3-to-2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 814 up, 608 down and 496 unchanged.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 132.15 million shares with an hour
of trading left.
   More than one-third of the volume came from dividend-capture
strategies in one stock, GTE, with nearly 48 million shares
changing hands at 35|, down [. Aside from that, many investors just
stayed away, partly out of concern over the impact of the March
trade deficit statistics to be released Tuesday.
   Those figures, which have come to symbolize America's economic
weakness, have jolted the market in the past when they exceeded
expectations. Most economists believe the March number will fall
between $12 billion and $13 billion, down from $13.8 billion in
February.
   ``If the number comes in under double digits, I think this
market goes a lot higher,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice
president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon, Read &
Co. in New York. ``But investors don't want to buy something today
and look like idiots tomorrow. That's the reason for the dullness.''
   Besides GTE, the most-active NYSE issues included Staley
Continental, down { to 36] on volume exceeding 1.5 million shares.
The company accepted a sweetened takeover offer from Tate & Lyle of
$36.50 a share after finding no other serious bidders.
   Among active blue-chips, IBM rose ] to 110}, General Electric
rose } to 40[, Woolworth rose [ to 53 and Exxon fell \ to 44}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues rose .51 to
145.81. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell
0.19 to 297.75.

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Futures Advance Limit On Weather Worries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures closed dramatically
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade with some contracts up
the limit allowed for daily trading as dry weather fears kicked the
grain markets into a frenzy.
   Buyers dominated the market from the opening bell as traders
returned from a weekend that saw less rain than expected in most of
the Midwest's corn and soybean areas.
   New forecasts issued in the morning predicted dry conditions
until at least mid-week.
   Soybean futures prices, now at four-year highs, are extremely
sensitive to weather factors because U.S. soybean stockpiles are
dwindling and a good crop is needed to meet the anticipated demand,
analysts said.
   Some soybean and corn contracts were up the limit before noon.
Soybeans are permitted to rise or fall no more than 30 cents a
bushel per day, while corn futures are limited to moves of 10 cents
a bushel.
   With most soybean contracts for 1989 delivery trading above
$7.90 a bushel, trader Victor Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. said $8 soybeans are likely.
   ``Then my goal is $10, assuming the weather remains a little
drier than normal, and then _ well, the all-time high was $12.90 a
bushel on June 5, 1973,'' he said. ``I was there.'' The Board of
Trade confirmed the date and price.
   At the close, wheat was 13 cents to 15 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.19 a bushel; corn was 8\ cents
to 10 cents higher with May at $2.07 a bushel; oats were 6\ cents
to 7} cents higher with May at $1.63} a bushel; soybeans were 28
cents to 30{ cents higher with the May contract, on which the daily
price limit has been removed because of the contract's upcoming
expiration, at $7.50 a bushel.

<HEAD>Boeing, Airbus Split Biggest Commercial Plane Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest commercial airplane
order in history was split Monday between Boeing Co. and Airbus
Industrie of Europe, with Boeing grabbing the lion's share of the
$5.04 billion, 130-plane purchase by International Lease Finance
Corp.
   The planes are to be delivered over the next six years to
International Lease Finance, which leases planes to many of the
world's airlines for periods of three to 11 years.
   All are so-called advanced technology planes, which have
relatively quite engines and incorporate other recent developments.
   Boeing's workhorse 737 series snagged the biggest chunk of the
order _ 72 of the 100 Boeing planes ordered _ and a mix of
wide-body and jumbo jets make up the rest of the purchase from the
Seattle company. The Boeing order is worth $3.69 billion.
   Airbus, a consortium of European aerospace companies led by its
French and German partners, will sell the leasing company 30 planes
for $1.35 billion. Eighteen of the Airbus planes will be A320-200s,
medium-range airliners similar to the 737, and the rest of the
order is for wide-body jets.
   Both manufacturers termed the agreement a marketing victory.
   ``It's a tremendous order,'' said Dean Thornton, president of
Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co.
   Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese called the order a welcome
vote of confidence following the recent failure of an Aloha
Airlines Boeing 737 over Hawaii. The top of the passenger cabin
ripped off that plane in flight, throwing a flight attendant to her
death, but the pilot managed to land safely.
   ``We really need it after everything that happened,'' Ms. Reese
said of the order.
   Airbus' share falls only slightly shy of matching the
consortium's U.S. strategy, which calls for gaining 30 percent of
the market, said Gregg Schulte, spokesman at Airbus' U.S. office in
Herndon, Va.
   ``We feel like we got a very competitive part of the order.''
Schulte said. ``I think it was always going to be a split order.''
   Airbus also announced Monday it had received an order for 15
A320s from Iberia Airlines.
   A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., the
other top competitor in the international market for commercial
airliners, said last week the company did not expect a share of the
International Lease Finance order.
   The Boeing order consists of 72 planes of models 737-300,
737-400 and 737-500; eight 757-200s; nine 767-300ERs; four
747-400s; and a previously unannounced order of six planes in the
737 series and one 757-200.
   The Airbus order consists of 18 model A320-200s; four
A300-600Rs; six A310-300s, and two A340-300s.
   Boeing valued its share of the contract at $4.6 billion,
counting toward that total the price of 24 additional planes on
which the company has options to buy.
   With Airbus, International Lease Finance said it had an option
to buy an additional 40 planes.
   The largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986, when
British Airways ordered 16 Boeing 747s for $2.3 billion. That deal
includes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring the
value to $4.1 billion.
   International Lease Finance is confident customers will emerge
for the approximately 25 planes a year the order will add to its
fleet of 54, said Kenneth Taylor, vice president for technical
services.
   He said the 15-year-old company would finance the purchase
through debt offerings and internally generated funds. Deliveries
are set to begin in 1989 and run through 1995.
   The purchase is intended to meet anticipated demand for
fuel-efficient, quiet planes to replace aging airline fleets and
accommodate expanded business from 1990 to 1995, said Steven
Udvar-Hazy, president of the leasing company.
   Leasing has become increasingly attractive to airlines because
it offers both tax advantages and an opportunity to keep cash in
hand rather than commit it to down payments and interest on loans,
analysts said.
   ``The airlines think they need a lot of cash around, and I think
they're right, partly in the fear of some kind of fare war,'' said
Andrew Geller, who follows the industry for Provident National Bank
in Philadelphia.
   International Lease Finance also announced it had commitments to
supply engines for the planes from General Electric-CFM
International, Pratt & Whitney and from Rolls Royce. The engines
purchased will in some cases depend on the airline a particular
plane is destined for, Taylor said.
   The GE-CFM committments are worth an estimated $700 million and
the Pratt & Whitney commitments worth $230 million. A value was not
given for the Rolls Royce share.

<HEAD>Upholds Insurance Judgment, Backs FCC in Cable Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court upheld on Monday a $1.8
million judgment against an insurance company that had been ordered
to pay the money to an injured Mississippi man whose $20,000 claim
it wrongfully rejected.
   But the justices declined to decide the constitutionality of
large punitive damage awards in personal injury cases.
   In another case, the court ruled the Federal Communications
Commission has exclusive authority to regulate the technical
quality of cable television signals. It rejected arguments that
state and local officials should be allowed to impose more
stringent requirements for cable TV.
   The court also agreed to decide whether New Jersey unfairly is
forcing 13 major oil companies to pay millions of dollars in taxes
by denying state tax deductions for what the companies pay in
federal windfall profits taxes.
   In other major business-related rulings, the court:
   _Refused to exempt federally chartered international banks from
being taxed by states and cities where the banks have branch
offices. The court let stand a ruling that Continental Bank
International, based in Chicago, must pay more than $6 million in
taxes, penalties and interest to New York City.
   _Made it easier for people to file job-discrimination charges
against employers by allowing flexibility for meeting some
deadlines imposed by a federal anti-bias law. The justices agreed
with the Reagan administration and revived a Colorado sex
discrimination case that was dismissed because deadlines for filing
the complaint were missed.
   _Let stand a decision generally barring foreign car
manufacturers from forcing franchised U.S. dealers to buy
replacement parts exclusively from them. It rejected an appeal by
Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. that had been supported by
other foreign and domestic car makers.
   _Ruled that states may tax the costs of producing merchandise
catalogs mailed directly to in-state residents even when the
catalogs are published in other states. The court unanimously
rejected an attempt by a New Orleans-based department store chain
to avoid paying taxes for catalogs received by its Louisiana
customers.
   In the insurance case, the court left unresolved the question of
skyrocketing damage awards. Some states, reacting to soaring
insurance rates, have imposed ceilings on how much money can be
recovered in personal injury lawsuits.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the the court, said
settling the issue now would ``short-circuit a number of less
intrusive and possibly more appropriate resolutions.''
   The justices did decide a lesser issue raised in the dispute,
upholding a Mississippi law that imposed a 15 percent penalty _
$243,000 _ against the insurance company for unsuccesfully
appealing the case to the Mississippi Supreme Court. The vote on
that issue was 6-1.
   The case involved Lloyd Crenshaw of Pascagoula, Miss., whose leg
was amputated less than two weeks after he injured it in his garage
in 1979.
   Crenshaw, 61 at the time, worked at the White Stores in
Pascagoula. His employer had a group insurance policy with Bankers
Life and Casualty Co.
   A state jury ruled that Bankers Life acted in bad faith in
denying Crenshaw's claim, and awarded him $20,000 in actual damages
and $1.6 million in punitive damages.
   The insurance company said the punitive damage judgment violates
the Constitution. But that issue was not raised or passed upon by
the Mississippi courts.
   In the cable television case, the court said the FCC ``acted
within the statutory authority conferred by Congress when it
pre-empted state and local technical standards governing the
quality of cable television signals.''
   The FCC has divided cable services into four categories. The
first consists of cable channels that deliver signals of television
stations that are normally broadcast through the air.
   The other classes include cable channels such as Cable News
Network and ESPN; pay channels such as Home Box Office; and
channels with two-way interaction capability.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year the FCC has
exclusive control over the signal quality of the first class of
cable channels. The appeals court also ordered the FCC to develop
standards for assuring the quality of the signals in the latter
three categories.
   The first part of the appeals court ruling was appealed by the
National League of Cities, New York City officials and other
communities who said state, county and city governments should be
allowed to impose signal quality standards for cable channels that
carry television broadcast stations.
   In its ruling, the Supreme Court said a 1984 federal law
endorses a dual system of cable TV regulation, giving local
officials power to award franchises but leaving control over
technical quality of cable signals with the FCC.
   In the New Jersey tax case, the oil companies, which operate
numerous refineries in the state, challenged a state business tax
law that disallows a deduction for windfall profits tax payments.
   The companies said the state tax is unfair because the windfall
profits tax is based on oil production, none of which takes place
in New Jersey.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the state tax last June,
saying it does not discriminate unfairly against the oil companies.
   The oil companies paid an extra $88.5 million in taxes to New
Jersey from 1980 through 1984 because of the state tax disallowance.
   The tax challenge was mounted by Amerada Hess, Atlantic
Richfield, Conoco, Cities Service, Exxon, Phillips Petroleum,
Chevron, Mobil Oil, Union Oil of California, Gulf Oil, Shell Oil,
Tenneco Oil and Texaco.

   A mild burst of late-afternoon buying helped
boost the stock market today after a mixed session marked by
extremely light volume and post-crash investor apathy.
   Traders said rumors of a lower-than-expected March trade
deficit, a statistic to be released Tuesday morning by the Commerce
Department, helped Wall Street in the final few hours.
   ``It looks like they're expecting good figures,'' said Robert
O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Traders said a figure sharply lower than the anticipated $12
billion to $13 billion deficit would provide some much-needed
optimism for Wall Street, which has been plagued by a loss of
confidence since the crash seven months ago.
   The monthly trade deficit figures have come to symbolize the
American economy's competitive weaknesses and are closely watched
by the financial markets because they can influence the dollar's
value, interest rates and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

<HEAD>Hutton Fined $1.01M For Money Laundering In Providence Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.F. Hutton & Co. on Monday paid $1.01
million in fines for a money-laundering scheme in which $1.5
million in cash was hidden from the government for clients, some of
them members of organized crime.
   Hutton attorney E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. signed a guilty plea to
three felony counts and turned a check for the fine over to U.S.
Attorney Lincoln C. Almond.
   The brokerage company was fined $10,000 for conspiracy to
violate the Bank Secrecy Act and $500,000 for each of two counts of
violating federal cash transaction reporting laws. The fines were
the maximum allowed under the law.
   Criminal charges filed May 6 in U.S. District Court accused
Hutton of failing to report at least $532,000 in currency
transactions at the Providence office.
   On Monday, however, authorities said that as part of the scheme,
two former Hutton brokers helped clients hide about $1.5 million
from the Internal Revenue Service.
   Cash transactions of $10,000 or more must be reported to the IRS.
   Authorities said briefcases stuffed with cash were brought into
Hutton's Providence office. In an activity known as ``smurfing,''
secretaries carrying envelopes full of money were then dispatched
to different area banks the same day to buy bearer bonds or
certificates of deposit for less than $10,000.
   Authorities said the scheme came to light when a bank employee
noticed a Hutton secretary purchased two bonds for just under
$10,000 the same day.
   The transactions were made under fictitious names for legitimate
businessmen and members of organized crime, according to Almond and
Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, head of the Justice Department's New
England Organized Crime Strike Force.
   Stephen Fusco, a Hutton broker who died of cancer about two
years ago, handled the accounts authorities have linked to
organized crime.
   The address for one client was the same North Providence
apartment where Raymond L.S. Patriarca, longtime boss of the New
England mob, was found dead of a heart attack in July 1984, while
another account was linked to a convicted mob pornographer who used
it to buy an adult book store in Boston.
   The money laundering, which authorities say began in May 1982,
stopped one month after Patriarca's death.
   Fusco and the other former Hutton broker were also named in the
criminal information documents filed in court. Brian J. Lareau, 46,
of Jamestown, was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday for money
laundering and false representation of a Social Security account
numberr.
   O'Sullivan and Almond said Lareau had no ties to organized
crime, and that he and Fusco were not partners in their alleged
illegal activities.
   Hutton was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
and the company is now known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. After
the merger, all the firm's branches adopted the Shearson policy of
prohibiting cash deposits in any amount, Shearson spokesman Michael
O'Neill said.
   As part of the plea agreement, the government stated ``no one
above the Providence branch office level of the company was
involved and that the money laundering occurred prior to the
acquisition of the defendant by the Shearson Lehman Co.''
   ``None of the people who were involved in any of the
transactions are with the company anymore,'' O'Neill said. ``We
don't see it as having any impact on the company.''
   Under federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the
company's felony conviction could cause a suspension of its
investment services.
   O'Neill, however, said the company should be able to obtain
exemptions from any federal sanctions it could face. Glen A. Payne,
assistant director of the SEC's investment management division,
said Shearson filed for a temporary exemption to the sanctions
Monday.
   Sometime in the next eight months, the commission will make a
decision on the firm's request for permanent protection based on an
outside audit of Shearson and its efforts set up procedures to
follow the cash transaction reporting laws, Payne said.
   Last October, the SEC censured Hutton for violating provisions
of the SEC law and rules relating to financial record-keeping and
reporting of currency transactions.

<HEAD>Kodak Agrees to $150 Million Settlement in Instant-Camera Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. agreed Monday to reimburse at
least 4.2 million owners of its obsolete instant cameras as part of
a proposed $150 million settlement of a class action lawsuit
against the company.
   Under the settlement proposal, U.S. owners of the cameras would
receive between $50 and $70 in cash and coupons.
   Kodak stopped selling instant cameras and instant film after a
federal court in 1985 said the company had violated patents held by
Polaroid Corp.
   Millions of people own one of the 39 camera models made useless
by the ruling, which barred the manufacture of compatible film.
   ``From the start, our primary objective has been to make an
attractive exchange program available to our Kodak customers,''
said Wilbur J. Prezzano, group vice president of Kodak's
Photographic Products division.
   ``We have worked hard to help reach this settlement and we are
pleased with the results,'' Prezzano said.
   Under the proposed agreement, filed with Cook County Circuit
Judge Thomas Rakowski, instant camera owners would receive $50,
$55, $60 or $70 in cash and Kodak coupons, depending on the model
of their instant camera.
   Cash and coupons will be disbursed when Rakowski gives his final
approval to the settlement, which is expected Sept. 19.
   The proposed settlement is limited to U.S. owners.
   When Kodak's instant film was no longer available, a group of
Chicago attorneys, led by Burton I. Weinstein, filed a class-action
lawsuit on behalf of camera owners in 1986.
   Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., said the settlement could cover
as many 16 million people since the company made that many instant
cameras for domestic sale between 1976 and 1985.
   But Weinstein said he would be surprised if many other owners
emerge in addition to the 4.2 million who are parties to the
lawsuit.
   ``We think we have garnered the entire universe,'' he said
outside Rakowski's courtroom.
   Still, Kodak will publicize the settlement in 100 newspapers May
22. Anyone who owns an instant camera and is not yet a party to the
lawsuit can clip the claim form and send it in along with the
camera's nameplate by Aug. 1.
   ``We think the settlement is fair, just and adequate,''
Weinstein said.
   The lawsuit had challenged Kodak's original proposed settlement
for camera owners of a Kodak Disc Camera, a $50 coupon or one share
of Kodak stock.
   Instant photography was invented by Dr. Edwin H. Land, founder
of Polaroid, and was first marketed in 1948.
   The invention enabled users to view a photographic print within
minutes of taking a picture. Conventional photography requires
development and printing of exposed film in a darkroom.
   Polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field
until 1976, when Kodak entered the market with a competing system.
A week after that entry, Polaroid sued Kodak for patent
infringement.
   A federal judge in Boston sided with Polaroid and the U.S.
Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear
Kodak's appeal in October 1986.

   The dollar drifted slightly higher in quiet
trading Monday in advance of the scheduled release Tuesday of the
U.S. trade deficit for the month of March.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $455 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$451.10 an ounce late Friday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said most traders had squared their
positions and were waiting to see if the U.S. trade deficit would
narrow as expected. The deficit was $13.8 billion in February.
   ``More or less, everybody's waiting for tomorrow,'' said Peter
Wild, senior trader for Bank Julius Baer & Co. in New York. He said
he believed many traders were expecting the deficit to fall to
$12.5 billion or $13 billion.
   Wild said there was no strong reaction in the currency market to
the Federal Reserve's report that industrial production jumped 0.7
percent in April, the biggest rise in six months.
   Sterling inched up early in the day, but light intervention by
the Bank of England encouraged some profit-taking and helped the
currency end mixed.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.03 yen to a closing 124.73. Late in London, it
was quoted at 124.75 yen. At the end of the trading day in New
York, the dollar rose to 124.92 Japanese yen from 124.78 late
Friday.
   One British pound cost $1.8915 in London late Monday, up from
late Friday's $1.8910. Later in New York, the pound fell to $1.8890
from $1.8903 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6892 West German marks, up from 1.6837; 1.4049
Swiss francs, up from 1.4006; 1.2337 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2333; 5.7275 French francs, up from 5.7108; and 1,255.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,251.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.6860 West German marks, up from 1.6830; 1.4013
Swiss francs, up from 1.4000; 5.7170 French francs, up from 5.7063;
1.8890 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8855; 1,253.45 Italian lire, up
from 1,249.00; 1.2322 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2336.
   Gold prices rose in European trading. Bullion dealers said there
was no market affecting news, but there was some strong overnight
buying in Hong Kong and then in New York at opening time by dealers.
   At the beginning of the trading day in Hong Kong, gold bullion
rose $2.39 a troy ounce to close at a bid $455.24 an ounce. Later
in London, gold sold for a bid price of $455 a troy ounce, up from
late Friday's $449. In Zurich, the bid price was $454, up from $450
late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $454.90 a troy ounce, up from $452.20 late Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid $6.70 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $6.52. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery closed at $6.583 a troy ounce, down from
$6.632.

<HEAD>Slow Sales Prompt Production Cuts as Eagle Struggles to Grow Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is cutting production of the
Eagle Premier, the flagship car of its new Jeep-Eagle division,
because of slower-than-expected sales during a difficult
image-building period.
   For two weeks in June and again for a previously scheduled
two-week vacation period in late July, Chrysler will close the
brand-new former American Motors Corp. assembly plant in Bramalea,
Ontario, which builds Premier.
   Bramalea's assembly line will produce 50 fewer cars a day when
the plant reopens after the shutdown during the weeks of June 13
and June 20, Chrysler spokesman Baron Bates said Monday. Bramalea
now builds about 360 cars a day.
   Through April 30, Bramalea had built more than 24,000 cars this
year and dealers had sold less than 10,000. Sales had been
increasing steadily throughout 1988 and Bates said Chrysler
expected them to reach 5,000 cars a month by June.
   At the end of both March and April, unsold inventories averaged
133 days' supply, twice the industry norm of about 60 to 65 days'
supply.
   Bates said Chrysler is pleased with Premier's progress because
the car is attracting younger, more affluent buyers than other
Chrysler products and has not taken sales away from Chrysler, Dodge
or Plymouth.
   Analysts agreed that Premier is a good car whose launch has been
difficult because the Eagle name and lineup is not familiar to
buyers and the market has been crowded with buyer incentives.
   It has been further hampered by the dealer network that sells
it, they said.
   ``The kind of traffic that you get into an old American Motors
dealership wasn't really the type that's going to go out and buy a
mid-size car,'' said Ted Sullivan, analyst with Wharton
Econometrics in Philadelphia.
   Sullivan said AMC dealers have attracted upscale buyers for
Jeep, but added that Jeep buyers are not buying Premiers.
   ``Part of the problem is the way it has to be marketed _ through
AMC dealers who haven't had a car to sell for a long time,'' said
David Healy, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``If you're in the market for an Audi-type mid-size car, your
AMC dealer is not the place you think of first to go look for
one,'' he said. ``Chrysler's trying to change that.''
   Chrysler bought AMC in August, beginning with French
government-owned Renault's 46.1 percent interest in the ailing
automaker. Under an agreement with Renault, which designed the
Premier and helped AMC build the Bramalea plant, Chrysler buys
major components including engines and transmissions from Renault.
   Because of the weakness of the dollar against western European
currencies, that arrangement is cutting severely Chrysler's profits
on Premier as the imported parts become more expensive, analysts
said.
   But the car _ and the entire Jeep-Eagle network _ still is
faring far better under Chrysler than it would have under AMC, they
said.
   ``If they kept the AMC nameplate it would have been extremely
difficult to make a success of the car because AMC had a negative
image. Now they are starting over with no image,'' said Chris
Cedergren, analyst with J. D. Power and Associates in Agoura Hills,
Calif.
   ``It's better to have no image than a negative image,'' he said.
   This summer, Chrysler will add a four-door, upscale new car
called the Eagle Summit and based on the Japanese Mitsubishi Mirage
to the lineup, followed in 1989 by a sports coupe built at a
Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in Bloomington-Normal, Ill.
   ``The Summit will help draw buyers to the show room. The more
buyers you draw ... the more Premiers you'll sell,'' Cedergren said.

<HEAD>Weather Worries Prompt Dramatic Gains In Soybean, Grain Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures closed dramatically higher Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade with some contracts up the limit allowed
for daily trading as dry weather fears kicked the grain markets
into a frenzy.
   Wheat futures also closed sharply higher.
   On other markets, cotton futures advanced the limit on weather
concerns; precious metals were mixed; cattle futures advanced; oil
futures were higher; and stock-index futures rose.
   Buyers dominated the grain markets from the opening bell as
traders returned from a weekend that saw less rain than expected in
most of the Midwest's corn and soybean areas.
   New forecasts issued in the morning predicted dry conditions
until at least mid-week. The National Weather Service's
six-to-10-day forecast, issued after the close, called for
below-normal rainfall May 22-26 in most of the Midwest.
   Soybean futures prices, now at four-year highs, are extremely
sensitive to weather factors because U.S. soybean stockpiles are
dwindling and a good crop is needed to meet the anticipated demand,
analysts said.
   Some soybean and corn contracts were up the limit before noon.
The exchange permits soybean futures prices to rise or fall no more
than 30 cents a bushel per day, while corn futures are limited to
moves of 10 cents a bushel.
   With most soybean contracts for 1989 delivery trading above
$7.90 a bushel, trader Victor Lespinasse of the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said $8 soybeans are likely.
   ``Then my goal is $10, assuming the weather remains a little
drier than normal,'' he said.
   The Agriculture Department reported Monday corn planting was
about 88 percent complete Sunday while just under 40 percent of the
U.S. soybean crop had been planted, so no real damage has been done
yet by dry weather, said Cathy Leow, assistant vice president for
grain trading at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   Ms. Leow predicted more moderate price movement in the soybean
market on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   ``I think we've moved enough for the next three days,'' she said.
   Wheat settled 13 cents to 14 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.19 a bushel; corn was 8{ cents to 10 cents
higher with May at $2.07 a bushel; oats were 6{ cents to 7{ cents
higher with May at $1.63} a bushel; soybeans were 28\ cents to 30{
cents higher with the May contract, on which the daily price limit
has been removed because of the contract's upcoming expiration, at
$7.50 a bushel.
   Dry weather in the Mississippi River Delta region spurred a
surge in cotton futures on the New York Cotton Exchange, where most
contracts traded up the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit.
   The July cotton contract settled 1.46 cents higher at 66.61
cents a pound.
   Despite the inflationary implications of Monday's broadly higher
commodities futures prices, precious metals had a mixed day on New
York's Commodity Exchange. Gold finished modestly higher and silver
was moderately lower.
   Precious metals futures closed well below their highs of the
day. Traders may have taken profits and squared their positions
late in the session ahead of the government's balance-of-trade
report, due out Tuesday, said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $2.70 higher with May at $454.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 4.4 cents to 5 cents lower with May at $6.583 a
troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the USDA's monthly seven-state
cattle-on-feed report, which was released after the close.
   The report showed 4 percent more cattle being fattened for
slaughter on May 1 compared to a year earlier. The number was
within the market's expectations.
   The report also showed 9 percent fewer feedlot placements and 5
percent more cattle marketed in April. Those numbers were construed
as positive by analysts, who predicted higher futures prices on
Tuesday.
   Live cattle settled .55 cent lower to .65 cent higher with June
at 73.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to 1.07 cents
lower with May at 80.65 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to
.25 cent higher with June at 53.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent lower to 1.05 cents higher with May at 54.12
cents a pound.
   Energy futures settled higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to new Iraqi attacks on Iranian targets in the
Persian Gulf, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents to 24 cents
higher with June at $17.66 a barrel; heating oil was .51 cent to
.58 cent higher with June at 47.98 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .39 cent to .49 cent higher with June at 52.73 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures settled moderately higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's stock index finished 2 points higher at 259.55.

   A mild burst of late-afternoon buying helped
salvage a directionless stock-market session Monday and nudged the
key Dow Jones industrial average back over the 2,000 level.
   Brokers said optimism that the March trade-deficit numbers to be
released Tuesday would show substantial improvement strengthened
the market in the final hours, offsetting pessimism caused by
evidence of rising commodity prices, which means higher inflation.
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks, which seesawed in a
narrow range for much of the day, closed 17.08 points higher at
2,007.63, its first finish above 2,000 since last Tuesday. Broader
market indicators also rose.
   ``The market appears to be putting in a pretty good accounting
for itself considering the factors against it,'' said Joseph
Barthel, technical strategist for the Philadelphia investment firm
Butcher & Singer Inc.
   Nevertheless, business on the New York Stock Exchange remained
extremely sluggish, a reflection of the investor apathy that has
plagued the stock market since the crash seven months ago.
   NYSE volume totaled 155.01 million shares, compared with 147.24
million Friday. But without the dividend-related trading in one
stock, GTE, the volume on Monday would have been nearly one-third
less. GTE closed unchanged at 35}.
   ``There's a lot of cash on the sidelines,'' said Robert O'Toole,
manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York. ``When it comes in it's going to be a beautiful
market, but I don't see it coming in.''
   Most economists expect the March trade deficit number released
by the Commerce Department to total between $12 billion and $13
billion, down from an unexpectedly high $13.8 billion in February.
That number, released April 14, contributed to a 101.46-point
selloff in the Dow average.
   The financial markets are highly sensitive to the trade numbers
because they have come to symbolize America's economic weaknesses.
A high deficit translates into a cheaper dollar, inflation and the
necessity for higher interest rates.
   Besides GTE, the most-active issues included Staley Continental,
which fell { to 36] on news that it had accepted a sweetened
takoever offer of $36.50 a share from Tate & Lyle.
   Among prominent blue chips, General Electric rose 1[ to 40{,
General Motors rose 1{ to 76}, Dow Chemical rose 1\ to 82} and
Minnesota Mining rose 1} to 60 and IBM rose 1\ to 111|.
   Boeing, which received more than half of a 130-plane, $5.04
billion purchase order from International Lease Finance Corp., rose
] to 50[.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by slightly more than
3-to-2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 901 up, 559 down and 508 unchanged.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 173.84 million shares.
   The NYSE index for all listed issues rose 0.91 to 146.21.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.33 to 300.56,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.93 to 258.71.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of
5,000 NYSE, American and OTC issues, rose by $13.12 billion.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.02
to 297.96. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 373.35, up 0.87.

   A $3.69 billion jet order received by Boeing Co.
demonstrates the airplane manufacturer's reputation has been unhurt
_ and may even have been helped _ by recent air safety incidents,
industry analysts said Monday.
   An Aloha Airlines incident, in which part of a Boeing 737's
fuselage came off during a flight over Hawaii, was called ``a
positive, not a negative for Boeing'' by Judith L. Comeau an
aerospace industry analyst with Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York.
   ``That incident underscored the need to place new orders,'' Ms.
Comeau said.
   ``The integrity of that 737 was impressive. It's unfortunate
that one person died but remember, all the others landed safely,''
Ms. Comeau said.
   Other analysts agreed that while passenger concerns may have
been raised by the Aloha Airlines incident, people within the
airline industry continue to place great faith in Boeing's jets.
   That faith was evident Monday when Boeing, which has about 60
percent of the world's commercial airplane market, captured 77
percent of the biggest commercial airplane order in history.
   Interational Lease Finance ordered 130 planes, 100 from Boeing
and 30 from Airbus Industrie, a consortium of European-based
airlines. The order was for $5.04 billion, with planes to be
delivered over the next six years.
   Boeing's workhorse 737 series snagged the biggest chunk of the
order _ 72 of the 100 Boeing planes ordered _ and a mix of
wide-body and jumbo jets made up the rest of the order.
   Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese called the order a vote of
confidence in light of the Aloha Airlines incident.
   ``We really need it after everything that happened,'' Ms. Reese
said of the order.
   William Whitlow Jr., a Seattle-based securites analyst for Dain
Bosworth Inc., said Boeing might see more orders because of the
Aloha Airlines incident and other fuselage cracks reported in the
wheel well of an American Airlines jet.
   ``It didn't hurt Boeing. In fact these things have strengthened
their position in that people will start to look at airplanes and
admit that there's an end to their usefulness,'' Whitlow said.
   ``Age is going to become a factor, and that means demand will
increase because people are going to have to start retiring
airplanes earlier than they might have,'' he said.
   The Boeing order consists of 72 planes of models 737-300,
737-400 and 737-500; eight 757-200s; nine 767-300ERs; four
747-400s; and a previously unannounced order of six planes in the
737 series and one 757-200.
   The Airbus order consists of 18 model A320-200s; four
A300-600Rs; six A310-300s, two A340-300s and options for 40 more
planes.
   Boeing valued its share of the contract at $4.6 billion,
counting toward that total the price of 24 additional planes on
which the company has options to buy.
   The largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986, when
British Airways ordered 16 Boeing 747s for $2.3 billion. That deal
includes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring the
value to $4.1 billion.

<HEAD>Eastern, Continental Launch New Fares for Children, Seniors;
United Matches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines on
Monday announced new cut-rate fares for children and senior
citizens for the summer, and at least one other major airline
quickly followed suit.
   The two airlines also said they were easing some restrictions
now attached to regular ``MaxSaver'' deep-discount fares.
   The new Junior and Senior MaxSavers, which range from $29 to $99
one way, are about 30 percent lower than current MaxSaver fares.
They are available for travel between June 1 and Sept. 11 for
children under 18 and seniors over 65.
   ``These new fares make summer travel more affordable for the
entire family,'' Continental President Martin Shugrue told a
televised news conference originating in New York and Los Angeles.
``Grandparents can share in a summer excursion at a price that is
practical, even on a fixed income.''
   Continental launched a media blitz to publicize the new fares,
including a series of television commercials featuring nonagenarian
comedian George Burns.
   ``I don't think this is a panicked response'' to lower passenger
demand, said Anthony Hatch, an airline analyst for Argus Research
Corp. He said the new fares, mainly designed to garner favorable
publicity for the beleaguered carriers, are not likely to have a
significant impact on their profit.
   Eastern and Continental, both subsidiaries of giant Texas Air
Corp., are the targets of new, highly publicized federal
investigations into their finances and the safety of their fleets.
   The two airlines said they were cutting fares for children and
seniors because they have found those segments of the flying public
to be very sensitive to price changes. Airlines normally raise
fares at this time of the year since it is the start of the peak
travel season.
   Some observers suggested privately, however, that Eastern and
Continental may have introduced the cheap fares to fill seats made
vacant by slack summer bookings _ partly due to negative publicity
from the new federal inspections.
   United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, said Monday it
will match the special fares in the markets where it competes with
Continental.
   ``Continental is a major competitor of ours,'' said United
spokesman Joe Hopkins, noting that both airlines have major hubs at
Denver.
   Spokesmen for Northwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta
Air Lines said officials of those carriers were studying the new
fares and considering matching them.
   Eastern and Continental also said they were loosening some
restrictions on regular MaxSaver fares _ for a price, in some cases.
   The new rules allow travelers to change the flight on the return
portion of their MaxSaver ticket when the change is made before the
scheduled departure time of the original return flight, and at
least two days before the departure of the new flight. A $75
service charge must be paid to make the changes.
   Minimum-stay requirements were eased by allowing fliers to
return after 4 p.m. on Saturday, rather than the current obligation
to stay past midnight that day.
   MaxSavers are good for travel between noon on Mondays and noon
on Thursdays. They must be purchased in advance for a round trip
and are non-refundable.
   The new fares for children and senior citizens carry the same
restrictions as the regular, liberalized MaxSavers, and children
flying on Junior MaxSavers must be accompanied by an adult who can
use any fare.
   In addition to the Junior and Senior MaxSavers, Eastern is
offering a summer round-trip fare of $79 to $99 for children to fly
to 14 Florida cities.

   The giant Swiss food manufacturer Nestle SA said
Monday it was increasing its 14.7 percent stake in Rowntree PLC in
a continued effort to take over the British candy maker.
   Nestle said it purchased more Rowntree shares Friday and Monday.
   The Swiss company has offered to buy Rowntree for 2.1 billion
pounds, or $3.95 billion.
   Judging by the modest volume of trade, Nestle's total purchases
were small. According to official stock exchange figures, which
count both the buy and sell side of a transaction, 1.1 million
Rowntree shares changed hands.
   Nestle is also the object of a controversial takeover bid from
the Swiss company Jacobs Suchard, which has a 29.9 percent stake in
the company, the maximum allowed under British takeover regulations
short of a full takeover bid.

   A handful of major Wall Street investment houses
had no comment late Monday on the Reagan administration working
group's recommendations to prevent gyrations in the stock market.
   The report recommended the adopting of a ``circuit breaker''
mechanism that would shut down trading in the stock and futures
markets if the Dow Jones industrial average falls 250 points from
its previous close.
   On a separate issue, the working group, headed by Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, said existing margin requirements
appear to be adequate.
   On Wall Street, spokesmen for Merrill Lynch & Co., First Boston
Corp., Bear Stearns & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. had no
comment on the recommendation. They said they needed more time to
study the report.
   But New York Stock Exchange spokesman Richard Torrenzano said
there did not seem to be ``any surprise in the announcement ...
Basically, what they had said is what they've been discussing
before.''
   Torrenzano said he was not sure the report would affect
operations at the exchange because ``nothing has been put into
place yet.''
   The working group was appointed in March as a follow-up to a
White House-appointed commission chaired by Wall Street investment
banker Nicholas F. Brady. The group issued its report amid
criticism that the administration has not gone far enough to
prevent a recurrence of the Oct. 19 market crash, when the Dow
average plunged 508 points in a single session.
   Currently there is no mechanism in place that can halt trading.

   Allegheny International Inc. said Monday its
annual shareholders meeting, originally scheduled for Friday, has
been enjoined by order of federal bankruptcy court.
   Company officials said the court temporarily restrained the
meeting for 90 days from Friday. The court ruled the
Pittsburgh-based company may call the annual meeting after its
reorganization plan is submitted to shareholders and creditors, but
before they have voted on it.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh issued its ruling Monday as
a result of a motion by the Official Committee of Unsecured
Creditors of Allegheny International.
   ``Allegheny International did not ask the court to postpone its
annual meeting. But now that it has been postponed, AI management
can continue the pursuit of its primary objectives of filing a plan
of reorganiation and to further strengthen our consumer products
businesses,'' said Allegheny International Chairman Oliver S.
Travers.
   Allegheny International's products include Sunbeam and Oster
consumer electronics.

<HEAD>Administration Proposes Modest Steps in Response to Crash</HEAD>

   The Reagan administration working group on the
stock market crash issued a report Monday recommending a variety of
modest financial market changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of
last October's market crash.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who headed the group,
defended the panel's recommendations against charges by critics
that it did not go far enough in protecting individual investors.
   ``The working group has recognized that no one has a monopoly on
wisdom in this particular field and that never-ending debate over a
perfect solution would be the enemy of very good solutions,'' Baker
said in presenting the report at a news briefing.
   The panel's major recommendation was that a ``circuit breaker''
mechanism be adopted to shut down trading in the stock and futures
markets when extreme market movements threaten the entire system.
   The panel said all trading should be halted for one hour on both
stock and stock index futures markets if at any time the Dow Jones
industrial average declines by 250 points from its closing level on
the previous day.
   There is currently no such requirement for all trading to be
halted. However, the 250-point limit is so broad that it would have
been triggered only once in history, on Black Monday last Oct. 19,
when the market plunged a record 508 points in a single day.
   The next-largest single-day decline in the market was a
156.83-point fall last Oct. 26.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, another member of
the working group, said ``no one in this group likes circuit
breakers,'' and therefore the decision was made to make the trigger
broad enough that it would be tripped only on rare occasions.
   In another area, the panel said it had been unable to agree on
tougher margin, or credit, requirements to be imposed on investors,
but it said it believed that the existing requirements were
generally adequate.
   While SEC Chairman David Ruder favored imposition of tougher
margin requirements, he was out-voted by the other members of the
working group.
   The recommendations by the working group brought immediate
criticism that the administration has not gone far enough to
prevent a recurrence of last fall's market collapse.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said that while the working group had come up
with some ``useful recommendations,'' it was hamstrung by the fact
that the SEC was the only agency on the administration panel with
the legal mandate to protect investors.
   ``The consensus approach to regulatory coordination is destined
to fail,'' Dingell said in a statement. ``Within the working group,
the SEC will be constantly outvoted and crippled by those who value
ideology more than confidence in our capital markets.''
   But the panel said in a letter transmitting its recommendations
to President Reagan that it believed its proposals would promote
the orderly operation of the nation's financial markets and
``maintain the confidence of investors both large and small.''
   The working group was created in March as a followup to a White
House-appointed commission chaired by Wall Street investment banker
Nicholas F. Brady.
   In addition to Baker, Greenspan and Ruder, other members of the
panel were Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, and Treasury Undersecretary George Gould, who
represented Baker in most of the meetings.
   Richard Torrenzano, spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange,
said there had been no surprises in the recommendations.
``Basically, what they said is what they've been discussing
before,'' he said.
   The Fed, the SEC and the CFTC are the principal federal agencies
which currently regulate the financial markets.
   The five members of the Brady commission earlier this month
issued a letter critical of the lack of government reponse to the
sweeping reform proposals they had made in January. The statement
urged quick government action before another stock market crisis
occurs.
   But the commission's proposals were not viewed favorably by the
administration, which has been a strong opponent of what it viewed
as any interference of the operation of free markets despite calls
for greater action in Congress.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee with direct oversight of financial markets,
said: ``In only 60 days, the president's working group has turned
the Brady commission's bible on financial markets into a tower of
Babel.''
   He said it would now be up to Congress to take the necessary
regulatory actions that the administration failed to recommend.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, has introduced a bill that would create a three-member
committee to coordinate regulation, consisting of the chairmen of
the SEC, CFTC and the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed chairman would
head the panel, but disputes would be resolved by majority vote.

<HEAD>Brazil Resumes Talks With IMF, Announces Economic Goals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a three-year split, Brazil on
Monday began formal talks with the International Monetary Fund and
announced economic goals to slash its budget deficit and soaring
inflation.
   President Jose Sarney announced his administration's objectives
through 1989 after an all-morning meeting with the nation's
governors.
   The economic aims are a basis for lengthy negotiations with the
IMF. Although it has made its IMF loan payments, Brazil stopped
negotating with the fund in 1985, saying its policies were
recessionary.
   Sarney said Brazil planned to cut inflation, maintain economic
growth at 4 percent and cut the huge gaps in distribution of wealth
with three goals:
   _Immediate reduction of the public deficit to 4 percent from 5.5
percent;
   _Greater opening of Brazil to international markets, starting
with reestablishment of relations with international financial
communities, including the IMF;
   _Modernization and expansion of the economy.
   Details of the economic goals were to be worked out at a later
date.
   Finance minister Mailson da Nobrega said specific measures to be
announced later in the week would include a 0.9 percent cut in the
budget deficit, a new industrial policy and new trade rules to open
Brazil's market to foreign competition.
   An IMF team led by the South Atlantic division chief, Thomas
Reichmann, started talks Monday with the central bank and the
finance ministry on lending Brazil $1.5 billion in stand-by money
over the next 18 months.
   Reichmann said Brazil owes the fund $2.6 billion, $900 million
of which is due in 1988.
   Brazil owes $123 billion to foreign banks, and after a 11-month
moratorium on interest payments reached a preliminary agreement
earlier this year to reschedule some $64 billion in interest and
principal due over 20 years, with an eight-year grace period.
   ``We are here to help Brazilian authorities in what we can and
at the same time the IMF's goal is to promote harmony in whatever
way we can,'' Reichmann said at a news conference. ``But we are not
part of the negotiations with private banks.''
   However, one of the private bankers' requirements to renegotiate
their loans was that Brazil resume relations with the IMF.
   Brazil eased its hard-line stand against the IMF in mid-1987.

<HEAD>Visa, Sony Join Pepsi in Buying Time on Soviet Television</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visa, a credit card provider, and Sony Corp.,
the Japanese electronics giant, have joined Pepsi Cola as the first
foreign companies to buy commercial time on Soviet television, it
was announced Tuesday.
   Visa and Sony each have purchased five 30-second commercials on
a five-part program that features Soviet commentator Vladimir
Pozner talking with American citizens on a range of topics,
according to Global American Television, a Massachusetts firm
representing the Soviet broadcast agency.
   Pepsi Cola International, based in Somers, N.Y., announced last
week it had purchased five minutes of time on the program.
   The show begins airing in five 1-hour segments Tuesday through
Saturday on one of the government's main television channels.
   The cost of the ad purchases were not disclosed.
   Visa plans to air a commercial that calls attention to its
sponsorship of the 1988 Olympic games and the planned introduction
later this year of Visa cards through the Soviet tourist agency for
Russians who travel abroad, spokesman David Brancoli said.
   He said the cost of the purchases was being shared equally by
Visa U.S.A., based in San Francisco, and Visa Europe, based in
London.
   Global American said Sony has prepared three commercials for
airing.
   Pepsi Cola plans to air six different commercials, including two
1-minute spots that feature entertainer Michael Jackson.
   Each of the shows are expected to be seen by about 150 million
people. the commercials will be shown in two 1-minute breaks per
show, according to Pam Roberts of Global American, which is based
in Colrain, Mass.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge in New York granted LTV
Corp. a 90-day extension Monday to file a reorganization plan for
the company and its 65 subsidiaries.
   With the extension, LTV until Aug. 18 has the exclusive right to
present a reorganization plan to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York.
   The court in February had extended the deadline to May 20 from
Feb. 20 at the steel and aerospace giant's request.
   LTV filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors in
1986, saying the company was running out of cash because of
unprecedented problems in the steel industry, the company's large
debt burden and its heavy pension obligations.
   Last week, the company submitted a proposed reorganization plan
to its creditor groups for their consideration. Creditors are
negotiating to reach a consensus plan, company officials said.
   When the company achieves a plan agreeable to creditors, a
disclosure statement will be filed with the bankruptcy court for a
hearing. The hearing will be followed by a vote on the plan by all
creditors and shareholders, after which the bankruptcy court will
conduct a hearing to confirm the plan.
   LTV is the parent company of the nation's second largest
steelmaker and operates a diversified manufacturing company
involved in steel, aerospace-defense and energy products.

   The United Rubber Workers were in the second
day of a walkout against Firestone Inc. Monday while a strike
deadline drew closer at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
   URW and Goodyear representatives were scheduled to meet Tuesday
morning, hours before the noon deadline for 15,000 workers at 11
Goodyear plants. It was not clear Monday how many plants would
participate if a walkout occurred.
   The Rubber Workers' policy committee for Goodyear, which
includes the local presidents from each of the 11 plants, was
scheduled to meet at 8 a.m. with Goodyear officials in Akron, said
URW spokesman Curt Brown.
   The union set a strike deadline after Goodyear balked at going
back to the bargaining table in light of worker rejection of a
tentative contract settlement.
   Brown said the policy committee faced a number of options and
that a strike could be averted or postponed depending on Tuesday's
meeting.
   ``We still have a few hours until the strike deadline at noon
Tuesday, and we intend to use the time to see if a strike can be
averted,'' Goodyear said in a statement.
   ``Both parties traditionally have been willing to work up to the
last minute to avoid strikes that create hardships for employees
and affect the company's competitive position,'' Goodyear said.
``We'll do our best to resolve our differences.''
   Although 11 Goodyear plants nationwide were involved in the
contract talks, not all are expected to participate if a walkout
occurs. Six of the locals have approved the contract, although it
was rejected nationally.
   Brown said if a strike is sanctioned by the international union,
each local would decide whether to join the walkout.
   In Lincoln, Neb., union leaders have already decided Goodyear
workers will stay on the job, according to URW Local 286 Vice
President Lee Domeier. The local's bargaining committee and
executive board unanimously approved the decision to keep working,
he said.
   In Akron, members of URW Local 2, which previously approved the
contract by a 3-1 ratio, voted 722-691 in favor of striking on
Tuesday.
   There were no talks scheduled in the contract dispute between
Firestone and some 4,700 rubber workers.
   The union wanted the Goodyear contract to serve as an
industrywide pattern. The union went on strike against Firestone on
Sunday because Firestone failed to meet the pattern, URW President
Milan Stone said.
   Firestone officials, however, said their latest offer was
``equal in value and in cost'' to the pattern.
   The Goodyear contract proposal did not include a pay raise,
although there were improvements in cost-of-living allowances, and
pension and health insurance benefits.
   The third of the nation's Big Three tire makers, Uniroyal
Goodrich Tire Co., came to terms in mid-April in a contract taking
into account the company's special needs as a result of the recent
Goodrich and Uniroyal merger.
