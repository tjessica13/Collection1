<HEAD>Second Saboteur To Be Repatriated To France, Says Lange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister David Lange said
Friday that France has informed him it is allowing the return of a
second French secret agent who took part in the 1985 bombing of the
Rainbow Warrior off New Zealand.
   Lange accused the French government of flouting international
law with the move.
   The New Zealand prime minister said he was advised that Capt.
Dominique Prieur was returning to Paris ``forthwith'' from Hao
atoll.
   Ms. Prieur and Maj. Alain Mafart, the other French agent, were
supposed to remain in exile on the South Pacific island until July
1989 under an agreement worked out by the United Nations. The
accord stipulated that they could not leave the island without the
consent of New Zealand.
   Lange said he expected Ms. Prieur to arrive in Paris on Friday
or Saturday and that he intends to pursue the matter with French
authorities.
   ``There has been no confirmation of departure but it is not
consented to and should she leave it would be a clear breach of
France's obligation under international law,'' Lange said in a
statement.
   Ms. Prieur and Mafart were sent to New Zealand to stop the
Rainbow Warrior from leading a protest flotilla to Mururoa, a South
Pacific island where France conducts underground nuclear tests.
   One crewman on the Rainbow Warrior was killed in the bombing in
Auckland Harbor.
   The pair, who worked for the French secret service, the
Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure, pleaded guilty in
1985 to manslaughter.
   Mafart was repatriated in December last year after complaining
of a stomach disorder.
   France's decision to end Ms. Prieur's exile on Hao atoll follows
the release of three French hostages from Lebanon and Thursday's
bloody rescue in New Caledonia of 23 hostages held by Melanesian
separatists.
   All three events could boost the chances of conservative
candidate Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in the runoff in France's
presidential election Sunday. He is running against President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Mafart and Ms. Prieur originally were sentenced to 10 years in
jail. Their conviction sparked an unprecedented diplomatic row
between Paris and Wellington which ended after seven months, when
the sentences were commuted under the agreement worked out by
Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general.
   Under the agreement the pair was released into French custody on
Hao, a tiny military outpost near Mururoa.
   In return Paris apologized for the bombing, paid $7 million
compensation and promised not to block New Zealand exports to
Europe.

   The National Urban League on Thursday issued
an agenda for economic and social change, saying presidential
contenders should be evaluated on their commitment to reverse eight
years of leadership by an ``activist against civil rights.''
   ``This document presents an agenda for change because it will
make America's neglected poor people ... full participants in our
nation's economic and social life,'' said league President John E.
Jacob.
   ``What we are trying to do with this document is to force the
candidates to tell us where they stand on critical issues as they
relate to our community,'' Jacob said.
   The group issued a report entitled, ``Black Americans and Public
Policy: Perspectives of the National Urban League.''
   Jacob said the league hopes to help black voters evaluate the
presidential candidates and to influence the Democratic and
Republican party platforms. Those platforms should be ``designed
not only to attract the black vote but designed to address black
needs.''
   ``We believe civil rights and social justice to be an agenda
item on any president's program,'' Jacob said. ``An agenda item in
the sense that the pulpit of the presidency is used as a bully
pulpit to be an advocate, an activist president on the behalf of
civil rights.''
   He said the greatest achievements in civil rights occurred
during administrations in which the president expressed such a
commitment.
   ``The last eight years have also indicated that when we have a
president who is an activist against civil rights, we've had the
greatest moving back on these kinds of issues,'' he said.
   Jacob called for full employment programs, including job
training targeted to the most disadvantaged, and increased
educational services to help black youth.
   ``This is the work force that this nation will be depending upon
in the future,'' he said.
   He also urged presidential leadership on welfare reform, saying
the issue cannot be left totally to the Congress.
   ``We need a president who is articulating the need to eradicate
the dependency phase of welfare reform and provide an opportunity
for people to graduate into independence through training, through
education, through skill development,'' he said.
   Jacob also stressed the need for development of a black economic
agenda to help foster a business class and increase economic
stability in the black community and ``close the wage and the
wealth gap that exists between the races.''

<HEAD>Labor Scores Gains In British Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with late returns. No pickup.</NOTE>

   The socialist Labor Party scored heavily in
municipal elections early Friday, overtaking the Conservatives in
the first electoral test of Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
radical third-term program.
   The big loser in Thursday's voting was the Social and Liberal
Democratic Party, however. It was formed in March to merge the
centrists, but a breakaway faction remained a separate party.
   With results in from most of the 211 councils being contested in
England, Wales and Scotland, Labor had a net gain of 109 seats,
while the Conservatives had a net loss of three and the centrists
lost more than 70, the British domestic news agency Press
Association calculated.
   At stake were one-third of the nearly 4,000 seats in 158 English
and Welsh districts and the entire councils of all 53 cities and
towns of Scotland. There are no elections this year in London and
Northern Ireland.
   A British Broadcasting Corp. computer analysis showed Labor took
39 percent of the vote, a nine-point jump since the general
election last June, while the Conservatives had 37 percent, five
points down, and the centrists with 18 percent suffered a
four-point drop.
   The Laborites kept Birmingham, Britain's second largest city,
and Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, and took control of Cambridge.
   Despite a five-point swing against the Conservatives compared
with last June, however, the Tories posted gains in the south and
took control of five councils where previously no party had control.
   The Tories had control of 46 of the contested cities and towns,
up five; Labor had 94, up three; the centrists eight, unchanged,
while 63 authorities were run by independents or had no overall
control.
   Labor tripled its narrow majority in the west England port of
Bristol, a prime Tory target.
   However, Labor advances were mainly at the expense of the
squabbling centrist parties while the Conservatives made gains in
their heartlands of the prosperous south.
   ``We're absolutely delighted,'' said Labor's environment
spokesman, John Cunningham.
   ``In our strongholds and in the inner cities, we're making gains
across the board. In the southwest we're making a small number of
gains which is heartening,'' Cunningham said.
   But Mrs. Thatcher's environment secretary, Nicholas Ridley, said
the Conservative showing was ``rather good ... for a government
that is making major changes.''
   Polls were open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m Thursday.
   Twenty million Britons were eligible to vote in the elections to
fill the seats, last contested in 1984. About 10,800 candidates
were running.
   The election was viewed as a litmus test of the sweeping social
reform program of Mrs. Thatcher's government. The opposition Labor
Party focused on the tax and welfare changes, which critics say
will hurt the poor.
   The tougher welfare standards are aimed at ending what the
Tories call Britain's ``dependency culture'' nurtured by the
welfare state.
   The opposition has also criticized new legislation that would
change the property tax system. Taxes would be levied on each adult
in a home, rather than on the building. Critics say the tax would
double or triple bills for millions of households.

   Thinking a few moves ahead, producers of the
$6.2 million Broadway play ``Chess'' have cut more than 10 minutes
from the less-than-acclaimed show in an effort to improve its
position and check overtime costs.
   ``One comment we received from even the people who were
enthusiastic about the play was that it was too long,'' Gerald
Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, one of the play's
co-producers, said Wednesday. ``We wanted to enhance the show.
   ``We also save a bunch of money,'' said Bernard Jacobs,
Schubert's president. ``But that's incidental. If the show doesn't
make it, the amount spent in weekly operating costs is minimal over
a long-term period.''
   Before the cuts, the curtain came down at about 11:10 each
night. Because overtime begins at 11, the extra 10 minutes a night
amounted to about $25,000 a week, in part because its complicated
sets and lighting requires more than 40 stagehands.
   The cuts, which total between 11 and 12 minutes, bring the
curtain down before 11 and save all the overtime.
   They were agreed to last weekend by Trevor Nunn, the director;
Time Rice, the lyricist; and Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, the
composers, Schoenfeld said.

   McNicol Middle School is developing a reputation
around these parts for producing students with a sharp eye _ if not
for studies then at least for big cockroaches.
   Susan Qunn, a science teacher at the suburban Hollywood school,
challenged her students for the second straight year to spread out
and hunt for monster cockroaches. Her students turned in 21
entries, one of which won Wednesday.
   The state winner last year in the contest for biggest roach was
a sixth-grader at McNicol, and went on to win the national
Roach-Off.
   On Wednesday, the winning entrant, found by sixth-grader Marvell
Berry, was dead by the time of the judging, but that didn't detract
from the glory of the moment.
   ``You're going to be a star,'' Tom Daubert whispered to the tiny
corpse of Florida's champion cockroach as the 1.75-inch bug was
crowned in the state finals of the Great American Roach-Off II. The
winner will be flown to the Philadelphia Zoo to measure up against
seven other regional finalists for the national title on July 7.
   Daubert, an exterminator for Alert Pest Control in Miami and a
judge for the Roach-Off sequel, predicted that the winning roach
will successfully ``defend Florida's national cockroach crown.''

   A landmark hotel-casino that was an adult
playground for the likes of Mae West, Judy Garland and Marilyn
Monroe in its heyday could get a new lease on life.
   Nevada gaming veterans George Karadanis and Robert Maloff, who
own the 600-room Sundowner hotel-casino and are building the
119-room Virginian in Reno, confirmed Wednesday they plan to buy
the 40-year-old Mapes hotel-casino, which has been closed since
1982.
   The two and First Interstate Bank of Nevada, which foreclosed on
the property in 1983, refused to release details of the pending
sale. But the bank previously rejected offers up to $8 million and
the property has been appraised at $10 million.
   ``There are no immediate plans for the Mapes,'' Karadanis said
through a spokeswoman on Tuesday.
   First Interstate President Ronald Zurek said the purchase deal
is expected to be closed in 30 days and Saturday's planned auction
of the 12-story hotel and casino and surrounding parking lot has
been cancelled.
   In the 1950s, big-name entertainers such as Judy Garland, Mae
West, Gypsy Rose Lee and Milton Berle performed in the 12th floor
Mapes Skyroom. Marilyn Monroe was a hotel guest when she was in the
Reno area filming the movie ``The Misfits,'' the last motion
picture she completed.

   NBC-TV is moving ``The Days and Nights of
Molly Dodd'' and ``Night Court'' to new nights and bringing back
reruns of a comedy it canceled three years ago.
   ``Molly Dodd,'' which has been broadcast on Thursday nights,
will be seen at 9:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday, May 25. On June 1, it will
move to 9 p.m. and be followed by reruns of ``Sara.'' ``Molly
Dodd'' will be off the air from May 5 to May 25 when it will return
with seven original episodes.
   ```Molly Dodd' has had a significant opportunity for sampling on
our strong Thursday night schedule,'' said Brandon Tartikoff,
president of NBC Entertainment. ``Our hope is the audience will
follow it to Wednesday night for another good summer run.''
   He added that the show should be compatible with ``Sara,'' which
focuses on the life of a young woman attorney in San Francisco and
stars Geena Davis.
   ``Night Court'' will return to its original time slot of 9:30
p.m. EDT on Thursdays behind ``Cheers'' with the departure of Molly
Dodd. It had been running on Friday nights. ``Night Court'' has new
episodes for Thursday, May 5 and May 12.

<HEAD>Report: Official Confirms Diversion of Heavy Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Norwegian official confirmed Wednesday that a
shipment of ``heavy water,'' which can be used in nuclear reactors
and in making nuclear weapons, was diverted to an unknown
destination in 1983, The New York Times reported.
   ``We have confirmed today that 15 tons of Norwegian heavy water
is missing,'' Lasse Seim, a spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign
Ministry in Washington, told The Times in an interview.
   Seim said the diversion appeared to be the result of an
international conspiracy involving a West German company and that
Norway had asked West Germany to investigate, the newspaper
reported in its Thursday editions.
   The heavy water, or deuterium oxide, had been sold to a West
German company, Rohstoff Einfuhr, and was to be flown in December
1983 from Oslo to Frankfurt, Seim said. But the plane flew instead
to Basel, Switzerland, and the heavy water was then shipped to an
unknown destination, he said.
   The Oslo government and the company that sold the heavy water
were unaware of the diversion until press reports appeared in
Norway and Germany, Seim said.
   A man identified in Norwegian press reports as the operator of
Rohstoff Einfuhr, Alfred Hempel, has been linked in the past to
trade in heavy water, The Times reported, citing unidentified
American officials. One U.S. government specialist said he was
believed to have sold heavy water to India in the past, the
newspaper said.
   Heavy water can be used to enable nuclear reactors to run on
natural uranium rather than enriched uranium fuel, and to produce
plutonium which in turn can be used in nuclear weapons. India has
several nuclear reactors that use heavy water.

   President Reagan was asked for disaster
aid Thursday for this city rocked by explosions at a space shuttle
fuel plant that killed two workers, including a polio-stricken man
unable to run for his life, officials said.
   The man, whose body has not been found since the blast
Wednesday, had stayed behind to call the Fire Department, said an
official at the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. of Nevada
plant.
   The blasts leveled 12 buildings at the Pacific plant and a
marshmallow factory. Steel girders were twisted like pretzels and
cars parked nearby were barely recognizable chunks of melted metal.
   Concussions from the blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in
Las Vegas, jolted airliners in flight, peeled off roofs, upended
cars and threw workers through walls. Broken windows and cracked
foundations were common in Henderson.
   More than 255 people were injured, four critically.
   Union officials charged the plant was unsafe and the subject of
numerous complaints. The chairman of the company denied the charges.
   The body of Bruce Bernard Halker, 56, vice president of
operations at Pacific, was identified Thursday. Pacific officials
told employees Thursday that they had concluded a second worker,
Leroy Westerfield, died as well.
   ``Mr. Westerfield had polio some time ago and had difficulty
moving rapidly,'' said company attorney Keith Rooker. Employees at
the meeting said Westerfield couldn't run.
   ``It's my understanding that a number of people asked Mr.
Westerfield to leave and he said no because he had to call the fire
department,'' Rooker said.
   The fire and explosions were caused by an equipment malfunction,
said Pacific Chairman Fred Gibson Jr.
   U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., toured the site after asking
Reagan in a letter to declare Henderson a federal emergency
disaster area, a move that would open the door to low-interest
loans to enable residents to repair damage.
   ``Certainly being here confirms what I did was valid,'' Reid
said.
   ``I think we're looking at tens of millions of dollars in
damages,'' said Gov. Richard Bryan.
   ``There were miracles all over town,'' said Mayor Lorna
Kesterson, who declared Thursday a day of thanksgiving in the
community of 54,000.
   Jim Thompson, president of Steelworkers Union Local 4856, said
Thursday, ``Our big problem was trying to get standards and
procedures developed for handling of this product through either
federal or state OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health
Administration).''
   ``We've had people burned, we've had people blown up _ minor
explosions that severely injured workers,'' Thompson charged. ``I
think if we had had proper safety standards in effect, and caring
people, we would not have what we have today _ a major catastrophe
on our hands.''
   The union released a letter from John Molovich, safety and heath
technician with the United Steelworkers union, following a 1982
tour of the plant. In the letter, he called the plant `` one of the
worst I have ever been into,'' and added: ``I cannot understand how
this plant has not been blown off the face of the earth.''
   ``It is a safe plant and I am stating there have been no fires
there,'' Gibson countered. ``We had inspections from OSHA and we
had no continuing problems with anything.''
   OSHA officials say they are barred by state law from discussing
any company's record.
   James Candrell, maintenance general foreman at the plant, called
the union officials ``hardnoses'' and contended Pacific ``had the
best safety program anybody had.'' He called the explosion a freak
accident.
   Greater loss of life was averted by hasty evacuation from the
rocket fuel plant when a fire flared out of control.
   But Bill Piper, 34, a forklift operator at the Kidd Co.
marshmallow factory, said the fire was burning at Pacific
Engineering for quite some time before the explosions. Moments
after he was told to leave, the first explosion hit.
   ``If we'd been in there in the second blast, forget it,'' said
Piper, who was critical of Pacific for failing to warn its neighbor.
   ``They underestimated what they had going there. We could all
have been killed,'' he said.
   The explosions sent a plume of acrid smoke high into the sky
over the desert of southern Nevada, but it dissipated by nightfall
Wednesday and Environmental Protection Agency officials determined
Thursday the site wasn't hazardous.
   Some shaken residents had abandoned their homes overnight.
   Pacific Engineering is one of two plants that makes ammonium
perchlorate, an oxidizer that provides oxygen for burning fuel in
the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters and the Minuteman and
Titan missiles.
   The other company is Kerr-McGee, located just a mile away.
   Kerr-McGee manager Patt Corbett said plant operations were shut
down after the Pacific Engineering explosions, which ripped tiles
from ceilings in the Kerr-McGee buildings.
   ``We're trying to start back up,'' he said, adding employees
were called to a Thursday morning meeting to assure them their
plant was safe.
   The explosions were so strong they were picked up by earthquake
monitoring equipment. The most powerful of several explosions
registered 3.5 on the Richter scale, said Bob Finn, spokesman for
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif.

   Jean Stapleton will play a wealthy,
clever woman studying Italian in a one-woman show Friday at Wilson
College to raise money for a scholarship in her name.
   Ms. Stapleton, best known as Edith Bunker in the television
series ``All in the Family,'' will play in ``The Italian Lesson.''
Tickets will cost $35.
   ``I've had a long association with Wilson,'' Ms. Stapleton said
Wednesday.
   In 1985, Ms. Stapleton gave the women's college her papers and
memorabilia and those of the nearby Totem Pole Playhouse, which was
run by her late husband, William Putch.
   ``The Totem Pole Playhouse is a very big jewel in the community,
as is Wilson College,'' Ms. Stapleton said.
   Putch received an honorary doctorate in May 1983 from Wilson,
which has 500 full-time students. He died that November.
   ``Wilson is honored to be able to establish a scholarship in Ms.
Stapleton's name in recognition of her accomplishments and her
dedication to the advancement of women,'' said Mary-Linda Merriam,
president of the 118-year-old college.
   Ms. Stapleton, 65, won three Emmy awards for her work on the
1970s' series ``All in the Family.'' She has appeared in 81 shows
in the Totem Pole Playhouse.

   The 33-year-old Evert, who is ranked third in the world, said
she did not play well in the first set. But with her fiance, Andy

   British filmmaker Paul Tivers kept mum on
the details, but he surely was tantalized by the location _ mostly
underwater in tanks at an abandoned, unfinished nuclear reactor.
   ``The one we're going to do is very complicated and very unusual
and we're going to do something nobody else has ever done before,''
Tivers said. ``But we're guarding the script very closely at this
point.''
   Tivers, production supervisor for the movies ``Aliens'' and
``Empire Of The Sun,'' met with a small group of businessmen and
community leaders on Wednesday. He said production would begin in
July at Earl Owensby's Studio City.
   The reactor is part of Studio City, the 2,000-acre site on Broad
River that Owensby bought from Duke Power Co. after the utility
decided to abandon construction of Cherokee Nuclear Station.
   The unfinished reacter dome is being transformed into a 15
million-gallon filming tank. A nearby pit is being transformed into
a 3 million-gallon tank.

   New York has often played a role in the films of
directors Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese,
and now they're getting together to tell ``New York Stories.''
   Production work has started on the trilogy on life in modern
Manhattan for Disney's Touchstone Pictures. Since the project was
led by Allen, it carries its usual Allenesque cloak of secrecy.
   All a Disney spokesman would say was that Allen will write,
direct and star in his segment but that no other casting has been
confirmed. Coppola is writing his segment with his daughter, Sofia.
Richard Price (``The Color of Money'') is writing Scorsese's
segment.
   Coppola shot ``The Godfather'' and ``The Cotton Club'' in New
York. Scorsese did ``Raging Bull,'' ``Mean Streets,'' ``Taxi
Driver'' and ``King of Comedy'' here. And just about all of Allen's
work is Manhattan-based.
   Disney said the movie, tentatively called ``New York Stories,''
will be released early next year.

   Sam Elliott plays an undercover cop in his
new film, but the point is to get out from the shadows, he says.
   ``Shakedown,'' which opens Friday, is a conscious effort ``to
elevate myself in this business,'' Elliott said recently.
   ``I'm trying to ally myself with commercially oriented movies so
that I can become bankable and therefore get better roles,'' he
said. ``I've turned stuff down because I didn't believe in it, and
I don't want to do anything I can't believe in.
   ``If it isn't real for me, it won't be real up on the screen.''
   Elliott, 43, lives in Malibu with his actress-wife, Katharine
Ross.

<HEAD>Spring Melt Causes `Acid Shock' In Eastern Canada's Lakes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAKE LAFLAMME, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The snow lies nearly two feet deep
under the fir trees around Lake Laflamme in the Laurentian
Mountains. But the pastoral scene masks one of Canada's worst
environmental hazards: acid shock.
   Each spring as the snow melts, airborne pollutants that
accumulated over the winter in the boreal forest are flushed into
the lakes of eastern Canada, causing up to 100 times the normal
level of acidity and killing the fish.
   ``Lakes in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada are under siege,''
federal Environment Minister Tom McMillan told reporters who
traveled an hour north of Quebec City to Montmorency Forest this
week to observe the acid shock phenomenon at Lake Laflamme.
   McMillan said half the acid rain and snow falling there
originates from U.S. smokestack emissions and vehicle exhausts, and
he repeated Canada's demand for U.S. legislation to slash those
emissions under a fixed timetable.
   The offending sulfates and nitrates have killed all fish life in
14,000 Canadian lakes and another 150,000 lakes are being
acidified, he said.
   ``It's the North American continent's No. 1 environmental
problem. Together, we must act to defeat it. If we don't, it will
defeat us,'' the minister said.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney made the same plea last month to
President Reagan and Congress, but won only a promise for more
talks.
   ``We didn't think it was going to be easy to convince a
president who had attributed acid rain to trees and ducks and
volcanoes,'' said McMillan.
   The Reagan administration argues that more cause-and-effect
research is needed before billions of dollars are spent on
smokestack filters and scrubbers and other measures to curb the 3.2
million metric tons a year of sulfur dioxide flowing across the
border from the United States.
   Since 1980, a team of 40 Canadian scientists has used Lake
Laflamme as an acid shock laboratory to develop the world's first
computer model on the amount of acid pollution that can be
anticipated during spring run-off.
   But ironically, the government-organized visit to the tiny,
remote lake underlined U.S. reservations over Canada's tough stand
on acid rain.
   For one thing, the United States plans to spend far more money
on acid rain research than Canada.
   Reagan agreed in 1986 to ask Congress for $2.5 billion U.S. over
five years to develop clean-coal technology, with an equal amount
coming from industry. Little has been appropriated thus far, but it
was a commitment.
   In Canada, seven federal departments spend a total of just $18
million ($14.5 million U.S.) a year on acid rain.
   McMillan said this did not take provincial spending into account
but added: ``One of the problems in the United States is that
research has become a buzzword for, `We're not going to do anything
about the problem itself.'''
   Mulroney and McMillan often assert that acid rain is damaging
Canada's forests. But Claude Godbout, research director at the
Quebec Ministry of Energy and Resources, said there is ``no
scientific proof'' of such damage.
   Thousands of dead trees along the road to Lake Laflamme fell
prey to spruce budworm, not acid rain, Godbout said. ``There's been
an epidemic since 1970. But there is some suspicion that acid rain
weakened the trees.''
   McMillan claimed the Canadian maple syrup industry may collapse
within 10 years because of maple die back in which acid rain is a
``major factor.'' But Godbout said high concentrations of ozone may
cause more damage.
   Godbout nevertheless favored reductions in acid rain emissions.
He quoted the French philosopher Pascal's aphorism on the existence
of God: ``If heaven exists and I am a Christian, I win. If I am not
a Christian, I lose. I can't take the gamble. It's the same with
acid rain.''
   Despite its high acidity, Lake Laflamme still supports 2,000
brook trout. Scientists measure acidity and alkalinity on a pH
scale from 0 to 14, with 7 representing neutrality and less than 7
showing increased acidity. Lakes generally need a pH of 5.0 or
above to sustain fish life.
   The pH at Lake Laflamme dips to 3.9 during spring run-off and
still supports life.
   Researchers explained that every lake is different, and many
factors are involved in destroying life, including the degree of
acid shock in springtime, and the content and buffering ability of
the nearby soil and lake bed.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager accused of taking part in the
1985 slaying of a convenience store clerk while playing a fantasy
game pleaded guilty to murder Wednesday and was sentenced to life
in prison.
   The plea bargain was reached during jury selection for Chris
White's capital murder trial in the slaying of 26-year-old Missy
Lee Macon.
   In pleading guilty to the lesser charge of murder, the
17-year-old could become eligible for parole after 10 years, said
Assistant St. Clair County District Attorney Gibson Holladay.
   If convicted of capital murder, White would have been sentenced
to the electric chair or life in prison without parole.
   White was the youngest of three Ragland teen-agers charged in
the 1985 shooting of the Ragland convenience store clerk. All were
certified to stand trial as adults. White was 14 when Mrs. Macon
was killed.
   Cayce Moore, 17 when Mrs. Macon was shot to death, was convicted
last year and sentenced to life in prison without parole. A third
defendant, Scott Davis, has yet to be tried. He also was 17 at the
time of the slaying.
   According to testimony, the three were playing Top Secret, in
which they pretended to be carrying out a secret mission, the night
Mrs. Macon was slain.
   White and Moore entered the store 40 miles northeast of
Birmingham while Davis waited in a car, and Moore fired the fatal
shot, according to testimony.

<HEAD>A Message from the Surgeon General</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This brochure has been sent to you by the government of the
United States. In preparing it, we have consulted with the top
health experts in the country.
   I feel it is important that you have the best information now
available for fighting the AIDS virus, a health problem that the
president has called ``Public Enemy No. 1.''
   Stopping AIDS is up to you, your family and your loved ones.
   Some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things
you are used to discussing openly. I can easily understand that.
But now you must discuss them. We all must know about AIDS. Read
this brochure and talk about it with those you love. Get involved.
Many schools, churches, synagogues, and community groups offer AIDS
education activities.
   I encourage you to practice responsible behavior based on
understanding and strong personal values. This is what you can do
to stop AIDS.

<HEAD>What AIDS Means to You</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   AIDS is one of the most serious health problems that has ever
faced the American public. It is important that we all, regardless
of who we are, understand this disease.
   AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is a
disease caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV _ the AIDS
virus.
   The AIDS virus may live in the human body for years before
actual symptoms appear. It primarily affects you by making you
unable to fight other diseases. These other diseases can kill you.
   Many people feel that only certain ``high risk groups'' of
people are infected by the AIDS virus. This is untrue. Who you are
has nothing to do with whether you are in danger of being infected
with the AIDS virus. What matters is what you do.
   People are worried about getting AIDS. Some should be worried
and need to take some serious precautions. But many are not in
danger of contracting AIDS.
   The purpose of this brochure is to tell you how you can, and
just as important, how you can't become infected with the AIDS
virus.
   Your children need to know about AIDS. Discuss it with them as
you would any health concern.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>How Do You Get AIDS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   There are two main ways you can get AIDS. First, you can become
infected by having sex _ oral, anal or vaginal _ with someone who
is infected with the AIDS virus.
   Second, you can be infected by sharing drug needles and syringes
with an infected person.
   Babies of women who have been infected with the AIDS virus may
be born with the infection becuse it can be transmitted from the
mother to the baby before or during birth.
   In addition, some persons with hemophilia and others have been
infected by receiving blood.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Difference Between Giving and Receiving Blood</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   1. Giving blood. You are not now, nor have you ever been in
danger of getting AIDS from giving blood at a blood bank. The
needles that are used for blood donations are brand-new. Once they
are used, they are destroyed. There is no way you can come into
contact with the AIDS virus by donating blood.
   2. Receiving blood. The risk of getting AIDS from a blood
transfusion has been greatly reduced. In the interest of making the
blood supply as safe as possible, donors are screened for risk
factors and donated blood is tested for the AIDS antibody. Call
your local blood bank if you have questions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Can You Become Infected?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Yes, if you engage in risky behavior.
   The male homosexual population was the first in this country to
feel the effects of the disease. But in spite of what you may have
heard, the number of heterosexual cases is growing.
   People who have died of AIDS in the U.S. have been male and
female, rich and poor, white, Black, Hispanic, Asian and American
Indian.

<HEAD>How Do You Get AIDS from Sex?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS virus can be spread by sexual intercourse whether you
are male or female, heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual.
   This happens because a person infected with the AIDS virus may
have the virus in semen or vaginal fluids. The virus can enter the
body through the vagina, penis, rectum or mouth.
   Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky. The rectum
is easily injured during anal intercourse.
   Remember, AIDS is sexually transmitted, and the AIDS virus is
not the only infection that is passed through intimate sexual
contact.
   Other sexual transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis,
herpes and chlamydia, can also be contracted through oral, anal and
vaginal intercourse. If you are infected with one of these diseases
and engage in risky behavior you are at greater risk of getting
AIDS.

<HEAD>You Won't Get AIDS From Insects _ Or A Kiss</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   No matter what you may have heard, the AIDS virus is hard to get
and is easily avoided.
   You won't just ``catch'' AIDS like a cold or flu because the
virus is a different type. The AIDS virus is transmitted through
sexual intercourse, the sharing of drug needles, or to babies of
infected mothers before or during birth.
   You won't get the AIDS virus through everyday contact with the
people around you in school, in the workplace, at parties, child
care centers, or stores. You won't get it by swimming in a pool,
even if someone in the pool is infected with the AIDS virus.
Students attending school with someone infected with the AIDS virus
are not in danger from casual contact.
   You won't get AIDS from a mosquito bite. The AIDS virus is not
transmitted through a mosquito's salivary glands like other
diseases such as malaria or yellow fever. You won't get it from bed
bugs, lice, flies or other insects, either.
   You won't get AIDS from saliva, sweat, tears, urine or a bowel
movement.
   You won't get AIDS from a kiss.
   You won't get AIDS from clothes, a telephone, or from a toilet
seat. It can't be passed by using a glass or eating utensils that
someone else has used. You won't get the virus by being on a bus,
train or crowded elevator with a person who is infected with the
virus, or who has AIDS.

<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What Behavior Puts You At Risk?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You are at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus if you
have sex with someone who is infected, or if you share drug needles
and syringes with someone who is infected.
   Since you can't be sure who is infected, your chances of coming
into contact with the virus increase with the number of sex
partners you have. Any exchange of infected blood, semen or vaginal
fluids can spread the virus and place you at great risk.
   The following behaviors are risky when performed with an
infected person. You can't tell by looking if a person is infected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Risky Behavior</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sharing drug needles and syringes.
   Anal sex, with or without a condom.
   Vaginal or oral sex with someone who shoots drugs or engages in
anal sex.
   Sex with someone you don't know well (a pickup or prostitute) or
with someone you know has several sex partners.
   Unprotected sex (without a condom) with an infected person.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Safe Behavior</HEAD>

   Not having sex.
   Sex with one mutually faithful, uninfected partner.
   Not shooting drugs.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>What About Dating?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dating and getting to know other people is a normal part of
life. Dating doesn't mean the same thing as having sex. Sexual
intercourse as a part of dating can be risky. One of the risks is
AIDS.
   How can you tell if someone you're dating or would like to date
has been exposed to the AIDS virus? The bad news is, you can't. But
the good news is, as long as sexual activity and sharing drug
needles are avoided, it doesn't matter.
   You are going to have to be careful about the person you become
sexually involved with, making your own decision based on your own
best judgment. That can be difficult.
   Has this person had any sexually transmitted diseases? How many
people have they been to bed with? Have they experimented with
drugs? All these are sensitive, but important, questions. But you
have a personal responsibility to ask.
   Think of it this way. If you know someone well enough to have
sex, then you should be able to talk about AIDS. If someone is
unwilling to talk, you shouldn't have sex.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Do Married People Get AIDS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Married people who are uninfected, faithful and don't shoot
drugs are not at risk. But if they engage in risky behavior, they
can become infected with the AIDS virus and infect their partners.
If you feel your spouse may be putting you at risk, talk to him or
her. It's your life.

<HEAD>What Is All The Talk About Condoms?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Not so very long ago, condoms (rubbers or prophylactics) were
things we didn't talk about very much.
   Now, they're discussed on the evening news and on the front page
of your newspaper, and displayed out in the open in your local drug
store, grocery and convenience store.
   For those who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual
activity to one partner, condoms have been shown to help prevent
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That is why the use of
condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of AIDS.
   Condoms are the best preventive measure against AIDS besides not
having sex and practicing safe behavior.
   But condoms are far from being foolproof. You have to use them
properly. And you have to use them every time you have sex, from
start to finish. If you use a condom, you should remember these
guidelines:
   (1) Use condoms made of latex rubber. Latex serves as a barrier
to the virus. ``Lambskin'' or ``natural membrane'' condoms are not
as good because of the pores in the material. Look for the word
``latex'' on the package.
   (2) A condom with a spermicide may provide additional
protection. Spermicides have been shown in laboratory tests to kill
the virus. Use the spermicide in the tip and outside the condom.
   (3) Condom use is safer with a lubricant. Check the list of
ingredients on the back of the lubricant package to make sure the
lubricant is water-based. Do not use petroleum-based jelly, cold
cream, baby oil or cooking shortening. These can weaken the condom
and cause it to break.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What Does Someone With AIDS Look Like?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It is very important that everyone understands that a person can
be infected with the AIDS virus without showing any symptoms at all.
   It is possible to be infected for years, feel fine, look fine
and have no way of knowing you are infected unless you have a test
for the AIDS virus.
   During this period, however, people infected with the AIDS virus
can pass the virus to sexual partners, to people with whom drug
needles are shared, and to children before or during birth. That is
one of the most disturbing things about AIDS.
   Once symptoms do appear, they are similar to the symptoms of
some other diseases. As the disease progresses, they become more
serious. That is because the AIDS virus keeps your body's natural
defenses from operating correctly.
   If you are concerned whether you might be infected, consider
your own behavior and its effects on others. If you feel you need
to be tested for the AIDS virus, talk to a doctor or an AIDS
counselor for more information. (See below.)
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Is There A Cure For AIDS?
   There is presently no cure for AIDS.
   Medicines such as AZT have prolonged the lives of some people
with AIDS. There is hope that additional treatments will be found.
   There is also no vaccine to prevent uninfected people from
getting the infection. Researchers believe it may take years for an
effective, safe vaccine to be found.
   The most effective way to prevent AIDS is avoiding exposure to
the virus, which you can control by your own behavior.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Should you Get An AIDS Test?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You have probably heard about the ``AIDS Test.'' the test
doesn't actually tell you if you have AIDS. It shows if you have
been infected with the virus. It looks for changes in blood that
occur after you have been infected.
   The Public Health Service recommends you be confidentially
counseled and tested if you have had any sexually transmitted
disease or shared needles; if you are a man who has had sex with
another man; or if you have had sex with a prostitute, male or
female. You should be tested if you have had sex with anyone who
has done any of these things.
   If you are a woman who has been engaging in risky behavior and
you plan to have a baby or are not using birth control, you should
be tested.
   Your doctor may advise you to be counseled and tested if you are
a hemophiliac, or have received a blood transfusion between 1978
and 1985.
   If you test positive, and find you have been infected with the
AIDS virus, you must take steps to protect your partner.
   People who have always practiced safe behavior do not need to be
tested.
   There's been a great deal in the press about problems with the
test. It is very reliable if it is done by a good laboratory and
the results are checked by a physician or counselor.
   If you have engaged in risky behavior, speak frankly to a doctor
who understands the AIDS problem, or to an AIDS counselor.
   For more nformation, call your local public health agency.
They're listed in the government section of your phone book. Or,
call your local AIDS hotline. If you can't find the number, call
1-800-342-AIDS.

<HEAD>The Problem Of Drugs And AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Today, in some cities, the sharing of drug needles and syringes
by those who shoot drugs is the fastest growing way that the virus
is being spread.
   No one should shoot drugs. It can result in addiction, poor
health, family disruption, emotional disturbances and death. Many
drug users are addicted and need to enter a drug treatment program
as quickly as possible.
   In the meantime, these people must avoid AIDS by not sharing any
of the equipment used to prepare and inject illegal drugs.
   Sharing drug needles, even once, is an extremely easy way to be
infected with the AIDS virus. Blood from an infected person can be
trapped in the needle or syringe, and then injected directly into
the bloodstream of the next person who uses the needle.
   Other kinds of drugs, including alcohol, can also cause
problems. Under their influence, your judgment becomes impaired.
You could be exposed to the AIDS virus while doing things you
wouldn't otherwise do.
   Teen-agers are at an age when trying different things is
especially inviting. They must understand how serious the drug
problem is and how to avoid it.
   Drugs are also one of the main ways in which prostitutes become
infected. They may share needles themselves or have sex with people
who do. They then can pass the AIDS virus to others.
   For information about drug abuse treatment programs, contact
your physician, local public health agency or community AIDS or
drug assistance group.

<HEAD>AIDS And Babies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An infected woman can give the AIDS virus to her baby before it
is born, or during birth. If a woman is infected, her child has
about one chance in two of being born with the virus.
   If you are considering having a baby, and think you might have
been at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus, even if it was
years ago, you should receive counseling and be tested before you
get pregnant.
   You must have a long talk with the person with whom you're
planning to have a child. Even if you have known this person for a
long time, there's no way to be sure he or she hasn't been infected
in the past, possibly without realizing it. That person needs to
think hard and decide if an AIDS test might be a good idea. So
should you.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Talking With Kids About AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Children hear about AIDS, just as we all do. But they don't
understand it, so they become frightened. They are worried they or
their friends might get sick and die.
   Children need to be told they can't get AIDS from everyday
contact in the classroom, cafeteria or bathrooms. They don't have
to worry about getting AIDS even if one of their school-mates is
infected.
   Basic health education should be started as early as possible,
in keeping with parental and community standards. Local schools
have the responsibility to see that their students know the facts
about AIDS. It is very important that middle school students _
those entering their teens _ learn to protect themselves from the
AIDS virus.
   Children must also be taught values and responsibility, as well
as skills to help them resist peer pressure that might lead to
risky behavior. These skills can be reinforced by religious and
community groups. However, final responsibility rests with the
parents. As a parent, you should read and discuss this brochure
with your children.

<HEAD>Helping A Person With AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   If you are one of the growing number of people who know someone
who is infected, you need to have a special understanding of the
problem.
   No one will require more support and more love than your friend
with AIDS. Feel free to offer what you can, without fear of
becoming infected.
   Don't worry about getting AIDS from everyday contact with a
person with AIDS. You need to take precautions such as wearing
rubber gloves only when blood is present.
   If you don't know anyone with AIDS, but you'd still like to
offer a helping hand, become a volunteer. You can be sure your help
will be appreciated by a person with AIDS.
   This might mean dropping by the supermarket to pick up
groceries, sitting with the person a while, or just being there to
talk. You may even want to enroll in a support group for
caregivers. These are available around the country. If you are
interested, contact any local AIDS-related organization.
   Above all, keep an upbeat attitude. It will help you and
everyone face the disease more comfortably.

   1. True. It is risky behavior that puts you at risk for AIDS,
regardless of any ``group'' you belong to.
   2. A & B. The AIDS virus is not spread by insects, kissing,
tears or casual contact.
   3. True. However, the most effective preventive measure against
AIDS is not having sex or shooting drugs.
   4. True. You cannot tell by looking if someone is infected. The
virus by itself is completely invisible. Symptoms may first appear
years after you have been infected.
   5. True. You should be counseled about getting an AIDS test if
you have been engaging in risky behavior or think you have been
exposed to the virus. There is no reason to be tested if you don't
engage in this behavior.
   6. True. You won't get AIDS by helping someone who has the
disease.

   There are two main ways you can get AIDS. First, you can become
infected by having sex _ oral, anal or vaginal _ with someone who
is infected with the AIDS virus.
   Second, you can be infected by sharing drug needles and syringes
with an infected person.
   Babies of women who have been infected with the AIDS virus may
be born with the infection becuse it can be transmitted from the
mother to the baby before or during birth.
   In addition, some persons with hemophilia and others have been
infected by receiving blood.

<TEXT>
   The acquittal of mob boss Anthony ``Tony''
Salerno on charges he helped rig the elections of Teamster
Presidents Roy Williams and Jackie Presser strikes a crippling blow
to government plans to take over the nation's largest union, law
enforcement sources say.
   Salerno was convicted Wednesday of racketeering in the
construction industry but was acquitted with two other reputed mob
figures on charges of fraud in Williams' and Presser's elevations
to the Teamsters presidency in 1981 and 1982.
   A federal law enforcement source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the acquittal by a federal court jury in New York
on the Teamster-related counts is ``a serious setback.''
   In light of the verdict, he said, the government will have to
conduct a ``major re-evaluation'' of bringing a civil suit to oust
Presser and other top officials in the 1.6-million-member Teamsters
union and replace them with a court-appointed trustee.
   The Justice and Labor departments a year ago began preparing the
civil suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
(RICO) Act to wrest control of the Teamsters from Presser and its
21-member executive board.
   Government attorneys delayed filing the suit out of concern that
it might prejudice the criminal prosecution of Salerno and a belief
that Salerno's conviction would enhance the case for taking control
of the union through the RICO statute.
   John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, declined late
Wednesday to comment on the outcome of the Salerno case.
   Teamster officials, however, said the verdict ``shatters once
and forever the myth'' that Presser's and Williams' elections ``had
been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements.''
   ``The FBI and the Department of Justice know that at this time
no such influence exists,'' said John R. Climaco, the union's
general counsel. ``It's a fiction, pure fiction.''
   Climaco said Presser and other top union officials ``feel
vindicated ... and are comforted by the fact that after over one
year of testimony, this jury was able to accurately ferret out the
truth.''
   Despite the setback in the Salerno case, some Teamster
officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they still
fear that Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, will
pursue a civil takeover attempt.
   ``They have been extremely adamant and cocky the past 30 days
about their intention to file this thing,'' one union official
said. ``Even this might not deter them.''
   The Justice Department used a similar suit under the RICO law in
1986 to place the 8,000-member Teamsters Local 560 in Union City,
N.J., under the control of a court-appointed trustee.
   The local, one of the largest in the union, had been under the
control of convicted and now imprisoned mob figure Anthony ``Tony
Pro'' Provenzano, who has been liked to the still-unsolved 1975
disappearance of former Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa.
   However, the government's takeover of Local 560 lacked the
political ramifications of its contemplated attempt to place an
entire international union under the control of a court-appointed
trustee.
   When word of the anticipated suit was leaked by anonymous
government sources last August, the Teamsters went on the
offensive, saying government ``takeovers of unions are nothing new
_ communists have been doing it for years.''
   The AFL-CIO, which had ousted the Teamsters on corruption
charges in 1957, immediately came to their defense, likening the
suit to the Soviet Union's crushing of the Solidarity labor
movement in Poland in 1981.
   Three months labor, the Teamsters were welcomed back into the
AFL-CIO in a move that the federation's president, Lane Kirkland,
said would not have happened had it not been for the contemplated
takeover suit. Some AFL-CIO leaders admitted the Teamsters'
reaffiliation was a defensive move.
   Government prosecutors had acknowledged that if the suit against
the Teamsters succeeded, their next targets were the Laborers
Union, the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union and the International
Longshoremen's Association.
   All three of those longtime AFL-CIO affiliates, along with the
Teamsters, were identified in a 1985 report by a White House
Commission on Organized Crime as being under the control or
influence of mob figures.
   Despite the Salerno verdict, the Teamsters' problems with the
Justice Department are far from over.
   Presser is scheduled to go on trial July 12 in Cleveland on
charges of participating in a payroll padding scheme to embezzle
$700,000 from a local there that he also heads.
   His attorneys have acknowledged that two men with alleged
organized crime connections were on the local's payroll while
performing no work for the union. But they said the FBI had
acquiesced in and even encouraged the scheme, and had used Presser
as a government informant for two decades.

   A series of thunderous explosions
destroyed a space shuttle fuel plant and a candy factory Wednesday,
generating a 5-square-mile toxic cloud, killing one person and
injuring more than 250, authorities said.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, of
Henderson, who was outdoors when the first explosions occurred
shortly before noon.
   Flames and orange smoke rose into the sky, and buildings shook
10 miles away in Las Vegas after the explosions at the Pacific
Engineering & Production Co. in the southern Nevada community of
Henderson.
   Fire Chief Roy Parrish said a body was found Wednesday night
about 25 feet from the entrance to the fuel plant, but all 12
buildings leveled or severely damaged by the blasts had been
searched and no other victims were found.
   ``The logical conclusion is we won't find any more bodies,''
Parrish said. ``Everybody has been accounted for with the one
deceased.''
   He said the fuel plant was evacuated seconds before the first
explosion, a move that may have saved many lives. ``There was a
small fire in the complex. Employees tried to put the fire out but
it got out of control. The supervisor then ordered the
evacuation,'' Parrish said.
   ``Most of the employees had exited the building or were in the
foothills (around the plant) when the first explosion occurred.
Seconds later, there was a second explosion that completely
demolished the building,'' Parrish said.
   Hospitals reported treating more than 250 people, at least four
of them listed in critical condition. Most others had cuts and
bruises from flying glass and debris. Others suffered burns, broken
bones or shock.
   Authorities initially said one person had died, and relayed
unconfirmed reports of nine deaths, but official casualty reports
fluctuated until mid-evening.
   All roads to Henderson, a town of 54,590 people midway between
Las Vegas and Hoover Dam, were closed. Emergency workers warned
people away from the area as smoke billowed across the entire Las
Vegas Valley. Area schools were evacuated, and United Blood
Services of Las Vegas appealed for donations.
   Firefighters went house-to-house to evacuate 20 blocks of the
housing development closest to the plant and another residential
area in the western portion of the city where the toxic cloud
formed.
   Most of Henderson's other residents left voluntarily. All
residents were allowed back into their homes by 6 p.m., said Gary
Bloomquist, city manager for the community of more than 54,000
people.
   Two blasts, which leveled the fuel plant and the Kidd & Co.
marshmallow factory next door, registered on earthquake
seismographs 200 miles away at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, said spokesman Bob Finn.
   The first blast, at 11:53 a.m., measured about 3.0 on the
Richter scale of ground motion; the second at 11:57 a.m. had a
magnitude of 3.5. ``I find that absolutely amazing. That is
extremely powerful,'' said Finn.
   ``We felt a little jolt,'' said John Conrad, 62, a passenger
aboard America West Airlines Flight 46, which flew over the plant
about the time of the blasts. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   Joe Hedrick, 30, a worker at the fuel plant, said he heard four
explosions over several minutes, with the fourth sounding the most
powerful. Others reported three explosions.
   ``The smoke was so thick it could choke you,'' said a tearful
Hedrick, who had cuts on his arms.
   The fuel plant manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer
used in fuel for the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but NASA said
the accident was not expected to delay resumption of shuttle
flights.
   The explosions followed a fire that began when ``one of our
pieces of equipment malfunctioned,'' Pacific president Fred Gibson
Jr. said. ``The fire spread quickly and there was an explosion.''
   The blast ripped doors from their hinges, broke windows and
crumpled ceilings in homes in Green Valley, two miles away, said
Jack London, spokesman at Desert Spring Hospital in Las Vegas.
   Firefighters were unable to enter the site for nearly three
hours after the explosions because of the threat of additional
blasts and the toxic cloud.
   Two hundred people were believed to be at the fuel plant before
the blasts, and 25 to 35 people on duty at the candy plant. Few
employees of either plant had been seen at hospitals, authorities
said.
   The toxic cloud, covering five square miles and moving to the
northeast, contained hydrochloric acid and ``it is very important
that no one be within five miles of the smoke or fire,'' said Doug
Bradford, a spokesman for the city of Las Vegas. ``The strategy is
to let it (the plant fire) burn.''
   More than 70 residents of the Glen Halla Nursing Home, two miles
from the blast, were evacuated to the Las Vegas Convention Center,
after the explosion damaged their building, officials said.
   Rick Rieckmann, 41, a welder, was one of four Pacific plant
workers hurled through a wall in the first blast.
   ``It blew us out of the building. It sent us through a
fiberglass wall and into the desert,'' he said. None of four was
seriously hurt.
   NASA said in Washington that Pacific Engineering provides the
ammonium perchlorate to Morton Thiokol, NASA's prime contractor for
the motors, as well as to some Department of Defense programs.
   Don Amitor, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said Morton-Thiokol had enough ammonium
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the
present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989.
   Pacific is one of two companies that supply ammonium perchlorate
for all U.S. solid fuel rocket engines, including the space
shuttle, Minuteman and Titan projects. The other is Kerr-McGee,
also near Las Vegas.
   The Pentagon said Pacific received no Department of Defense
contracts in fiscal 1988, although they had two in 1987, totaling
$675,000.
   ``Currently, we have no information that Department of Defense
work is in any way related to the fire,'' the Pentagon said in a
statment.
   Kidd, based in Ligonier, Ind., expanded to the Gibson Business
Park and opened its 36,500-square-foot plant about two years ago.

   ?Que significa el SIDA (AIDS) para usted?
   El SIDA (AIDS) es uno de los problemas de salud mas serios a los
que se ha enfrentado el publico americano. Es muy importante que
todos nostros entendamos esta emfermedad.
   SIDA quiere decir Sindrome de Immunodeficiencia Adquirida. Es
una enfermedad causada por el Virus de la Inmunodeficiencia Humana,
HIV, el virus del SIDA.
   El virus del SIDA puede vivir dentro del cuerpo humano por anos
antes de que los sintomas aparezcan. Este principalmente afecta a
la persona haciendola incapaz de defenderse do otras emfermedades,
que podrian cuasarle la muerte.
   Much gente cree que solo personas de ciertos ``grupos de alto
riesqo'' es infectada por el virus del SIDA. Esto es incorrecto. La
posibilidad de estar en peligro de infectarse con el virus del SIDA
no tiene que ver con quien es usted. Lo que importa es lo que uste
hace.
   A la gente le preocupa el adquirir el SIDA. ALgunas personas si
deberian de preocuparse y necesitan tomar precaucioned serias. Sin
embargo, muchos no estan en peligro de contraer el SIDA.
   El proposito de este folleto es informarle como puede y como no
puede resultar infectado con el virus del SIDA.
   Sus hijos necesitan saber acerca del SIDA. Discutalo con ellos,
como haria usted sobre cualquier otro problema de salud.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ?Como se adquiere el SIDA?
   Hay dos maneras principales como usted puede adquirir el SIDA.
Primero, usted puede infectarse por tener relaciones sexuales
(vaginales, anales, y tambien orales) con alguien que esta
infectado con el virus del SIDA.
   Segundo, usted puede infectarse por compartir las agujas y
jeringas para inyectarse drogas con una persona infectada.
   Tambien los bebes de mujeres infectadas con el virus del SIDA
pueden nacer con la infeccion, porque el virus puede ser
transmitido por la sangre de la madre a la del bebe durante el
embarazo o durante el parto. Algunas personas con hemofilia y otras
que han recibido una transfusion de sangre se han infectado.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ?Puede usted infectarse?
   Si, si usted sigue un comportamiento arriesgado.
   Los varones homosexuales fueron los primeros en sentir los
efectos de la enfermedad en la nacion. Pero a pesar de lo que tal
vez usted haya escuchado, el numero de casos entre los
heterosexuales sigue aumentando.
   Las personas que han muerto de SIDA en los EEUU han sido hombres
y mujeres, ricos y pobres, anglos, negros, hispanos, asiaticos y
indios americanos.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ?Como se adquiere el SIDA por las relaciones sexuales?
   El virus del SIDA puede se transmitido por el contacto seual ya
sea usted hombre o mujer, heterosexual, bisexual u homosexual.
   Esto sucede porque una persona infectada con el virus del SIDA
puede tener el virus en el semen o en los fluidos vaginales. El
virus puede entrar al cuerpo pr la vagina, el pene, el recto o la
boca.
   El contacto sexual anal, con o sin condon, es arriesgado. El
recto es lesionado facilmente durate el contacto sexual anal.
   Recuerde, el SIDA es transmitido sexualmente y el virus del SIDA
no es la unica infeccion que se transmite por el contacto sexual
intimo.
   Otras enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles, tales como la
gonorrea, sifilis, herpes y clamidia, pueden contraerse tambien por
el contacto sexual oral, anal, o vaginal.
   Si usted esta infectado con alguna de estas enfermadades, usted
esta en alto riesgo de contraer el SIDA.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Usted no adquiere el SIDA (AIDS) por insectos, ni por un beso
   No importa lo que usted haya escuchado, el virus del SIDA (SIDA)
es dificil de adquirir y facilmente se puede evitar.
   Usted no adquiere el SIDA como un resfriado o la gripe, porque
el virus es de un tipo diferente. El virus del SIDA se transmite a
traves del contacto sexual (vaginal, anal, y tambien oral), por
compartir agujas para inyectarse drogas, o a los bebes de madres
infectadas, durante el embarazo o durante el parto.
   Usted no adquiere el virus del SIDA por el contacto comun diario
con la gente a su alrededor en la escuela, en el tabajo, en
fiestas, en guarderias infantiles, o en supermercados. Usted no lo
adquirere por nadar en una piscina, aun cuando alguien que este
nadando en la misma piscina este infectado con el virus del SIDA.
Los estudiantes que asisten a la escuela con alguien infectado con
el virus SIDA, no estan en peligro por el contacto casual.
   Usted no adquiere el virus SIDA por la picadura de un mosquito.
El virus del SIDA no se transmite por las glandulas salivares del
mosquito, como otras emfermedades, como la malaria (paludismo), o
la fiebre amarilla. Usted no lo adquiere de los insectos de la
cama, piojos, moscas u otros insectos.
   Usted no adquiere el virus del SIDA por la saliva, sudor,
lagimas, orima, ni excrementos.
   Usted no adquiere el virus del SIDA por un beso.
   El virus del SIDA no se adquiere del telefono, la ropa, ni del
asiento de un inodoro (excusado). No puede transmitirse por usar un
vaso o los utensilios para comer que alguien mas haya usado. Usted
no adquiere el virus por estar en un autobus, tren, o elevador
lleno de gente con una persona que esta infectada con el virus, o
que tiene el SIDA.

   La diferencia entre donar y recibir sangre
   1. Donar sangre. Usted no esta ahora, ni ha estado nunca en
peligo de adquirir el SIDA por donar sangre a un banco de sangre.
Las agujas que se usan para las donaciones de sangre son nuevas.
Una vez que se usan, son destruidas. No hay forma en que usted
pueda entrar en contacto con el virus del SIDA por donar sangre.
   2. Recibir sangre. El riesgo de adquirir el virus del SIDA por
una transfusion de sangre ha sido reducido enormemente. Con el
proposito de que el suministro de sangre sea lo mas seguro posible,
se investiga a los donadores para detectar probables factores de
riesgo; a la sangre donada se le hace la prueba de anticuerpos del
SIDA. Si tiene alguna pregunta, llame a su banco de sangre.
   ?Que clase de comportamiento lo pone a usted en riesgo?
   Usted tiene el riesgo de resultar infectado con el virus del
SIDA si usted tiene relaciones sexuales con alguien que este
infectado.
   Ya que usted no puede estar seguro de que alguien este
infectado, el riesgo de estar en contacto con el virus aumenta con
el numero de companeros sexuales que usted tenga.
   Cualquier intercambio de sangre, semen o fluidos vaginales
infectados puede transmitir el virus y ponerlo a usted frente a un
gran riesgo.
   Los siguientes comportamientos constituyen un riesgo cuando se
practican con una persona infectada. Usted no puede saber a simple
vista si una persona esta infectada.
   COMPORTAMIENTO ARRIESGADO
   Compartir agujas y jeringas para inyectarse drogas.
   Contacto sexual anal, con o sin condon. Contacto vaginal u oral
con una persona infectada, o con alquien ue se inyecte drogas o
practique el sexo anal.
   Contacto con alguien que usted no conoce bien (un encuentro
casual o una persona que practique la prostitucion) o con alguien
que usted sabe que tiene varios companeros sexuales.
   Contacto sin proteccion (sin condon) con una persona infectada.
   COMPORTAMIENTO SEGURO
   No tener relaciones sexuales.
   Tener relaciones sexuales con una sola persona que no este
infectada y ser mutuamente fieles.
   No inyectarse drogas.
   ?Y hablando de citas?
   Tener citas y concoer a otras personas es algo normal en la
vida. Tener una cita no es lo mismo que tener relaciones sexuales.
El contacto sexual, como parte de una cita puede ser arriesgado.
Uno de los riesgos es el SIDA (AIDS).
   ?Como puede usted saber si la persona con la que usted esta
saliendo o le gustaria salir ha estado expuesta al virus del SIDA?
Lo malo es que usted no puede saberlo. Pero lo bueno es, que
mientras evite las relaciones sexuales y no comparta las agujas
para inyectarse las drogas, no importa.
   Usted debe tener mucho cuidado con la persona con quien usted
tenga relaciones sexuales, haciendo su propia decision sobre la
persona, basandose en su buen juicio. Esto puede ser muy dificil.
   ?Ha tenido esta persona alguna enfermedad sexualmente
transmisible? ?Con cuanta gente ha tenido relaciones sexuales? ?Ha
experimentado con drogas?
   Todas estas preguntas son delicadas, pero importantes. Pero
usted tiene la responsabilidad personal de preguntar.
   Pienselo de esta manera. Si usted conoce a alguien lo suficiente
como para tener relaciones sexuales, entonces usted deberia hablar
francamente del SIDA. Si alguien se niega a hablar del SIDA, usted
no deberia tener relaciones sexuales con esa persona.
   ?Pueden las personas casadas adquirir el SIDA?
   Las personas casadas que no estan infectadas, que son fieles y
que no se inyectan drogas no tienen ningun riesgo. Pero si siguen
un comportamiento arriesgado (vea la pagina 3) ellos podrian
infectarse con el virus del SIDA e infectar a su pareja. Si usted
cree que su conyuge pudiera estar poniendole en una situacion
arriesgada, hable con el o ella. Es su vida.
   ?Por que se habla tanto de los condones?
   No hace mucho tiemo, los condones (hule, la gomita, o
preservativo) eran cosas de las que no hablabamos mucho.
   Ahora esto se discute en las noticias de la television o en la
primer aplana de su periodico y los condones se exhiben libremente
en su farmacia local, supermercado o tienda.
   Para aquellos sexualmente activos, que no limitan su actividad a
una sola pareja, se ha demostrado que el uso de los conones ayuda a
prevenir la diseminacion de enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles.
Por eso se recomienda el uso de los condones para ayudar a reducir
la transmision del SIDA.
   El uso de los condones es la mejor medida preventiva contra el
SIDA, fuera de no tener relaciones sexuales y de practicar un
compartamiento seguro (vea la pagina 3).
   Pero los condones no son absolutamente seguros. Usted debe de
usarlos apropiadamente. Y usted debe usarlos cada vez que tenga
relaciones sexuales, desde el principio hasta el final. Si usted
usa un condon debe seguir las siguientes recomendaciones:
   (1) Use condones hechos de latex, ya que el latex sirve como una
barrera para el virus. Los condones ``lambskin'' o ``natural
membrane'' no son tan buenos por los poros en el material. Busque
la palabra ``latex'' en el empaque.
   (2) Un condon con un espermicida puede proporcionarle proteccion
adicional. Se ha demostrado en pruebas de laboratorio que los
espericidas matan el virus del SIDA. Use el espermicida en el
interior de la punta y en el exterior del condon.
   (3) El uso del condon es mas seguro con un lubricante. Revise la
lista de ingredientes en la parte posterior del empaque del
lubricante para estar seguro de que tenga base de agua
(water-based). No use lubricantes con base de petroleo, cold cream,
aceite para bebes o manteca vegetal para cocinar. Estos pueden
debilitar el condon y ser la causa de que se rompa.
   ?Como luce una persona con SIDA?
   Es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede
estar infectada con el virus del SIDA (AIDS) y no mostrar ningun
sintoma.
   Es posible estar infectado por anos, sentirse bien, lucir bien y
no tener manera de saber que usted esta infectado, a menos que a
usted le hagan una prueba para el virus del SIDA.
   Este periodo en que uno esta infectado sin saberlo es una de las
cosas que mas preocupan del SIDA. Durante este periodo, sin
embargo, las personas infectadas con el virus del SIDA, pueden
transmitir el virus a sus companeros sexuales y a la gente con
quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas. Las madres
infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o
durante el parto.
   Una vez que se presentan los sintromas, estos son similares a
los de algunas otras enfermedades. Mientras la enfermedad progresa,
los sintomas se vuelven mas serios, porque el virus del SIDA no
permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar
correctamente.
   Si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar
infectado, usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede
afectar a otros. Si usted cree que deberia hacerse una prueba de
sangre para el virus del SIDA, consulte a un doctor o a un
consejero del SIDA para mas informacion. (Lea abajo.)
   ?Hay una cura para el SIDA?
   Actualmente no hay cura para el SIDA.
   Las medicinas, tales como AZT, han prolongado la vida de alguna
gente con SIDA. Existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos
tratamientos.
   Tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccion en gente
que no esta infectada. Los investigadores creen que pasaran anos
antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz.
   La manera mas eficaz para prevenir el SIDA es no exponerse al
virus, cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento.

   ?Quee significa el SIDA (AIDS) para usted?
   El SIDA (AIDS) es uno de los problemas de salud maas serios a
los que se ha enfrentado el puublico americano. Es muy importante
que todos nostros entendamos esta emfermedad.
   SIDA quiere decir Siindrome de Immunodeficiencia Adquirida. Es
una enfermedad causada por el Virus de la Inmunodeficiencia Humana,
HIV, el virus del SIDA.
   El virus del SIDA puede vivir dentro del cuerpo humano por annos
antes de que los siintomas aparezcan. Este principalmente afecta a
la persona hacieendola incapaz de defenderse do otras emfermedades,
que podriian cuasarle la muerte.
   Much gente cree que soolo personas de ciertos ``grupos de alto
riesqo'' es infectada por el virus del SIDA. Esto es incorrecto. La
posibilidad de estar en peligro de infectarse con el virus del SIDA
no tiene que ver con quien es usted. Lo que importa es lo que uste
hace.
   A la gente le preocupa el adquirir el SIDA. ALgunas personas sii
deberiian de preocuparse y necesitan tomar precaucioned serias. Sin
embargo, muchos no estaan en peligro de contraer el SIDA.
   El propoosito de este folleto es informarle coomo puede y coomo
no puede resultar infectado con el virus del SIDA.
   Sus hijos necesitan saber acerca del SIDA. Discuutalo con ellos,
como hariia usted sobre cualquier otro problema de salud.

<TEXT>
   ?Coomo se adquiere el SIDA?
   Hay dos maneras principales como usted puede adquirir el SIDA.
Primero, usted puede infectarse por tener relaciones sexuales
(vaginales, anales, y tambieen orales) con alguien que estaa
infectado con el virus del SIDA.
   Segundo, usted puede infectarse por compartir las agujas y
jeringas para inyectarse drogas con una persona infectada.
   Tambieen los bebees de mujeres infectadas con el virus del SIDA
pueden nacer con la infeccioon, porque el virus puede ser
transmitido por la sangre de la madre a la del bebee durante el
embarazo o durante el parto. Algunas personas con hemofilia y otras
que han recibido una transfusioon de sangre se han infectado.
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ?Puede usted infectarse?
   Sii, si usted sigue un comportamiento arriesgado.
   Los varones homosexuales fueron los primeros en sentir los
efectos de la enfermedad en la nacioon. Pero a pesar de lo que tal
vez usted haya escuchado, el nuumero de casos entre los
heterosexuales sigue aumentando.
   Las personas que han muerto de SIDA en los EEUU han sido hombres
y mujeres, ricos y pobres, anglos, negros, hispanos, asiaticos y
indios americanos.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ?Coomo se adquiere el SIDA por las relaciones sexuales?
   El virus del SIDA puede se transmitido por el contacto seual ya
sea usted hombre o mujer, heterosexual, bisexual u homosexual.
   Esto sucede porque una persona infectada con el virus del SIDA
puede tener el virus en el semen o en los fluidos vaginales. El
virus puede entrar al cuerpo pr la vagina, el pene, el recto o la
boca.
   El contacto sexual anal, con o sin condoon, es arriesgado. El
recto es lesionado facilmente durate el contacto sexual anal.
   Recuerde, el SIDA es transmitido sexualmente y el virus del SIDA
no es la uunica infeccioon que se transmite por el contacto sexual
iintimo.
   Otras enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles, tales como la
gonorrea, sifilis, herpes y clamidia, pueden contraerse tambieen
por el contacto sexual oral, anal, o vaginal.
   Si usted estaa infectado con alguna de estas enfermadades, usted
estaa en alto riesgo de contraer el SIDA.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Usted no adquiere el SIDA (AIDS) por insectos, ni por un beso
   No importa lo que usted haya escuchado, el virus del SIDA (SIDA)
es dificil de adquirir y faacilmente se puede evitar.
   Usted no adquiere el SIDA como un resfriado o la gripe, porque
el virus es de un tipo diferente. El virus del SIDA se transmite a
travees del contacto sexual (vaginal, anal, y tambien oral), por
compartir agujas para inyectarse drogas, o a los bebees de madres
infectadas, durante el embarazo o durante el parto.
   Usted no adquiere el virus del SIDA por el contacto comuun
diario con la gente a su alrededor en la escuela, en el tabajo, en
fiestas, en guarderiias infantiles, o en supermercados. Usted no lo
adquirere por nadar en una piscina, aun cuando alguien que estee
nadando en la misma piscina estee infectado con el virus del SIDA.
Los estudiantes que asisten a la escuela con alguien infectado con
el virus SIDA, no estaan en peligro por el contacto casual.
   Usted no adquiere el virus SIDA por la picadura de un mosquito.
El virus del SIDA no se transmite por las glaandulas salivares del
mosquito, como otras emfermedades, como la malaria (paludismo), o
la fiebre amarilla. Usted no lo adquiere de los insectos de la
cama, piojos, moscas u otros insectos.
   Usted no adquiere el virus del SIDA por la saliva, sudor,
laagrimas, orima, ni excrementos.
   Usted no adquiere el virus del SIDA por un beso.
   El virus del SIDA no se adquiere del teleefono, la ropa, ni del
asiento de un inodoro (excusado). No puede transmitirse por usar un
vaso o los utensilios para comer que alguien maas haya usado. Usted
no adquiere el virus por estar en un autobuus, tren, o elevador
lleno de gente con una persona que estaa infectada con el virus, o
que tiene el SIDA.

<TEXT>
   The nation's biggest junk bond underwriter has
had a change of heart about its practice of letting employees buy
into its own deals, one week after being accused in Congress of
favoring them over its customers.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. announced Wednesday that employees
and partnerships formed by employees will no longer be permitted to
purchase new issues of bonds underwritten by the firm.
   The investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, in hearings last week, released documents showing Drexel
employees reaped huge profits by purchasing bonds underwritten by
the firm and then quickly reselling them, in one case within 17
days.
   Employees were permitted to buy bonds during initial offerings
of much-sought issues, even when the practice denied bonds to
public customers, the documents showed.
   Drexel was instrumental in developing the market for the
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, which allow companies without a
track record of earnings to obtain financing based on whether they
have sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. Junk bonds have
been frequently used in corporate raiding.
   Of the $32 billion in junk bonds issued in 1986, 40 percent were
underwritten by Drexel, according to a congressional report.
   Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph, in a letter to Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the committee and
subcommittee, stuck by his assertions that the employee purchases
were proper, but said the firm was worried about appearances.
   ``I indicated we supported such purchases; nonetheless public
perception is important to financial institutions such as ours and
we recognize that even the best of motives can be misunderstood,''
he said.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the subcommittee, said
Drexel's letter leaves a number of questions unanswered, including
whether Drexel will be able to trade for its own accounts and pass
profits on to employees in the form of bonuses.
   He said he would also like to know if employee accounts will be
able to trade in the secondary market, which is heavily influenced
by the underwriting firm.
   Steven Anreder, a spokesman for Drexel, said the firm had no
comment beyond its brief announcement.
   Dingell, in a statement released by an aide, called Drexel's
decision ``a very good step,'' adding, ``It should lay to rest
questions associated with the fairness and legality of that
particular practice.''
   However, the aide, Dennis Fitzgibbons, said Dingell has made no
decision regarding his committee's ongoing investigation of Drexel.
   Dingell has been criticized by Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., for
subpoenaing Michael Milken, chief of Drexel's junk bond unit, to
appear before the committee even though Milken had indicated in
advance he would refuse to testify based on his constitutional
protection from self-incrimination.
   When he refused to testify, Milken confirmed he is under
investigation by a federal grand jury in New York, which is
reported to be looking into insider trading allegations.
   Dingell said the firm's retreat on employee purchases
``indicates that the behavior of the committee was correct and fair
in bringing these matters to light.''
   Junk bonds pay higher interest rates than those issued by
established companies and are considered riskier investments. They
have been used by corporate raiders to finance unfriendly takeover
attempts.

   La diferencia entre donar y recibir sangre
   1. Donar sangre. Usted no estaa ahora, ni ha estado nunca en
peligo de adquirir el SIDA por donar sangre a un banco de sangre.
Las agujas que se usan para las donaciones de sangre son nuevas.
Una vez que se usan, son destruidas. No hay forma en que usted
pueda entrar en contacto con el virus del SIDA por donar sangre.
   2. Recibir sangre. El riesgo de adquirir el virus del SIDA por
una transfusioon de sangre ha sido reducido enormemente. Con el
propoosito de que el suministro de sangre sea lo maas seguro
posible, se investiga a los donadores para detectar probables
factores de riesgo; a la sangre donada se le hace la prueba de
anticuerpos del SIDA. Si tiene alguna pregunta, llame a su banco de
sangre.
   ?Quee clase de comportamiento lo pone a usted en riesgo?
   Usted tiene el riesgo de resultar infectado con el virus del
SIDA si usted tiene relaciones sexuales con alguien que estee
infectado.
   Ya que usted no puede estar seguro de que alguien estee
infectado, el riesgo de estar en contacto con el virus aumenta con
el nuumero de companneros sexuales que usted tenga.
   Cualquier intercambio de sangre, semen o fluidos vaginales
infectados puede transmitir el virus y ponerlo a usted frente a un
gran riesgo.
   Los siguientes comportamientos constituyen un riesgo cuando se
practican con una persona infectada. Usted no puede saber a simple
vista si una persona estaa infectada.
   COMPORTAMIENTO ARRIESGADO
   Compartir agujas y jeringas para inyectarse drogas.
   Contacto sexual anal, con o sin condoon. Contacto vaginal u oral
con una persona infectada, o con alquien ue se inyecte drogas o
practique el sexo anal.
   Contacto con alguien que usted no conoce bien (un encuentro
casual o una persona que practique la prostitucioon) o con alguien
que usted sabe que tiene varios companneros sexuales.
   Contacto sin proteccioon (sin condoon) con una persona infectada.
   COMPORTAMIENTO SEGURO
   No tener relaciones sexuales.
   Tener relaciones sexuales con una sola persona que no estee
infectada y ser mutuamente fieles.
   No inyectarse drogas.
   ?Y hablando de citas?
   Tener citas y concoer a otras personas es algo normal en la
vida. Tener una cita no es lo mismo que tener relaciones sexuales.
El contacto sexual, como parte de una cita puede ser arriesgado.
Uno de los riesgos es el SIDA (AIDS).
   ?Coomo puede usted saber si la persona con la que usted estaa
saliendo o le gustariia salir ha estado expuesta al virus del SIDA?
Lo malo es que usted no puede saberlo. Pero lo bueno es, que
mientras evite las relaciones sexuales y no comparta las agujas
para inyectarse las drogas, no importa.
   Usted debe tener mucho cuidado con la persona con quien usted
tenga relaciones sexuales, haciendo su propia decisioon sobre la
persona, basaandose en su buen juicio. Esto puede ser muy difiicil.
   ?Ha tenido esta persona alguna enfermedad sexualmente
transmisible? ?Con cuaanta gente ha tenido relaciones sexuales? ?Ha
experimentado con drogas?
   Todas estas preguntas son delicadas, pero importantes. Pero
usted tiene la responsabilidad personal de preguntar.
   Pieenselo de esta manera. Si usted conoce a alguien lo
suficiente como para tener relaciones sexuales, entonces usted

   ?Pueden las personas casadas adquirir el SIDA?
   Las personas casadas que no estaan infectadas, que son fieles y
que no se inyectan drogas no tienen ninguun riesgo. Pero si siguen
un comportamiento arriesgado (vea la paagina 3) ellos podriian
infectarse con el virus del SIDA e infectar a su pareja. Si usted
cree que su coonyuge pudiera estar ponieendole en una situacioon
arriesgada, hable con eel o ella. Es su vida.
   ?Por quee se habla tanto de los condones?

pueden debilitar el condoon y ser la causa de que se rompa.
   ?Coomo luce una persona con SIDA?
   Es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede
estar infectada con el virus del SIDA (AIDS) y no mostrar ninguun
siintoma.
   Es posible estar infectado por annos, sentirse bien, lucir bien

<TEXT>
   When Joseph Pulitzer Jr. was an
undergraduate at Harvard University in 1935, he bought a striking
painting by Modigliani, beginning an extraordinary collection of
modern art.
   The collection grew to more than 250 paintings, drawings and
sculptures in the ensuing half-century. Pulitzer recently returned
to Harvard for the opening of an exhibit featuring 86 of his those
works.
   More than 40 artists are represented in the exhibit, which will
be at Harvard's Fogg Museum until June 12 when it moves to the
Saint Louis Art Museum in Missouri from July 8 through Aug. 28.
   ``There are perhaps only three or four museums in the country
who could put together, from their own collections, a display to
match the depth and breadth of this one,'' said Edgar Peters
Bowron, director of the Harvard University Art Museums.
   Included are 12 works by Picasso, four each by Monet, Klee and
Miro; three each by Degas, Matisse, Lipchitz and Lichtenstein; and
pieces by Cezanne, Brancusi, Pollock and Warhol.
   ``I wanted to buy creative art that would have a validity and
vitality that would transcend fashion,'' said Pulitzer, whose
grandfather's will established the Pulitzer Prizes in journalism
and the arts.
   ``I was much more interested in the living rather than going
deeply into the past,'' he said, explaining why he chose to collect
modern art.
   A fine arts major at Harvard, Pulitzer graduated in 1936 and
joined the staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He became its
editor and publisher and now is chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing
Co.
   He has been generous with his purchases, giving pieces to
museums, including the Fogg and the Saint Louis Art Museum, which
has that first Modigliani, ``Elvira Resting at a Table.'' Some
remain at his home.
   ``Joe started (collecting) from the purest of reasons _ love of
art,'' said Michael Shapiro, chief curator of the Saint Louis Art
Museum.
   ``And, he's not cashing in his chips,'' Shapiro added, referring
to collectors who sell for profit.
   Shapiro, Bowron and Judith Weiss-Levy, curator of prints,
drawings and photographs at the Saint Louis Museum, made the
selections from the Pulitzer collection to put in the exhibit.
   ``It was intended to demonstrate the quality and range of the
collection,'' Bowron said of their choices, and noted that Pulitzer
also had a say.
   ``We made the initial selection, but then Joe, with his unerring
eye, said, `You must put in this one and that one,''' Bowron said.
   Installing the exhibit was difficult because the works were so
varied in size, media and style.
   One perspective on the exhibit, said Shapiro, is that Pulitzer
bought the Modigliani four years before Richard Serra, who has a
painting, a drawing and a sculpture in the show, was born.
   ``The collection is very much a synopsis of mainstream modernism
and its evolving,'' Shapiro said.
   ``In a certain sense we distilled them (the selections) out of
Joe's distillation, a summary history of modern art in Europe and
America. It is a history of modern art.''
   The exhibit also marks the publication by the Harvard University
Art Museums of the fourth volume of the catalog of the Pulitzer
collection.
   It was written by Angelica Zander Rudenstine, a curator and
scholar and, as a member of the visiting committee, an adviser to
Harvard's fine arts department.
   ``I have said ... to Angelica, if she ever departs from her
profession as art historian, I would like to hire her for the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch as an investigative reporter,'' Pulitzer said.

   The number of part-time college students in the
average freshman class has increased 7.3 percent during the 1980s,
but total freshman enrollment has declined by a similar amount, a
survey shows.
   The major exception to that trend: private, doctoral
degree-granting universities, where average part-time rolls plunged
32.1 percent while freshman enrollments have risen 4 percent.
   An annual report from the College Board, ``Summary Statistics:
Annual Survey of Colleges, 1987-88,'' included average enrollment
data on 3,134 institutions of higher education.
   The survey shows that from 1980 to 1986:
   _ The average freshman class at all kinds of institutions was
down 7.4 percent, 942 students to 872. Two-year public technical
colleges experienced the biggest declines, 19.8 percent on average,
964 students to 773.
   _ The average institution had 1,489 part-time students in 1986,
7.3 percent more than the 1,388-student average in 1980. Leading
the way were two-year public technical colleges, where average
part-time rolls were up 24.7 percent, from 1,047 to 1,306.
   _ Full-time freshman rolls shrank 2.4 percent at all
institutions, and the biggest drop was at two-year technical
schools, where the average freshman class shrank by 11.9 percent,
from 1,264 to 1,114.
   _ Minority freshman rolls at four-year private universities rose
1.5 percent _ the biggest increase of any kind of institution.
Overall, minority enrollments rose from 15.4 percent to 15.8
percent of freshman attending all institutions.
   _ The average number of applications to freshman classes at all
four-year institutions increased 6.3 percent. The biggest average
gains were 11.5 percent at public doctoral granting universities,
and 10.5 percent at private liberal arts colleges.
   The sharp gain in part-timers results at least partly from
aggressive marketing by colleges to attract older students, said
College Board spokeswoman Janice Gams.
   Those increases have softened the impact of enrollment declines
in the number of 18-year-olds. That trend is not expected to
reverse itself until the mid-1990s, she said.
   The College Board is a non-profit educational association whose
members include more than 2,500 secondary and higher education
institutions.

   When Chester Wells closed his failing
robotics firm in Chicago, he never imagined that six months later
he would be making plows and harnesses in the African bush as a
U.S. Peace Corps volunteer.
   ``For a man my age, opportunities were limited and I was
disillusioned,'' said the 66-year-old electrical engineer. ``But I
was not ready to retire. I had too much to offer.''
   Two years after arriving in this East African nation, Wells is
working to open a training center to mass produce inexpensive plows
and harnesses for peasant farmers with U.S.-government money and
land donated by the Kenyan government.
   He expects to open the Mutomo Community Technical Center by
January with an class of 100 students.
   The Kenya Rural Enterprises Program gave Wells nearly $300,000
to build the center and the Kenyan government donated a seven-acre
site. The enterprises program is financed by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) through World Education Inc. of
Boston to help set up small businesses in rural areas.
   Wells, who comes from Park Ridge, Ill., left Marquette
University in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in
electrical engineering. He worked as a design engineer, managed a
computer chips manufacturing company and helped various companies
automate their operations before establishing his own company,
Wells Automation Products, in Chicago in 1983.
   He closed the business in January 1986, when the economy turned
sour.
   Wells, a widower, said ``the children had gone their seperate
ways,'' so he decided to strike out on his own.
   He joined the Peace Corps, an organization usually staffed by
people a third his age.
   Wells was sent to Kenya in July, 1986, and eventually wound up
in Mutomo, a market town of fewer than 1,000 people 140 miles
southeast of the capital, Nairobi. There, the Danish International
Development Agency had asked other donor governments to help find
someone to run a small operation making harnesses and plows.
   ``I wondered what a man trained in electronics and used to big
plants would do here,'' recalled Wells, a stocky, balding man.
   He spent 10 weeks at the lakeside town of Naivasha for
orientation before coming to Mutomo about 18 months ago. He found
workers turning out crude plows and harnesses by hand.
   ``I was astounded,'' he said. ``The men sat on dirt floors
hacking away at wood with pangas (machetes) and producing beautiful
frames for harnesses.''
   He intends to introduce shop tools and power tools to the
process so the men can make more harnesses and plows at a faster
rate.
   Days are hot and nights chilly in Mutomo, which sits in the
middle of scrubland, rock outcrops and gulleys left by torrential
rains that come twice a year.
   Peasants of the Kamba tribe, mainly women and children because
men seek fortunes elsewhere, try to grow corn, sorghum and millet.
They also graze goats and cattle and keep donkeys.
   But they lack affordable tools, particularly plows.
   Wells pushed the idea for a training center, writing proposals
and seeking money.
   Josephat Muliungi, development coordinator for the Kitui Roman
Catholic Diocese, said the center will be the largest economic
enterprise in Mutomo.
   The area is one of Kenya's poorest; average income for a peasant
farm family is less than $100 a year.
   ``Once the students are gainfully employed, we expect a sizeable
increase in income for at least 1,000 families within a year,''
Muliungi said.
   Wells said the center will continue making harnesses and plows
but in larger quantities and better quality. He hopes to reduce the
price of a plow from the current 450 shillings ($26.50).
   Only 20 of the 100 students will remain at the center after the
year-long training. The others will be organized into groups, given
a little money and sent out to make and repair plows and harnesses
in the villages around Mutomo.
   The center will continue to offer advise on how to run simple
businesses.
   Wells already is looking to expand production to include hand
tools, bicycles, carts and solar-powered radios.
   ``People say it cannot be done,'' he said. ``But I think it can
be done. It is possible.''
   Wells, whose Peace Corps stint has been extended by a year, said
the center can be duplicated in other parts of Kenya and wants to
stay after his Peace Corps time is up.
   ``It is a beautiful thing what I'm doing here,'' he said. ``And
it's good for people like me.
   ``I'm young again. I'm thinking again.''

   Geneva Chowdhury jealously guards the
water stored in pots and pans in her house in a middle-class
neighborhood. She hasn't had a bath in more than a week and won't
allow her husband and two daughters to use more than one bucket of
water a day.
   ``I have rationed water. I do not want to be caught in a
situation where there will not be enough left to drink,'' Mrs.
Chowdhury said.
   The 55-year-old housewife is one of hundreds of thousands of
residents facing an unprecedented water crisis in the Indian
capital.
   Lack of free-flowing water in many parts of New Delhi has
triggered demonstrations in the streets, brawls over the occasional
dribbles at public taps, and debates in Parliament.
   ``In best of time, there is not enough water for all of us in
New Delhi, but what we are experiencing now is beyond
comprehension,'' said Mrs. Chowdhury, whose Chitta Ranjan Park
neighborhood of 16,000 people has been without running water since
April 25.
   New Delhi's 8 million residents need at least 472 million
gallons of water daily, officials say. But drought conditions in
neighboring states, low river levels and a dispute on water-sharing
rights have slashed the supply in half for the past week.
   Some neighborhoods are completely without water, while others _
mainly upper-class areas _ are virtually unaffected. In other
areas, people say they are getting 10 percent to 30 percent of
their usual supply.
   New Delhi's water crisis finally brought home what has been
happening in other states since last year's monsoon rains failed.
Sixteen of India's 25 states were declared drought-affected last
year, leading to crop failures, starving livestock and hardships
for poor villagers.
   Devout Hindus in the city are offering special prayers to the
rain god Indra and the sea god Varuna.
   ``When man fails, the only way left is to turn to the gods,''
said Ramrati Ram, a housewife in the congested Mehrauli district
where water taps are either dry or emit only thin trickles for an
hour a day.
   During last Sunday's full moon, Mrs. Ram joined dozens of women
who walked to the Yamuna River, New Delhi's main source of water,
and threw coconuts in the shallow water as offerings to Indra and
Varuna.
   The river emerges from glaciers in the Himalayan foothills and
flows down the plains through Utter Pradesh and Haryana states
before reaching New Delhi.
   Coconuts are auspicious symbols in the Hindu faith, and the
women hoped their offerings would please the water gods.
   ``The drought dragon has traveled to the capital city. We feel
the fire,'' said Santanu Mohan, a sales executive in New Delhi's
five-star Ashoka Hotel.
   Some luxury hotels, including the Ashoka, have asked their
guests to conserve water.
   The water shortage has also hit the city's hospitals, but no
emergencies have been reported.
   ``Things are improving, but still there is shortage,'' said S.S.
Ramrakhiani, chief engineer of Delhi Water Supply and Sewage
Disposal Undertaking. ``Water is not something that you can churn
out of a factory.''
   Opposition members of Parliament have accused the government of
inefficient water management, but Neelam Kapur, spokeswoman for the
Ministry of Water Resources, denied the allegation.
   ``We are getting emergency supply from Haryana state, and things
are not that bad,'' she said.
   The drought has forced the Haryana state government to regulate
the Yamuna's flow, which public works officials are monitoring from
helicopters.
   The Haryana government says it did not reduce the flow but only
diverted water through a longer canal route to enable farmers to
irrigate their lands.
   As a result, more farmers are using the water from the river and
the amount reaching New Delhi is reduced.
   Haryana has agreed to channel the river water back into the
shorter route, but only until May 16.
   ``God willing, it may rain before that,'' said Ramrakhiani.

   President Najib, former secret police
commander, is trying to polish his image abroad as he loses the
Soviet military might that has propped up Afghanistan's Marxist
government for the past decade.
   His sales pitch for financial aid and political sympathy is
aimed in three directions:
   _The United States, which has been arming the Moslem
fundamentalist guerrillas fighting the Afghan army.
   _India, the strongest power in the Asian subcontinent, which
shares Afghan animosity toward Pakistan.
   _Islamic nations, which have given lip service but little in the
way of arms and money to the guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or
Islamic holy warriors.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and have been
helping Najib's government fight the U.S.-backed guerrillas. The
Soviet Union agreed April 14 in Geneva to begin withdrawing its
estimated 115,000 troops on May 15.
   Najib's appeal to the United States became most pronounced last
week when he addressed a group of private American citizens and
Soviet academicians at the end of their weeklong conference on
Afghanistan.
   While stressing his government's commitments of friendship with
the neighboring Soviet Union, Najib professed an eagerness for
political, economic, cultural and even military ties with the
United States.
   He also played on Iranian-U.S. enmity, comparing the
fundamentalism of the mujahedeen to that of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's regime in Iran, which borders Afghanistan on the west.
   ``What would be the consequences of the emergence of another
Iran in the region today?'' Najib asked his American visitors.
   He played down commitments to socialism and emphasized what he
called his government's encouragement of the private sector. He
invited ``the United States and its corporations'' to invest in
Afghanistan.
   His economic pragmatism was an open acknowledgement that the
communism or socialism espoused by his predecessors is doomed among
his fiercely individualistic _ and capitalistic _ countrymen.
   Kabul moneychangers operate openly, soliciting dollars and
offering exchange rates more than three times the official rate.
Coca-Cola is still the most popular soft drink; the bottle looks
like ``the real thing,'' but the contents don't taste like it.
   The burly Najib, former head of KHAD, the KGB-style security
police, also seemed to be seeking a gentler personal image.
   Towering over 6 feet and aften described as a ``bear,'' ``bull''
or ``ox'' of a man, he spoke more softly than he had in the past.
His eyes crinkled with smile wrinkles as he beamed at his listeners.
   Reshaping his image, however, will require other efforts.
According to Western diplomatic sources, the rate of executions has
been increasing at Pul-i-Charki prison, a circular complex on the
outskirts of Kabul.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hundreds
of inmates, mostly mujahedeen, have been executed in the last three
months. The sources said Pakistani and Iranian prisoners were
beaten daily at Pul-i-Charki.
   The 41-year-old Najib also has been courting India, which like
Afghanistan is wary of a potentially powerful Pakistan.
   Pakistan, wedged between India and Afghanistan, has sheltered
mujahedeen guerrillas and serves as their conduit for weapons
supplied by the United States, China and other nations.
   Najib arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for a three-day state
visit, his first foreign trip since the signing of the Geneva
agreement.
   At an April 27 sports festival celebrating the 10th anniversary
of the Afghan revolution, the seat of honor next to Najib was
occupied by Sunil Dutt, an Indian movie star and member of
Parliament from Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party.
   Dutt later observed admiringly that Najib ``knows how to be
president.''
   India, which is a founding member of the nonaligned movement and
has a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, has been supportive
of Najib's government against the Pakistani-based mujahedeen.
   Najib also has taken pains to portray himself as a champion of
Islam, a change from his predecessors' policies.
   Government officials, when asked their priorities, routinely
mention reconstruction of the mosques first, ahead of repatriation
of refugees and rebuilding the economy. Turbaned clergymen are
included in official delegations presented to foreign visitors, and
stops on government-organized tours include historic mosques.
   Najib himself was called Najibullah at birth, but he dropped the
``ullah'' _ a form of ``Allah,'' meaning God _ in 1986 when he
replaced Babrak Karmal as general secretary of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Now, however, he is again referred to as Najibullah by his
underlings and the government-run news media.

   Residents of the posh Connecticut suburbs of
New York City have the highest average incomes in the nation, more
than three times the income of Texans near the Mexican border, a
government report says.
   The Commerce Department, in its annual ranking of per capita
income in 317 metropolitan areas, said residents of the
Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury area of Connecticut maintained
their No. 1 ranking with average incomes of $24,501 for every man,
woman and child in 1986.
   That was up 15.7 percent from $21,181 in 1984, when the
Bridgeport area average income also was the highest.
   The McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of Texas, near the Mexican
border, posted the lowest per capita income. It traded places with
Laredo, Texas, another border town, which was last in 1984 and
next-to-last in 1986.
   McAllen area income was $6,800 and Laredo income was $6,850 in
1986.
   For the nation as a whole, average income grew by 11.6 percent
from $13,116 in 1984 to $14,639.
   However, the statistics show that the gap between the municipal
haves and have-nots is widening.
   Sixty-five percent of the richest 106 metropolitan areas had
faster-than-average income growth, while only 29 percent of the
poorest 105 areas had higher-than-average growth.
   Income in Bridgeport, for example, grew by 15.7 percent, while
income in McAllen grew 6.3 percent.
   The top and bottom average incomes were separated by $17,701 in
1986, compared with a $14,920 gap in 1984.
   The 15 metropolitan areas with the lowest per capita income were
generally located in the Southeast and Southwest. Of the 15
richest, all but two were in the Northeast, California or Florida.
   Four of the top 15 areas were in New Jersey while five of the
bottom 15 were in Texas.
   The top 15 areas and the average per capita personal income in
1986 were:
   Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, Conn., $24,501; San Francisco,
$23,542; Bergen-Passaic, N.J., $21,518;
Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J., $21,142; San Jose, Calif.,
$20,935;
   Anchorage, Alaska, $20,550; Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., $20,514; Lake
County, Ill., $20,265; Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., $20,154;
Washington, D.C., $20,148;
   West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach, Fla., $19,938; Newark,
N.J., $19,675; Trenton, N.J., $19,309; Sarasota, Fla., $19,248, and
Boston-Lawrence-Salem-Lowell-Brockton, Mass., $18,959.
   The bottom 15 and 1986 per capita income were:
   Pine Bluff, Ark., $10,529; Anniston, Ala., $10,476;
Houma-Thibodaux, La., $10,476; Biloxi-Gulfport, Miss., $10,449;
Huntington, W.Va.-Ashland, Ky., $10,426;
   Florence, Ala., $10,336; Pascagoula, Miss., $10,122;

Las Cruces, N.M., $9,544;
   El Paso, Texas, $9,177; Provo-Orem, Utah, $8,528;
Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas, $7,205; Laredo, Texas, $6,850, and
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, $6,800.

<HEAD>Four Years After Jackson's Visit, Coal Miner's Family Still
Supports Him</HEAD>

   Four years have passed since Jesse
Jackson came to call on jobless coal miner Karnell Bryant. Since
then, the Bryant family has started to leave the hard times behind
_ but not their enthusiasm for Jackson.
   ``I voted for him in 1984 and I'm surely going to do so this
time,'' says Bryant's wife, Diane.
   West Virginia's primary is Tuesday, and Jackson, along with the
other candidates, is campaigning in the state next week. Again, he
will pay a visit to a coal miner's home, this time in Raleigh
County.
   During the 1984 presidential campaign, Jackson's visit with the
Bryants at their home at Mudfork in Logan County garnered national
attention, and gave a glimpse of the coalition of economically
struggling Americans _ both black and white _ that Jackson was
beginning to build.
   At the time, Bryant was eking out a living in the depressed
coalfields from occasional carpentry jobs. He had met Jackson
nearly 20 years earlier, when he was driven to Chicago by tough
economic times in his native state.
   ``I went there because you couldn't get crackers in West
Virginia,'' Bryant said this week. ``Times was really hard here,
with the coal economy so down.''
   In Chicago, Bryant was living in one of the numerous Appalachian
ghettos that sprang up when West Virginians and others fled to
urban areas to look for work.
   ``There was a lot of poor white people _ a real raggedy area,''
he said. ``And I wasn't doing too hot either. I was just a big ol'
knot-headed boy, working as a janitor, so I guess I was one of the
people who was underprivileged.''
   Though he may have considered himself underprivileged, Bryant
still had time and energy to devote to people who were even less
fortunate. He went to work as a volunteer in a food pantry, and
when the pantry needed additional support he contacted Jackson's
Operation PUSH.
   ``I worked around him and with him and I got to admire the
guy,'' Bryant said. ``He wasn't working for no personal gain, just
to help people.''
   These days, the Bryants are better off financially than they
were during Jackson's 1984 visit. About 3{ years ago, they
mortgaged their home and property to buy the store where Mrs.
Bryant worked as a butcher, and now they run the Wilcox Grocery.
   They work 12 hours a day, six days a week. Jackson likes to say
in his stump speech that many of America's poor people work hard
every day.
   ``The business is growing by leaps and bounds,'' Mrs. Bryant
said. ``We're doing real good, with the grace of God.''
   But Bryant doesn't want to forget the hard times.
   ``We're blessed so we can be a blessing to other people, that's
how I look at it,'' Bryant said. ``It seems like the people that
has the money don't care about God, country or human beings. They
just care about getting richer.''
   Bryant said his support for Jackson goes beyond a personal
fondness for the man.
   ``I'm getting a little bit disillusioned with our government and
the way it's been run,'' he said. ``If you ever ask a question,
seems like our government wants to say `You're just a communist, or
a rebel or a redneck.'''
   That's what attracted him to Jackson, Bryant said.
   ``Jesse Jackson don't believe in diplomacy _ he believes in
honesty,'' he said. ``There's a spirit about the man that makes you
want to be more like him.''
   ``What I like about the guy is he's specific and to the point,''
Bryant added. ``And he don't believe in babying people _ if you're
wrong, you're wrong.''
   Diane Bryant agreed.
   ``I think Jesse is the only one who can do the job _ he has the
ability and he's an honest person,'' she said.
   ``You know full well we already have too many crooks in
government.''

   The ghost of extreme-right candidate Jean-Marie Le
Pen haunts the presidential campaign trail, bedeviling conservative
Premier Jacques Chirac and, like a poltergeist, forcing cracks in
his center-right coalition.
   Le Pen, who ran on an anti-immigration ``French First''
platform, was eliminated in the first round of the election April
24, but he won a surprising 14.4 percent of the vote and placed
fourth.
   Now, Chirac and Socialist President Francois Mitterrand _ the
top two vote-getters who advanced to Sunday's runoff _ are making
overtures to Le Pen supporters.
   Chirac's Rally for the Republic party took its deepest swing
into Le Pen territory last weekend when Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua said Le Pen's National Front ``claims the same
preoccupations, the same values'' as the traditional conservative
parties.
   Chirac placed a weak second with just under 20 percent of the
April 24 vote. He needs to win over supporters of the National
Front without distancing centrist voters who backed former Premier
Raymond Barre, who came in third and was eliminated from the runoff.
   Mitterrand, favored in Sunday's election, also needs support
from Le Pen's voters if his image as a uniting force in a divided
France is to be credible.
   But Pasqua's remarks in an interview with the weekly Valeurs
Actuelles unsettled the French political world.
   Some of Chirac's other ministers demanded an explanation, while
a top National Front official said Pasqua would be welcome to join
up.
   The premier himself said the attention to Pasqua's statement was
a maneuver ``invented by the left to mask the real debate'' _
economic competitiveness.
   ``Europe is in the making,'' Chirac said in a Tuesday night
television interview in reference to 1992, when trade barriers will
dissolve. He said talk should be focused on redressing the economy,
not on ``an abstract debate on values.''
   But the premier clearly has taken on the language of the
National Front. He has used its favorite words _ family, country,
national identity _ and even uses Le Pen's preferred word _
``decadence'' _ when referring to the left.
   Mitterrand has said he will not pursue a ``witchhunt of
immigrants'' but has begun saying that immigration to France should
be cut.
   While making such subtle appeals to the National Front, he has
sought the support of wayward centrists and moved the Socialist
program toward the political center.
   ``We don't have the right to refuse any help offered honestly.
It is in union, not separation, that France will achieve its
destiny,'' Mitterrand said this week at a rally in Strasbourg.
   Because of Le Pen's strong showing, many French are worried
about a rise in racism, fascism and undemocratic values.
   Some centrists who have supported Chirac's government have been
unnerved by the open flirtation with Le Pen. Dozens who supported
Barre in the first round have announced support for Mitterrand.
Most are obscure political figures, but four served as conservative
Cabinet ministers in the 1970s.
   ``Jacques Chirac is caught between the devil and the deep blue
sea,'' Socialist Sen. Roger Quillot said Tuesday night. ``If he
moves toward Le Pen, he loses from Barre's side. If he moves too
close to Barre, he loses from Le Pen's side.''
   Mitterrand is widely expected to lure other centrists into the
government he will form if he wins the election.
   Analysts have attributed much of Le Pen's support to a protest
vote by people outside the economic and political mainstream.
   Le Pen contends that France, inundated with immigrants, notably
from its former North African colonies, is in decline, growing
decadent and in danger of losing its identity. He says France, busy
providing for immigrants, has forgotten to take care of its own.
   At a May 1 rally in Paris' Tuileries Gardens, Le Pen called on
about 30,000 supporters not to vote for Mitterrand. He asked them
to use their own judgment on a vote for Chirac or not vote at all.
He vowed to stay active and called on followers to organize for
municipal elections next spring.

   President Reagan says he wonders what would
happen if the Earth were invaded by ``a power from outer space,''
and imagines that it would unite all nations of the world in a
common defense.
   He made the comment Wednesday in Chicago during a
question-and-answer session after a speech about human rights and
the Soviet Union.
   His telling of the story followed one day after the disclosure
that Nancy Reagan has consulted an astrologer about the president's
schedule and travel plans. Several members of Congress chided
Reagan about the use of astrology and a group of scientists
complained that it was a discredited practice.
   Reagan, asked what he felt was the most vital factor in
international relations, spoke of the importance of frankness and
about a desire for peaceful solutions.
   He went on to say that there had been ``about 114 wars'' since
World War II, including conflicts between smaller nations.
   ``But I've often wondered, what if all of us in the world
discovered that we were threatened by an outer _ a power from outer
space, from another planet,'' Reagan said.
   ``Wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have any
differences between us at all, we were all human beings, citizens
of the world, and wouldn't we come together to fight that
particular threat?'' the president asked.
   The president found an analogy in the threat of nuclear
destruction.
   ``In a way, we have something of that kind today, mentioning
nuclear power again. We now have a weapon that can destroy the
world, and why don't we recognize that threat more clearly and then
come together with one aim in mind, how safely, sanely and quickly
can we rid the world of this threat to our civilization and our
existence?''
   The comment drew applause from the audience, a nonpartisan group
that specializes in foreign policy and national security issues,
the National Strategy Forum.
   As his next summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
approaches, Reagan has been emphasizing the need for arms control
in particular and for cooperation among nations in general.
   In light of his past anti-Soviet rhetoric, he offered startling
praise for Gorbachev during his speech Wednesday, saying the Soviet
leader's reform programs are ``of tremendous significance.''
   ``It is my belief that there is hope for further change, hope
that in the days ahead the Soviets will grant further recognition
to the fundamental civil and political rights of all,'' Reagan said.

<HEAD>FTC to Look for `Scorched Earth' Campaign by Tobacco Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission is under orders
from a House panel to investigate whether the tobacco industry is
waging an illegal ``scorched earth'' campaign of economic
retaliation against corporate opponents of smoking.
   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of a House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee, instructed FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver at a
hearing Wednesday to examine whether tobacco companies are engaged
in illegal boycotts, ``whether real or threatened,'' against
businesses that prohibit smoking.
   Luken referred to RJR Nabisco Inc., which fired the advertising
firm that handled the announcement by another client, Northwest
Airlines, that it would prohibit smoking on all domestic flights
except to Hawaii starting April 23.
   The ad firm, Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Inc., had been producing ads
for Nabisco cookies for 12 years and for Life Savers candy, another
product of the tobacco and food conglomerate, for 18 years. RJR
Nabisco cited ``philosophical differences'' in firing the agency.
   ``The scorched earth efforts by conglomeration tobacco companies
to hit back at those who restrict smoking and to use the economic
power of their non-tobacco components to effort their will are
chilling and depressing,'' Luken said.
   ``If the parent companies, with tobacco and non-tobacco
subsidiaries, use tactics of intimidation and threats against those
who oppose smoking, the FTC should be alerted,'' he said. ``It is
the FTC's job to be aware of boycotts, whether real or threatened,
and to examine their legality.''
   Charles O. Whitley, a senior consultant for the Tobacco
Institute, the industry's trade association, said ``there is no
evidence of any collusion'' among the six major tobacco
manufacturers to take economic reprisals against Northwest Airlines
or any other business.
   But Whitley said tobacco companies will take any lawful steps
necessary to protect themselves and their customers against
corporate discrimination.
   Whitley said the Tobacco Institute had not taken a position on
draft legislation proposed by Luken and Rep. Bob Whittaker, R-Kan.,
to allow states to require tougher health warnings on cigarette
packs and advertising than those required under federal law.
   Major health organizations, including the American Lung
Association, the American Cancer Society and the American Heart
Association, endorsed the measure at the hearing.
   Their spokesmen accused the tobacco industry of making false
advertising claims that low-tar cigarettes are safer to smoke than
others. ``The only safe cigarette is no cigarette,'' said Scott D.
Ballin, vice president of the heart association.
   The Luken-Whittaker bill also would allow smokers and their
families to sue tobacco companies for damages on the ground that
deceptive cigarette advertising resulted in serious injury or death.
   The measure seeks to nullify recent appeals court rulings
favoring cigarette manufacturers who argued that
government-required warning labels protect them from legal claims
that they failed to warn the public of the hazards of smoking.
   The bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to contract
with a government or private laboratory unrelated to the tobacco
industry to conduct annual studies of the chemicals contained in
major cigarette brands, including tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide,
ammonia, cyanide, formaldehyde and radioactive compounds.
   The FTC closed its cigarette-testing laboratory in February 1987
on budgetary grounds. The only testing is performed by a tobacco
industry laboratory which is monitored by the FTC and uses
FTC-approved methods.

   A small boat fell Wednesday while
being lowered to the water from an amphibious ship, injuring seven
sailors, the Navy said.
   ``The injured were rescued from the water and taken ashore by
another Navy small boat which was operating in the vicinity,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet Surface
Force, based in Norfolk.
   Lloyd said he did not know whether those hurt had been in the
small boat or if they were struck by it and tossed overboard from
the 522-foot amphibious vessel Manitowoc in the accident in the
Lynnhaven anchorage.
   Two of the injured were in stable condition at Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital, Lloyd said. He said that four others remained in
the hospital but that their conditions were not immediately
available.
   One sailor was treated at a Navy clinic and released, he said.
   The Manitowoc, which is used to land troops and equipment on
beaches via a ramp that extends more than 100 feet, was on a
routine exercise, Lloyd said.
   The vessel is based at Little Creek Amphibious Base, which
straddles Norfolk and Virginia Beach. The ship operates with a crew
of 290 and can carry up to 400 troops.

   An unlikely combination of Mariachi music,
searchlights and the overhead drone of the Goodyear blimp lured the
last of thousands of aliens to the nation's busiest immigration
amnesty application center.
   But a line of aliens that in the past few weeks had numbered in
the thousands dwindled to only a few dozen Wednesday night.
   Still, hundreds of people merely wanting to watch the scene
gathered in the adjacent parking lot and a steady stream of cars
clogged traffic along the street just north of downtown.
   With ``Los Arrieros,'' a six-member Mariachi band, playing
Hispanic music in the background, Richard Rios, director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's amnesty center, earlier
surveyed the line of aliens.
   ``It may be a 6,000 day,'' he said simply.
   In the 12 months since the program began, the Houston office
became the nation's busiest single center, with applications
expected to top 110,000, officials said.
   One of the last minute applicants was Maria Flores, who used the
trunk of a car to fill out applications for two of her five
children. She already has submitted applications for her other
children and husband.
   ``We waited until now because we didn't have the money,'' she
said of the $50 fee for children and $185 for adults. A $420
ceiling was set for families.
   She decided to take advantage of the amnesty program for the
advantages of being an American citizen.
   ``Mexico's economy is so bad. It's so expensive and at least
here we can make enough money for food and a decent living,'' said
Mrs. Flores, who has been in this country since 1979.
   Overhead, the Houston-based Goodyear blimp circled, its lighted
sign proclaiming in Spanish and English: ``Time Is Growing Short.''
   A searchlight pierced the dark sky.
   Entrepreneurs sold refreshments and portable toilets were set up
to accommodate people who had camped out overnight.
   ``I kept saying tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,'' said 24-year-old
Florentino Montiel, explaining why he waited until the last day.
   Some attorneys, conspicuous in their suits, and other volunteers
were seated at card tables outside the center, helping applicants
fill out the INS forms. A Spanish-language radio station broadcast
live while an artist sketched pictures of applicants.
   Even police officers directing the traffic helped aliens having
problems with the forms.
   ``I brought my father down here,'' Officer Joe Garcia Jr. said,
pointing to a man working with aliens at a table outside the center.
   Many INS workers wore T-shirts saying, ``I survived the IRACA
crush,'' referring to the Immigration Reform and Control Act.
   Others caught naps in a small lounge filled with sleeping bags.
   ``I'd say we are putting in 12- to 16-hour days,'' Yolanda
Arizola, an INS worker, said. ``I'm tired, but it's my job.''

<HEAD>Women Face Poverty, Isolation in Old Age</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Countless mothers hoping to live comfortably
in their old age surrounded by loving families subscribe to a
bitter myth, since many will face only poverty and isolation, says
a grim Mother's Day message to Congress.
   For those women, growing old brings an economic nightmare as
they face life without a spouse, steady income or adequate health
benefits, according to the Older Women's League, a group working
for social reforms for women.
   America must do more than ``take a once-a-year look at
motherhood,'' Lou Glasse, the league's president, said Wednesday.
   ``It is not enough to buy us off with cards and flowers,'' she
said. ``These women deserve significant economic support from a
society which they have supported all their lives.''
   The group, which has 20,000 members, launched a campaign on
Capitol Hill for pension reforms, better health care for the
elderly and increased job protection and benefits for mothers who
work.
   Too many Americans believe that older women enjoy a ``golden old
age, surrounded by loving and adoring children, spouses and
friends,'' Ms. Glasse said.
   ``We do not deny that this is the reality for some,'' she said.
``But there is another America in which older women do not reap the
benefits of a lifetime of hard work, in which older women live in
poverty and isolation.''
   The group released a report, compiled from Census and other
data, showing that 72 percent of the poor over age 65 are women and
that a woman's chances of being poor increase if she is black or
Hispanic, divorced, widowed or separated.
   Women constitute the majority of the elderly living alone, but
more than half have been alone for at least 10 years and a quarter
have no surviving children to provide assistance if needed, the
report said.
   The disparity between men and women in median income is greatest
for midlife women aged 45-54, the report said. Only four women in
10 are currently vested in pension plans. And job interruptions for
having children or caring for a family member affect promotions,
salary and retirement benefits.
   ``This is a conspiracy of circumstances that work throughout a
woman's life to consign her to poverty,'' Ms. Glasse said.
   The group presented members of Congress with Mother's Day cards
outlining the report and the legislation they want to have enacted.
The group supports Medicare coverage for long-term home care,
expanded coverage of adult day care, catastrophic health care for
the elderly, an increase in the minimum wage, employee benefits for
part-time workers, passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act and
other health care measures.
   Norma Downey, mother of Rep. Thomas Downey, a member of the
House Select Committee on Aging, gave her son a Mother's Day card
with instructions to ``take its message to the floor of Congress.''
   On Mother's Day this Sunday, ``too many women will spend the day
wondering how they will be able to pay their rent, feed their
children and maintain some semblance of the American Dream,'' she
said.

   A jury Wednesday recommended life in prison
rather than the death penalty for a teen-ager convicted of
bludgeoning a classmate to death with baseball bats and putting the
body in a cistern.
   Ronald Charles Clements, 17, of Carl Junction, cried quietly as
the recommendation was read. Jasper County Circuit Judge Herbert
Casteel, who is not bound by the recommendation, set sentencing for
June 14.
   Earlier Wednesday, the jury deliberated 2{ hours before
returning a first-degree murder verdict against Clements in the
slaying Dec. 6 of Stephen Newberry, 19, of Carl Junction. A
psychiatrist had called the slaying a satanic sacrifice.
   First-degree murder carries either the death penalty or life in
prison without hope of parole.
   Another teen-ager pleaded guilty to murder in the slaying in
exchange for a promise from prosecutors not to seek the death
penalty; a third teen-ager is awaiting trial.
   Newberry was struck at least 50 times with baseball bats,
authorities said. His body was found a day later in a cistern in a
wooded area near the Kansas border.
   Clements had conceded taking part in the crime, pleading
innocent by reason of mental disease or defect. In closing
arguments, attorneys clashed over his mental state.
   Under Missouri law a person is absolved of responsibility in a
crime if it can be shown that a mental disease or defect prevented
him from knowing right from wrong or being able to conform his
actions to the law.
   Defense attorney Ross Rhoades asked jurors to reflect on
evidence of Clements's chaotic family life, including his parents'
turbulent marriage, and his dependence on drugs, dabbling in
satanism and lifelong fascination with violence.
   Jasper County Prosecutor David Dally said in closing arguments
that it was clear that Clements acted deliberately.
   ``You heard one of the psychiatrists offer a possible reason:
This young man had been getting his high off drugs for a number of
years,'' Dally said. ``He had been getting his high off music that
I don't care for and I'm sure you don't.
   ``He decided it was time for the ultimate thrill _ to see what
it would be like to kill another human being,'' the prosecutor
said. ``And, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, he has to be
punished for it.''
   Clements listened Wednesday as his attorney played one of his
cassette tapes in which the heavy metal rock group Megadeth sings,
``I hack up my victims like pieces of meat.''
   ``This boy ... did not have the capability of differentiating
between fantasy and reality,'' Rhoades said in his closing
argument. ``In fact, he escaped into fantasy from the reality he
had endured for 16, 17 years.''
   Dr. William Logan, director of the department of law and
psychiatry at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan., said Clements
followed along when his friends suggested making ``the ultimate
sacrifice to Satan, a human sacrifice.''
   Logan said Clements understood the killing was wrong but could
not separate the act from fiction.
   ``He almost expected (the victim) to be there the next day at
school,'' Logan said.

<HEAD>US-Soviet Groups Says The Two Powers Should Avoid Regional
Conflicts</HEAD>

   Soviet and U.S. veterans of the Cold War are
proposing that the United States and the Soviet Union stop
intervening in the developing world as a step toward reducing their
military competition.
   The motto for the group might be ``No more Afghanistans, No more
Vietnams,'' said Arthur Macy Cox, a former CIA official who
organized the effort with Georgi Arbatov, head of Moscow's
USA-Canada Institute.
   In a position paper issued today, the Soviets and Americans call
for the ``progressive demilitarization of U.S.-Soviet
competition,'' including sharp cuts in strategic nuclear and
conventional arsenals, elimination of chemical weapons and
adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   All those areas are under negotiation between the superpowers.
   The proposal breaks new ground by proposing a deal to end the
Cold War in the developing world, saying: ``We believe that
military intervention by the superpowers in regional conflicts has
reached a dangerous dead end and should be terminated by mutual
agreements.''
   Now is the right time for such a rapprochement, far better than
during detente, said one American in the group, Townsend Hoopes,
undersecretary of the Air Force under President Lyndon Johnson. The
Americans were all members of the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet
Relations and include former CIA director William Colby, former
undersecretary of state George Ball and former Sen. John Culver.
   Detente _ a period of thawing superpower relations under
Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter _ produced a series of arms
control agreements and increased trade between the superpowers, but
floundered amid U.S. accusations that the Soviets were continuing
their military buildup and using force to install allied
governments in the developing world.
   ``We have a clear idea of why detente was ruined,'' Hoopes said
in an interview. The Soviets understood detente to exclude behavior
in the developing world, the opposite of the U.S. understanding.
   This time, says Hoopes, ``We are convinced of the sincerity on
the Russian side.''
   During detente, the United States withdrew from Vietnam.
   At the same time, the Soviet Union was supporting Marxist
insurgencies that took power in South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia,
Angola, Nicaragua and Ethiopia. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
in 1979 and the military crackdown in Poland in 1981 nailed shut
the coffin of detente, in the view of many American analysts.
   President Reagan, on taking office in 1981, sought to reverse
Soviet advances in the developing world by supporting insurgent
movements, a policy that probably contributed to the Kremlin
decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, but has been less
successful elsewhere, notably Nicaragua.
   The Soviet-American group is proposing an understanding under
which the Soviets pull out of Afghanistan, their Cuban allies
withdraw troops from Ethiopia and Angola, and most Soviet bloc
military advisers in the developing world go home.
   In return, said Cox, ``the Reagan doctrine must end,'' and the
United States would stop supporting anti-Communist guerrilla
movements in Nicaragua, Angola and elsewhere.
   Additionally, the two sides would agree to a list of weapons
which they would not supply to developing nations.
   The main points of the proposal reflect suggestions that have
been made by Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorachev, Arbatov, and other
Soviets in the bilateral group: Valentin Falin, Fyodor Burlatsky,
Henry Trofimenko, Vitaly Zhurkin, and Andrei Kortunov.
   ``Every one of these people is a spokesman for Soviet policy.
Most of them are influential,'' said Cox.

<HEAD>NRC Staff Backs Plan To Mothball Contaminated Three Mile Island
Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report says the contaminated
Three Mile Island nuclear reactor can be safely mothballed, but a
citizens' group fears that would effectively turn the site into a
high-level waste graveyard.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff approved a plan by the
Pennsylvania plant's operator to place Three Mile Island Unit 2 in
storage for some 20 years while radiation decays inside.
   Significantly, the NRC staff's report, which was released upon
request Wednesday, said the plan was no better or worse than an
alternative under which further cleanup work would be performed
before the unit was mothballed.
   That is the approach favored by Three Mile Island Alert, a
citizens' group based near the plant in the middle of the
Susquehanna River, near Harrisburg.
   Eric Epstein of TMIA criticized the NRC on Wednesday for being
``willing to accept a high-level waste site on an island in the
middle of a river indefinitely.'' He said the plan enables GPU
Nuclear, the plant operator, ``to walk away from their commitment
to completely decontaminate and decommission the plant.''
   The idea, GPU said, was to place the plant in ``safe, stable and
secure'' condition while radiation was allowed to decay naturally
and new technologies were developed to permit easier access to the
insides of reactor.
   After studying the plan, the NRC staff concluded it could be
implemented ``without significant environmental harm'' and that
``no alternative was found to be clearly preferable from an
environmental impact perspective.''
   The NRC staff is soliciting comments from the public before
making its conclusions final.
   Unit 2 was disabled in the nation's worst commercial nuclear
accident on March 31, 1979. The reactor was allowed to lose vital
cooling water that normally covers it. Uncovered, material in the
radioactive core melted partially.
   The subsequent $1 billion cleanup, expected to completed in
mid-1989, has focused on water decontamination, waste shipment and
removal of fuel from the damaged core.

   President Reagan is softening his sharply
anti-Soviet rhetoric as the Moscow summit nears, a meeting he
contends shouldn't have ``a winner or a loser.''
   Reagan, in a speech Wednesday in Chicago, offered a startling
amount of praise for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the human
rights reforms he's begun.
   The president's remarks came in sharp contrast to a speech he
gave April 21, in which he lambasted the Soviet role in Afghanistan
and suggested they wouldn't keep their pledge to withdraw from
their neighboring country.
   In his address to the National Strategy Forum, a group concerned
with foreign policy and national strategy issues, Reagan lauded
Gorbachev for loosening restrictions on religion, freedom of
speech, press and emigration.
   ``We applaud the changes that have taken place and encourage the
Soviets to go farther,'' Reagan said. ``We recognize that changes
occur slowly but that is better than no change at all.''
   Reagan's speech was the next-to-last in a series of addresses
designed to highlight the issues he intends to raise at the summit
in Moscow with Gorbachev, set for May 29-June 2.
   ``In recent months, the Soviet Union has shown a willingness to
respect at least some human rights. It is my belief that there is
hope for further change, hope that in the days ahead the Soviets
will grant further recognition to the fundamental civil and
political rights of all,'' Reagan said.
   He took note of a development he termed ``of tremendous
significance'' in recent months, that the Soviets themselves are
beginning to talk and print stories about economic shortages in
their country.
   The president also said some 300 political and religious
prisoners had been released from labor camps over the last three
years, and that the incarceration of dissidents in mental hospitals
and prisons has slowed, and in some cases, stopped.
   While Reagan said much religious activity remains repressed in
the Soviet Union, but controls have been relaxed.
   He added that he is ``heartened'' by the progress made in the
increased numbers allowed to emigrate, as well as the loosening of
controls on family visits.
   The president acknowledged that the United States has its own
problems with homelessness, racial discrimination and unemployment.
Moscow has used the problems in an attempt to counter U.S.
criticisms of Soviet human rights policies. In a bow to Soviet
concerns, Reagan said their critique ``deserves a full response.''
   In a brief question and answer session with the audience, Reagan
said he was willing to give Gorbachev ``the benefit of the doubt,
up to a point'' _ that the Soviet leader sincerely wants to achieve
the program of economic and social reforms known as ``glasnost.''
   The president said he believes Gorbachev is pursuing the reforms
because of economic problems in the Soviet Union.
   Reagan said he hoped he could offer Gorbachev some suggestions
at the summit on how he could move ahead with glasnost.
   ``That, I think, is preferable to staging a kind of contest with
him so that someone looks like a winner or loser,'' Reagan said.
   White House Communications Director Tom Griscom denied Reagan's
remarks were designed to mollify Gorbachev, who took issue with
Reagan's anti-Soviet attacks during a recent meeting with Secretary
of State George Shultz.
   Griscom argued that Reagan's approach to the Soviets was
consistent, but that his speeches varied because he addressed
different topics.
   The president also played down expectations for the Moscow
meeting, saying he didn't expect to sign a new treaty on long-range
strategic missiles. He added that both he and Gorbachev were
``hopeful'' their pact banning medium-range weapons could be ready
for signing, but noted the U.S. Senate hasn't moved rapidly to
approve the pact.
   Reagan said he continued to look for additional changes in the
Soviet Union, but was realistic, given Soviet history.
   He said the West has observed progress before, only to see it
wither away.
   That, Reagan said, was the reason U.S. dealings with the Soviets
must be based on ``candor and realism.''
   ``Just as previous hopeful moments in Soviet history ended all
too soon, so, too, glasnost, _ today's new candor _ will succeed if
the Soviets take steps to make it permanent, to institutionalize
it,'' Reagan said.

   Tricks may be for kids, but this
kidnapping case got the police hopping.
   It started when 6-year-old Michelle Rizzo discovered her pet
rabbit, Smokey, was missing Sunday morning and a ransom note was
left in the animal's place, police said.
   ``If you ever want to see your stupid rabbit alive again, leave
$50 in an envelope under the railroad crossing sign behind your
house,'' said the note, fashioned from newspaper clippings pasted
to a piece of paper.
   Michelle's parents, Joseph and Vera Rizzo, called Police Chief
Charles David, who is their neighbor, and detectives worked the
rabbit-napping case on their day off.
   Detective William Dowd photocopied $50 worth of currency and
placed it in an envelope. He told Michelle, her 8-year-old brother,
Joseph, and 10-year-old sister, Antoinette, to follow the
rabbit-napper's instructions and deliver the envelope to a
specified rock under the sign at 5 p.m. Sunday.
   About 40 minutes later, police arrested two boys, ages 14 and
15, after one of them grabbed the envelope. A third boy confessed
after questioning from his mother.
   Police found Smokey in a cardboard box in a shed behind one of
the culprits' homes.
   Written on the box were the words: ``Handle with care. Rabbit
inside. Thank you for the money.''
   The three boys were charged with theft of the rabbit and
released into the custody of their parents.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Examines Broadened Ethics Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House chairman says will move swiftly to
fashion a plan to stop former members of Congress and top executive
branch officials from becoming instant lobbyists right after they
leave government.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., says he plans follow the Senate's
footsteps and begin moving ``revolving door'' legislation ``in a
very short time'' in his Judiciary government relations
subcommittee.
   ``There is broad agreement in the Congress that we should be
moving on this,'' Frank said Wednesday at a subcommittee hearing
prompted by Senate passage last month of an ethics bill to put
Congress for the first time under post-employment lobbying
restrictions.
   During Senate debate, supporters referred to the cases of Lyn
Nofziger and Michael Deaver, who ran into legal problems in
connection with high-priced lobbying after they left top White
House posts.
   Witnesses gave Frank's subcommittee mixed reviews about the
Senate bill, with John Keeney, acting head of the Justice
Department's criminal division, saying the Reagan administration
favored some parts of it and opposed others.
   Keeney said the Senate plan is too broad because it would simply
ban much for-pay lobbying by former lawmakers and senior political
appointees for a year after they leave their jobs.
   Instead, Keeney said, prohibitions against cashing in on inside
knowledge and connections should have a ``nexus'' between the
lobbying and the official's former position or responsibilities.
   A much-criticized 10-year-old ethics law does not cover Congress
_ which Keeney says the administration feels should be covered _
and puts a year's ban on top-drawer executive branch officials
lobbying their former agencies.
   Critics say the law has been eroded by Office of Government
Ethics rulings that compartmentalize agencies, banning a former
official's contacts with his or her previous section but leaving
them free to lobby elsewhere in the agency.
   The Senate bill would prohibit former high officials from
lobbying anywhere in the executive branch and trying to influence
members of Congress for a year. Former lawmakers could not lobby
Congress or top White House aides and Cabinet secretaries for a
year.
   ``If there ever was a bill whose time has come, this is it,''
said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, the subcommittee's ranking
Republican. He said Congress has been ``extremely hypocritical'' to
exempt itself from the ethics law.
   ``We have a real problem,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.
``When Richard Nixon can go on `Meet the Press' and with a straight
face comment on the Washington sleaze factor, then we have a
problem.''
   Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, said that while the Deaver and
Nofziger cases have captured public attention, problems exist
elsewhere, such as the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, where
15 officials departed in 1986 to become lobbyists or foreign agents.
   ``Their institutional memory and knowledge of U.S. negotiating
strategies gives foreign interests a clear bargaining advantage,''
Kaptur testified.
   Ann McBride, senior vice president of Common Cause, the
self-described citizens' lobby, urged approval of a strong
``revolving door'' bill. But Morton Halperin of the American Civil
Liberties Union said there is no proven need to include former
members of Congress and that doing so would be ``bad policy'' and
possibly unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Boy Recovering After 20 Minutes Underwater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old boy who survived being submerged
20 minutes in a pond in February is hoping to root for the
Cincinnati Reds this summer.
   James R. Reilly has been at Children's Hospital Medical Center
here since Feb. 16, when he fell through the ice while playing at
an industrial park near his Cincinnati-area home in northern
Kentucky's Boone County.
   These days J.R., as he is known to family and friends, spends
his time writing, talking with nurses and doctors and playing with
a big brown teddy bear near his bed. Doctors aren't saying when he
can go home.
   He keeps track of the Reds, his favorite baseball team. ``Eric
Davis and Pete Rose are my favorites,'' he said.
   His youth and vigor are advantages in recovery, and he seems
more alert, his mother said. He is active in his hospital ward, and
he knows the nurses' and doctors' names.
   A physical therapist works on strengthening his legs and
improving hand-eye coordination.
   The youngster was rescued by his 14-year-old brother, Michael.
``I was scared and cold at first,'' Michael recalled. ``But when I
thought about J.R., I didn't feel cold at all.''
   After 20-25 minutes, Michael pulled his brother to shore. Once
James was out of the water, Charles Deaton, 17, of Newport, Ky.,
who was nearby, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   He remained in a coma for about a week, but regained
consciousness. ``We didn't leave the hospital for two weeks,'' said
his father, Jim.
   Since then, J.R. has made steady progress. The accident
decreased his lung capacity, and he must work to regain his
strength and coordination, but there has been no sign of brain
damage, doctors say.
   Doctors have told the parents there will be some permanent lung
damage, though it will be some time before its extent will be
known. The boy still has a tube in his chest that he has to cover
in order to speak.
   His recovery is credited primarily to a body function called the
mammalian diving reflex. When the human body is submerged in cold
water for an extended time, the heartbeat slows and oxygen-rich
blood is sent from the arms and legs to the heart and brain. The
reflex is more active in children.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the President Reagan's
Father's Day proclamation, released Wednesday by the White House:
   Once again we celebrate Father's Day, by tradition the third
Sunday in June, a day to honor and salute fathers everywhere for
their love and devotion.
   As a weary child tumbles into his father's arms, to be lifted up
and carried, he feels his father's strength and is content. In that
perch he is like a captain, confidently scanning the horizons of
his world, secure in the knowledge that his ship will carry him
safely through any threatening seas. Children, vulnerable and
dependent, desperately need such security, and it has ever been a
duty and a joy of fatherhood to offer it.
   Being a father requires strength in many ways; above all, it
requires character. Raising a family is no easy task, of course,
but one of trial, frustration and disappointment. Great strength
and more than a little courage are needed to persevere, to fight
discouragement and to keep working for the family. In that
strength, and with God's grace, fathers find the patience to teach,
the fortitude to provide, the compassion to comfort and the mercy
to forgive. All of this is to say that they find the strength to
love their wives and children selflessly. And it is above all for
this wondrous, mysterious love that fathers shower upon their
families, and that allows them to ceaselessly put their families'
needs first, that we honor fathers with their own special day.
   Our gratitude is not limited to Father's Day, but remains
constant; indeed, there are not enough days in the year to express
it properly. Still, it is fitting that on such a day the American
people pause to celebrate all fathers for their loving care for
their youngsters. Our nation can only continue to prosper if our
families prosper. Nothing can replace the family's role as prime
nurturer and educator of children, and nowhere are our country's
shared values more effectively transmitted to future generations.
   So let us thank all fathers on this day; but, above all, let us
each take this occasion to express our thanks and our affection to
our own fathers, whether we can do so in person or in prayer. We
are perhaps no longer little children riding on our fathers'
shoulders, yet we will forever feel their firm and loving guidance
through life's challenges.
   Now, therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States
of America, in according with a joint resolution of the Congress
approved April 24, 1972 (36 U.S.C. 142a), do hereby proclaim
Sunday, June 19, 1988, as Father's Day. I invite the states and
communities and people of the United States to observe that day
with appropriate ceremonies as a mark of appreciation and abiding
affection for their fathers. I direct government officials to
display the flag of the United States on all federal government
buildings, and I urge all Americans to display the flag at their
homes and other suitable places on that day.
   In witness thereof, I have here unto set my hand this third day
of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight,
and of the independence of the United States of America the two
hundred and twelfth.
   Ronald Reagan.

<HEAD>Yeutter Calls US-Japan Trade Relations Good Despite GATT Complaint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has taken its complaint
about Japan's beef and citrus import restrictions to GATT, where
the Reagan administration's chief trade negotiator says the dispute
may be settled by the end of this year.
   Moreover, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter says Zenchu,
Japan's Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, had better
rethink a threat made to boycott imports of American feed grains or
suffer the consequences.
   Yeutter predicted Wednesday at a news conference that the
Japanese restrictions on beef and citrus imports will be declared
illegal by GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such a
finding would open the way to compensation or possible U.S. trade
reprisals or a combination of both, he said.
   Japan accepted the process at a GATT meeting in Geneva hours
after breakdown of talks in Washington on Tuesday night. A panel to
consider the issue is expected to be convened soon.
   However, Yeutter said overall trade relations between the two
countries are ``still very good'' and the United States ``would be
happy at any time'' to listen to new Japanese proposals provided
they ``reflect a whole lot more market liberalization than surfaced
in the last few days.''
   The Commerce Department has estimated that annual U.S. beef
exports to Japan of about $550 million could grow to about $1
billion under free trade and exports of oranges and orange juice,
now less than $100 million a year, could top $150 million.
   ``We will not permit this case to spill into the next
administration,'' he said. ``We're going to resolve this dispute
one way or another during this administration.''
   Disclosing new details of his negotiations with Japanese
Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato, however, Yeutter said the United
States would have accepted a proposal for a three-year phase out of
the beef quota if Japan had not sought to raise new barriers.
   He also said a two-year phase out of orange and orange juice
import quotas could have been accepted, but Japan insisted on five
years and offered only a 10 percent annual tonnage increase.
   Yeutter was asked about a threat by Zenchu to boycott U.S. feed
grains because of the American request for GATT action on Japan's
import restrictions.
   ``I would certainly hope (it doesn't happen), because that would
be met with a harsh reaction by everyone here in the United
States,'' including the Agriculture Department, the Office of the
U.S. Trade Representative, the Reagan administration as a whole,
and Congress, he said. ``Japan, as a nation, would pay a very high
price for that kind of vindictive action.''
   At a later telephone hookup with farm broadcasters, Yeutter
reiterated his view that a GATT decision on the U.S. complaint
would come relatively soon and said he made that clear to the
Japanese agriculture minister.
   ``I told him that in no way would we permit this issue to spill
over into the next administration, which is obviously what the
Japanese would prefer,'' Yeutter said. ``So they're going to have
to face it, at the very latest, toward the end of this year.''
   Yeutter added: ``We're rather confident (of) winning the GATT
dispute on both beef and citrus, and we're confident that the panel
can come down with a recommendation and a decision in a relatively
short period of time.''
   The National Cattlemen's Association supported the move to put
the issue in GATT because Japan's position left ``no choice'' to do
otherwise, said association president Dale Humphrey.
   ``We cannot accept a proposal that would leave Japan's beef
market essentially closed to producers,'' he said. ``Japan has a
responsibility as a major trading partner to open its market. This
is an opportunity for Japan to demonstrate that willingness and
settle the beef trade dispute once and for all.''
   John Datt of the American Farm Bureau Federation expressed
disappointment that Japan ``has again refused to eliminate clearly
illegal import restrictions.''
   Datt said Japan's offer to phase out its import quota system in
favor of new permanent import levies would be ``just replacing one
protectionist program with a worse one. For a country's that's a
major player in world trade, Japan is refusing to act like one.''

   Good weather appeared to help three regional
airlines in the Sun Belt post the best on-time records for the
second straight month, according to the Transportation Department.
   The monthly statistics released Wednesday showed Pacific
Southwest Airlines, America West and Southwest Airlines with the
fewest number of delayed arrivals during March.
   Overall the 14 airlines reporting statistics to the
Transportation Department had 78.8 percent of their flights arrive
within 15 minutes of schedule, considered on time by the
government, during March.
   That was a slight improvement over the average 74.7 percent
on-time arrival rate in February.
   The department, in its monthly consumer scorecard on air travel,
said 92.3 percent of Pacific Southwest's flights arrived on time in
March. America West had an arrival rate of 89.9 percent and
Southwest 86.3 percent.
   At the other end of the scale were Northwest Airlines, Trans
World Airlines and Continental Airlines, all of which the
department said were on time 75 percent of the time or less. The
same three were also at the bottom in February.
   The number of reports of mishandled baggage filed with airlines
declined during March, from an average of 8.75 reports for every
1,000 passengers flown in February to 7.48 percent in March.
   Meanwhile, complaints to the Transportation Department's
consumer affairs office about air travel fell significantly from
2,584 in March to 2,033 in April.
   The department released the on-time arrival statistics for March
at the same time as the consumer complaint statistics, although
they cover a different month.
   The department received the most complaints about Continental
and Eastern airlines in March. Both have been at the top of the
complaint list since the beginning of the year.
   The department said it received 14.61 complaints about
Continental for every 100,000 passengers flown last month. For
Eastern, the department got 12.07 complaints per 100,000 passengers.
   Houston Intercontinental Airport had the worst arrival record of
the 27 airports monitored by the government, with 64.5 percent of
the flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule. Denver's
Stapleton International Airport was second-worst with a 66.6
percent on-time record.
   The best arrival record was recorded at Phoenix, Ariz., which
had an on-time arrival rate of 85.2 percent. Next was Las Vegas,
Nev., with an on-time rate of 85 percent.
   In March, 12 flights _ six belonging to Continental, two
belonging to America West, two to Delta and one each to United and
Eastern _ were late at least 90 percent of the time.

   Six men met at the peak of Mount Everest
on Thursday after scaling the world's highest mountain for the
first time simultaneously from two different directions, the Nepal
Mountaineering Association announced.
   It said China's Ringen Puncog, 45, Da Cering, 38, and Ang Phurba
Sherpa, 27, of Nepal, reached the top of the 29,028-foot mountain
at 9:25 a.m. (11:40 p.m. EDT Wednesday). They reached the summit
more than four hours after leaving Camp Five located at 27,880 feet
on the south side in Nepal.
   They met Japan's Noboru Yamada, 38, Nepal's Ang Lhakpa Sherpa,
27, and China's Cering Doji, 30, who scaled the mountain from the
northern side in Tibet, the association said.
   The group later plan a live television broadcast from the peak
of the mountain.
   The two teams are part of an expedition involving more than 200
people from Japan, Nepal and China, who started climbing last month
to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the first Everest conquest in
1953 by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa guide Tenzing
Norgay.
   The rest of the members are scattered in various camps, while
some are in China and Nepal.

   An experimental drug that erodes a pig's
natural defense against ``pigging out'' may be the key to producing
leaner pork, a U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist says.
   ``Ordinarily, pigs know when they are full and don't really pig
out,'' said Jerome C. Pekas, an animal physiologist at the U.S.
Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center.
   Pigs' aversion to stuffing their snouts is due to a naturally
produced hormone that tells them when to lay off the feed, he said
Wednesday in a telephone interview from Las Vegas, Nev., where he
was attending the 72nd annual meeting of the Federation of American
Societies for Experimental Biology.
   An initial study found pigs ate more but put on leaner tissue
when injected with a compound that immunizes them against the
hormone cholecystokinin, or CCK.
   ``The pigs `thought' they were hungry so they ate more,'' Pekas
said.
   A pig's immune system treats the compound _ a harmless decoy _
as a foreign invader by developing antibodies to it, he said.
   Pekas conducted the study in Nebraska with animal physiologists
Bruce D. Schanbacher and William E. Trout. Pekas said he has
researched appetite regulation and feeding of swine since 1981. The
latest study began in the fall of 1986.
   ``This is pretty brand-spanking new stuff we are talking about
here. This is the first public disclosure,'' Pekas said.
   The 12 leaner pigs in the test group consumed an average of 22.5
pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more during the 82-day
treatment period compared to the 12 control pigs, he said.
   The scientists injected the pigs first at 11 weeks and later
gave three booster shots, but Pekas believes only one booster may
eventually be used.
   ``Pigs that got the special injection continue to use feed
efficiently, digest extra feed and go to the feed trough more often
than pigs in the control group,'' he said.
   Pekas said researchers were somewhat surprised and don't really
understand why the meat on pigs receiving the compound was leaner.
He added that more research was needed to determine if the drug was
the cause.
   ``I was impressed myself that the meat grows leaner. I'd be
almost inclined to say that was unexpected. I would have been
content to have observed that the animals were eating more feed and
gaining more weight,'' he said.
   Physiologists first recognized CCK as a hormone that causes the
gall bladder in humans and animals to contract, Pekas said. Its
possible effect on appetite regulation became known within the last
10 years. He said technology for using the new compound could be
available within a year, but the USDA would have to clear its use.
   Pekas said he envisions the hormone being further studied in
human medicine to treat problems caused by low appetite such as
anorexia nervosa or insatiable appetite such as obesity.
   Charles Harness, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers
Council based in Des Moines, Iowa, said he was not familiar with
the study but confirmed much research is being conducted to produce
leaner products.
   Mike Sondag, executive vice president of the Illinois Pork
Producers Association, also said he was aware of efforts to make
pork leaner, but was not familiar with the latest study.
   ``Several years ago that was our campaign theme, `America you're
leaning on pork,''' Sondag said.
   ``You look at today's hog versus the one back in the 1950s or
1960s and there is a tremendous difference in the composition and
actual appearance of the pigs. There is significantly less fat than
there used to be. We say pork is 50 percent leaner than it was 25
years ago.''

   A North Carolina businessman who made a
$25,000 loan to Jesse Jackson to help pay for a trip to Syria in
1984 says he's considering taking the Democratic presidential
candidate's campaign to court if he's not repaid.
   Marion ``Rex'' Harris, a businessman from Fayetteville, N.C.,
said Wednesday he has not been reimbursed despite repeated
requests. He said he was ``mad as hell about it.''
   ``If I loan you five cents I expect to be paid back _ I'm a
businessman,'' said Harris, a 1984 North Carolina coordinator for
the Jackson campaign. ``I would take my sister to court (if she
owed me money),''
   In the course of the trip to Syria, Jackson scored a diplomatic
coup by securing the release of Navy flyer Robert Goodman, who was
captured by the Syrians after being shot down over Lebanon.
   Harris said he mentioned the loan to Jackson in 1985 at a
convention in Memphis, Tenn.
   ``He was highly upset that I was upset (and hadn't been paid),''
said Harris. ``I know he has instructed them (his campaign) many
times to pay me. I have a beef with his staff, not Jesse.''
   Harris said he was asked by Jackson associates to make the loan
to the Concerned Citizens Humanitarian Fund Inc., based in
Savannah, Ga. Records in Georgia show the fund was incorporated on
Jan. 3, 1984, the day Goodman was released.
   Jackson told the The Associated Press in a recent interview that
his campaign attorney, Edward Coaxum, created a special
humanitarian fund in 1984 to pay for the candidate's two foreign
trips to Latin America during the campaign.
   Little is known about the humanitarian fund, incorporated as a
nonprofit organization. The fund has never filed an annual report
listing its officers or any details about how much money it has
raised and spent, said Carolyn Harris of the Georgia secretary of
state's office.
   Harris said he was asked to lend the money to the fund by
Benjamin Polote, who owns a construction company in Savannah, and
helped raise money for Jackson's 1984 campaign.
   The Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday that bank records show the
humanitarian fund's account paid out $17,876 of Harris' $25,000
loan to a travel agency that handled the Syrian trip, but that it
was not clear what happened to the rest of the money.
   ``I gave them a deadline (to pay me back),'' said Harris, but
refused to say if the deadline had passed. ``They are going to pay
me. I demand payment.''

   Glasnost is giving Americans a rare glimpse at
Russian and Soviet art ranging from religious icons to the
avant-garde of the early 20th century and works of ``official''
contemporaries.
   The Corcoran Gallery today opens a show of three contemporary
Soviet artists, the National Museum of American history next Friday
starts an exhibit of Russian religious icons, and in July the
Hirshhorn Museum is showing 90 important but seldom seen canvases
by Russian avant-garde painters.
   ``It's kind of the `glasnost' of the day around here,'' said
Sidney Lawrence, spokesman the Hirshhorn gallery, site of the most
important of the three shows.
   The exhibit is the ``first to come out of the Soviet Union made
up exclusively of paintings from this period that will show in the
West,'' Hirshhorn director James T. Demetrion said in statement.
   Many of the paintings, by such greats as Marc Chagall, Vasily
Kandinsky and Kasimir Malevich, were locked away for decades in the
basements of Leningrad and Moscow museums while Soviet authorities
enforced the official style known as ``Socialist realism.''
   For many Americans, this may the first and only glimpse of
paintings that art historians describe as among the most important
in the early 20th century.
   Malevich is particularly crucial because he is credited with
painting the first abstract canvases, in 1910-11, according to art
historians.
   The Hirshhorn exhibit runs from July 12 to September 25.
   The show at the Corcoran marks another first, part of a
pioneering official exchange that sent canvases by the Wyeth family
to the Soviet Union.
   In return, the Soviets sent works by Boris Ugarov, Tair Salakhov
and Dmitri Bisti, three ``official'' artists whose work illustrates
movement away from the sometimes stifling motifs of Socialist
Realism, such as tractors and smiling peasants and workers.
   The work of Ugarov, a native of Leningrad and winner of the
State Prize of the USSR in 1985, is reminiscent of such French
post-Impressionsts as Degas and Cezanne.
   Salakhov, born in Azerbaijan, has traveled abroad and his
canvases include such familiar images as the Empire State Building
in New York.
   Bisti, another State Prize winner, is a book illustrator who
appears to draw more heavily on purely Russian themes.
   Distancing himself from the abstract work that will be featured
at the Hirshhorn, Bisti told a news conference Wednesday that
``realism is the Russian tradition. Other styles are a departure
from the mainstream.''
   Of the three Washington exhibits, that at the American history
museum has the most traditional Russian art, 50 metallic icons from
the 17th to the late 19th century.
   The overall collection of 350 icons was sold to the Smithsonian
in 1892 by George Kunz, a Tiffany & Co. buyer who picked them up in
the Russian city of Nizhni-Novgorod, now known as Gorky.
   Although sizable collections of wooden icons exist in the West
and Soviet Union, the Smithsonian trove of metallic icons is
believed to be the largest of its kind in the West, and possibly
the most thoroughly studied in the world, said curator Richard
Ahlorn.
   Specialists began to restore and study the collection in the
early 1980s, and conceived the idea of holding an exhibition to
coincide with the 1,000-year anniversary of Christianity in Russia
which is being held in the Soviet Union this June.
   The icons, made of a copper alloy, where used in churches, in
homes and were carried by members of the Russian Orthodox faith
from about the 9th century, when Greek Orthodox missionaries
introduced Christianity into Russia, said Ahlorn.

   A strong earthquake struck Pagan Island in the
Marianas chain in the Western Pacific, officials said.
   No injuries or damage were immediately reported.
   The quake occurred at 1:47 p.m. HST Wednesday (7:47 p.m. EDT)
about 300 miles northeast of Guam, and measured 5.3 on the Richter
scale, not of a sufficient magnitude to generate a Pacific-wide
tsunami, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center here.
   The earthquake also was recorded by the Hong Kong observatory
and in Japan.
   Rich Sillcox at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach
said it is not known if the earthquake was related to volcanic
activity on Pagan where a major eruption in 1981 forced the 53
residents to flee.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded
on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a 10-fold
increase in intensity.
   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause serious damage in
populated areas, while one of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Study Finds More Than Half Of All Undergraduates Get Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says more than half the 7
million undergraduates who enrolled in college full-time last year
received financial aid, compared with less than a quarter of the
4.2 million part-time students.
   For the 58 percent of the full-time students receiving financial
aid, the support from all sources _ the federal government, states
and the college itself _ averaged $3,813, according to a survey
released Wednesday by the Department of Education's Center for
Statistics.
   For the rest, the financial aid was $2,199 on average.
   Overall, 46 percent of the 11.2 million undergraduates received
some type of aid, with 35 percent getting federal help.
   While 24 percent of the part-timers got help from some source,
less than 1 in 7 got any help from Washington.
   The cost of attending college, including tuition, room, board,
books and other expenses, averaged $6,000 in the fall of 1986 for
the students. They were surveyed last spring about how they were
paying for college and what it cost.
   The center said 77 percent of all the students attended public
colleges, 18 percent private colleges and 5 percent proprietary, or
for-profit, trade schools.
   The trade school students were far more likely to draw financial
aid.
   The so-called National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey found
that 84 percent of those enrolled in proprietary schools received
aid and 81 percent of those got federal help. Nearly 35,000
students were questioned.
   That compared with 65 percent of private college students who
were getting help, including 48 percent who got aid from
Washington; and 38 percent of all public college students, 29
percent of whom got federal aid.
   The College Board has reported previously that $20.5 billion in
aid was available in 1986-87. About 60 percent was in the form of
federal Pell Grants _ outright gifts based on need _ and Guaranteed
Student Loans.
   The College Board released a separate survey Wednesday that
showed part-time enrollments grew _ up 7.3 percent _ while
full-time enrollments shrank by 2.4 percent between 1980 and 1986.
   In another report, the American Association of University
Professors said the average full professor now earns $47,400 after
a 4.9 percent raise for 1987-88. The average salary across all
faculty ranks was $37,000.
   The government's student aid survey found nearly 56 percent of
black and 41 percent of Hispanic undergraduates got federal help,
compared with 35 percent of all undergraduates.
   Some 9.4 percent of those receiving aid in proprietary schools,
2.2 percent in public institutions and 1.2 percent in private
colleges never completed high school or obtained an equivalency
degree.
   Under current law, dropouts can get federal aid for college if
the institution judges they have the ``ability to benefit'' from
the training. The Reagan administration plans to ask Congress this
week to change the law and deny aid to those without diplomas.
   Chester Finn Jr., the Education Department's assistant secretary
for educational research and improvement, said only 20 percent of
undergraduates live on campus in dorms, while 50 percent live
off-campus and 30 percent reside with their parents.
   Finn said that belies the image of the typical college student.
``If you want to figure out people's costs and resources, don't
start by thinking of a dorm-dweller going to school full-time with
a check from his father to pay these costs,'' Finn said.
   Those living in dorms reported total expenses that averaged
$8,187; for those living off-campus, the figure was $5,042, and for
those living at home with their parents, just $3,970.
   But the people who conducted the survey said the students living
at home underestimated just how much their food and housing
actually cost their family.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Faults Favoritism Toward Wedtech When Meese Was
Counselor</HEAD>

   A White House deputy wrote a note in 1982 to
his boss Edwin Meese III that ``your personal go-ahead to me'' led
to a $32 million no-bid federal contract going to Wedtech Corp., a
congressional report says.
   Wednesday's bipartisan report by the Senate subcommittee on
oversight of government management concludes that Meese and the
former deputy, James Jenkins, violated White House ethics rules on
government contracts, resulting in ``improper favoritism'' to
Wedtech. Meese was counselor to the president at the time.
   The subcommittee's conclusion, disputed by Meese's lawyers, is
the latest in a series of disclosures and allegations that have
harmed Meese's tenure as attorney general.
   Meanwhile, Justice Department aides to Meese were busily
answering questions about a new controversy surrounding the
attorney general: his letter soliciting 30,000 lawyers and
businessmen to accompany him to a conference in Japan.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, head of the
department's office of legal counsel, concluded the Meese trip and
solicitation ``meet applicable legal and ethical standards,'' said
department spokesman Terry Eastland.
   The matter is under investigation by the Office of Government
Ethics, which polices a presidential order forbidding officials
from conflicts of interest or actions that have the appearance of
conflict or favoritism.
   Meese's letter was sent April 26 by the trip sponsors on the
attorney general's stationery with the Justice Department seal.
   When Meese and other Justice officials approved his letter, they
were unaware that the non-profit sponsor, People to People
International of Kansas City, was working with its profit-making
arm to recruit participants in the trip and a private conference in
Japan on international legal and economic issues, said Eastland.
   Meese and Jenkins got involved with Wedtech despite at least
three warnings at various times by two White House officials not to
do so, the Senate subcommittee report found.
   Then-Cabinet Secretary Craig Fuller told Jenkins not to get
involved, but Jenkins went ahead anyway because Fuller ``wasn't my
boss, so he couldn't tell me not to,'' Jenkins told the Senate
subcommittee staff.
   In addition, the report said, a note to Jenkins initialed by
Fuller stated: ``Strongly recommend no White House action be
taken.''
   Finally, former White House counsel Fred Fielding told the
Senate subcommittee staff that he had advised Jenkins either
directly or through Fuller not to intervene on behalf of Wedtech.
   Jenkins' efforts culminated with the award of the engine
contract to the South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor, which had
long been at odds with Army officials who thought Wedtech's price
for building small engines was too high. Jenkins' note to Meese in
the fall of 1982 said, ``your personal go-ahead to me saved this
project,'' according to the Senate report.
   The bipartisan report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese 16 memos
in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech's efforts to get the contract.
   Wallach, under indictment in the Wedtech scandal, was paid $1.3
million by the company.
   ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former
Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House
policy on contacts with procurement officials, which failure
resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the
report said.
   The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981
says, ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should
contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a
personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or
business associate has a financial interest.''
   ``In looking under the Wedtech rock, the subcommittee has
uncovered a picture of greed, influence-peddling and corruption,''
said the panel's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``We have found
improper and biased decision-making by top agency officials who
were influenced by well-paid Wedtech consultants.''
   Meese's lawyer, Nathan Lewin, said Meese's actions didn't give
the appearance of impropriety and did not fall within the scope of
the White House regulation.
   Lewin said the White House policy was designed to prohibit a
White House official from intervening at the request of a friend
who was asking that a certain company be awarded a contract.
   Lewin said that in this instance, Meese was simply trying to
ensure that Wedtech was treated fairly when it was considered for
the contract.

<HEAD>House Does Quick Rewrite of Trade Bill, Drops Alaska Oil Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are grumbling that a quick rewrite
by House Democrats of the omnibus trade bill aims at winning enough
Senate votes to override a veto while retaining a plant-closing
provision opposed by President Reagan.
   The House voted 253-159 Wednesday to remove curbs on exports of
Alaskan oil from the 1,000-page bill, which won final passage last
week. The move was contained in a resolution authorizing technical
changes in the bill.
   The resolution would simply authorize an official known as the
enrolling clerk to erase the oil provisions while he is dotting the
i's and crossing the t's in the mammoth piece of legislation.
   Republicans complained that deleting curbs on Alaska oil exports
after the bill was passed violated House rules and was designed to
gain the votes of Alaska's two Senators. Democratic leaders,
however, said their plan was fashioned as a compromise gesture to
Reagan.
   ``What we need here is a good, old-fashioned compromise,'' Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich., said Wednesday.
   But House Republicans were scornful.
   ``You've come the wrong half and you've done it the wrong way,''
Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., said. ``When it's over it's over.''
   ``We have here a technical procedure,'' said Minority Leader
Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., ``with which the majority will attempt to
surgically extract something from a piece of legislation that has
been officially, formally and finally adopted by both houses of the
Congress and should now by all rights be on the president's desk
for signature.''
   Reagan has been expressing concern for weeks over a provision of
the trade bill that would require companies with more than 100
employees to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs.
   House Democrats, citing the hardship of surprise plant closings
on employees and their families, said they will not drop that
provision.
   ``Maybe they should consult their astrologer to find out when
they are going to be out of work,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
told the House.
   More recently, Reagan also has criticized the Alaska oil
provisions.
   One of those provisions would limit exports of petroleum
products from new refineries in Alaska to 70,000 barrels a day and
50 percent of output. The other would clear the way for sending
50,000 barrels of crude a day to Canada. But first the oil would
have to be transported in a U.S. vessel to a port in the lower 48
states before turning around and going north of the border.
   Both provisions are favorites of politically influential
maritime unions.
   Democratic leaders had been hoping to persuade Alaska's
Republican senators, Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, to vote in
favor of the trade bill. When the leaders were unable to strip out
the oil export curbs, the two Alaskans opposed the measure when the
Senate passed it 63-36 last week.
   Stevens later said he could not guarantee that he would support
the trade bill even if the Alaska provision had been dropped.

   A Midway Airline DC-9 made an emergency
landing here, but authorities reported no injuries among the 76
people aboard, including the wife and son of Democratic
presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson.
   The plane landed safely at Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport on Wednesday evening during as flight for Chicago.
   Flight 369, carrying 69 passengers and five crewmembers, left
Washington, D.C., about 6:30 p.m., said Sandy Allen, a Midway
spokeswoman.
   About 1{ hours into the flight, the pilot saw a light warning
that an engine oil filter was clogged, Ms. Allen said.
   The jet made the unscheduled landing after receiving permission
from the airport.
   Passengers were reboarded on another Midway flight for Chicago,
Ms. Allen said.
   Jackson said his wife, Jackie, son Jonathan and the Rev. Willie
Barrow, president of the civil rights group Operation PUSH, were on
the flight. He said they had been in Washington for the celebration
of Jackson's victory in Tuesday's presidential primary in the
District of Columbia.
   Jackson, who was in Kearney, Neb., said he reached his wife by
telephone in Chicago late Wednesday.
   ``Whenever a family has a brush with death its always
traumatizing,'' Jackson said. ``But it should make us more sincere
in our prayer life because we face danger so much.''

<HEAD>FAA Chief Calls Older 737s Safe But Says Caution Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 older Boeing 737s belonging to
U.S. airlines are under special scrutiny for possible cracking and
corrosion as a result of last week's terror aboard an Aloha
Airlines jet in which the cabin tore open during flight.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced Wednesday that all
Boeing 737s with more than 30,000 landings are to be visually
inspected for cracks and corrosion in the upper part of the
fuselage. Those with at least 50,000 landings must undergo special
tests with high-frequency electronic equipment, the agency said.
   The wider inspection was ordered in part because ``several
additional reports of corrosion, delamination and cracks'' were
discovered in a number of aircraft since the Aloha accident a week
ago, the FAA said.
   The agency did not say what airlines were involved in the
discovery of additional cracks and corrosion. The inspections apply
to the top section of the plane from just behind the cockpit to the
tail section.
   The FAA reiterated a warning issued in a directive last November
that such cracks if close together and allowed to corrode ``could
result in a structural failure of the fuselage'' if not corrected.
   Investigators believe such a sequence of events likely occurred
aboard the Aloha jet last Thursday when a 20-foot secton of the
cabin wall and ceiling ripped away 24,000 feet. A flight attendant
was swept to her death and 61 people were injured before the plane
landed in Hawaii.
   The 19-year-old plane was one of the oldest and most heavily
used Boeing 737s manufactured, with a history of nearly 89,000
landings.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor nevertheless said the older
Boeing 737s subject to the increased inspections are ``just as safe
as newer models.'' He said the aircraft warranted closer scrutiny
because in light of the Aloha accident ``it is time for an
abundance of caution''
   David Jimenez, a spokesman for the Boeing Co., said in Seattle
that there are 212 Boeing 737s operated by 19 U.S. airlines in
domestic service that would be subject to the FAA inspections
announced Wednesday.
   Another 161 Boeing 737s with more than 30,000 landings are owned
by foreign airlines and fly outside the United States, he said.
While these planes may be inspected they are not directly subject
to the FAA order.
   The FAA is concerned about the aircraft because the Boeing 737
is a short-haul plane that normally accumulates a high number of
takeoffs, cabin pressurizations, depressurizations and landings.
This cycle puts stress on the plane's fuselage and can after time
cause an increased number of cracks in the outer metal skin.
   In addition, the older Boeing 737s also used a so-called ``cold
bonding'' process to hold sections of the metal skin in place.
``The FAA has reason to believe that possible delamination of the
bond requires mandatory inspections,'' said McArtor.
   According to Jimenez, all of the Boeing 737s on which the cold
bonding process was used _ the first 291 planes built _ have more
than 30,000 landings and are already subject to the FAA's broader
inspection order.
   Last week the FAA ordered many of the older Boeing 737s to fly
no higher than 23,000 feet until they are inspected. But that
directive applied to only 66 planes that had 55,000 or more
landings. The altitude restrictions remain in effect for the planes
covered by the new requirements, officials said.
   The new order expands the visual inspections and requires those
with 50,000 landings to automatically undergo so-called ``eddy
current'' inspections using high-frequency electronic devices.
   McArtor said he does not think the inspection requirements will
disrupt air travel because airlines will have between 250 and 500
landings, depending on type of inspection, to comply. The airlines
must report to the FAA within 48 hours on the results of any
inspections.
   The Boeing 737 is widely used for short-haul flights, with more
than 1,500 of them in service around the world. The older 737-100
and -200 series aircraft, on which the concern about cracking and
corrosion has centered, total 1,139 worldwide, although many of
them have had fewer than 30,000 landings.

   The state-run news agency PAP reported
Thursday that ``actions were taken'' to put an end to the
10-day-old strike at the Lenin steel mill in Nowa Huta outside
Krakow.
   No more specific information was given.
   Workers also were told to stay away from the shipyard in Gdansk
``until further notice,'' PAP said.
   The Gdansk shipyard went on strike Monday, the forth strike
since April 25 in Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since the
1981 military crackdown on Solidarity. Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa has joined the strikers and spent Wednesday night at the
shipyard on Poland's Baltic coast.
   ``There's no strike any longer,'' said a switchboard operator at
the steel mill in southern Poland at 8:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT). She
said no one from management was available to answer questions.
   On Wednesday, church mediators won a promise of negotations
today between strikers and management at the steel mill. A Roman
Catholic mediator in Gdansk said the director there had ruled out
negotiations with strikers.
   The promise of negotiations at Nowa Huta came after the
communist government on Wednesday accused strikers of terrorist
actions and warned continued trouble could bring ``serious
consequences.''

   Leocadia Hicks, a volunteer with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's amnesty program,
understood the fears and suspicions of illegal aliens waiting to be
processed.
   Sixteen years ago, she illegally entered the United States at El
Paso, Texas, from her home of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
   For the past year, Mrs. Hicks worked as a volunteer at the INS
legalization office here. She has assisted hundreds of illegals who
were eligible to apply for amnesty and eventual permanent residency.
   Mrs. Hicks, 39, and the oldest in a family of 14 children, grew
up in Juarez. There, while working in a curio shop, she met T.L.
Hicks, a soldier stationed at the U.S. Army's Fort Bliss base at El
Paso.
   Because of her illegal status, she kept a low profile for almost
a year after their marriage. She finally obtained legal residency
status on April 9, 1973.
   ``I'll never forget that day,'' she said. ``No one ever does.''
   Mrs. Hicks and her husband helped many of the hundreds of aliens
Wednesday applying for amnesty here on the final day of the program
that expired at midnight.
   Mrs. Hicks said she initially was leery of the program and
``checked it out'' thoroughly before volunteering to help last May.
   ``You go through so many bad experiences, but I have never seen
so much caring as I have here,'' she said. ``It's like a dream and
it's beautiful to see people regain their respect and dignity.''

   Wendy Davis had no trouble sneaking into
the country, but she says she's been unable to sleep well in her
six years as an illegal immigrant.
   ``I went right through the border. They just asked if we had
fruits,'' said Mrs. Davis, one of the thousands of aliens who
jammed Immigration and Naturalization Service offices in South
Florida on Wednesday.
   But as an illegal alien, ``I didn't have a life of my own,
control of my destiny,'' said Mrs. Davis, 19, a Belize native who
married Judd Davis of Chicago on July 4. The newlyweds moved
recently to Miami Beach.
   ``I had insomnia. I worried at night that someone could come and
take me away. When my papers come, I'm going to sleep at night,''
she said.
   Lines were long at the INS office here, but most of the waiting
people were smiling.
   ``They say this place is bad, but it's the best there is,'' Mrs.
Davis said, referring to U.S. citizens who complain about their
government.
   A sister and two brothers in Belize ``keep writing, asking me
when I'm going to visit. I wanted to go but I couldn't. I'd say I
was going soon as I get my papers,'' she said, beaming at the
prospect of receiving a work permit next week and residency status
this summer.

   Just hours before the midnight deadline
for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty under a one-year federal
program, the Immigration and Naturalization Service legalization
office here was quiet.
   ``The biggest problem tonight may be staying awake,'' said Ana
Pardo, who directs the office set up to handle applicants from
North Carolina and South Carolina.
   About 210 people _ half of them farm workers who have until Nov.
30 to apply for amnesty _ were processed Wednesday, Ms. Pardo said.
   ``The numbers are lower than they were yesterday, surprisingly
enough,'' she said Wednesday. ``I heard the Houston office had
13,000 people today.''
   As she spoke, only one person waited to submit his application
and $180 fee. Kong Hung moved to Hickory from Taiwan nearly 20
years ago.
   ``He likes to do things at the last minute,'' said his wife,
Karla, as she chased their twin 2-year-old sons, Christopher and
Albert. Their older brother Jim, 5, slept on a chair in the
near-empty waiting room.
   The Charlotte office has handled about 9,200 cases so far this
year, said Ms. Pardo. That's far below the 50,000 projected by INS
officials when the program began.

   Luis Aguilar has been deported five times
since coming to the United States nine years ago, but he kept
coming back by swimming the Rio Grande.
   ``I've been so long here, I just make myself at home,'' Aguilar
said Wednesday while waiting to apply for amnesty at the
Immigration and Naturalization Service office. ``I've been here
since 1979. I don't even know who the president of Mexico is.''
   Aguilar, 26, said he wasn't worried whether he would receive
amnesty and had no fear of being deported again.
   ``If they send me back to Mexico, I figure I can't stay there,''
he said. ``I've spent almost half my life here. The last time I was
there, I stayed three days and came back. I figure I belong here.''
   Aguilar said he works on a ranch in Konawa, where he earns about
$200 a week. He met his wife, Rosie, seven years ago, and she
persuaded him to apply for amnesty.
   ``He would get deported, but he always knew where to find me,''
Mrs. Aguilar said. ``One time he came right back three days after
he was deported.''
   They were married in 1983, and A.J. Irwin, the chief
legalization officer at the Oklahoma City INS office, said he was
surprised Aguilar didn't apply for citizenship since his wife, a
Seminole Indian, is a U.S. citizen.

   Cars were sent careening off highways,
windows shattered and a jetliner was jolted in the air by the chain
of atomic bomb-like blasts that tore through a rocket fuel plant
here.
   ``I was sitting in a booth eating pizza and the windows blew
out,'' Officer Michael Peterson of the Nevada Highway Patrol said
Wednesday, after the explosions erupted from the industrial park 10
miles from Las Vegas.
   ``We thought the whole building was going down,'' he said.
``Everybody took off right away.''
   Cars traveling on Highway 148 were knocked off the road by the
concussion, and motorists were injured, said Capt. Terry Edwards of
the Clark County Fire Department.
   ``People in their vehicles on this road were injured and their
cars were damaged,'' he said. ``They just went off the road and
wrecked.''
   Authorities said more than 250 people were injured and one
person was killed by the explosions, which struck just before noon
Wednesday at the plant that manufactures ingredients for space
shuttle rocket fuel.
   The blasts, which made gamblers briefly flee at least one
casino, were recorded by seismographs at California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, 200 miles away.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground, and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, a
Henderson resident who was in her pickup truck at the time of the
blasts.
   Gaming tables were briefly abandoned at Sam's Town on Boulder
Highway, but 15 minutes later it appeared there was no danger and
hundreds of gamblers went back inside, said resort spokeswoman
Shelley Roberts.
   A Las Vegas-bound America West jetliner approaching McCarran
International Airport was rocked by the blasts, said passenger John
Conrad, 62, of Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``We felt a little jolt. The second explosion looked like a
mini-atomic bomb,'' he said. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   There were no injuries aboard Flight 46, which originated in
Burbank, Calif.
   ``First we saw these very intense, hot flames. It didn't mean
much to us at first. We thought they were burning tires or
something. Then, there was another slight jolt,'' he said.
   Several large windows and sliding glass doors at the airport _
less than 10 miles from the blast site _ were shattered by the
explosion, and some ceiling tiles were knocked loose, said airport
spokesman Roy Clawson.
   Pacific worker Joe Hedrick, 30, said he heard a series of four
explosions over several minutes, with the fourth blast sounding the
most powerful.
   Hendrick, tearful and distraught, with cuts on his arms, said he
an two co-workers were assembling a pollution control device when
they heard a pop and the room filled with smoke.
   ``The smoke was so thick it could choke you. It smelled like
plastic,'' Hedrick said. The pop was followed by a blast that blew
metal and fiberglass wall panels off the building.
   Hedrick said he fled in his truck and was about 2 miles from the
plant when another explosion shattered the windshield.
   ``You've seen pictures of a nuclear detonation with a cloud that
runs across the ground. It looked like that,'' Hedrick said of the
final blast. ``The further we drove it seemed the blasts kept
coming.''
   The plant is in an isolated desert area on the western fringes
of Henderson, southeast of Las Vegas. The industrial complex dates
back to World War II when titanium was processed there.

   A House subcommittee has approved $100 million
for the $4.4 billion super conducting supercollider physics project
but barred use of the money for construction and equipment.
   ``We feel like the $100 million is adequate to hold the team
together, the scientists, and also to go ahead with the necessary
research and all the preliminaries ... getting ready for
construction,'' said Tom Bevill, D-Ala. and chairman of the House
appropriations subcommittee on energy. ``But we do not intend to
start construction on that and put this project on the credit
card.''
   The subcommittee's decision on Wednesday raised the proposed
spending from the $60 million it had initially approved for fiscal
1989, which begins Oct. 1. The higher appropriations level had the
backing of Democratic and Republican leaders in the House, Bevill
said.
   President Reagan had asked Congress to approve $363 million for
the project, which would use a 53-mile-round particle accelerator
to smash subatomic particles into each other. Physicists hope the
research will give insight into the basic structure of matter, but
also say the project will have practical spinoffs as well.
   Supporters argue the super collider is needed to keep the United
States competitive in the next century. Opponents say the project
would siphon much needed money from other scientific research.
   Seven states have been selected as potential sites for the
project: Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.
   ``Once we're down to a single site, it is going to be even
harder to find support for the funding,'' said Rep. Carl Pursell,
R-Mich. and the only subcommittee member from a super collider
state.
   Bevill said, ``This money is not to be used for purchasing
equipment or starting construction.''
   But Pursell disputed Bevill's contention, saying the use of the
money will depend on the legal language adopted by the full
Appropriations Committee.
   ``I have maintained anything over $80 million involves
construction,'' Pursell said.

   The state-run PAP news agency on Thursday
said action was taken to end a 10-day-old strike at the huge Lenin
steel mill in the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta, and an official in
Krakow said the strike had ended.
   PAP also warned employees to stay away from the Gdansk shipyard,
where striking workers, including Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
were occupying the facility. PAP quoted management as saying that
workers not participating in the strike will receive paid leaves of
absence until the strike was settled.
   ``There's no strike any longer,'' a switchboard operater at the
Lenin steelworks in Nowa Huta said at 8:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT).
She said no one from management was available to answer questions.
   ``I don't expect they (the striking workers) left themselves,''
said Bogdan Drej, the Krakow city spokemsan, confirming that the
steel mill strike had ended. ``So I assume they had to be helped to
leave.
   ``In the languages of press communiques, this means that forces
of order making use of available means, assured again the
possibility of normal operation of the combine.''
   An aide in the government press office in Warsaw said no one was
available to answer questions.
   PAP reported that ``actions were undertaken this morning aimed
to ensure normal functioning of all departments'' at the huge
plant. No more specific information was given in the dispatch.
   It said the strike had threatened ``the fundamental interests of
the society and national economy.'' Strikers had said about half
the 32,000 workers were on strike, the government had put the
number at a few thousand.
   Workers also were told to stay away from the shipyard in Gdansk
``until further notice,'' PAP said. About 7,000 workers at the
shipyard in the Baltic port went on strike Monday, the fourth
stoppage since April 25 in Poland's worst wave of labor unrest
since the 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity.
   Walesa, founder of the outlawed labor federation, spent
Wednesday night at the shipyard where he works as an electrician.
   ``Due to the existing situation which makes impsossible the
normal functioning of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, its activity is
being suspended until further notice,'' the management said in a
communique carried by PAP.
   ``The workers not striking will have paid leaves ensured for
this period. I appeal to all working on the first and second shifts
not to come to work starting today, May 5,'' it said.
   ``Management of the shipyard will choose and inform in a
separate notice workers indispensible for ensuring of the
appropriate equipment in the shipyard,'' the news agency said.
   The reported action in Nowa Huta came less than 24 hours after
government spokesman Jerzy Urban accused the strikers of
``terrorist'' tactics and threatened ``serious consequences.''
   Earlier today, the strike committee at Nowa Huta said it was
promised talks with management through the help of Roman Catholic
church mediators. Those talks were supposed to take place today.
   But strike leaders at the Gdansk shipyard said on Wednesday that
management had refused to church-mediated talks with its strike
committee.
   The strikers at both plants demanded higher wages, an
independent union, reinstatement of fired union activists and
release of political prisoners.
   On Wednesday, five independent Catholic intellectuals acting at
the church's request arrived at the striking shipyard and
steelworks to serve as mediators. The government would not say if
it had authorized the move.
   Also, Roman Catholic bishops urged authorities to find a common
ground with Poles by meeting with representative groups.
   Urban indicated authorities may crack down if the unrest
continues.
   ``We shall not allow any anarchy,'' he said Wednesday on
national radio and television. ``The two wildcat strikes have
degenerated, and I am warning, they may result in serious
consequences.''
   Urban said employees who tried to resume work at the Nowa Huta
steel mill were threatened by strikers armed with bottles. He said
that in the Gdansk shipyard, groups of strikers threatened
management and workers and pulled drivers from cars as they were
delivering materials around the yard.
   ``We are talking here about terrorist actions,'' Urban said.

<TEXT>
   A congressional report says the United States
never lodged an official protest with South Korea over evidence
that American-designed rifles built in Korea have been sold to
foreign countries in violation of a U.S.-Korean agreement.
   The General Accounting Office found there was little oversight
of the program and confusion over which government agency should be
in charge of the 1971 pact, which banned sales of the M-16 rifles
to foreign nations without U.S. permission and placed a cap on the
number South Korea could produce.
   ``Defense and State Department officials in various agencies and
locations told us that they were not responsible for managing the
program,'' said the report, which was obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press.
   When presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales, the State
Department usually instructed embassy officials to remind Korea of
the ``seriousness'' of such sales. A strong, official government
protest was never lodged, GAO said.
   The agreement included Colt Industries Firearms Division of
Hartford, Conn., which set up the Korean rifle plant in exchange
for per-weapon royalties.

   The average full professor at an American
college or university now earns $47,400, according to the American
Association of University Professors.
   The faculty group said Wednesday that its survey of 300,000
professors on 1,900 campuses showed salaries rose by 4.9 percent in
1987-88, compared to a 5.9 percent increase the year before.
   Across all faculty ranks _ including associate professors,
assistant professors, lecturers and instructors _ the average
salary was $37,000.
   The association, which conducts collective bargaining on some
campuses, said that after inflation, faculty salaries rose by just
0.9 percent.
   The association said faculty salaries vary widely by region,
with full professors averaging $52,510 on the West Coast and
Hawaii, and less than $42,000 in some Southern and Central states.
   Salaries rose 5.6 percent at private, independent colleges and
universities, compared with 4.7 percent at public and
church-related campuses.

   Two congressmen are trying to place a
legislative wall in front of a developer's plans to build a
shopping center next to a historic Civil War battlefield.
   A bill introduced Wednesday by Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., and
Michael Andrews, D-Texas, would direct the Interior Department to
purchase from a developer a 600-acre plot of land adjacent to the
Manassas National Battlefield Park, where two important Civil War
battles were fought.
   The congressmen say plans for a 1.2 million square-foot shopping
center would violate the battlefield site.
   ``We've come to this conclusion because both of us feel there's
no other choice,'' said Andrews. ``Both of us are convinced that
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping
mall.''
   The 3,800-acre Manassas battlefield, about 27 miles west of
Washington, was the site of the first significant land battle of
the Civil War in 1861.
   In a second, three-day battle in 1862, 24,000 Union and
Confederate casualties were recorded, as Union forces that had been
as far south as Richmond 60 days earlier were pushed back into the
nation's capital.

   A fierce challenge by Rep. Hal Daub has
Sen. David Karnes fighting for survival in next week's Republican
primary, and the victor has to face a popular Democratic
ex-governor in the main event.
   Democratic state chairman Tom Monaghan says he hopes the GOP
rivals wake up after the voting ``bloodied and broke.''
   Whoever wins Tuesday's GOP showdown will have to face former
Gov. Bob Kerrey, 44, who's expected to easily beat his Democratic
primary opponent, Ken Michaelis, a 45-year-old disbarred lawyer
from West Point, Neb.
   The GOP race is a dead heat, according to an Omaha World-Herald
poll taken last week. Karnes was backed by 41 percent, Daub by 40
percent and 19 percent said they were undecided. The margin of
error was 4 percentage points.
   The same poll found Kerrey leading either Daub or Karnes by more
than 20 percentage points.
   Karnes, 39, is in the unusual position of being an incumbent
facing a tough bid for nomination. He was appointed by Republican
Gov. Kay Orr in March 1987 to fill the unexpired term of the late
Sen. Ed Zorinsky, a Democrat.
   In announcing his appointment, Mrs. Orr said Karnes was the best
man for the job. Critics said Mrs. Orr chose Karnes because he
wouldn't threaten her status in the state party. She is a personal
friend of President Reagan and co-chair of the GOP National
Platform Committee.
   Karnes was a virtual unknown, but Daub was among the GOP
regulars who sought the seat. Karnes had headed Mrs. Orr's
successful 1986 gubernatorial effort in Omaha-dominated Douglas
County, a traditional Democratic stronghold.
   Daub, 47, a four-term congressman from the Omaha-dominated 2nd
District, took the offensive several weeks ago.
   At first, the opponents bickered about voting records. Each
accused the other of voting directly or indirectly for tax
increases. Each effectively said the other was lying without using
the word liar.
   Daub has more recently charged that Karnes wouldn't fight for
water projects in Nebraska.
   Karnes says the tape recording of his statement during a debate
made clear that he supported already planned projects, but that
water officials ``recognize that in the future we will not be able
to start any new projects.''
   Daub responded with a TV commercial using Karnes' statement,
contrasting it with a picture of cattle in a dry pasture and an
announcer saying: ``Frightening as it it may seem, a vote for Dave
Karnes is a vote to cut off your own water.''
   Those would be fighting words in the huge 3rd Congressional
District where cattle and crops are what counts and water is the
equivalent of liquid gold to many.
   Daub clearly annoyed seven-term Republican Rep. Virginia Smith,
who represents the 3rd District, when he claimed credit for shaking
loose federal money for a pending water project.
   While saying she wasn't endorsing Karnes, Mrs. Smith promptly
announced that it was she and Karnes _ not Daub _ who had done the
work on the project then made a campaign appearance with the
senator.
   Even implied support from Mrs. Smith is important because her
popularity in the mostly Republican district, which includes 62 of
the state's 93 counties. She usually wins it with pluralities of
tens of thousands of votes.

<DATELINE>MAHOMET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Paul Simon says he is virtually
certain Michael Dukakis will win the Democratic presidential
nomination but refuses to release his delegates ``in the unlikely
event that Michael Dukakis stubs his toe between now and the
convention.''
   The Illinois senator, who put his presidential campaign on hold
a month ago, said he would not surrender about 184 delegates
committed to his campaign despite pressure to do so by supporters
of Jesse Jackson.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer and some black lawmakers have urged
Simon to officially drop out of the presidential race. Jackson, who
finished second to Simon in the Illinois primary, would then
inherit the bulk of the state's delegates.
   ``I'm going to hold out until the California and New Jersey
primaries on June 7 and see whether I can still have an influence
on the nomination,'' Simon said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Ohio Dems Remain Neutral After Dukakis Primary Win</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis' landslide victory in
Ohio's Democratic presidential primary did not alter the neutral
stance of Gov. Richard Celeste or the state Democratic party,
officials said.
   ``Jesse Jackson wants it to continue, and that's OK with me. It
keeps the interest up, and that's good for the party,'' Ohio
Democratic Chairman James Ruvolo said Wednesday.
   Celeste said essentially the same through an aide, Heidi
Findley, who added told a reporter the governor ``wants to take a
united party to the convention.''
   On Tuesday night, after Dukakis had defeated the Rev. Jesse
Jackson with 63 percent of the vote to Jackson's 28 percent,
Celeste said he did not think the question of an endorsement is
important at this point.

   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum says she is not
interested in becoming vice president and doubts she would offer
the right balance to a Republican ticket headed by George Bush.
   ``I'm not interested,'' the Kansas Republican said in an
interview with KTKA-TV on Wednesday.
   ``I think anybody who is a politician and a woman would be
interested, but I have always enjoyed the legislative part of the
job,'' she said in the interview that will be aired Saturday. ``I
don't anticipate I will be offered the job and, in all honesty, I
don't think I'm the right balance for George Bush.''
   Mrs. Kassebaum toured California last weekend campaigning for
the re-election of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and was greeted with
Bush-Kassebaum stickers.
   But she told an interviewer, ``There are 50 or so people you see
listed, and there is a bumper sticker in Washington somewhere that
says, `Honk if George Bush has asked you to be vice president.''

   Here is a summary of the status of the amnesty program for
undocumented aliens:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEADLINE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The amnesty application period, which began May 5, 1987, ended
at midnight Wednesday.
   The deadline does not apply to aliens applying for legal status
under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker provision of the immigration
reform act. They have until Nov. 30.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ELIGIBILITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Illegal aliens who have lived in the United States since before
Jan. 1, 1982, were eligible.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PROCEDURES FOR APPLICATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Applicants had to submit a four-page application and provide
documentation such as utility bills, pay stubs, rent receipts or
school records to prove eligibility. Those who filed were allowed
to request up to 60 days for submitting required documents.
   Physical examinations, photographs and fingerprints also were
required.
   If a computer search turns up no history of illegal behavior,
the applicant receives his temporary residency card. He must later
apply for permanent legal residency. He can ultimately apply for
citizenship.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FEES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Application cost $185 a person and $50 per child with a limit of
$420 per family.
   In addition, applicants were urged to get help filling out their
applications. Cost varies with lawyers and volunteer organizations.
   Applicants also had to pay for identification photos, physicals
and fingerprinting.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUMBER OF APPLICANTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As of Monday, 1.4 million applications had been received, and
475,000 people sought legal status under the program for seasonal
agricultural workers, the INS said.
   The federal government estimated last year that from 1 million
to 3.9 million of the nation's estimated 6 million illegal aliens
would apply for amnesty.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENFORCEMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government will shift emphasis to employers now that the
amnesty program has ended. The immigration reform act mandates
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers.
   Starting June 1, the INS has the discretion to issue warning
citations or fine employers who violate the law.

   Ten French hostages have been released since June
20, 1986, including three freed by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad on
Wednesday.
   Hostage negotiations, shrouded in official secrecy, have been
the subject on speculation in the press. Previous deals reportedly
have involved payment on the $1 billion loan owed to Iran and the
expulsion from France of Iranian exiles opposing Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   Here is a chronology of major events involving French hostages
since 1986:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1986</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   June 7 _ Three months after conservative Premier Jacques Chirac
took office and announced efforts to improve relations with Iran,
the chief of the Iranian opposition Mujahedeen leaves France for
Iraq.
   June 20 _ Two journalists with the television network Antenne 2
_ Philippe Rochot, 40, and Georges Hansen, 46 _ are freed in Beirut
by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Revolutionary Justice Organization
after 105 days of captivity.
   Nov. 11 _ Marcel Coudari, 54, and Camille Sontag, 84, are freed
by the Revolutionary Justice Organization. Coudari was abducted in
Beirut in February 1986. Sontag was kidapped May 7, 1986.
   Nov. 17 _ France and Iran sign an accord for a partial
reimbursement of $330 million on a $1 billion loan owed to Iran.
   Dec. 24 _ Aurel Cornea, 54, soundman for Antenne 2, is freed by

   Nov. 29 _ France allows Wahid Gordji, an employee at the Iranian
Embassy, to leave the country. Gordji, wanted for questioning in
connection with terrorist bombings in Paris in 1985, had been
hiding in the embassy since June 29.
   On July 17, France broke diplomatic relations with Iran over the
Gordji affair.
   France denied reports of ransom and of arms sales to Iran, but
said Iran's influence leading to the hostage release made other
actions possible. It did not specify what they were.

<HEAD>Speedy Prenatal Testing Method Could Soon Become More Widely

<TEXT>
   A new method of determining chromosome
abnormalities in a fetus as early as the eighth week of pregnancy
may soon become much more widely available, following a government
study that shows it is safe and accurate, a researcher says.
   The technique is called chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, and
can make an early identification of Down's syndrome and other birth
defects. It is now restricted by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to use by researchers on an experimental basis,
because the device used to obtain the sample is not approved for
routine use.
   Because of the success of the nationwide study, however, the FDA
may decide to revise its restrictions and CVS may soon become much
more widely available, said one of the study's principal
investigators, Dr. Laird Jackson of Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia. Jackson presented the findings in Boston at the
annual meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.
   He predicted that CVS might one day largely replace
amniocentesis, the current method of obtaining genetic information
on a fetus.
   CVS has been performed in the United States since 1983, but the
government study is the first to carefully assess its safety and
accuracy, said Dr. George Rhoads of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, which coordinated the research.
   ``We're encouraged,'' Rhoads said Wednesday in an interview.
``This was a diagnostic technique which is being used in the
community, and we wanted to assess its safety and accuracy so women
could make more informed decisions.''
   In amniocentesis, a small sample of the amniotic fluid that
bathes the fetus is withdrawn. Fetal cells that have drifted into
the amniotic fluid are extracted and analyzed for chromosome
abnormalities.
   That cannot be done until about the 16th week of pregnancy, when
enough amniotic fluid has been produced to allow some to be removed.
   In chorionic villus sampling, doctors snip off a tiny piece of
chorionic villus tissue, which grows from an enveloping membrane
that eventually gives rise to the placenta. The chorionic villus
tissue, while not part of the fetus, is genetically identical to
it. So it will reveal any chromosome abnormalities carried by the
fetus.
   CVS can be done at seven to nine weeks into the pregnancy. That
allows mothers who choose to terminate their pregnancies to do so
during the first trimester, when abortion is safer and simpler.
   CVS, like amniocentesis, is designed primarily to reveal
chromosome abnormalities, the most common of which is Down's
syndrome. Certain other genetic disorders can be identified, but
many birth defects and inherited diseases cannot be detected by any
test.
   The study was initiated partly to address the question of
whether CVS would increase the risk of miscarriage, which is known
to be very small with amniocentesis.
   The study compared 2,278 women who received CVS and 671 who
received amniocentesis. It found that 2 percent of those who
received CVS miscarried versus 1.3 percent for the others.
   Rhoads said that those numbers are not precise, and the
difference in risk could actually range from slightly higher than
that to no difference at all.
   The risk of amniocentesis is very low, so even a slight increase
in the risk of CVS could represent a doubling of the miscarriage
risk, Rhoads said.
   ``That's not very much risk, but there's a little evidence that
amniocentesis is safer,'' he said.
   Jackson said that if there is a slight increase in risk, it
reflects the fact that not all doctors in the study were equally
experienced at performing the procedure. Among those who had the
most experience doing CVS, the risk was virtually identical to the
risk associated with amniocentesis, he said.
   ``I think that's a goal any prenatal unit can achieve,'' Jackson
said in an interview. ``The key in there is `with good experience,'
'' he said. ``It has to be something they do every week.''

<HEAD>Sunlight May Trigger AIDS Virus Reproduction, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunlight may make a dormant AIDS virus start to
reproduce itself by activating a genetic trigger, scientists
reported today.
   The results of new test-tube experiments do not necessarily mean
people infected with the AIDS virus should stay out of the sun,
scientists stressed.
   But ``I certainly wouldn't tell somebody who had the virus or is
seropositive (possibly infected) to go sit in one of these
ultraviolet (tanning) spas,'' said Martin Rosenberg of Smith Kline
& French Laboratories.
   Rosenberg and Smith Kline colleagues from King of Prussia, Pa.,
and Belgium report their work in the British journal Nature.
   They found that the virus grew faster in cells that had been
exposed to ultraviolet light, a component of sunlight, and that
exposing infected cells to ultraviolet light or sunlight activated
a genetic trigger that controls virus reproduction.
   Since ultraviolet light damages a cell's genetic material, the
work suggests that a dormant AIDS virus recognizes when an infected
cell is under stress, said Rosenberg.
   Cells under attack are ``no longer a nice place to be latent,''
so the virus reproduces and spreads elsewhere, he said.
   After the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome
has infected a cell, it can lie dormant for long periods before it
begins to reproduce itself and spread to other cells.
   Scientists are trying to understand just what triggers a latent
virus to start reproducing itself, in hopes of finding ways to keep
it dormant.
   While most cells infected by the AIDS virus are deep within the
body, shielded from sunlight and its ultraviolet light, the virus
has been found in cells called Langerhans cells that reside in the
skin.
   But so little is known about that kind of infection that the
possible effect of sunlight is not exactly clear, Rosenberg said in
an interview.
   Scientists do not know how often Langerhans cells are infected
or whether the virus spreads from there to elsewhere in the body,
he said.
   Donald Belsito, associate professor of dermatology at New York
University, said he knows of no experiments that show how much
ultraviolet light reaches Langerhans cells. The minimum dose that
produced an effect in the new experiments ``could reasonably be
expected from natural sunlight exposure to reach the Langerhans
cells,'' he said.
   But AIDS researcher William Haseltine of Harvard's Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute said more studies will be needed to determine any
effect of sunlight on infected people.
   ``It is far too early to draw any conclusions that would affect
behavior,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I don't think at
this point people should be overly concerned that sunlight
represents a substantial risk.''
   In one of the new experiments, scientists exposed blood cells
called T-cells to ultraviolet light before infecting them with the
AIDS virus. They found evidence of viral reproduction four to five
days after infection in the exposed cells, significantly earlier
than the seven to eight days required for untreated cells.
   Other experiments focused on a segment of genetic material
called the long terminal repeat, which regulates reproduction of
the AIDS virus. Through genetic engineering, researchers inserted
the segment into an experimental cell line.
   After the cells were exposed to ultravolet light, the segment
showed up to 150 times as much activity as it did when light was
not used, researchers reported. Activity was first detected two to
four hours after irradiation, reaching a peak 20 to 24 hours later.
   The scientists also exposed the experimental cells to ordinary
sunlight, finding that a half-hour of exposure produced a 12-fold
increase in activity. Even 10 minutes was enough to cause a small
increase, they said.

   Scientists say certain chemicals viewed
as potential antidrunkenness drugs reversed anesthesia in tadpoles
and rats and could lead to safer anesthetics and new medicines to
save lives and money in hospital recovery rooms.
   The researchers also said their studies are starting to solve a
140-year-old mystery: how general anesthetics act on the brain to
cause unconsciousness, insensitivity to pain and memory loss.
   ``If we understand how anesthetics work, then we can develop
anesthetics that are less toxic and safer'' but act on the same
drug ``receptors'' on nerve cells in the brain, said Dr. Leonard
Firestone, assistant professor of anesthesiology at the University
of Pittsburgh.
   In addition, ``studies like these may lead to (development of
safer) drugs that reverse anesthesia'' and prevent some of the
deaths of surgery patients.
   Firestone and Debra Yourick, a University of Kansas
pharmacologist-toxicologist, presented their findings Wednesday
during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies
for Experimental Biology.
   Yourick and the Kansas team led by Richard Tessel anesthetized
rats and flipped them on their backs ``like limp dishrags,'' Tessel
said. Rats that were then given a chemical called beta-CCE regained
consciousness and got up on all fours after only 19 minutes, while
other rats took 60 minutes to recover.
   Firestone knocked out tadpoles with a variety of anesthetics,
and found it took much longer for them to pass out if he first gave
them a drug known as Ro15-4513.
   In 1986, government scientists raised hopes for eventual
development of an antidrunkenness drug when they published studies
showing that when drunken rats were given Ro15-4513, the drug
blocked the effect of alcohol on the brain, allowing the rats to
behave in a sober manner even though they still had high
blood-alcohol levels.
   But the drug can cause potentially fatal seizures and has other
drawbacks, so similar drugs must be developed to treat chronic
alcoholics and to make anesthetized surgery patients regain
consciousness more quickly, said Dr. Steven Paul, clinical
neurosciences chief at the National Institute of Mental Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   Beta-CCE and Ro15-4513 were developed to help scientists learn
how anesthetics work. The Kansas and Pittsburgh studies and similar
research by Paul and his colleagues found that the drugs reverse
anesthesia by attaching to a certain type of receptor on nerve
cells in the brain.
   Sedatives named benzodiazepines, including Valium and Librium,
bind to the same receptors to calm the transmission of nerve
impulses. Anesthetics attach to the same receptors to cause
unconsciousness and memory loss, although pain insensitivity may be
produced by another reaction, Tessel said.
   Beta-CCE and Ro15-4513 also bind to the same receptors,
suggesting they reverse anesthesia by replacing the anesthetics on
those receptors.
   Yourick and Tessel said that differs from the traditional theory
that anesthetics work by disrupting nerve cell membranes rather
than by attaching to a particular target or receptor.
   If similar, safer anti-anesthetics can be developed, ``we could
administer one of these agents and speed their (surgery patients')
recovery from anesthesia and save lives,'' Yourick said.
   ``Every single patient who gets general anesthesia could benefit
from having their unconsciousness reversed'' as soon as surgery
ends, because unconscious patients are more likely to stop
breathing, vomit into their lungs or die from other problems,
Firestone said.
   ``Time in the recovery room is very costly,'' so drugs to
reverse anesthesia quickly also would save patients money, said
Donald Miller, a co-author of the Kansas study.

   Widespread arrests in the Palestinian uprising
have crowded Israel's prisons with nearly 5,000 new inmates and
raised accusations that suspects are held unlawfully, humiliated
and sometimes beaten.
   At least 1,700 of the inmates have been sentenced to up to six
months in jail without specific charges or an appearance before a
judge. This is done under emergency laws still in use 43 years
after they were imposed by Britain during its mandate over
Palestine.
   Israel has opened or converted five prison camps to house the
burgeoning inmate population, nearly double the 5,000 Palestinians
jailed before the protests began Dec. 8 against Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Lawyers and civil rights advocates say facilities still are
overcrowded and that toilets, drinking water, showers and other
amenities are in short supply.
   ``The number arrested is just way beyond anything anybody had
planned for,'' said Joshua Schoffman of the Association for Civil
Rights, an organization similar to the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Felicia Langer, an Israeli lawyer who defends Palestinian
clients, said so many people have been arrested that inmates are
referred to not by their names but only by numbers assigned to them
at the time of arrest.
   ``They are calling them according to their numbers. They have no
names,'' she said. ``They announce, `No. 70 is imprisoned for six
months, No. 30 is imprisoned.'''
   Israeli army officials have said every effort is made to treat
prisoners with dignity.
   A army spokeswoman, who cannot be identified under law, said
every charge of mistreatment is investigated and ``most complaints
are found to be baseless.'' She said she could not give specific
figures.
   Schoffman said civil rights association lawyers who visited two
camps found ``serious overcrowding'' and lack of basic facilities
but no evidence of beatings. But he added that the lawyers were not
allowed to see areas of camps where suspects are interrogated.
   Mona Rishmawi, a Palestinian lawyer trained in Egypt, maintained
that beating takes place regularly during interrogation. She and
Ms. Langer charged that the Dahariya prison camp in the West Bank
is notorious for beatings.
   Salim Al-Bus, a 19-year-old Palestinian, told an Arab reporter
that he was beaten at Dahariya in late March after refusing to
curse PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Al-Bus said he was released after
18 days, the time a prisoner can be held by law before he must be
charged or put under administrative detention.
   Reporters have seen arrested Palestinians ordered to stand for
hours with their heads bowed or heads leaning against a wall.
   Ms. Rishmawi said prisoners that she visited in Dahariya were
forced to stand bowed before prison guards.
   ``Humiliation is the rule. It's unbelievable,'' she said.
   In most cases, Palestinian prisoners are kept in tents
surrounded by fences or barbed wire. Ketziot, in Israel's Negev
Desert, and Dahariya have just been put up to house Palestinian
prisoners, and three other prisons have been expanded or converted
for the purpose.
   Many of the prisoners are youths arrested for stone throwing,
but Palestinian lawyers and doctors also are among those jailed.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post reported recently that the
army moved prisoners under age 16 to separate facilities after a
12-year-old inmate was sexually abused by other prisoners.
   The army will not discuss the numbers of arrests, but Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Cabinet in late April that 4,900
Palestinians were being held and 1,700 were under administrative
detention. The Jerusalem Post reported on April 29 that 8,000
Palestinians had been arrested since December.
   Some of the inmates were sentenced in proceedings where as many
as 50 people were tried at one time.
   Mrs. Langer suggested the number of detainees also was growing
because the army canceled regulations requiring that administrative
detention orders _ issued by three regional commanders _ be
reviewed by military judges within 36 hours.
   ``They have returned to the original, infamous regulations of
1945,'' Mrs. Langer said, referring to British orders that Jewish
settlers condemned as harsh and inhuman in the years before the
State of Israel was established in 1948.
   Two court cases have been filed against the government, and both
are now before the Supreme Court. One challenges the emergency laws
and the other maintains that transfer of prisoners from occupied
territories to prisons inside Israel violates international law.
   But lawyers complained that it's difficult to pursue individual
cases, despite procedures for appeal to a military tribunal and
Israeli courts, because no specific charges are announced.
   ``Evidence is submitted in secret. Charges are submitted in
secret. How can you appeal?'' asked Ms. Rishmawi.

<HEAD>Norwegian Heavy Water Intended For West Germany Disappears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said 15 tons of Norwegian
``heavy water,'' which can be used in nuclear reactors and in
making nuclear weapons, was illegally diverted in 1983 to an
unknown destination.
   The Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that its investigation
had confirmed media reports that the shipment, intended for a West
German firm, did not reach its licensed destination of Frankfurt.
   The Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang reported April 21 that the heavy
water was flown on a Liberian-registered West African Airlines
plane via Basel, Switzerland, to Dubai, then probably to a nuclear
reactor in Bombay, India.
   Norway does not allow the export of heavy water to countries
that have not signed the international nuclear non-prolification
agreement, including India.
   The ministry said it had so far determined only that the heavy
water was sent by air freight to Basel.
   ``The prosecuting authority will be requested to start
investigations in Norway. Via diplomatic channels West Germany will
be asked to to do the same in order to reveal possible punishable
offenses,'' the ministry said.
   It said the heavy water was sold by Norsk Hydro, Norway's only
producer of heavy water, to the West German firm Rohstoff Einfuhr
of Duesseldorf. The ministry said the firm had stated that the
heavy water was for scientific use in West Germany.
   ``Norsk Hydro and Norwegian authorities may have been tricked by
Rohstoff Einfuhr, a company owned by Alfred Hempel, a former World
War II Wehrmacht officer,'' the Verdens Gang report said.
   It quoted spokesman Helmut Swien of Alfred Hempel of
Duesseldorf, the parent company of Rohstoff Einfuhr, as saying:
``You must understand that I cannot tell you who our customers are
because of business reasons.''
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used as a coolant in some
nuclear reactors, but it can also be used to produce plutonium for
use in nuclear arms. India has several nuclear reactors that use
heavy water.

<HEAD>Study Links Cancer Virus With Nervous System Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious paralyzing disease that occurs in
tropical climates may be caused by a virus that also triggers a
rare form of blood cancer, according to a report today.
   The virus, first isolated in 1980, is called human T-cell
lymphoma-leukemia virus Type 1, or HTLV-I. It causes cancer of a
variety of white blood cells known as T cells.
   Recently, doctors have found that people with a mysterious
disease called chronic progressive myelopathy, or tropical spastic
paraparesis, sometimes show signs in their blood of infection with
HTLV-I.
   In the latest study, doctors found direct evidence of the virus
in these people, strengthening the suspicion that HTLV-I can be one
cause of the disease.
   ``HTLV-I appears to be causally associated with many cases of
otherwise unexplained myelopathy in patients from the tropics,''
they wrote.
   The research was directed by Dr. Satyakam Bhagavati of the State
University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn. It was
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Health experts say HTLV-I is spreading among drug addicts in the
United States. Surveys estimate that about two of every 10,000
units of blood used for transfusions contain the virus. Blood bank
officials have said they will start checking donations for the
virus when screening tests are available.
   Clusters of chronic progressive myelopathy occur in tropical
parts of the world, including the Caribbean, where the virus is
also relatively common. The disease results in weakness, numbness
and gradual paralysis of the legs.
   In their study, doctors found direct evidence of the virus in 12
patients who also had antibodies to HTLV-I.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Bruce J. Brew and Richard W.
Price of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York said
it's puzzling why the disease is rare even where the virus is
widespread.
   Even though there are other examples of low disease rates from
common viruses, they wrote, ``it nonetheless raises the question of
what other factors contribute to the development of the disease.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Vow Retrial After Judges Declares Mistrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors plan to push for a new trial of
extremist Lyndon LaRouche and his associates in a federal
conspiracy case that continued for four months until a judge
declared a mistrial.
   ``We will press for a new trial and we will get this case to a
verdict,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said after District
Judge Robert Keeton's decision Wednesday.
   LaRouche, six aides and five affiliated organizations are
charged with raising money for LaRouche's 1984 presidential
campaign through credit card and loan fraud and with conspiring to
stymie a grand jury investigation of the alleged fraud.
   The slow-moving trial began in December. Among other twists,
defense lawyers charged the government with deliberately
withholding information, including a memo in which two key figures
in the Iran-Contra scandal discussed alleged infiltration of
LaRouche groups.
   Keeton excused four jurors who complained about the length and
conduct of the case, forcing him to call a mistrial.
   ``I find that it is clear that these four jurors will be unable
to continue to serve as fair and impartial jurors after mid-July,''
Keeton said. ``There is not the slightest possibility that we will
complete this trial in that time.''
   The judge had to declare a mistrial because there were only 10
jurors remaining and court rules require at least 12 unless both
sides agree to continue with fewer. Defense lawyers refused to do
so.
   In a statement, LaRouche charged the dismissal was caused by a
two-month delay for hearings on whether prosecutors deliberately
withheld information.
   ``The delays which led to the dismissal of the jury were caused
by substantial acts of misconduct by the government, including
withholding of information and the manufacturing of evidence,''
LaRouche said.
   ``And the delays were caused by the need to have hearings on the
issue of government misconduct.''
   LaRouche, who has accused some Western leaders of being Soviet
spies, says the charges against him were organized by the Reagan
administration because he refused to support aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras.
   He is charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with
investigators. All six aides and the five organizations also are
charged with conspiracy, and four of the groups are charged with
fraud.
   Three other LaRouche aides named in the indictment were granted
later trials and three are fugitives.
   Keeton criticized both sides for giving ``grossly wrong''
estimates of how long the trial would last.
   He also said ``aggressive behavior'' by defense lawyers in the
presence of the jury was a factor in his declaring a mistrial, a
comment that likely will be at the center of the government's
response to defense arguments.
   Defense lawyers sought to have five jurors excused because of
their complaints. Keeton, over the objections of Markham, excused
four.
   If Keeton orders a new trial, defense lawyer said they would
appeal to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Attorneys for both
sides said the earliest a new trial could begin would be in the
fall.
   The prosecutor was beginning the portion of the case focusing on
the alleged conspiracy to obstruct justice when Keeton ordered
hearings into possible government misconduct and infiltration of
LaRouche groups.
   During those proceedings the government declassified a memo in
which retired Air Force Maj. Richard Secord told then-National
Security Council aide Oliver North about an associate's efforts to
``get info against LaRouche.''
   A search of FBI files based on that disclosure led to the
discovery of another classified document in which three
intelligence operatives said top level CIA and FBI officials had
asked them to infiltrate LaRouche groups.
   LaRouche presidential campaign spokesman Dana Scanlon said a
LaRouche organization called the Constitutional Defense Fund had
spent more than $2 million in legal fees and some administrative
costs on the Boston case.
   Although she did not have figures for March through the first
week of May, Scanlon said the fund's costs had averaged almost
$200,000 in January and February.
   Markham declined comment on the government's costs and referred
a caller to U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara Jr., who could not be
reached after office hours Wednesday.

<HEAD>Reports: Brawley Seen At Party; Had Run Away Before</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black teen-ager had run away from home at
least twice before she disappeared last November, and was seen at a
party during the period she claims she was abducted and raped by a
group of whites, according to news reports.
   When Tawana Brawley was 13 and 14 years old she caused frantic
family searches _ and beatings when she was found _ by staying away
from home at least 24 hours, the Daily News reported today, quoting
her friends and their parents.
   Wednesday night, WCBS-TV reported that Miss Brawley, 16, was
seen at a birthday party in Newburgh on Nov. 27, three days after
she disappeared and one day before she was found behind an
apartment complex where she used to live.
   Miss Brawley was found huddled in a trash bag with racial slurs
scrawled on her torso and feces smeared on her body. She has said
she was a victim of a sexual and racial assault involving up to six
white men, one of whom flashed a police-like badge. She has since
refused to tell her story to a state grand jury investigating the
case.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor for the
case, issued a statement saying: ``All aspects of this case,
including reports that Tawana Brawley may have been seen in
Newburgh, are under continuing investigation.''
   According to the News, the first runaway incident allegedly
occured when Tawana was 13. She spent the night with a teen-age boy
watching television, the newspaper said. When Brawley's mother and
aunt tracked her down the next day she first hid from them and then
tried to flee, the News said.
   In the second incident, in April 1986, Miss Brawley left school
on a Friday afternoon and spent two days in Beacon, smoking
marijuana, drinking beer and partying with a girlfriend and two
men, the report said.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, tracked her down at the house of
the teen-ager and smacked her repeatedly with her fists, the report
said.
   Neither disappearance was reported to police.
   The News said Mrs. Brawley could not be reached to comment on
the report, but the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has advised Miss Brawley
not to cooperate with the officials investigating her case, said he
could not confirm the reports.
   ``If anything, it says Tawana came from a family who cared. And
if she got out of line, they attempted to take care of it,'' he
said.
   Sharpton, who said he watched the WCBS-TV report with the
Brawley family in Wappingers Falls, said he and family attorneys
Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason planned to hold a news
conference today to comment on the reports.
   In the WCBS-TV report, a witness who was not identified, and
spoke on camera with his face concealed, said he knew Miss Brawley,
saw her at the party and talked to her there.
   He also said that during part of the four-day period when Miss
Brawley claimed she was held captive she spent time with ``a former
boyfriend'' and ``drug dealer,'' identified by WCBS-TV as Jason
``Chico'' Colon.
   Several newspapers have quoted other friends of Miss Brawley as
saying they thought her claims of sexual abuse and racial assault
were exaggerated or untrue.

<HEAD>Big Explosion, Fire At Oil Refinery</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout; No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NORCO, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge explosion ripped through the Shell Oil
Co. refinery early today, breaking windows 20 miles away in New
Orleans and igniting a fire that could be seen for miles, civil
defense officials said.
   At least three people were injured, one of them critically, a
hospital official said.
   ``It is a serious thing, but we don't know anything much about
it yet,'' said Raymond Barvaro at the St. Charles Sheriff's
department.
   Shell officials reported the fire was under control, indicating
there was no danger of further explosion although the fire
continued to rage at the refinery on the Misssissippi River, the
sheriff's operations center said.
   The blast about 4 a.m. rocked the New Orleans metropolitan area,
shaking buildings, setting off burglar alarms and awakening people.
The shock broke windows in New Orleans and the fire's glow was
visible in downtown New Orleans.
   Two people were taken by helicopter to West Jefferson Medical
Center in New Orleans, one in critical condition with burns over 80
percent of his body, the other in guarded condition with cuts and
other injuries, officials said.
   Nursing supervisor Beverly Trahan said the helicopter returned
to the refinery where there were reports of another person with
burns.
   An evacuation center was set up at Destrehan High School, but
Jules Hymel, assistant director of civil defense for St. Charles
Parish, said it was voluntary and that no one was forced to leave
home.
   Hymel said the explosion was in a catalytic cracker, which
separates crude oil in various grades for the refining process.
   Two state police hazardous materials specialists were called to
the scene, but there were no reports of toxic fumes.
   Tim Vial, spokesman for the operations center, said said the
fire was under control.

   The U.S. dollar traded lower against major foreign
currencies in Europe this morning. Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers said there was little trading in dollars, as
most activity focused on trading among European currencies.
   ``Dollar trading is very slow and dull,'' said one dealer in
Rome.
   ``We have seen phases like this before, where the dollar is in a
state of equilibrium and neither side sees an imbalance that has to
be corrected,'' said a dealer at a large West German bank.
   Interest could pick up Friday, they said, when U.S. employment
figures for April are scheduled to be released.
   In London, the dollar was quoted at 124.51 yen, compared with
124.95 late Wednesday. Banks and other financial institutions were
closed in Japan because of the Children's Day national holiday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6796
   _1.3955 Swiss francs, down from 1.4000
   _5.7030 French francs, down from 5.7075
   _1.8796 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8840
   _1,248.80 Italian lire, down from 1,250.50
   _1.2340 Canadian dollar, down from 1.2353
   One British pound cost 1.8650 in London this morning, unchanged
from late Wednesday.
   Gold prices rose in sluggish trading. One trader said the
bullion market lacks direction because the dollar is virtually
motionless and because the Tokyo market is closed.
   The metal opened in London at a bid price of $444.50 a troy
ounce, little changed from late Wednesday's $444. At midmorning
today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended
price of $445.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $445.20, up from $443.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.36 to close at a bid $447.07.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.35 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   In a pair of mountaineering firsts,
multinational climbing teams scaled Mount Everest simultaneously
from two directions today and made a live television broadcast from
atop the world's highest mountain.
   Signals relayed via satellite from a small video camera attached
to the helmet of Japanese climber Susumu Nakamura showed a
panoramic view of the deep blue sky and rough, snow-covered terrain
at the top of the world.
   Gasping from the thin air and with frost on their eyebrows, 10
climbers from Nepal, China and Japan in bright red, blue and yellow
mountaineering gear congratulated each other. They erected on the
summit a string of brightly colored banners during the live
broadcast, monitored in Tokyo.
   Nakamura's specially-made camera is so full of sensitive
equipment that, if abandoned on the Chinese side of the mountain,
it could be viewed as a violation of Western laws governing the
transfer of high technology to communist nations, said Hiroshi
Yamazaki of Japan's Nihon Television Corp., or NTV, which paid most
of the expedition's $12.5 million bill.
   NBC News Sunrise, monitored in New York, began its 6 a.m. EDT
show with footage of the climbers celebrating at the summit.
Chinese television also broadcast part of the climb. The live
broadcast was the longest ever in China.
   The expedition, involving more than 200 people from Japan, Nepal
and China, is the largest assault ever on Everest. One member of
the Japanese team, Hidetaka Mizukoshi, died of heart failure during
the climb.
   Climbing began last month to celebrate the 35th anniversary of
the first Everest conquest by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and
Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay. More than 192 people have since scaled
the 29,028-foot mountain, with 13 climbing more than once.
   In this climb, however, members of two teams met at the summit
after climbing simultaneously from the mountain's north face in
China and the south face in Nepal, the first such rendezvous in
history.
   ``This is the greatest event in the history of climbing,'' said
Kunga Sherpa, leader of one of the Nepalese base camp setups.
   On the summit, a cameraman asked one of the Japanese climbers
how he felt, and he gaspingly replied: ``I feel great!''
   NTV is Japan's largest commercial network and it, too, is
celebrating its 35th anniversary.
   As seen in Japan, the broadcast was one technical blitz after
another.
   Aside from the broadcast at the summit, the NTV producers were
able to switch their broadcasts from the base camp on the south
side of the mountain to the north side.
   And at one point, a Japanese broadcaster held up a document that
had been received in a base camp by facsimile transmission from
Tokyo. Relatives of the climbers were in the NTV studio in Tokyo
and were able to speak directly to the climbers atop the mountain.
   During an earlier live broadcast, Chinese television showed
members of the two teams approaching the peak from the south and
north painstakingly making their way toward the summit.
   The Chinese broadcast said Tibetan climber Cering Doje and
Nepal's Ang Lhakpa Sherpa, the first climbers to reach the summit,
waited along with Noboru Yamada of Japan in a small hut for others
to arrive.
   ``This is an exciting moment. The motherland thanks you. The
Chinese people thank you,'' the Chinese newscaster said. Senior
leader Deng Xiaopeng called the television station to congratulate
the ``great pioneers'' of all three countries.
   The 10 climbers at the top then filled small bottles with

climbers who have died in previous attempts.
   Soon after, the 10 were shown beginning their descent to try
another first _three climbers who reached the summit from the north
will descend southward and three who came from the south will
descend to the north.

   Police detained more than 25
opposition leaders who had gathered to support workers on a hunger
strike and held them for about two hours, a spokesman for the
opposition parties said.
   A rally planned for Wednesday in support of the striking workers
did not take place. Demonstrations in Nicaragua are banned unless
they have government approval.
   Authorities told the leaders only that the police action was
``to frustrate an attempt to violate the laws of the country,''
Jaime Bonilla of the Independent Liberal Party said.
   The Interior Ministry on Tuesday barred the privately owned
Radio Mundial and the Roman Catholic station Radio Catolica from
broadcasting news for eight days. It also closed Radio Corporacion
for 24 hours for airing ``false news'' about the strike.
   Leaders from 14 opposition parties, ranging from the Communists
to the rightist Social Christians, had gathered at the office of
the Social Democrat Party.
   They were to go from there to the General Workers Federation
building a mile away, where more than 30 workers were staging a
hunger strike for higher pay. The strike continued today for a 10th
day.
   As the leaders were about to leave, police in military and
civilian vehicles took them into custody, Lorena Obando, a member
of the Social Democrat Party, said.
   Alma Morales, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said the group
``was invited'' to meet with Commander Doris Tijerino, chief of the
Sandinista police.
   Police grabbed two others _ Social Christian leaders Agustin
Jarquin Anaya and Armando Guadamuz _ near the federation building
and pushed them into a police vehicle. Guadamuz had been speaking
with journalists a block from the building.
   ``This is the repressive custom of the (Sandinista) Front,''
Guadamuz said before police led him away. ``They are violent by
tradition.''
   Police cordoned off the federation building.
   At a news conference late Wednesday, Bonilla said opposition
leaders who are in the National Assembly and have immunity from
prosecution were released before reaching a police station.
   The rest, he said, ``were taken to a place called Palo Alto
where they asked us our complete names, home addresses, age,
occupation and position in our political parties.
   ``Some of us were taken to jails and others to interrogation
rooms, which are more comfortable,'' Bonilla added.
   Tijerino ordered them released, he said.
   Javier Lopez, a high-ranking police official, was quoted in
newspapers as saying the leaders were detained ``because they did
not have authorization to carry out that mobilization.''
   It was unclear if he referred to the visit to the hunger
strikers or the planned rally.
   Construction workers and car mechanics walked off their jobs
Feb. 25 to demand higher salaries and better working conditions.
The federation, a coalition of socialist unions, says 4,500 workers
are striking. Interior Minister Tomas Borge has said there are only
400 people off the job.
   Erick Ramirez, leader of a faction of the Social Christian
Party, said the parties ``have been holding activities in favor of
the workers on hunger strike because their demands are just and
because of the difficult economic situation that the workers in
this country are living.''
   Radio Catolica had been closed for almost two years for failing
to broadcast Ortega's year-end message on Dec. 31, 1985. The only
opposition newspaper, La Prensa, was closed June 26, 1986. Both
were allowed to reopen last October.

   Fire in a 62-story downtown building showered
broken glass on firefighters today and sent orange flames and
plumes of thick black smoke shooting out of the city's tallest
skyscraper.
   The steady stream of heat-blasted glass made the firefighting
effort particularly dangerous, Capt. Mike Bowers said. ``The glass
falling ... is severing our hose lines. And we can't send
firefighters to replace them because they'll get severed.''
   Firefighters extinguished the blaze at the First Interstate Bank
early this morning after it burned 3{ hours, spreading flames and
smoke as it snaked upward. Inspector Ed Reed called it the city's
worst high-rise fire.
   Thousands of onlookers gathered downtown to take pictures and
scoop up singed papers that fluttered to the street through broken
windows.
   Gary Stratton, 20, of Los Angeles, snared a singed page from
what appeared to be an office manual, and a few half-burned
receipts.
   ``I'll definitely be keeping this as a souvenir,'' Stratton said.
   People craned their necks as helicopter spotlights illuminated
bright orange flames and plumes of thick smoke shooting out broken
windows.
   Inside, firefighters faced a hellish mix of heat and smoke.
   ``We were on of the first fire companies up on the 12th floor,
where the fire was,'' Fire Capt. Jeff Marcus said today on CBS-TV's
``This Morning.'' ``We used the door as a barricade to keep the
heat from coming into the stairwell.
   Water hitting the hot metal girders and pipes sent clouds of
steam spewing at firefighters, hampering visibility and spreading
severe heat, Reed said.
   Fire crews wearing breathing gear trudged up closed streets to
the blaze raging through the headquarters of the state's
third-largest bank, evoking images of troops headed into battle.
   The drone of helicopter rotors was mixed with the whine of
sirens, the sound of shattering glass and the roar of the flames a
dozen stories overhead.
   ``This is one of the all-time big ones,'' fire Capt. Steve
Varney said. ``The whole square block (building) is just full of
smoke and heat.
   ``Everything that was burnable, burned down. It was just metal
and that was red hot ... It looked like Dante's Inferno.''
   The fire erupted shortly after 10:30 p.m. Wednesday as workers
installed piping for an overhead sprinkler system. Police lines
kept the crowds back and traffic snarled as motorists parked five
and six cars deep at the curb.

   A commercial fisherman partied with native
dancers and immigration officials early today as he became the last
illegal alien in the United States to apply for legal residency
status before a midnight deadline.
   ``No words can express my appreciation and my happiness at this
time,'' Sione Feiloakitau said through an interpreter. ``This is
something I have hoped for for a long time.''
   Sione Feiloakitau, 42, has lived in the United States since 1979
after coming to Hawaii from the South Pacific nation of Tonga.
   Feiloakitau was the last of more than an estimated 1.4 million
illegal aliens nationwide who took advantage of the amnesty program.
   A dozen people waited in the local Immigration and
Naturalization Service's legalization office lobby, hoping for the
honor of becoming last applicant.
   ``They're fighting over being the last one,'' said Pamela
Legates, chief legalization officer in the amnesty office. ``They'd
like to be the last person for historical purposes.''
   INS District Director Bill Craig chose Feiloakitau at random as
the clock struck midnight.
   ``As they say, better late than never,'' said Mark Everson, an
INS Deputy Commissioner from Washington. He presented Feiloakitau a
Statue of Liberty replica.
   ``We have all just participated in a piece of history,'' Craig
said. ``We as Americans should be proud of this.''
   Immigration officials here held a bash complete with sushi and a
Tongan band to celebrate the amnesty program's final hours.
   The Honolulu office was set up to handle 250 applicants a day,
but Legates said the office was lucky to handle 20 a day since its
doors opened May 5, 1987.
   At midnight Wednesday, a single-day record 189 people applied
for amnesty, said Sarah Kim, a legalization officer.
   For the entire year, 2,082 illegal aliens from 61 countries
applied for legal residency status at the Honolulu office, Kim said.
   Because of the time difference between Honolulu and the
mainland, Hawaii's legalization office closes six hours after East
Coast offices and three hours past those on the West Coast.
   Legates was the busiest person in the office Wednesday,
arranging refreshments and decorations for the night's festivities.
   Legates said she believed the office would fill for the first
and last time in the program's final hours, but not due to a crush
of applicants.
   ``We know a lot of people are coming just to party with us,''
Legates said.
   Legates said she had been contacted by community leaders from
several ethnic groups, who asked that a person of their heritage be
the last to file. She declined to identify the groups, but the
largest groups of applicants in Hawaii have been Tongans,
Filipinos, Samoans and Canadians.

   British and Soviet media poked fun at President
Reagan's reported belief in astrology, but newspapers in other
countries quoted him as saying the stars had played no role in his
policies.
   ``White House Watchers Wild about Nancy (Reagan) the
`Stargazer,''' blared the headline in Wednesday's Daily Telegraph,
which reported that ``Washington was abuzz with claims ... Nancy
really believes what the stars foretell.''
   Newspapers in Italy, West Germany and Sweden gave relatively
straightforward coverage to the president's denial Tuesday that his
decisions and progarms were influenced by astrology.
   British and Soviet media also made fun of former Reagan
administration officials who have revealed juicy White House gossip.
   ``There is no wrath like that of a former Reagan aide,
apparently,'' said Britain's Independent newspaper. ``Or, to put it
another way, former Reagan aides will do anything to get their
memoirs on the best-seller list.''
   Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of staff, reportedly
asserts in a forthcoming book that Mrs. Reagan regularly consulted
astrologers in shaping the president's schedule.
   The tabloid Daily Mirror devoted almost an entire inside page to
the hubbub. It also listed _ under the banner headline ``Star
Struck!'' _ the famous people who purportedly sought insight from
astrologers.
   Among them were Albert Einstein, Queen Elizabeth I and Napoleon
Bonaparte.
   Einstein once wrote that ``astrology was a science in itself
(that) ... taught me many things,'' according to Daily Mirror
columnist Louise Montgomery.
   Elizabeth I, the 16th-century English monarch, rarely acted
without the advice of astrologer John Dee, and French emperor
Napoleon commissioned at least two astrological charts and ``placed
his trust in the movement of the stars,'' she added.
   A sober headline in the Independent said ``Reagan Takes a Dim
View of Star-Gazing Tales'' while the tabloid Daily Express' banner
headline proclaimed, ``Ronnie and Nancy's Star-Struck White House.''
   In Sweden, Aftonbladet bannered the story saying ``Reagan
Governed by the Stars'' while the liberal Expressen had a large
picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading ``Nancy,
What's the Stars Predicting for Today?''
   Tass wondering in a dispatch what the stars are telling Reagan.
   ``It is difficult to say what the May night sky, studded with
stars, predicted to the president, but it hardly predicted that he
would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of
the USA,'' the official Soviet news agency said.
   Tass characterized as evasive Reagan's denial that the stars
influence policy decisions. ``Now more Americans are asking
themselves: May it be true that the president determines the
country's political course with the help of the stars?''

   In KRAKOW, police surprise sleeping workers and break up a
10-day strike by half the force at the huge 32,000-worker Nowa Huta
steel mill. The government says no one is injured, but at least 38
people are arrested. Opposition activists' telephones appear to be

shipyard and vowed to be ``the last to leave.''

   The wave of strikes, which began April 25, are Poland's most
serious since the 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity. Two
earlier strikes were settled when the government agreed to increase
wages to offset price increase of 42 percent so far this year.
   At Nowa Huta and Gdansk, strikers demanded independent local
unions, reinstatement of fired union activists and the release of
political prisoners.

   Even before three freed French hostages made it
home, Premier Jacques Chirac was peppered with reproach for dealing
secretly with terrorists, likely worsening chances for remaining _
and future _ hostages.
   Nine Americans, three Britons and six others were still believed
to be captive in Lebanon.
   After a morning of scattered sharp reaction, Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua today retorted to reporters:
   ``We have not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone, not a
franc, not a dollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''
   Most French politicians publicly hailed the release, calling it
above politics even though it came four days before Chirac faces
incumbent Francois Mitterrand in presidential elections.
   But Jean-Marie Le Pen, of the extreme right National Front, who
polled 14.4 percent in first-round voting, said he was struck that
everyone cried victory over a ``defeat'' for France.
   ``There is the other side of this, a death and the price that I
would like to know,'' he said. ``There is only one way to deal with
terrorists, that used in Ouvea.''
   As the hostages were returned from Beirut today, troops stormed
insurgents on the French New Caledonian island of Ouvea to free 22
gendarmes held hostage. Two members of a French assault team and 15
Melanesian kidnappers were killed, according to Bernard Pons,
French minister for overseas territories.
   A fourth French hostage in Lebanon, Michel Seurat, is believed
to have died of cancer in captivity.
   Harsh reaction came from Britain. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher refuses to treat with terrorists. Peter Temple-Morris,
member of parliament and a Lebanon specialist in Thatcher's
Conservative Party, said:
   ``No responsible nation and no responsible government, and I say
that directly to the French government and the French people,
should deal with terrorism.''
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he went on:
   ``I very much disapprove (of the French action). I think it's
corrupt both in electoral terms and...general terms. I think it's
thoroughly bad.''
   He blamed the deal on France's system which, on Sunday, pits a
president and his prime minister against one another for the
presidency.
   By Chirac's approach, he said, ``Governments throughout the
world had better give way to terrorism and let the terrorists
completely take over.''
   John Waite, cousin of Terry Waite, the Church of England envoy
detained since Jan. 20, 1987, echoed Temple-Morris' criticism.
   ``Unfortunately when deals are done by countries like France
then (others') position is made worse because they are isolated
because we are the only country it seems who is not doing deals.''
   David Owen, leader of the Social Democratic Party, called the
French deal ``brazen and cynical.''
   Chirac confronted the charges after greeting the hostages
outside Paris. On nationwide television, he declared:
   ``We have never ceased to act with dignity and honor, conforming
strictly to values shared with other countries, adhering strictly
the grand principles of our foreign policy, to those of our
friends.''
   Pierre Beregovoy, a Socialist and Mitterrand's campaign
director, praised ``conditions that do honor to our country.''
   But among ordinary Frenchmen, many private remarks reflected
that of a senior Western diplomat: ``I wonder how much he paid?''
   In a brief but pointed statement, the U.S. State Department said
it was awaiting details but added: ``We would be concerned by any
sign that concessions were made. We believe concessions encourage
future kidnappings and could prolong captivity of other hostages.''
   Another British Conservative legislator, Hugo Summerson, urged
summoning the French ambassador for an explanation. ``The French
... have always looked after their own interests in a rather
selfish way,'' he said.
   Chirac himself refused to discuss negotiations leading to the
release of the three, the last French hostages in Lebanon. Since
June 1986, pro-Iranian groups have freed 10 Frenchmen.
   Weeks ago, sources close to Chirac reported that France agreed
to repay to Iran the remaining two-thirds of a disputed $1 billion
loan contracted with the deposed shah, and that Iran was prepared
to broker a release.
   The most persistent speculation, never confirmed, was that
France also agreed to alter the balance of arms supplied to Iraq
and Iran and to add a cash payment.
   Chirac's aides, confronting criticism head-on, remarked
privately that the United States might draw a lesson from France.
   The French premier personally oversaw negotiations, working with
Pasqua, and repeatedly pressed senior Iranian officials who were
instrumental in obtaining the release.
   The remaining hostages include nine Americans believed to be
prisoners of Islamic zealots in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Circuitous secret manuevers, including arms sales to Iran, came
to light dramatically in November 1986 and weakened the Reagan
administration's position.
   French political analysts are divided on the effect of the
timing, days before an election which polls suggest Chirac would
lose.
   As soon as he announced the hostage release at a campaign rally
in Strasbourg, his followers began chanting, ``We're going to win!
We're going to win!''
   But some analysts predicted a hostile backlash from people who
suspected Chirac himself had influenced the timing to give himself
a badly needed boost in the final stretch.
   Islamic fundamentalists may have decided to give the
conservative candidate an edge because Mitterrand is regarded as a
close friend of Israel. But it was Chirac who first negotiated arms
sales to Iraq, in his previous term as premier in the 1970s.

   Israeli troops shut Palestinian shops
throughout the West Bank today in punishment for a strike, and
schoolchildren set tires ablaze in the Gaza Strip to protest the
army's closing of Arab schools.
   The army said a 52-year-old Palestinian man from Gaza's Shati
refugee camp died after reportedly inhaling tear gas Wednesday, but
said it had ordered an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
   Two Arab protesters were reported shot to death by Israeli
soldiers Wednesday, raising to 183 the number of Arabs who have
died since unrest began in the occupied territories Dec. 8. Two
Israelis also have been killed.
   Today, Israeli troops forced Arab shops to close on the West
bank, announcing on megaphones the closure would remain in effect
for three days to punish merchants for adhering to a PLO-ordered
general strike a day earlier.
   In Jericho, soldiers shut down the West Bank's largest vegetable
market, along with other shops and bakeries. An order from the
military governor said stores that do not reopen on Sunday will be
sealed shut by troops.
   Near the village of Beita, hundreds of Jewish settlers began a
five-hour march along the route taken by a group of teen-age hikers
last month when a bloody clash erupted at the Arab village and left
an Israeli teen-ager and two Palestinians dead.
   Many of the marchers had guns slung over their shoulders. Last
month's clash caused an uproar in Israel and prompted the army to
demolish 14 Arab homes, arrest dozens of Arab villagers and seal
off Beita for weeks.
   In Gaza City, about 120 children chanting ``PLO yes, Israel
no!'' hoisted the outlawed Palestinian flag onto a flagpole at a
school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, an Arab
reporter said.
   Troops fired tear gas to disperse the children, who erected
barricades of boulders and set tires ablaze in front of the school,
the reporter said.
   The Arab protest was in response to a leaflet distributed by
underground leaders of the 5-month-old Arab uprising and signed by
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The leaflet ordered protests today against Israel's shutdown of
Arab schools and told schoolchildren to force the schools open for
three hours. All schools in the occupied West Bank have been closed
since Feb. 6, affecting 300,000 Arab children.
   In Nablus, troops erected roadblocks and prevented Arab taxis
from leaving the city to punish residents for adhering to a general
strike Wednesday that shuttered shops and stopped all public
transit.
   Ahmed Sarawi, a Nablus merchant whose shop was forced closed by
troops, said the action would not break the back of Arab
resistance. ``The army has killed, deported, jailed and beaten us.
But we are not going to give up,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The army clamped curfews on the Gaza Strip refugee camps of
Shati and Jabaliya after violent protests erupted Wednesday in
response to a ``day of confrontation'' ordered in the leaflets.
   In a rare armed attack, an assailant hurled a grenade at an
Israeli car near the West Bank's Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim
on Wednesday, Israel radio and the Itim news agency said. No
injuries or damage were reported.
   But most of Wednesday's violence centered in the crowded
Palestinian refugee camps in the Gaza Strip.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in an interview published
Wednesday, called for an Arab-Israeli peace settlement entailing a
jointly run Jordanian-Palestinian state in 60 percent of the
occupied lands.
   But Rabin was quoted as saying in Jane's Defense Weekly that his
center-left Labor Party, which shares power with the right-wing
Likud bloc, believes ``Jerusalem must be united under Israeli
sovereignty and remain its capital.''

   A French assault team today stormed
a cave in this French Pacific territory and freed 22 gendarmes and
a prosecutor held hostage by Melanesian separatists. An official
said 17 people were killed.
   Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories in the
conservative government of Premier Jacques Chirac of France, said
the dead included two members of the assault team and 15 kidnappers.
   He also said two members of the assault team were seriously
injured.
   Pons said the hostages were freed after ``a particularly violent
battle'' in the nearly seven-hour assault on a network of caves in
Ouvea, an island off the northeast coast of New Caledonia.
   The assault team attacked the cave with tear gas, forcing most
of the approximately 30 kidnappers out, Pons told a news conference
after returning from Ouvea, where he had traveled for the operation.
   The hostages freed themselves from their handcuffs before the
attack after a key was smuggled to them by Capt. Philippe Legorjus,
chief of an anti-terrorism squad.
   Legorjus had been captured during earlier hostage negotiations
with the separatists, then freed to act as an go-between with
French authorities. Legorjus made several trips to and from the
caves during negotiations and was told that the hostages would be
killed if he did not return.
   Legorjus also smuggled to the caves two pistols with which
hostages defended themselves during the attack.
   ``Profiting from the smoke created by tear gas bombs, the
hostages were able to escape through a chimney in the back of the
cave,'' Pons said.
   Police said the injured were taken to a hospital in Noumea,
capital of this island territory 1,300 miles northeast of Australia.
   In Paris, Defense Minister Andre Giraud said in a television
interview that the kidnappers' chief was among those killed.
   Giraud told French radio that the attack was ordered by Chirac,
with approval from President Francois Mitterrand, when negotiations
with the kidnappers stalled.
   ``The situation inside the cave had become extremely
dangerous,'' Giraud said. ``In any case, it was entirely
intolerable that representatives of the forces of order might be
held hostage.''
   Jean-Marie Tjibaou, president of the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, the main Melanesian separatist organization, said
the operation was ``a hard blow for the Kanak people.''
   ``This will not stop the determination of the Kanak people in
their demand for independence,'' Tjibaou told The Associated Press
by telephone from his home in Hienghene at the northern end of New
Caledonia.
   Asked if he expected to be arrested, Tjibaou replied: ``It's
always possible. It would be completely logical, since the
government thinks there is no political claim but only a terrorist
band.''
   Authorities had imposed a near total news blackout for several
days, cut communications with Ouvea and would not allow journalists
to go there.
   The Melanesian kidnappers had demanded negotiations toward
independence for New Caledonia, the French Pacific island territory.
   Fifteen of the gendarmes had been held since they were kidnapped
from a police station on Ouvea April 22. Four gendarmes were killed
in that attack.
   Legorjus and seven other hostages were seized April 27 as they
sought to negotiate the release of the other hostages.
   The militants were demanding that French troops be removed from
Ouvea and that a mediator be sent to arrange a referendum on
independence for New Caledonia, a French territory since 1853. They
also had demanded the cancellation of elections, which took place
during scattered violence April 24.
   As a result of that election, Mitterrand and Chirac will face
each other in a presidential runoff election in France on Sunday.
New Caledonia has become an issue in the campaign.
   Of New Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants, 43 percent are native
Melanesian, known as Kanaks, most of whom desire independence.
   European settlers make up 36 percent of the population, with the
rest Asian and Polynesian. This group generally would prefer to
remain part of France.

<HEAD>Convoy Arrives At Kuwait As US Warships Watch For Iranian Mines Or
Attacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ This story was filed by the Pentagon news pool.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warship-escorted convoys
moved through the Persian Gulf without incident, but U.S. warships
that prowled the waterway were still on alert for mines and
possible Iranian attack.
   ``It's very quiet out there,'' Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke said
Wednesday on the 3,700-ton guided-missile frigate that played a
pivotal role in fierce fighting with Iranian warships two weeks ago.
   A U.S.-escorted tanker convoy arrived off the coast of Kuwait on
Wednesday morning without incident after clearing through the
narrow Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf, the day before, Navy
officials reported.
   The two Kuwaiti tankers reflagged as American vessels, the
Townsend and the Sea Isle City, were escorted by the destroyer USS
Merrill and the guided missile frigate USS Sides. The tankers were
left in international waters off Kuwait.
   Iran has threatened revenge for the April 18 battle in which
Washington claimed three Iranian vesssels were sunk. Three others
were hit by missiles and bombs.
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told a Pentagon media pool aboard the command ship USS
Coronado on Tuesday that Tehran's threats of revenge are taken very
seriously.
   ``They have considerable capability and they have ... missile
capability which we are always concerned about,'' Crowe said during
a surprise visit to the gulf. He came to tour some of the 28 ships
plying the vital oil trade route.
   Shipping executives said a civilian helicopter pilot reported
Tuesday seeing two ships thought to be Iranian between Das island,
an oil terminal off the United Arab Emirates, and the Iran-owned
Sassan platform that U.S. forces destroyed April 18.
   His report raised fears the ships were sowing mines.
   Crowe met with senior Bahrain government officials on Wednesday,
the second day of a visit to the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq
have been at war since September 1980.
   Although no new mines have been found since the April 18 sea
battle, mine-sweepers and lookouts in the bow of the Williams and
other passing ships kept lookouts on constant duty to survey the
placid turquoise sea for fear Iran may use mines to even the
balance after its naval losses.
   ``I don't care if one of my boys forces us to reverse speed for
a dead sheep or cow,'' says Cmdr. Edward Mann, captain of this
warship. ``I still praise him for spotting it because it shows he
his doing his job.''
   Dead sheep and cattle, with their four hoofs poking through the
calm waters, have provided a scary imitation of the mines the
United States blames Iran for floating in international waters.
   One mine put on display yesterday aboard the Coronado, recovered
in September from the mine-laying Iran Ajr by the U.S. Navy, has
deadly hoof-like prongs that can detonate 250 pounds of explosives.
   Crowe visited the badly damaged 3,700-ton guided missile frigate
USS Samuel B. Roberts, which is in a gulf drydock undergoing
repairs, to pay tribute to its crew for its heroic effort in saving
the ship from sinking last month after it nudged a mine as it tried
to back away. Ten crew members were injured.
   The incident prompted the U.S. attack on Iranian oil platforms
April 18 which in turn led to the naval skirmish with Iran.
   As this warship sailed back into the central gulf to resume
patrol duties after a brief port stop, its officers and men seemed
more concerned about mines than Iranian attacks.
   ``You can even plant one of those from a dhow,'' said executive
officer Lt. Cmdr. Wally Bloss of the bow-shaped Arab fishing boats
that dot the steamy horizon.
   While the Pentagon has still not decided if Iran actually fired
Silkworms at U.S. ships in the April 18 engagement, the Williams'
crew shows little doubt.
   They have ordered 1,000 T-shirts with the slogan on the front:
``Persian Gulf Escort Service.'' The back displays an empty tequila
bottle with the words: ``We drank the bottle, but we didn't eat the
worm.''
   President Reagan has warned Tehran of strikes against coastal
Silkworm missile batteries if they were ever fired at American
ships, but the Pentagon says it lacks definite proof Iran used them
in the daylong battle.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Warplanes Hit Ship, New Convoy Heads Down Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said its warplanes attacked an oil
tanker off the Iranian coast today, and a new convoy of
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers escorted by American warships headed
south down the Persian Gulf.
   The reported Iraqi raid was the first in a week. There was no
immediate confirmation from independent shipping sources.
   The convoy, the fourth in the past week, left Kuwait as the U.S.
Navy accelerated its escort operations in an effort to make up for
delays caused by last month's mine threat and a one-day naval
battle with Iran.
   Iraq's official news agency said a ``large naval target,'' the
Iraqi term for a tanker, was attacked this morning. The report was
monitored in Cyprus.
   It quoted a military spokesman as saying the planes scored a
``direct and effective hit'' on the unidentified vessel and
returned safely to base.
   The raid was aimed at ``depriving the Iranian regime of its oil
revenues which are used for aggressive purposes,'' the spokesman
was quoted as saying.
   It was the first raid claimed by Iraq since April 29, when it
said two Iranian tankers were attacked by its jets the day before.
But those raids also have not been verified by independent sources.
   The last confirmed Iraqi air strike on Iranian shipping was
March 30, when the 259,000-ton Cypriot tanker Anax was set on fire
by missiles.
   Iraq and Iran have been at war since September 1980. More than
400 ships have been hit or damaged since the so-called ``tanker
war'' broke out in early 1984.
   The convoy, the 29th this year and the 51st since the United
States began escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers last July,
included the 79,999-ton oil products tankers Chesapeake City and
Ocean City.
   The ships had reached Kuwait in a northbound convoy April 29.
They left a few hours after another convoy arrived in Kuwait
Wednesday.
   The movements have been stepped up in the past week after
falling behind schedule because of Iran's mining of international
waters and the subsequent naval clashes between U.S. and Iranian
forces April 18.
   Shipping executives, who reported the latest convoy, did not
name the escort warships and U.S. officials were not available.
   The warships were believed to be the destroyer Merrill and the
guided missile frigate John H. Sides, which had accompanied
Wednesday's convoy to Kuwait. U.S. warships do not normally enter
Kuwaiti waters.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest book by suspense novelist Lawrence
Sanders has been sold at auction for $2.85 million in a tug-of-war
that involved eight publishing houses.
   On Wednesday, the Putnam Publishing Group bought the hardback
and paperback rights for the book, titled ``The Devil in the White
House.''
   The author of such successful novels as ``The Anderson Tapes''
and ``The First Deadly Sin,'' Sanders demanded and got a 15 percent
royalty on all hardcover and paperback sales. Under most publishing
contracts, hardcover royalties begin at 10 percent, while paperback
royalties rarely reach 15 percent until hundreds of thousands of
copies are sold.
   Sanders' last contract also was with Putnam, for $1.2 million.
He decided to hold an auction this time to test the market.
   It was the second blockbuster literary sale this week. On
Monday, Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books agreed to pay
mystery-suspense writer Mary Higgins Clark a minimum $10.1 million
for four books and a collection of short stories. Strong sales
could push the value of the package to $11.6 million.

<HEAD>Government Appeals Court Decision Opening Beaches To All Races</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today appealed
a court order that opened segregated beaches in the southern city
of Port Elizabeth to all races.
   The Port Elizabeth Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the city
council acted without proper authority in 1966 when it passed a
resolution proclaiming the beaches segregated.
   The court declared the beaches in the country's fifth largest
city open to all races. Some blacks immediately went to previously
``whites only'' beaches and ran triumphantly along the sand.
   But today, Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis and
the administrator of Cape Province, Gene Louw, filed court papers
seeking to appeal the decision. The documents said the beaches
should remain segregated until the court rules on their appeal.
   City Councilor Graham Richards, who filed the application
calling for desegregated beaches, said Louw was ``using procedures
of the court as a purely political maneuver.''
   Heunis and President P.W. Botha have taken a middle ground on
the volatile issue of ``beach apartheid,'' contending that some
beaches should be integrated while others remain reserved for
whites.
   Most beaches in the two largest coastal cities, Durban and Cape
Town, are open to all races. Blacks are barred from many beaches in
smaller communities.
   In January 1987, Port Elizabeth's beaches figured in a political
confrontation between Botha and the Rev. Alan Hendrickse, leader of
the mixed-race chamber of Parliament.
   Hendrickse waded into the surf in a well-publicized defiance of
apartheid laws. He later apologized to Botha for causing any
offense to the president, lowering his credibility among his
constituents.
   ``Somebody owes me an apology,'' Hendrickse said Wednesday in
Parliament after learning of the court ruling.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Auction Will Be First Of Living Author's Archive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Saul Bellow has decided to sell
all rough draft material from his 1970 novel ``Mr. Sammler's
Planet'' in an unprecedented auction that is making librarians and
scholars uneasy.
   The four handwritten notebooks, typescript, galleys and all
papers relating to the book will go on the block June 7 at
Sotheby's. It will be the first archive of a major living author's
published work to be auctioned, and the first manuscript material
sold by Bellow.
   The pre-sale estimate of the collection's value is between
$60,000 and $100,000, according to David Redden, head of Sotheby's
books and manuscripts department.
   Redden said it is difficult to evaluate because the sale will be
the first of its kind. The estimate is based on the $165,000 paid
for Henry Miller's ``Tropic of Cancer'' at Sotheby's in 1986, the
auction record for a published literary work.
   Bellow, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1976, said in
today's New York Times that he is selling the material because he
has ``no sentimental attachments to the manuscripts.''
   With the money, he said, he might endow a chair at a university
for a writer.
   The novel is about Arthur Sammler, a Polish Jew in his 70s who
survived the Holocaust and lives in Manhattan in the 1960s. The
material is on loan to the Regenstein Library of the University of
Chicago, where Bellow is a professor of English and social thought.
Bellow has donated the draft material of other books to the
library, and the library had hoped to keep the Sammler work.
   Librarians and manuscript curators discussing the sale echoed
the concerns of Lola Szladits, curator of the Berg Collection of
the New York Public Library, who worries that a purchase by an
investor will cut scholars' access to the archive.
   ``For him (Bellow) it's over, but it's not over for the reader
and the literary critic, and it is not over in the flow of literary
history,'' Ms. Szladits said. ``The written traces of great
creative minds will just disappear if their manuscripts do.''

<HEAD>Methodists Reject Abortion For Birth Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Methodists, who have condoned abortion
in ``some tragic conflicts of life,'' voted to oppose it as a means
of birth control or because the expected baby isn't of the desired
sex.
   ``We cannot affirm abortion as an acceptable means of birth
control, and we unconditionally reject it as a means of gender
selection,'' says the amendment approved Wednesday night by the
denomination's governing conference.
   The 9.6-million-member denomination is the country's second
largest Protestant group, next to the Southern Baptist Convention,
which sweepingly condemns abortion except to save the life of the
mother.
   Several other Protestant bodies in recent years have taken a
sterner position about abortion, modifying pro-choice stands, while
others have turned completely against it.
   The conference here acted after it defeated a broader
condemnation of abortion that said ``unborn human life is a human
being and therefore has a right to be born, loved and cared for.''
   Supporting that position, Eve G. Kirk of Hinckley, Ill., told
the nearly 1,000 delegates that ``if God is for the poor, weak and
helpess, to take a human life in the womb is wrong.''
   She cited biblical passages saying God knows people before they
come from the womb, adding that those words are ``for the millions
of unborn human babies that will never see the planet earth.''
   However, the Rev. Tex A. Sample, a Kansas City theologian,
opposed the proposal, declaring, ``If this view is carried, it will
take away from parents and children the right to safe, medical
abortion.''
   The proposal, offered by a minority of a legislative committee,
lost by 649 to 308, while the majority proposal tightening
limitations on abortion in some cases passed overwhelmingly, 805 to
130.
   The Rev. Edmond W. Robb of Marshall, Texas, said the approved
statement was ``the strongest position the church has ever taken
about abortion, a more responsible position.''
   Robb said the Methodist rejection of abortions for birth control
or convenience puts the church against about 90 percent of
abortions carried out for those reasons in America.
   The new reservations were added to the church's past postion,
which said:
   ``Our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us
reluctant to approve abortion. But we are equally bound to respect
the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother, for whom
devastating damage may result from unacceptable pregnancy.
   ``In continuity with past Christian teaching, we recognize
tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion, and
in such cases support the legal option of abortion under proper
medical procedures.''
   In another action, the conference voiced opposition to the
movement for a constitutional amendment making English the
country's official language.
   Opposing it, Methodist delegates declared, ``These efforts and
their implications are another manifestation of the systemic racism
which has infected this country for generations.''

<HEAD>Airports Put On Alert To Block Marcos Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airports were on alert today to
prevent relatives of Ferdinand Marcos from returning to the
Philippines for the funeral of the ousted president's mother.
   President Corazon Aquino cited national security in barring
Marcos, exiled in Hawaii, from attending the funeral of Josefa
Edralin-Marcos, 95, who died Wednesday.
   Mrs. Aquino today was asked about a statement by Marcos that he
would ``exhaust all possibilities'' to attend his mother's funeral.
   ``I suppose we'll have to wait for him to exhaust all those
measures, but I stand firm on my decision not to allow him to come
back,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, who read the Marcos statement
to reporters in Hawaii, said the former president ``won't violate
any laws to go back.''
   The ban on Marcos also applies to his wife, Imelda, and his
three children.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, capital regional commander,
ordered airport authorities to be on the alert after intelligence
reports that Marcos' son, Ferdinand Jr., might slip back into the
country for his grandmother's funeral.
   Marcos fled the country with his wife and children after he was
ousted by a popular uprising in February 1986.
   Late Wednesday, hundreds of mourners, some shouting ``Marcos!
Marcos!'' packed a Mass for Mrs. Edralin-Marcos after the
government refused her deathbed wish to let her son return.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos was hospitalized Sunday suffering from
pneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure.
   Marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attempts
against Mrs. Aquino, whose husband, opposition leader Benigno
Aquino, was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983.
   About 50 staff members and supporters joined Marcos and his
wife, Imelda, in their Makiki Heights home near Honolulu on
Wednesday for a Mass in memory of his mother.
   In other developments, at least 20 people were killed in
separate clashes between government troops and communist rebels
throughout the country Wednesday and today, the military reported.
   The casualties included 16 soldiers and at least four rebels,
although rebel casualty figures were incomplete.
   The deputy chief of staff for intelligence said 1,291 people
were killed in more than 1,200 ``insurgency-related'' incidents
throughout the country during the first four months of the year.
   Brig. Gen. Galileo Kintanar said the fatalities included 584
guerrillas, 346 soldiers and 361 civilians.

   Mark Gastineau's announcement that his towering

   Lisa Gastineau, 28, said the couple's 5-year-old daughter,
Brittny, found out about her future half-sibling from another
youngster.
   ``A little friend asked her if she knew her daddy is having a
baby,'' said Mrs. Gastineau. ``She's a little innocent getting
caught in a crossfire.''
   She said that since Feb. 19, when her husband announced his
engagement to Nielsen, the ex-wife of actor Sylvester Stallone, he
has not spoken to his daughter.
   ``Three months have gone by and daddy doesn't call,'' Mrs.
Gastineau was quoted as saying in today's Daily News.
   The reaction of the Jets' defensive end?
   He said he loves Brittny ``more than anything in the world.
   ``Hopefully someday soon ... Lisa will find love, which will
give her something better to do than try to make me look bad.''
   Gastineau, a defensive end for the New York Jets, blushingly
announced Tuesday that the 24-year-old Nielsen, a Danish-born
actress, will bear his child.

   Vietnam has withdrawn about 15,000
soldiers from Cambodia, leaving a force of about 125,000, a U.S.
official said today.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to topple the Khmer Rouge
regime, which massacred hundreds of thousands of people. With
Soviet military aid, the Vietnamese have been fighting 50,000 or
more Cambodian resistance guerrillas armed by China and politically
backed by the United States.
   ``We believe that Hanoi did withdraw about 15,000 troops from
Cambodia last November and that there would be about 125,000 there
right now,'' said Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.
   ``We don't have any evidence that fresh troops have replaced the
personnel that departed, but Vietnam is able to very quickly return
troops to Cambodia if it so desires,'' he said. He quoted
information the State Department sent to U.S. embassies in Asia on
April 28.
   Vietnam withdrew what it said were 20,000 troops last November
in the largest of six annual withdrawals made since 1982. Most if
not all of the previous pullouts were dismissed by the United
States and other countries as mere troop rotations.
   The U.S. government estimate of Vietnamese troop strength in
Cambodia is widely used by news organizations, Western diplomats
and others. The non-communist nations of Southeast Asia generally
give higher estimates.
   The figure of 140,000 had been the official estimate since 1986.
   In an interview with The Associated Press early last month,
Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said Hanoi had over the
past six years withdrawn half of the forces it had stationed in
Cambodia. Hanoi will withdraw the remaining half over the next
three years to keep its pledge of a total pullout by 1990, Thach
said without giving any figures.
   Petzing also quoted the State Department as saying it had seen
reports indicating Vietnam has withdrawn some of its troops
stationed in Laos. He said the department had no firm figures,
however.
   Western diplomats in Hanoi also have cited such reports. Some
said they believed it was part of Vietnam's effort to streamline
its military in order to devote resources to economic development.
   Vietnam's communists helped the Laotian communists come to power
in 1975 and since has maintained a ``special relationship'' with
that country, including the stationing of what some estimates have
put at 40,000 or more soldiers.

<TEXT>
   A radio enthusiast who faked a plane crash
was convicted in federal court of making a false report to the
government after a neighbor testified he heard the man say, ``I am
in trouble. I am losing blood.''
   The fake Jan. 8 report during the height of a snowstorm
triggered a search for a downed plane, three dead passengers and a
weakening pilot. The hunt involved 20 aircraft, six police agencies
and up to 100 people at a cost of $50,000.
   Jurors deliberated for about two hours Wednesday before
convicting Mark Blair, 29. Blair faces a fine and up to five years
in prison when he is sentenced July 1 by U.S. District Judge Shane
Devine.
   In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Papps
portrayed Blair as a radio enthusiast who enjoyed instigating the
crash hoax during one of the worst storms of the year.
   ``Imagine the power he felt making this Navy plane run east to
west and north to south,'' Papps said, referring to a plane that
for nearly four hours flew low over risky terrain searching for the
downed jet.
   Defense lawyer Paul Twomey said he will appeal the verdict on
grounds of insufficient evidence, saying, ``This case is garbage,
absolute garbage.''
   But Papps said the testimony of the neighbor and the Navy pilot
``clearly identified Mark Blair as guilty.''
   Blair had testified he couldn't have committed the hoax because
he was asleep and wasn't aware that a plane was reported down until
he woke and turned on a police scanner after 10:47 p.m.
   Blair said he then overheard the downed pilot tell the Navy
plane that he believed passengers were dead, that he had lost a lot
of blood, was having trouble staying conscious, and could see and
hear the Navy plane overhead.
   But his account conflicted with times given Monday by David
Webster, the Navy reservist and Delta Airlines pilot flying the
Navy plane. He said conversations with the lost plane ended shortly
after 10:35 p.m.
   Timothy Dinan, 24, who lived in Blair's apartment building, said
he heard the scratchy sound of a two-way radio through an open
window in Blair's apartment and a voice clearly saying, ``I am in
trouble. I am losing blood.''
   When police searched Blair's apartment and a nearby storage
shed, they seized radio equipment and printed material that
included the name Dale, the name given to searchers by the man who

<HEAD>Michael Jackson & Pepsi on Soviet TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soviet viewers will see pop superstar Michael
Jackson in two ads for Pepsi Cola, the first advertiser to buy
commercial time on Soviet television.
   Jackson will sing and dance to his hit ``Bad,'' but he won't be
dubbed into Russian. Only the company's ``Choice of a New
Generation'' slogan and its logo will appear in the Cyrillic
alphabet.
   The ads are to appear on the broadcast of ``Pozner in America,''
a joint U.S.-Soviet production featuring Soviet commentator
Vladimir Pozner talking with Americans on topics such as attitudes
toward the Soviet Union and American family life.
   Among the six commercials Pepsi plans to run are two 60-second
spots featuring Jackson, the soft drink maker said Wednesday.
Another will show two astronauts floating through space after their
bottle of Pepsi. All six ads have been shown on U.S. television.
   The five 1-hour Pozner programs are being broadcast May 17-21,
in advance of the scheduled May 29 beginning of the Moscow summit
between President Reagan and Soviet Communist Party General
Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has been encouraging foreign business to consider
ventures in the Soviet Union.
   Pepsi-Cola International, a Somers, N.Y.-based unit of Pepsico
Inc., said it purchased five minutes of time on the Soviet Union's
main television channel. Pepsi said the ads will reach an audience
of 150 million.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the American company
that represented the Soviet broadcast agency Gosteleradio in the
sale said previously the going rate was $10,000 for a 30-second ad.
   Even as Pepsi was making its announcement in New York, Italian
businessman Silvio Berlusconi told reporters in Rome that a
subsidiary of his Fininvest Group had won rights to transmit
Western advertisements on Soviet television.
   ``For the first time Soviet televison will systematically
present Western advertising in its regular programming, and for the
first time Western companies will be able to reach the 287 million
people in the Soviet Union to promote their products,'' Berlusconi
said at a news conference at the Foreign Press Association.
   The three-year contract between the ad agency Pubitalia '80 SpA
and the Soviet state broadcast company was signed April 29 and
begins Sept. 1, he said.
   Barry Holt, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola International, said Pepsi
felt its purchase made it the first paid advertiser on Soviet
television.
   He said that commercials are scarce on Soviet television and
that Pepsi had been told Soviet advertisers were not charged for
running their commercials.
   Pepsi has been selling soft drinks in Russia since 1974, and
Holt said it has 20 bottlers there.
   This would not be the first time Soviet television viewers have
seen a Pepsi ad, however. Holt said a Pepsi ad ran free of charge
on Soviet television during telecasts of the 1986 Goodwill Games.

   Arvel Crawford admits to a bad back and
legs, but says he's very much alive despite Social Security's
listing him as dead for more than a month.
   And officials told Crawford's wife it will be three more months
before they reclassify him among the living.
   ``I don't think that's right having me down dead for three more
months,'' Crawford said. ``I'm not dead at all.''
   Crawford, 43, suffers from a bad back and legs, unstable nerves
and a paranoid schizophrenic personality disorder.
   He gets about $370 in Social Security a month, and his three
children get about $180. In addition, he receives $280 from
Supplementary Security Income and Medicaid each month for
medication.
   The family discovered that Crawford was listed as dead when they
called his Social Security office Friday to correct a problem.
   Crawford's wife, Marylou, spent Monday morning trying to
resurrect him at the office.
   ``I had to bring him in and show all kinds of ID,'' she said.
``They made him sign a paper that said `I, Arvel Crawford, live at
2041 Monroe Street and I am alive.'''
   Maureen Theodore, Social Security supervisor in Hollywood, said
the family still will get its monthly payments even though a
bureaucratic glitch lists Crawford as dead since March 31.
   But it'll take three months to get corrected paperwork to
regional Social Security offices in Baltimore and Birmingham, Ala.,
Mrs. Crawford said she was told.

<HEAD>Cuba Outlines Terms For Leaving Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba will withdraw its troops from Angola under a
four-year timetable if South Africa ends its occupation of
South-West Africa, a Cuban official said today.
   Jorge Risquet Valdes, Cuba's delegate in Angolan peace talks,
outlined his country's terms for withdrawing from Angola at a news
conference.
   Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States concluded a
two-day conference Wednesday aimed at ending the Angolan civil war.
   Cuban troops were sent into Angola in 1975 to defend the Marxist
government against pro-Western rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola. The United States aids the rebel
group.
   South Africa troops also are in southern Angola to back the
rebel movement and to attack Angolan bases of the South-West
African People's Organization, which is fighting for independence
of the South African-held territory of South-West Africa, or
Namibia.
   Risquet said Havana would withdraw its troops from Angola under
a four-year timetable hinging on South African readiness to give
independence to Namibia.
   He also said South Africa and the rebels must cease attacks on
Angolan soil.
   A joint statement Wednesday at the end of the talks said
progress was made and the parties agreed to meet again in a few
weeks at a still undecided African location.
   ``Our optimism could be defined as moderate,'' Risquet said.
   He said the Cubans came to the London talks seeking
``non-interference in the internal affairs of Angola and assurances
that Angola is not going to be attacked again.''
   Cuban forces in Angola, which he said numbered aver 35,000,
would remain ``as long as Angola needs us.''
   But ``if the abovementioned conditions are met then Cuba's role
will have been fulfilled,'' Risquet said.
   He declined to disclose Cuba's casualties in the 12 years it has
had forces there, but said the economic cost to Havana had been
heavy.
   He also called for an end to U.S. aid to Angolan rebels. Chester
Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs who
chaired the London talks, said U.S. aid to the Angolan rebels was
not negotiable.

   The nation's 107 immigration offices closed their doors today to
a once-in-a-lifetime offer of amnesty for millions of illegal
immigrants after processing tens of thousands on the final day of
the yearlong program.
   Aliens who beat the deadline today exchanged hugs and kisses and
waved American flags in Los Angeles. Immigration and Naturalization
Service employees in Houston popped open champagne bottles as the
final applicants walked out the door. In Chicago, workers waved a
flag and burst a balloon at midnight.
   ``Thank God, this is a blessing. We have come so far and from so
much suffering,'' said Rosa Pineda, a Guatemalan who applied in
Albuquerque, N.M.
   In Honolulu, commercial fisherman Sione Feiloakitau partied with
native dancers and immigration officials today after becoming the
last person in the United States to apply before the deadline.
   ``No words can express my appreciation and my happiness at this
time,'' said Feiloakitau, 42, who moved to Hawaii in 1979 from the
South Pacific nation of Tonga. ``This is something I have hoped for
for a long time.''
   ``As they say, better late than never,'' said Mark Everson, an
INS deputy commissioner from Washington who presented Feiloakitau
with a tiny Statue of Liberty replica.
   As of Tuesday, 1.4 million people filed applications nationwide,
and 475,000 people were seeking legal status under a separate
program for seasonal agricultural workers, the INS said. The
deadline for that program is Nov. 30. There were no figures
available yet for Wednesday.
   ``At this time, it appears we will break 2 million'' for the
combined programs, INS spokesman Greg Leo said in Washington, D.C.
   Most of the applications were received in the West, where 1.3
million people have applied for amnesty under the two federal
programs. The Western region is comprised of California, Nevada,
Arizona, Hawaii and Guam.
   Illegal aliens who have lived in the United States continuously
since before Jan. 1, 1982, were eligible for temporary residency
and amnesty from deportation under the program. They must apply for
permanent residency with 18 months and can eventually apply for
citizenship.
   Rogelio Curriel, 23, of Jalisco, Mexico, was among the last of
the more than 68,000 people to apply in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
   Asked why he waited so long, Curriel said, ``I don't know, but I
did.''
   The doors closed at the office in Hialeah, Fla., at 12:02 a.m.,
but three minutes later, Manuel Pico, a Colombian, and his wife,
Sandra, were allowed in.
   ``We were home, we saw the news, I told him let's go for it,''
said Mrs. Pico, out of breath.
   The couple ran red lights to get to the office on time, said
Mrs. Pico, who is a U.S. citizen.
   More than 3,000 applied for amnesty on Wednesday, bringing
Florida's total number to 114,838, said Richard Smith, regional INS
deputy director.
   INS employees cheered as Rosa Lopez walked into the Houston
center at midnight.
   Ms. Lopez, 62, said she didn't file her application sooner
because she didn't have enough money. She still only had $40 in
cash when she presented her application, but the INS granted her a
60-day extension to pay the remaining $145.
   ``I'm very happy,'' she said.
   In New York, applicants were allowed to enter the INS office up
to an hour past the deadline, said James A. Jasey, deputy district
director of legalization in the metropolitan area.
   ``I stopped the clock,'' Jasey said, smiling. ``They're going
upstairs.''
   Carmen Siguenza, 28, of Ecuador, was not so lucky. She was in a
bewildered group of six who were turned away shortly after midnight
at an INS office in Chicago, where 9,299 illegal aliens registered
on Wednesday.
   Now, she said, she might have to return to Ecuador, where her
husband and two sons still live.
   ``I'm scared I can't work,'' she said.
   But the guard at the office door told the group, ``Sorry, you're
too late. You had a whole year.''
   An exception to the amnesty deadline was mandated in New York
state Wednesday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
extended it for some aliens until at least May 16 because of
initial confusion about the program's application to parents of
U.S.-born children on welfare. They were first ruled ineligible,
then eligible for amnesty, and the state has been seeking a 60-day
extension.
   A federal judge in Sacramento, Calif., scheduled a hearing for
today on whether the deadline also should be extended through
November for illegal aliens who did not apply because they had made
brief trips outside the country without permission from immigration
officials. U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton ruled Tuesday
that the INS wrongly made such trips grounds for disqualification.
   In Washington, D.C., U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin gave
certain non-immigrant aliens, such as foreign students who violated
terms of their visas by working, until Aug. 31 to show the court
they were dissuaded from applying because of an INS
misinterpretation.
   But some who processed the aliens offered no hope for an
extension beyond midnight Wednesday.
   ``They've been hanging from the rafters the past few days,''
said Hazel Leitch of Catholic Charities in Tulsa, Okla.
   ``After midnight, that's it. They can't come in here and say `I
had a flat tire.' The line has to be drawn somewhere.''

   The Soviet government regrets the labor unrest in
Poland but denies it has any relevance to Soviet economic reforms,
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
   Soviet media were silent about the crackdown by Polish
authorities on strikers at a steel mill outside Krakow and a
lockout of workers at a Gdansk shipyard.
   Official Radio Moscow reported only that 61 percent of the
people polled in the Soviet Union's western neighbor thought the
strikes would damage the economy.
   Asked at a regular news briefing about the labor unrest, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said: ``We regret that such
events take place in Poland.''
   He declined to say whether Soviet officials had offered advice
or suggestions to the Polish government.
   Asked whether the labor unrest, sparked by price increases
imposed by the government, was a warning for Soviet officials who
say prices must go up to reform the Soviet economy, he said:
   ``We closely follow the events in Poland. They go their way and
we go ours. I don't see any definite links. We have our own
problems here.''
   But Gerasimov noted that among the economic reforms being
discussed in the official Soviet press are price increases and
consumer demand that cannot be met because of a lack of goods.
   Soviet officials say prices will go up in the early 1990s to cut
the billions of rubles the government spends every year on
subsidies for food and other basic items.
   That has caused an outcry among consumers, and the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda has said it receives more letters about the
pending price increases than almost any other topic.
   Polish workers are seeking pay increases of up to 60 percent to
offset prices that have gone up 42 percent so far this year. The
Polish government has said the price increases are necessary to
straighten out Poland's economic problems and that the strikes
damage the reform effort.
   Pravda on Wednesday accused ``anti-Polish centers'' in the West
and domestic dissidents of trying to exploit the unrest in Poland.

   What the killer rabbit was for Jimmy Carter
and the bump on the head was for Gerald Ford, the signs of the
Zodiac may become for Ronald Reagan.
   Americans love to make fun of the occupants of the White House,
and the president and first lady Nancy Reagan have just given them
an excuse.
   Actually, not much of an excuse is needed. Almost anything will
do.
   Lyndon Johnson was subjected to endless jokes just for pulling
up his shirt and showing his scar from gall bladder surgery.
Abraham Lincoln was a figure of fun because of his habit of telling
tall stories. Even Richard Nixon, not much of a stand-up comic,
drew guffaws for dressing up White House guards in goofy uniforms.
   Once in a while, though, something happens that strikes the
public funny bone with special impact.
   For Carter, it all started on a spring afternoon in 1979 when he
told some of his aides, gathered on the Truman balcony of the White
House, about his encounter with a swamp rabbit as he fished in a
pond on his farm in Georgia.
   Carter said the animal was hissing and gnashing its teeth and
seemed intent on climbing into his boat. The commander in chief
said he took action by splashing water at the rabbit with his
paddle to shoo it away.
   Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell, who was in the group on
the balcony, later wrote, ``Had I been doing my job, I would have
stopped the president at that moment, pointed out the dangers to
him and his administration if such a story ever got out, and sworn
him and all within reach of his voice to secrecy.''
   Instead, Powell told the story, several months later, to a
reporter, Brooks Jackson of The Associated Press. Jackson wrote a
lighthearted column about it, and the fat was in the fire.
   ``It was a nightmare,'' said Powell. ``The story ran for more
than a week. The president was repeatedly asked to explain his
behavior at town hall meetings, press conferences, and meetings
with editors.''
   The former press secretary had his own tongue in cheek when he
wrote that account, but it is certainly true that the enraged
rabbit added a new facet to the folklore of the president from
Plains.
   Ford inadvertently broke into comedy one rainy day in Salzburg,
Austria, as he walked down the steps of Air Force One on arrival
for an international meeting with one arm around his wife and the
other holding an umbrella.
   Two or three steps from the bottom of the ramp, by his count,
his heel caught on something. With no arm free to grab a rail, he
tumbled onto the tarmac, then jumped to his feet, unhurt.
   ``From that moment on, every time I stumbled or bumped my head
or fell in the snow, reporters zeroed in on that to the exclusion
of almost everything else,'' Ford complained in his White House
memoirs.
   Not only that, but Johnny Carson made jokes about the subject on
his late night television show and comic Chevy Chase practically
made a career out of mimicking Ford's supposed clumsiness.
   ``Their antics _ and I'll admit I laughed at them myself _
helped create the public perception of me as a stumbler. And that
wasn't funny,'' said Ford.
   Now comes former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan,
reportedly saying in a forthcoming book that Mrs. Reagan used
astrology to determine the timing of presidential speeches and
travel. The report reminded people that the president also has
professed interest in astrology.
   Both Carter and Ford had elections coming up when the snickers
about the rabbit and the stumbles began. Both lost.
   Reagan doesn't have that to worry about. He isn't running.
   But Vice President George Bush is running, and he lost no time
joining in the fun.
   Aboard Air Force II as he began a three-day presidential
campaign swing through the West on Tuesday, Bush was asked about
Joyce Jillson, a Los Angeles astrologer who says the stars told her
Bush would be Reagan's best running mate in 1980.
   ``I'll likely work closely with her,'' Bush said. ``She's
brilliant. Joyce Jillson? Secretary of what?''

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop today defended
the mailing of a sexually explicit pamphlet on AIDS to every
American home, saying the brochure is designed to prevent ``the
greatest threat in the way of an epidemic we've ever had.''
   But the head of an anti-abortion group called it ``a
disreputable intrusion into family life.''
   Koop, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said, ``When you
send sexually explicit information into the homes of this country
in order to prevent the greatest threat in the way of an epidemic
we've ever had, I think that that is defendable.''
   In another interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' Koop declared,
``My position in this goverment is that of surgeon general. I'm not
the chaplain to the conservatives. And I have to be the surgeon
general to all of the people of this country, and if there's a
health message it has to be delivered.''
   The eight-page pamphlet, being mailed in sealed envelopes,
includes a description of the role of condoms in helping to prevent
the spread of the fatal virus.
   Judy Brown, president of the American Life League, called the
brochure ``a disreputable intrusion into family life.''
   Also interviewed on NBC, she said the pamphlet left out key
scientific evidence that would discourage promiscuity. She accused
Koop of suggesting that it's all right to have sex with an
unmarried partner ``if he's willing to discuss his former sex
habits with you.''
   ``What this brochure does is degrade, if you will, sexuality to
nothing more than a mechanical act that people are subconsciously
going to be involved in, that they cannot practice self-control,''
she said.
   The American Life League, which describes itself as a national,
Christian organization with 300,000 members, opposed President
Reagan's nomination of Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and
has called for the Roman Catholic church to excommunicate its
members who support abortion rights.
   Koop and Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen began
a series of appearances to draw attention to the massive mailing
aimed at informing every U.S. household about the dangers of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which has killed nearly 33,000
Americans.
   Koop told NBC: ``There is tremendous misinformation abroad in
this land... This will set the record straight. It tells you how
you will not get AIDS but tells you very explicitly how you can get
the virus.''
   Koop said his brochure was approved without changes by the White
House, although he did not know whether President Reagan had
personally gone over it.
   Koop was asked on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' about conservatives
who do not like the publication:
   ``This went to the White House, it was seen by the domestic
policy council, it was seen by the chief of staff. It was also
tested on 80 different focus groups, and 288 organizations with an
interest in AIDS had a part in this preparation,'' he said.
   ``It is still a good idea because we will be able to get
material into homes where famliies can discuss it and add their own
moral, religious, ethical values and not be afraid their youngsters
are going to learn things they'd rather not have them hear,'' said
Koop.
   Bowen told a news conference Wednesday the $17 million project
is ``the first time the federal government has attempted to contact
virtually every resident, directly by mail, regarding a public
health crisis.''
   Koop's photograph appears on the cover, along with a brief
message over his signature.
   ``Some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things
you are used to discussing openly,'' the surgeon general wrote. ``I
can easily understand that. But now you must discuss them. We all
must know about AIDS. Read this brochure and talk about it with
those you love.''
   Bowen said Koop was given the high-profile role in the project
because ``Americans know and have faith in the health advisories of
the surgeon general, and that trust will help ensure the success of
this effort.''
   There were a few complaints that such a mailer should have gone
out a year earlier, but the slick and explicit booklet drew
widespread praise for its contents.
   ``This pamphlet should be required reading for every American
citizen,'' the American Hospital Association said in a statement.
   ``Everyone who reads this mailer will understand the disease
better, and I hope this understanding will lead to urgency and
compassion, and replace panic and fear,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., who blamed unnamed ``White House censors'' for blocking
such a project last year.
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., criticized the mailing.
   ``You get the impression that none of us have anything to fear
from associating with people who have the virus, ARC (AIDS-related
complex) or AIDS,'' said Dannemeyer, whose district is next to
Waxman's. ``Nothing could be further from the truth. The report
should not go out to the American people.''
   The first batch of brochures is to be picked up by the U.S.
Postal Service in three days in preparation for deliveries starting
May 26. Posters have been distributed advertising: ``You Asked For
Answers About AIDS. They're In The Mail.''
   The second page of the brochure bears the heading ``How Do You
Get AIDS From Sex?'' and goes on to say it ``can enter the body
through the vagina, penis, rectum or mouth.''
   ``Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky,'' it
continues. ``The rectum is easily injured during anal intercourse.''
   The fourth page contains a headline asking: ``What Is All The
Talk About Condoms?''
   ``For those who are sexually active and not limiting their
sexual activity to one partner, condoms have been shown to help
prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. That is why
the use of condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of
AIDS.''

   A man impaled by 22 inches of a tree limb
that penetrated his abdomen in a logging accident is out of
intensive care today and says he considers himself very lucky to be
alive.
   Gary Crawford, 31, of Hazlehurst, was listed in fair condition
at a Savannah hospital.
   ``I remember everything,'' Crawford said. ``I remember asking
the Lord to help me, to get the stick out of me.''
   Crawford was operating a skidder, a heavy tractor used to haul
logs, near Stilson on April 29 when a tree limb penetrated the
heavy cage that protects the driver's seat from falling limbs.
   Candler County Sheriff Homer Bell said Crawford was driving over
cut-down trees and a branch on one of those trees struck him.
   Crawford's mother, Colleen Crawford, said the branch entered her
son's body in the groin area and bypassed his liver, kidneys and
bowels to press against the skin of his back.
   ``It (the limb) didn't break the skin in his back,'' she said.
``But 22 inches of the stick were inside my son's body.''
   He underwent several hours of surgery at Memorial Medical Center
in Savannah to remove the limb and was in an intensive care unit
for almost five days.
   Crawford said he suffered only nerve damage. ``I consider myself
pretty lucky,'' he said. ``I don`t know if I will be able to walk,
but I am not paralyzed. I just can`t s myth'' that Presser's and Williams'
elections ``had
been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements.''
   ``The FBI and the Department of Justice know that at this time
no such influence exists,'' said John R. Climaco, the union's
general counsel. ``It's a fiction, pure fiction.''
   Climaco said Presser and other top union officials ``feel
vindicated ... and are comforted by the fact that after over one
year of testimony, this jury was able to accurately ferret out the
truth.''
   Despite the setback in the Salerno case, some Teamster
officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they still
fear that Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, will
pursue a civil takeover attempt.
   ``They have been extremely adamant and cocky the past 30 days
about their intention to file this thing,'' one union official
said. ``Even this might not deter them.''
   The Justice Department used a similar suit under the RICO law in
1986 to place the 8,000-member Teamsters Local 560 in Union City,
N.J., under the control of a court-appointed trustee.
   The local, one of the largest in the union, had been under the
control of convicted and now imprisoned mob figure Anthony ``Tony
Pro'' Provenzano, who has been liked to the still-unsolved 1975
disappearance of former Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa.
   However, the government's takeover of Local 560 lacked the
political ramifications of its contemplated attempt to place an
entire international union under the control of a court-appointed
trustee.
   When word of the anticipated suit was leaked by anonymous
government sources last August, the Teamsters went on the
offensive, saying government ``takeovers of unions are nothing new
_ communists have been doing it for years.''
   The AFL-CIO, which had ousted the Teamsters on corruption
charges in 1957, immediately came to their defense, likening the
suit to the Soviet Union's crushing of the Solidarity labor
movement in Poland in 1981.
   Three months labor, the Teamsters were welcomed back into the
AFL-CIO in a move that the federation's president, Lane Kirkland,
said would not have happened had it not been for the contemplated
takeover suit. Some AFL-CIO leaders admitted the Teamsters'
reaffiliation was a defensive move.
   Government prosecutors had acknowledged that if the suit against
the Teamsters succeeded, their next targets were the Laborers
Union, the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union and the International
Longshoremen's Association.
   All three of those longtime AFL-CIO affiliates, along with the
Teamsters, were identified in a 1985 report by a White House
Commission on Organized Crime as being under the control or
influence of mob figures.
   Despite the Salerno verdict, the Teamsters' problems with the
Justice Department are far from over.
   Presser is scheduled to go on trial July 12 in Cleveland on
charges of participating in a payroll padding scheme to embezzle
$700,000 from a local there that he also heads.
   His attorneys have acknowledged that two men with alleged
organized crime connections were on the local's payroll while
performing no work for the union. But they said the FBI had
acquiesced in and even encouraged the scheme, and had used Presser
as a government informant for two decades.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet news agency Tass today issued a
blistering comment on President Reagan's remarks on human rights
and accused his administration of waging a massive onslaught on
civil liberties at home.
   In a speech Wednesday in Chicago, Reagan took an unusually
moderate tone toward the Soviet Union and deplored unemployment,
homelessness and racial bigotry in his own country.
   The speech was billed as a scene-setter for Reagan's May 29-June
2 summit meeting in Moscow with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
but Tass ignored Reagan's conciliatory remarks about the Soviet
Union and focused on the president's acknowledgement of problems in
his own country.
   ``Reagan had to admit that the situation is unfavorable in the
area of social and economic rights in the U.S.A.,'' Tass said.
``But the president asserted that these problems `belong to an
essentially different category from civil and political rights.'''
   In a more conciliatory tone, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov told a regular news briefing today that ``the
most interesting part of it (Reagan's speech) is that the president
recognized there are problems in the United States.''
   But he added that Reagan had spoken out for solving disputes
peacefully and said, ``We think that's a good idea for the Moscow
summit.''
   Tass was silent on comments Reagan had made about the human
rights situation in the Soviet Union. The president hailed the
release of some religious and political activists but said he hoped
for more improvements.
   But the Soviet news agency cited U.S. sources and statistics in
an attempt to debunk Reagan's claim that ``no government may
violate'' the freedoms of expression and assembly protected by the
Bill of Rights.
   ``It is precisely under the current administration that a
massive onslaught was launched on all these freedoms,'' Tass said.
   Reagan contended Americans have the right to free assembly, Tass
said. But it said it was recently documented that FBI agents in
1981-85 conducted active surveillance of more than 180 public,
religious and antiwar organizations who opposed administration
policy in Central America.
   ``Under the pretext of `combatting terrorism,' FBI agents were
present at meetings, protographed participants in demonstrations,
eavesdropped on telephone conversations,'' Tass said.
   Those FBI activities were made possible by an executive order
signed by Reagan in 1981, which ``sanctioned large-scale operations
for the surveillance of Americans, even if they are not suspected
of violating the law,'' Tass said.
   Tass quoted a prominent American lawyer, Floyd Abrams, as having
said the Reagan administration is apparently hostile to
constitutional provisions that declare citizens must have access to
information.
   The First Amendment to the Constitution protects the freedoms of
the press and speech, among others.
   Over the past seven years, Tass said, 50 percent to 70 percent
of Americans have consistently opposed aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   ``But the White House ignored the will of the majority of
Americans,'' even organizing a secret operation that broke U.S. law
to supply the Contras with weapons, it said.

   An airline baggage worker took a 70-minute

   The Boise Air Service employee's problems began Tuesday when he

   Surprised Alaska Airlines employees in Seattle found the man
after the plane landed about 4:35 p.m., airline spokesman Lou

   This is ``Tax Freedom Day'' and you are

   The Tax Foundation, a Washington research organization,
estimates that if everything you earned were earmarked for taxes
until your debt was paid, the average American would have been

   That is the latest date since the foundation began making the

The exercise assumes that all taxes, including those collected by
business, are paid by individuals.

   Vice President George Bush says he sometimes
holds back from speaking in White House meetings out of fear of
leaks and reluctance to have the president ``choosing between his
vice president'' and members of the Cabinet.
   He said the prospect of ``kiss and tell'' books about the Reagan
administration hinders the free exchange of views in the
government's highest circles.
   ``It inhibits freedom of expression, the vehemence with which
people express their views,'' Bush told a group of reporters
Wednesday during a campaign stop in Sacramento.
   He was referring to a recent book by former White House press
secretary Larry Speakes and a forthcoming one by former chief of
staff Donald T. Regan.
   ``If you think somebody is there writing a book putting his or
her own spin on it, you hold back,'' he said.
   ``I hold back speaking in meetings because I don't want the
president to have to be choosing between his vice president and the
other members of the Cabinet,'' said Bush.
   ``And I hold back sometimes because I worry about leaks.''
   The vice president planned to visit a high school in East Los
Angeles today before flying to Idaho as he continued a three-day
campaign swing through the West.
   Calling California a ``major battleground'' in the fall
election, Bush said: ``I'll be back. I'll be back. Have to. Got to
win this state.''
   He said he would ``absolutely not'' rule out California Gov.
George Deukmejian as a potential running mate.
   But he said he has not talked to the Republican governor about
the subject, nor to anyone else at this point, insisting he wants
to wait until after the Democratic convention in July before
deciding.
   Bush made light of reports, based on Regan's new book, that
Nancy Reagan has sought the help of astrologers in making
recommendations to her husband on scheduling.
   Bush said: ``I know it is a fascinating, titillating subject for
all, with particular emphasis on the journalistic community.''
   ``I may get more interested,'' he joked.
   A spokesman, Stephen Hart, said the vice president ``does not
consult astrologers or horoscopes or anything of the kind. He
doesn't even know where the horoscope is in the newspaper.''
   But speaking to reporters on Air Force II on Thursday, Bush
said: ``I'll tell you one thing: there are two edges to this
sword.''
   ``There are a helluva lot of people across this country that
read these columns. Otherwise, they wouldn't be in the papers.''
   Asked about Joyce Jillson, a Los Angeles astrologer who contends
she helped unidentified Reagan campaign aides select Bush as a
running mate in 1980, Bush said he had never heard of her.
   But he joked: ``I'll likely work closely with her. She's
brilliant.''
   In Sacramento, Bush said: ``Generally speaking, I don't like
kiss-and-tell books.''
   Bush also said Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega
should go, denying he had signed on to any possible White House
compromise to enable Noriega to step down from power instead.
   ``I want him to leave the country,'' Bush said.
   Bush also reiterated his charge that both Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson lack foreign policy
experience.
   When a reporter noted that Reagan did not have such experience
either upon taking office in 1981, Bush said: ``Maybe this guy
(Dukakis) could muddle through and make it; maybe Jackson could
too.''
   ``We'll never know whether President Reagan could have done an
even better job if he had foreign policy experience,'' he said. He
quickly added that Reagan's performance in foreign policy had been
splendid.

   Israeli troops seized 20 guerrillas and
brought them back to Israel after a two-day raid into southern
Lebanon that left at least 40 Arabs dead, sources said today.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would not hestitate
to make raids similiar to the strike that began Monday into the
area of southern Lebanon that Israel has designated its ``security
zone.''
   Three Israeli soldiers were killed during the operation.
   ``The point was to purge the security zone,'' Rabin told Israel
radio. ``There is nothing worse than allowing terror elements who
are active against us to establish themselves freely and feel free
to act against Israeli and targets in the security zone.''
   He said the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, Shiite
Moslem movement was singled out by the Israeli forces this time
because it ``has become one of the elements that most cooperates
with (Palestine Liberation Organization Chief Yasser) Arafat.''
   The Israelis confronted Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday in the
village of Maydoun north of the security zone in the fiercest
fighting of the operation.
   Reports from Lebanon said Israeli troops abandoned Maydoun after
blowing up houses and using bulldozers to cover up the rubble and
the bodies of the guerrillas. Army officials denied the village was
destroyed.
   ``Maydoun was not destroyed. What was destroyed were the
trenches, the bunkers,'' Col. Raanan Gissin, deputy army spokesman,
told reporters in Tel Aviv.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
Israeli-backed troops of the South Lebanon Army militia entered
Maydoun after the Israeli withdrawal to conduct a ``cleaning up''
mission.
   Israel Radio reported that the militiamen left Maydoun after
conducting searches and blowing up houses in the village. Army
officials confirmed that the militiamen returned to the security
zone.
   Military officials said a South Lebanon Army tank opened fire on
a guerrilla vehicle approaching Maydoun today and killed the
guerrillas inside. They did not elaborate.
   The Israeli sources also said today that Israeli troops arrested
20 guerrillas during the operation and brought them back to Israel.
   Critics questioned the wisdom of attacking Hezbollah, noting
that its guerrillas had not participated in any of the dozen
infiltration attempts by Palestinian guerrillas into Israel since
November.
   ``Why Hezbollah?,'' asked military analyst Uzi Mahanaimi in a
front page commentary in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
   ``Hezbollah is not the Israeli army's main enemy in south
Lebanon'' and has not tried to penetrate into northern Israel since
1982, Mahanaimi wrote.
   On Wednesday, helmeted soldiers riding armored personnel
carriers waved and made the ``V''-for-victory sign as they crossed
back into Israel.
   ``The mission ... was intended to clear the area from terrorist
strongholds, serve a warning signal to the local population, and
enhance our deterrence ... against terrorist activity,'' Gissin
said.
   But some experts said the mission could backfire and lead to
more guerrilla strikes against Israel.
   It was Israel's largest military operation in south Lebanon in
two years. Security sources said up to 2,500 Israeli troops took
part.
   Soldiers searched five villages in southeastern Lebanon on
Tuesday and Wednesday and distributed leaflets telling residents
not to assist guerrillas.
   Gissin said Shiite Moslem militiamen of Hezbollah drove
villagers out of Maydoun last year and took over the community. He
described Maydoun as a Hezbollah ``stronghold, fortified with
trenches, dugouts, and gun emplacements.''
   Army officials said Maydoun threatened outposts of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia and civilians living in
the Christian-dominated security zone, a six- to 10-mile-wide strip
north of Israel's border.
   Reporters covering the attack said there were 60-70 guerrillas
in Maydoun.
   Israeli paratroopers surrounded the village on Tuesday night
and, led by a dozen tanks, moved into Maydoun at dawn. Troops met
fierce opposition as they advanced slowly while fighting in
trenches and in house-to-house battles.
   One soldier died in the fighting and two others were killed when
Hezbollah and Lebanese army gunners shelled the assault force from
nearby Mashghara, site of a 50-man Syrian garrison.
   Israeli troops fired on Mashghara, and Israel radio quoted
Lebanese reports as saying five Lebanese army gunners were wounded.
The Israeli army said its ``attack helicopters and artillery struck
at and destroyed ... Lebanese army guns.'' Gissin denied Lebanese
reports that the Syrian garrison was hit.
   ``We took precautions that our artillery fire or even flat
trajectory fire would not be directed against the Syrians,'' Gissin
said. ``The results prove we succeeded. The Syrians did not make an
offensive move.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia today rejected Iran's
claim that it arrested a Saudi spy and told Tehran not to pursue
``misleading and venomous campaigns'' against the kingdom.
   Iran also claimed Wednesday that the Saudis beat up Iranian
diplomats before they left Saudi Arabia after Riyadh's decision to
severe relations with Tehran April 26.
   Riyadh rejected the claims as ``totally baseless.''
   ``It is not difficult for the government of Iran, with its
stigma of lying, to hire a mercenary from among its followers to do
and say what he is ordered,'' a Saudi government official said in a
statement distributed by the Saudi Press Agency.
   ``We warn the rulers of Tehran against exceeding the limits in
this manner, which is spurned by all sons of the Islamic nation,''
he said. ``We have decided to confront this misleading and venomous
campaign with all firmness and determination.''
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Wednesday
security authorities ``arrested an agent of the Riyadh regime who
had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials ($4.5
million).''
   ``He will be dealt with as a spy,'' the statement said.
Convicted spies may be sentenced to death under Iran's Islamic law.
   IRNA also quoted an unidentified Information Ministry official
as saying the man was planning to ``spread Wahabi faith and the
American brand of Islam.''
   The Wahabis are an ultra-conservative Sunni Moslem movement.
Most Saudis, including Saudi Arabia's ruling family, are Wahabis.
The majority of Iranians are Shiite Moslems.
   IRNA earlier quoted Iranian officials as saying the Saudi
authorities had dealt ``barbarically'' with Iranian diplomats in
their embassy in Riyadh and consulate in the Red Sea port city of
Jidda Tuesday.
   That was the deadline for them to leave following the April 26
rupture of ties.
   Saudi television today screened a 15-minute film report showed
75 Iranian diplomats and their dependents at Riyadh and Jidda
airports as they left calmly with Saudi officials offering them
coffee and refreshments in the VIP lounges.
   An Iranian Boeing 707 was allowed to pick them up.
   Saudi-Iranian relations have deteriorated sharply over the past
year amid Iranian charges that the Saudis are aiding Iraq in its
war against Iran.
   The Iranians have attacked Saudi ships and vessels trading with
the kingdom in retaliation for Iraqi air strikes on their tankers
in the gulf.
   Relations between the two countries plummeted after
Iranian-inspired riots in the holy city of Mecca during the annual
Moslem pilgrimage last July 31.
   More than 400 Moslem pilgrims, including 275 Iranians, were
killed in the violence.
   The Iranians accused Saudi security forces of massacring the
Iranians. An Iranian mob later stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran
and fatally injured a Saudi diplomat.
   Iran also has called for the overthrow of the Saudi royal family
and stripping it of custody of Islam's holy shrines in Mecca and
Medina.

   Molloko, the California condor chick, took its
first meal from its ``mother,'' a hand puppet built to resemble an
adult condor.
   ``We introduced mom puppet to baby today. They hit it off
fine,'' San Diego Wild Animal Park spokesman Tom Hanscom said
Wednesday.
   The previous feedings of Molloko, the first captive-bred condor
in the history of the critically endangered species, were delivered
by hand.
   Condor keeper Beckie Usnik operated the puppet to feed as well
as preen Molloko. Officials use the puppet to eliminate human
contact and prevent the chick from ``bonding'' with its keepers.
   The chick, which hatched Friday with human help, has been eating
well, consuming about 15 ``pinkies,'' chopped baby mice, during
feedings spaced about two hours apart.
   Hanscom said the chick weighs 9.45 ounces, up from its hatching
weight of 6.75 ounces.
   The hatching of Molloko raised the California condor population
to 28. All of the rare birds are in captivity _ 15 at the Wild
Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The species' future rests with efforts to breed the bird in
captivity.

<HEAD>Fourth Suicide In Six Months Spurs Debate At MIT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fourth student suicide in six months
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has spurred debate
about the rigors of attending one of the world's top technological
schools.
   Since the death of Mark Kordos, 18, who jumped from his 13th
floor dormitory room April 8, students and faculty have questioned
whether MIT drives its already top-flight students too hard.
   Kordos, a junior from Morristown, N.J., was an excellent student
majoring in computer science who apparently had no academic or
personal problems. Family and friends said he was applying to the
best graduate schools in the country.
   But he left a note saying he considered himself a failure, and
friends said he was having trouble with some of his course work.
   Andrew Fish, editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper The Tech,
blamed unwarranted pressures on students, insensitive and
overachieving faculty members and a climate that creates loneliness
and depression.
   ``The compulsion to constantly work, often at the exclusion of
all other activities, can warp the minds and bodies of students,
sometimes with tragic results,'' Fish wrote in a column.
   Kordos was the sixth MIT student to kill himself since 1986. All
were young men, and there is no evidence that any had known one
another.
   Administrators at MIT, which has about 9,600 students, said the
overall rate of suicide at the school is no higher than the
national average of approximately 1.4 suicides per 10,000
college-age students a year.
   Before the recent deaths, suicides were rare at MIT, officials
said. There were none in 1985, one in 1984, two in 1983 and none
from 1979-82.
   The suicide rate of Americans under 25 has tripled in the last
30 years, and suicide is now the second-leading cause of death of
college students.
   ``There is no evidence I've been able to come across that
matters at MIT are out of line with what is happening with youth
throughout the country,'' MIT Provost John Deutch told The Boston
Globe.
   Six members of MIT's faculty are Nobel Laureates, and 14 have
received the National Medal of Science. Because MIT draws students
who are in the top 5 percent of their high school classes, it is a
place where the best and brightest quickly can become average or
below average.
   Ron Kordos, Mark's father, said MIT ``was absolutely a factor''
in his son's death.
   ``He was a superachiever _ he never earned a `B' in his life,''
Kordos said. ``But the issue was pressure. The sleep deprivation
and competition were so excessive. He was just being driven by the
system.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Vario, a reputed high-ranking Mafia figure
who figured prominently in the book ``Wiseguy,'' has died at a
Texas prison, authorities said. He was 73.
   Vario died Tuesday at a minimum security federal prison in Fort
Worth, where he was serving a six-year sentence for extorting air
freight companies at Kennedy International Airport, said Edward
McDonald, a Brooklyn-based federal organized crime prosecutor.
   Charlotte Barron, executive assistant to the warden, attributed
Vario's death to respiratory arrest due to chronic obstructive lung
disease.
   A reputed capo, or captain, in the crime organization once
headed by Thomas Lucchese, Vario allegedly controlled many of the
lucrative illegal activities at the airport.
   In interviews for Nicholas Pileggi's book, ``Wiseguy,'' federal
informant Henry Hill implied that Vario was the major unapprehended
beneficiary of the $5.8 million Lufthansa airlines robbery in 1978,
one of the largest in U.S. history.
   Before starting his sentence in the airport case, Vario served a
four-year term for conspiring to defraud the government in
connection with attempts to secure Hill's early release from prison.
   In ``Wiseguy,'' Pileggi describes Vario as ``a large man,
standing six feet tall and weighing over 240 pounds (who) appeared
even larger than he was. He had the thick arms and chest of a sumo
wrestler and moved in the lumbering manner of a big man who knew
that people and events would wait for him.''
   Hill, formerly Vario's protege, said he once saw Vario grab a
sawed-off baseball bat from his car and chase a nimbler man up five
flights of stairs to collect a loan-shark debt.

lawyers and businessmen to pay $3,240 to attend a conference put on
by the group that paid his wife's expenses to a similar forum in
China last year.
   Justice's chief spokesman Terry Eastland dismissed a series of
questions which have arisen since Meese's solicitation letter on
behalf of the group's conference in Japan was disclosed in news
accounts Tuesday.
   The private conference on U.S.-Japanese legal and economic
issues is set for Aug. 29-Sept. 1 and Meese is to head a U.S.
delegation as part of an official visit he is making to Japan at
the same time.
   The solicitation by Meese is under investigation by the Office
of Government Ethics, which is independent of the Justice
Department and polices a presidential order barring conflicts of
interest or actions which create an appearance of a conflict or of
favoritism.
   Eastland said at a news conference Wednesday that Assistant
Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, head of the department's office
of legal counsel, had reviewed the news accounts earlier in the day
and determined that Meese's action ``does meet applicable legal and
ethical standards.''
   Eastland, nevertheless, acknowledged that department officials
did not know when they approved the Meese letter that a
profit-making organization, the Citizen Ambassador Program of
Spokane, Wash., was recruiting conference participants and paying
$100 per traveler to its non-profit affiliate, People to People
International of Kansas City.
   He added that although Meese wrote his letter on plain
stationery, a department official, Joseph Morris, authorized People
to People to reproduce the attorney general's official letterhead
and Justice Department seal and assemble them atop the 30,000
copies of the Meese letter sent April 26 to lawyers and businessmen.
   Unauthorized use of the department seal is a federal crime.
   Eastland said that, at the invitation of People to People, Meese
had attended a similar international legal conference in China last
year and had sent a similar but smaller batch of solicitation
letters then.
   He said the group had paid the expense of Meese's wife, Ursula,
on that trip and produced a letter showing that it also paid the
expenses of Morris' wife, Deborah. Eastland said department
regulations allow private reimbursement of spousal trip expenses
under certain circumstances which were met in this case.
   In a July 16, 1987 letter to Morris, Tom Stillitano, Jr., of
People to People confirmed the group would pay the China expenses
of Mrs. Meese and Mrs. Morris, because ``their participation would
help emphasize the human side of this type of program, showing
that, while we are a nation of law, the essence of mutual
understanding is truly relating to each other on a people to people
level.''
   Eastland said, ``Because conferences of this kind clearly serve
the interests of the department and the U.S. government, and
because they benefit the American people, the attorney general's
role in this matter is entirely appropriate.''
   Cooper ruled that ``it's a question of whether it's in the
department's interest,'' not whether a profit-making group is
involved, Eastland said.
   Meese's letter was sent to people whose names were ``provided by
everyone from the American Bar Association, the advisory committees
on both sides, to the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan,'' said
Norm Swanson, chairman of the Citizen Ambassador Program.
   Eastland released an exchange of letters between Meese and his
Japanese counterpart, Justice Minister Yukio Hayashida.
   On March 15, Hayashida invited Meese to make an official visit
to Japan to coincide with the conference. Twenty days later, Meese
accepted the invitation and said he understood the two of them
would be invited to co-chair the conference called ``The U.S.-Japan
Bilateral Session: A New Era in Legal and Economic Relations.''
   People to People International is a non-profit organization set
up originally in the State Department by then-President Dwight
Eisenhower, Swanson said.
   The Citizen Ambassador Program, however, is a profit-making
organization that works exclusively to set up international
exchanges for People to People, Swanson said.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 20 grafs new with Jackson comments today on super
delegates, editing for transition; pick up 16th graf pvs bgng ``We

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said today he will ``appeal
for fairness'' to every ``super delegate'' and member of the
Democratic National Committee and try to convince those party
leaders that their support should correspond to the popular vote in
the primaries and caucuses.
   After spending the night with a farm family in this rural
Nebraska hamlet, Jackson told reporters that front-runner Michael
Dukakis' lead in delegates is an ``inflated, padded lead'' created
by super delegates committed to Dukakis.
   Super delegates are party leaders or elected public officials.
The Democratic Party designates 643 super delegates who have a
large voice at the national convention.
   Of those 643, Dukakis has the commitment of 166 thus far,
Jackson 46 and the remainder are uncommitted. Overall, Dukakis
holds a delegate lead of almost 600 over Jackson.
   Jackson, who in the last two days has begun outspoken criticism
of the super delegate system, said it gives voters the impression
that ``their vote does not count.''
   Asked if he intended to hold back his support for the party's
ticket if the delegate count did not directly correspond to the
popular vote, Jackson said, ``That's immature. Why should we
proceed in that atmosphere? Let's be reasonable, rational and
consistent.''
   Talking to a small group of reporters at the farmhouse of peace
activists Maxine and Fred Schroeder, Jackson took a jab at Dukakis'
gubernatorial problems in Massachusetts. He said there is a $77
million shortfall in the state budget and added, ``We cannot run
our country on state-by-state miracles.''
   He accused Dukakis of cutting money for pregnant teen-agers and
senior citizens. ``Some of our most vulnerable people have to bear
the burden of the cuts,'' he said.
   Dukakis has maintained that no existing services will be cut to
balance the Massachusetts state budget.
   Jackson spoke to a gymnasium full of students at Kearney High
School before heading to campaign in New Mexico and then California.
   Jackson has not said whether he intends to mount an all-out
challenge to party rules like the one he waged during his 1984
presidential race.
   Jackson complained Wednesday at a news conference and later in
an address to the Congressional Black Caucus that the popular vote
candidates win is not directly tied to the number of delegates they
receive toward the nomination.
   ``There must be some reasonable correlation between the popular
vote and the delegate count in a democracy,'' he told the black
congress members.
   ``We're not talking about generosity. We're talking about
reciprocity.''
   And he suggested that he expects such reciprocity as a condition
of his cooperation with the Democratic ticket in the general
election.
   Party leaders and the pundits, he said, are trying to figure out
`how you can get a combination of Jackson support, a short platform
and win.
   ``That's not a formula for winning,'' he said.
   The mention of the platform apparently was a signal that Jackson
wants more specifics in the party platform than does Democratic
chairman Paul Kirk, who has indicated it should be streamlined.
   Asked by reporters what he would do about his concerns regarding
delegates, the Democratic contender said, ``I can only appeal ...
for fairness.''
   Although he has suffered a string of losses to Dukakis,
including Tuesday in Ohio and Indiana, Jackson said he would fight
on and take the nomination. He won the District of Columbia, which
offered only a fraction of the delegates of Indiana and Ohio.
   ``We never before in history had the mathematical chance of
winning. We can win,'' he told the Black Caucus.
   But that would require winning virtually all of the delegates at
stake in the remaining seven primary states, as well as the support
of the super delegates.
   Jackson also met with members of the Congressional Democratic
Caucus in what chairman Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri called a
``warm and successful meeting.''
   And he held a session with several liberal activists, including
consumer advocate Ralph Nader and representatives of peace and
environmental groups.

   In Norco, an explosion in a catalytic cracker ripped through a
Shell Oil Co. refinery today, killing one person, leaving five
missing and injuring 33, and forcing 2,800 people to evacuate. The
blast, so powerful it set off burglar alarms 20 miles away in New
Orleans, triggered a fire visible for miles.

   In Los Angeles, a fire raged through five floors of a 62-story
office tower today, killing a man trapped in an elevator and
injuring 35 people as a rescue helicopter plucked 10 people from
the roof of the city's tallest building. The fire broke out late
Wednesday on the 12th floor of the First Interstate Bank and was
put out 3{ hours later. The cause was under investigation.

   In Henderson, fire smoldered today at a crater in the ruins of
Pacific Engineering and Production Co., a rocket fuel plant
destroyed by earthquake-force explosions Wednesday that flattened
an industrial park, killing one person and injuring more than 250.
   The blasts broke windows 10 miles away in Las Vegas, tweaked
seismographs 200 miles away, peeled off roofs, upended cars and
rocked a jetliner in flight.

   An explosion and fire ripped through a Shell
Oil Co. refinery today, leaving one person dead, 33 injured and
five missing, and forcing 2,800 residents to evacuate, officials
said.
   The blast was so powerful it broke windos and set off burglar
alarms 20 miles away, and Shell spokeswoman Sarah Coletti said both
plant workers and neighborhood residents were injured.
   ``My layaway bins are in the back yard. The back door where we
process shipments is completely blown off. There's daylight all
over the building,'' said Gloria Estillette, manager of a nearby
store smashed by the blast.
   The blast occurred at a catalytic cracker, which converts crude
oil to gasoline, but no cause was known, Coletti said. The fire was
brought under control 5{ hours after the 3:30 a.m. explosion, but
continued to burn.
   ``It looks like there is something on the ground that is
burning. It doesn't seem to burn out,'' said Jimmy Greco, riding in
a medical helicopter 1,000 feet over the scene.
   The blaze cast an eerie glare across the isthmus between the
Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain 20 miles upriver from New
Orleans. Thick, acrid smoke billowed over the area, looking like
thunderclouds in the red glow.
   The force of the blast blew out windows. The entire metropolitan
area was shaken awake as the rattling explosion set off burglar
alarms and broke plate glass windows.
   Hospital officials said 33 people were injured, including at
least 19 community residents. Shell spokesman Phil Schwin said five
people were unaccounted for.
   Schwin said damage went into the millions, including damage at
the main shop and control rooms. A small fire burned in the
distilling unit.
   ``I've never seen so much damage in Norco, even when hurricanes
have hit,'' said Ikey Lucas, director of St. Charles Parish
Emergency Operations.
   The area from Norco downriver to the Bonnet Carre Spillway was
ordered evacuated by a special emergency operations office,
affecting about 2,800 people, officials said.
   An evacuation center was set up at Destrehan High School, but
officials allowed everyone to return home after 9 a.m. except those
living on the two streets next to the refinery.
   ``It was very, very loud, one thunder behind the other, and it
shook the house,'' said one of the evacuees, Adam Mashia, 65, who
lives less than a mile from the plant. ``I thought, `Well, maybe
the Russians dropped a bomb.''
   The refinery sits in the middle of the heavily industralized
corridor along the Mississippi between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
Next to it is a Shell chemical plant, which suffered broken windows
from the blast.
   Wendy Jacobs, another Shell spokeswoman, said 92 of the plant's
1,600 employees were on duty at the time of the explosion.
   A sign with the familiar Shell logo just inside the refinery
gates still read, ``Complex Safe Days 616.''
   Tim Vial, a spokesman for the operations center, said that
Shell's own firefighting equipment and medical teams dealt with the
situation in the refinery.
   State police spokesman Mike Taylor said 4,000 gallons of foam
was being sent in to fight the blaze.
   Outside, the area was sealed off by emergency officials.
Firefighting equipment, law enforcement vehicles and other
emergency equipment clogged the area, standing by in case it was
needed.
   The force of the blast smashed a discount store that sat beside
the refinery's fence, knocking down the back walls and breaking the
roof in half. Glass was everywhere.
   ``You have to see it to believe it,'' said Estillette, manager
of Bill's Dollar Store. ``The roof on top of the clothing
department came completely down. ... We're just lucky it happened
when it did because if it was in the daylight, it would have been
much worse.''
   Two state police hazardous materials specialists were called to
the scene, but Coletti said there were no reports of toxic fumes.
   ``Right in the middle of the plant, the fire is spread over two
hundred square feet, maybe one hundred square feet. It is confined
to one area, west area of the plant, but it is confined to one
area,'' Greco said in an interview by radio with The Associated
Press as he flew over the plant.
   The dead man worked for Shell, Coletti said. Twenty-eight
injured people were taken to River Parishes Medical Center at
LaPlace, and five others were taken to St. Jude AMI Hospital in
Kenner.
   Rose McDuffie, community relations director at River Parishes,
said 21 of the injured were treated for cuts and bruises and
released, and that 19 were community residents.
   McDuffie said two were transferred to West Jefferson Medical
Center.
   One of the two transferred patients sustained burns over 80
percent of his body and was listed in critical condition, said
Beverly Trahan, nursing supervisor at the hospital. The other had
cuts and other types of injuries and was listed in guarded
condition, she said.

   A man was stabbed several times by a
burglar after he woke up to find the intruder trying to kiss his
girlfriend, authorities said.
   Raymond Barrentine, 33, was reported in stable condition at the
Vicksburg Medical Center after undergoing surgery for stab wounds
in his back and chest.
   His girlfriend and the assailant were unhurt in the struggle
early Wednesday.
   Police arrested Anthony Bell, 22, wearing blood-soaked clothing,
at a convenience store. He was being held in lieu of $50,000 bond,
facing charges of burglary and aggravated assault, Chief of
Detectives Bob Woods said.
   Barrentine and his girlfriend were asleep at his house when she
awoke to find a man trying to kiss her and began screaming.
   Woods said the two men fought and Barrentine was stabbed at
least five times with a six-inch hunting knife.
   ``They fought all over that house,'' Vicksburg police
investigator Mark Culbertson said. ``They tore that house up. There
was blood everywhere.''
   Culbertson said there was no indication the burglar knew
Barrentine or the woman. After the fight, the intruder ran outside,
broke windows with a steel object and ran away, Culbertson said.

   Democratic front-runner Michael S. Dukakis and his
wife, Kitty, had joint income of $108,957 last year and paid nearly
a quarter of that amount in federal taxes, according to personal
income tax reports made public today.
   The Massachusetts governor's income was about half the total
reported by Democratic rival Jesse Jackson and a little more than
one-third the 1987 income reported by Vice President George Bush,
the likely Republican presidential nominee.
   The Dukakises paid $25,892 in taxes, or just under 24 percent of
their income.
   The governor also is the actual or potential beneficiary of
family trusts totaling more than $1 million. No income from the
trusts was listed on his tax returns.
   Dukakis earned nearly $85,000 in salary as governor laat year.
   The couple also reported $1,445 in taxable interest income, from
two Massachusetts bank accounts, along with $452 in income they had
from tax refunds they received a year ago.
   In addition, Dukakis reported $176 in income from the state of
Massachusetts beyond his government salary. Aides said the amount
reflected the benefit the governor receives from his occasional use
of state automobiles on personal business.
   Mrs. Dukakis reported $20,000 in salary for her role as director
of the Public Space Partnership Project at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, a collaborative program that
mobilizes public and private resources to improve the appearance of
prominent public spaces.
   In addition, Mrs. Dukakis reported $2,000 in income for her role
as a director of Mastery Education Corp., a publisher of college
textbooks.
   As in past years, Dukakis reported no deductible interest
payments. The mortgage on his home in suburban Brookline has been
paid off, and the governor does not use credit cards.
   His tax form said he spent $300 to have his taxes prepared by an
accountant.
   Two weeks ago, Bush and his wife Barbara reported 1987 earnings
of $308,396. They paid $86,684 in taxes.
   Earlier this week, Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, reported
1987 earnings of nearly $210,000 and payments of $53,631 in federal
taxes.

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
today denounced Reagan administration economic policies and said
progress will require greater educational efforts. He promised to
do more than talk about education for political gain.
   Dukakis' likely November Republican opponent, Vice President
George Bush, declares in almost every campaign speech that he wants
to be ``the education president.''
   However, Dukakis said, ``The next president must be this
nation's No. 1 advocate for educational opportunity and good
schools, not just during election years but every day and every
week and every month.''
   ``In a Dukakis administration, we're going to make the same kind
of commitment to excellence and high standards that launched an
explosion in scientific and economic progress under John Kennedy a
generation ago,'' Dukakis said at the University of Charleston.
   ``We're going to invest in our people; we'e going to invest in
new technology; we're going to invest in research,'' Dukakis said.
   On Reagan-Bush economic policies, Dukakis said the
administration has ignored regional development while allowing
corporate raiders to orchestrate mergers that have brought them
millions in profits while costing jobs.
   Dukakis also was touring a West Virginia coal mine before headng
to Nebraska to campaign. Both states have presidential primaries
Tuesday.
   In Boston, meanwhile, income tax reports made public today
showed Dukakis and his wife Kitty made $108,957 in total income
last year and paid just under 24 percent of that amount in federal
taxes.
   Upon arriving in West Virginia early today, Dukakis wooed voters
with a promise to help the state's coal industry.
   Dukakis said he would encourage the construction of electricity
plants near the state's coal mines, with the power to be sold to
the energy-dependent Northeast.
   ``We now are buying power from Canada,'' he said. ``I'm willing
to pay a little more and I think most Americans are, too,'' to rely
on U.S. suppliers.
   In Boston, before heading to West Virginia, he said he welcomed
continued competition from Democratic rival Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis said he had a friendly discussion with Jackson on
Wednesday morning, the day after Dukakis' big wins in Ohio and
Indiana.
   At the same time, Dukakis campaign aides said privately that
Jackson should tone done his recent criticism of Dukakis.
   On Tuesday, the day that his Ohio and Indiana primary victories
pushed him closer to the nomination, Dukakis named Marcia Hale, a
veteran Democratic political operative, as his manager for the
Democratic National Convention.
   The Dukakis campaign also has brought in Richard Moe, Kirk
O'Donnell, Anne Wexler and Charles Campion as campaign advisers and
likely will add more veterans of national campaigns in coming weeks.
   Moe was Vice President Walter Mondale's chief of staff and
informally advised Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt's presidential
campaign. O'Donnell is a former aide to ex-House Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neil. Wexler worked for Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 vice
presidential campaign and Campion is a Boston political consultant
who will serve as the campaign's national political coordinator.
   Just a month ago, it appeared Dukakis would head into the
convention short of the 2,081 delegates needed for nomination. Now
that it appears more likely he will have that number or close to
it, more advisers are being brought in to help prepare for
convention platform discussions and the general election.

   Federal agents expect they'll have a record,
4-ton cocaine seizure once they finish inspecting all 9,000 boards
in a shipmment of hollowed-out, cocaine-packed Brazilian lumber.
   Two Colombians and an American, meanwhile, were in custody on
drug conspiracy charges, awaiting bond hearings Friday before a
federal magistrate.
   The haul from the British-registered Amazon Sky reached 3,500
kilograms, or 7,700 pounds, by late morning, said authorities, who
expect the yield to hit 8,800 pounds by the time the inspection is
finished later today or Friday.
   ``If true, it would represent the largest cocaine seizure in
U.S. history,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   The largest previous cocaine seizure was 8,700 pounds found
stuffed inside picnic furniture delivered to Port Everglades in
November 1987.
   An anonymous letter from Cali, Colombia, in February tipped drug
agents that the freighter Amazon Sky would be docking in Florida
with 4,000 kilos of cocaine hidden in lumber, authorities said.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents believe the cocaine,
with an estimated street value of $1.7 billion, was imported by the
Cali cartel.
   The cocaine was headed for New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and
Miami, centers of the Cali cartel's distribution network, agents
said.
   The Cali group ``is a world-class competitor of the Medellin
cartel,'' the violent Colombian gang believed responsible for up to
80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports, said Tom Cash, head of the
Miami DEA office.
   Michael Tsalickis, owner of the Amazon Sky and a Tarpon Springs
warehouse where the cocaine-filled lumber was stashed, was charged
with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine, as were Fredy
Perez and Pedro Narvaez, authorities said.
   Tsalickis, 60, is an associate of two top Cali cartel leaders,
Gilberto Rodriguez and Jose Santacruz Londono, according to DEA
files.
   Tsalickis, a native of Tarpon Springs who has been written about
in National Geographic magazine, has operated numerous businesses,
including a monkey farm and lumber mills in Leticia, Colombia.
   The Amazon Sky loaded 459 bundles of cedar in Brazil, then
stopped in Leticia, Colombia, where perhaps half of the boards were
hollowed out, stuffed with cocaine in one-kilo packets and
resealed, Cash said.
   The vessel then went down the Amazon River and arrived at
Bayboro Harbour in St. Petersburg on April 19.
   DEA and U.S. Customs Service inspectors staked out the ship. A
Customs inspector later slipped aboard, drilled into a lumber
bundle and found cocaine on his first try, Cash said.
   Federal agents set up round-the-clock surveillance, obtained
search warrants and brought in audio-video and X-ray equipment.
   The whole shipment was unloaded to a warehouse in St.
Petersburg. A few days later, 224 bundles of 24 boards each were
transported to Tsalickis' Tarpon Springs warehouse, authorities
said.
   Merkle said the cocaine-filled lumber was found at the Tarpon
Springs site, not in the wood left behind in St. Petersburg.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson complained today that front-runner
Michael Dukakis has an ``inflated padded lead'' in convention
delegates that does not reflect the popular primary vote. Vice
President George Bush said he sometimes keeps quiet at Cabinet
meetings to avoid making the president choose sides.
   For a second day, Jackson criticized his party's nominating
rules. He told reporters he will contact every ``super delegate'' _
the 643 party leaders and elected officials who have a voice in
choosing the nominee _ with ``appeals for fairness'' and try to
persuade them that the super delegate split should correspond to
the primary and caucus vote.
   Of those 643 super delegates, Jackson has 46, Dukakis 166 and
the others remain uncommitted. Overall in the delegate chase,
Dukakis has 1,500 of the 2,081 needed to clinch the nomination and
Jackson has 927.
   Despite the numbers, Jackson continued to insist ``we're within
striking distance'' as he campaigned in Nebraska, which holds its
primary next week.
   But the Dukakis people were beginning to talk about being within
striking distance too _ of the nomination. Campaign communications
director Leslie Dach said Dukakis could clinch it in the remaining
five weeks worth of primaries _ a goal that seemed impossible in
the muddled contest of a few months ago.
   ``The arithmetic is clearly there,'' said Dach.
   Dukakis himself kept to a careful course, avoiding any direct
objections to the criticism Jackson has been leveling at him lately.
   ``I don't mind the competition at all as long as we can keep the
campaign up where it belongs and keep it positive,'' the
Massachusetts governor told reporters in Boston.
   Dukakis headed today for the poverty-scarred coal country of
West Virginia, which also holds a primary next Tuesday, and
criticized Bush for his standard campaign line of wanting to be
``the education president.''
   ``The next president must be this nation's No. 1 advocate for
educational opportunity and good schools, not just during election
years but every day and every week and every month,'' Dukakis said.
   At home in Boston, the Dukakis campaign released tax returns
that showed the governor and his wife earned $108,957 last year and
paid $25,892 in taxes.
   On the Republican side, Bush was campaigning in California
today, as aides talked of the importance of the West in the general
election.
   On Wednesday, Bush said that fear of ``kiss and tell'' books has
sometimes kept him from speaking up in Cabinet meetings.
   Bush said Wednesday that other times he keeps quiet at the
meetings ``because I don't want the president to have to be
choosing between his vice president and the other members of the
Cabinet.''
   Since the vice president already has secured enough delegates to
win the nomination, the main suspense concerns his running mate.
Bush said Wednesday he would ``absolutely not'' rule out
California's governor, George Deukmejian. Kansas Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, meanwhile, said she's not interested in the job.
   Bush has sometimes been criticized for not saying more about his
opinions of Reagan administration policies and his role in
developing them. Dukakis, for one, has called him a ``blank slate.''
   On Wednesday, Bush offered an explanation for his reticence,
saying it stems from concern about ``kiss and tell'' books written
by former White House insiders.
   The vice president cited books like the ones written by ex-White
House spokesman Larry Speakes and former chief of staff Donald
Regan.
   ``It inhibits freedom of expression, the vehemence with which
people express their views,'' Bush told reporters in Sacramento.
``If you think somebody is there writing a book putting his or her
own spin on it, you hold back. ... I hold back sometimes because I
worry about leaks.''
   The vice president made lighthearted reference to one of the
revelations in the forthcoming Regan book _ that Nancy Reagan has
consulted astrologers about the president's schedule. He joked that
an astrologer claiming to have helped pick him as Reagan's running
mate in 1980 might make a good member of his own Cabinet.
   ``She's brilliant,'' Bush said, adding that if anyone was
interested, he and his wife Barbara are both Geminis.
   Spokesman Stephen Hart said Bush himself doesn't consult
astrologers or horoscopes himself, but the vice president said:
``I'll tell you one thing. ... There are a helluva a lot of people
across this country that read these columns.''
   Dukakis also had a little fun with the reports of astrological
influence at the White House. He joked to a crowd at a New York
Democratic dinner that his horoscope said he was headed for better
things. According to the stars, Dukakis said, it was ``pointless to
remain'' in his present position.
   While Dukakis studiously avoids saying he expects to be the
Democratic nominee, in the past few days he has been recruiting
some experienced political operatives to work in his likely
campaign against Bush.
   He picked Marcia Hale as his manager for the Democratic National
Convention, and joining the campaign as advisers are Democratic
veterans Richard Moe, Kirk O'Donnell and Anne Wexler.
   Meanwhile, Democrat Paul Simon, whose presidential campaign is
on hold, said he is ``95 percent certain'' that Dukakis will win
the nomination. But Simon said he'll hang onto his own delegates
``in the unlikely event that Michael Dukakis stubs his toe between
now and the convention.''

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's legal
troubles began last May 11 when independent counsel James C. McKay
launched a criminal investigation of his activities.
   Here is a summary of the various matters that have been
investigated:
   _The involvement of Meese when he was White House counselor with
Wedtech Corp., a New York City defense contractor on whose behalf
Meese intervened in 1981 at the behest of his longtime friend, E.
Robert Wallach.
   _The attorney general's actions, again at Wallach's request, in
connection with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. Wallach, a
San Francisco lawyer, was representing one of the project's
partners.
   _Meese's $14,000 in telephone industry stock holdings at a time
when he met with executives of the regional Bell companies, who
were seeking a reversal of Justice Department policy opposing
expansion into new areas of business by the regional firms. Wallach
wrote a memo to Meese urging him to become personally involved in
the matter, and within weeks the attorney general approved a
reversal of the department's position.
   _Meese's relationship to a Washington real estate family that
leases space to the Justice Department and arranged to pay a
$40,000 yearly salary to Meese's wife, Ursula, at a localcharity.
   _In a matter unrelated to McKay's inquiry, the Office of
Government Ethics is launching an investigation into why Meese
solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessmen to pay more than $3,000
apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference in
Japan.

<HEAD>State Joins Challenge of Ban on School Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has joined parents and civil
liberties groups in opposing a federal judge's decision that
permits a school district to ban two classics criticized as
promoting sex and women's liberation.
   When U.S. District Judge Susan Black ruled for the Columbia
County School Board on Jan. 29, she cited a controversial Jan. 13
Supreme Court ruling that allowed school officials in Hazelwood,
Mo., to censor a school newspaper.
   The Florida Department of Education joined the education
departments of Maryland, California and Wyoming and 14 other groups
in an appeal of the ruling, which upheld a ban on ``Lysistrata''
and ``The Miller's Tale.''
   The groups, marshaled by People For the American Way, prepared a
friend-of-the-court brief that was submitted to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this week.
   Syd McKenzie, general counsel for the state Department of
Education, said the department was concerned ``because it involved
a state-approved textbook and for that reason we think Judge Black
was overbroad in the authority she granted to the School Board.''
   Four parents filed suit against the Columbia County School Board
after it banned the two works from high school classrooms.
   Black, in her ruling, said she did not like the action taken by
the Columbia County School Board in 1986 after receiving complaints
from a pastor that the works promoted ``pornography and women's
lib.''
   But the judge ruled that the Hazelwood decision affirmed the
broad power of school boards to make curriculum decisions.
   Jan. G. Levine, an attorney for People for the American Way, a
270,000-member organization founded in 1980 by television producter
Norman Lear, said the case is important because it is one of the
first to follow the Hazelwood ruling.
   ``We hope the ruling is not interpreted so broadly that it
allows banning of the classics,'' she said.
   In the ancient Greek comedy ``Lysistrata,'' by Aristophanes,
women of warring Sparta and Athens conspire to deny sex to their
husbands until the men end their fighting.
   In ``The Miller's Tale,'' written in the 14th century by
Geoffrey Chaucer, a carpenter's wife deceives her husband and a
would-be suitor to cavort with a tenant in her house.

   The House voted 385-23 today to order
President Reagan to use U.S. military might to stop the flow of
illegal drugs into the United States.
   The vote approved a proposal backed by conservative Republicans
to tell Reagan to ``deploy equipment and personnel of the Armed
Forces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of United States
borders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics.''
   But the measure is a long way from becoming law. Even Rep. Jack
Davis, R-Ill., one of its strongest supporters, admitted, ``Yes, it
is flawed.''
   The proposal was added as an amendment to a Pentagon budget
bill. The final provisions of the huge bill will be worked out
later this year by a House-Senate conference committee after the
Senate approves its version of the bill.
   In two previous years, 1985 and 1986, the House also voted to
use the military to help stop drug trafficking, but those
provisions were knocked out by the conference committee. They were
strongly opposed by the Pentagon.
   ``The problem is that our southern borders are just a sieve of
cocaine and heroin coming over unchallenged every night,'' Davis
told his colleagues. ``We want to bring the front lines into this
battle against this poison coming across our borders.''
   Rep. Tommy Robinson, D-Ark., said, ``It's time to use the armed
forces to stop the drug cartel.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, opposed the amendment because he said it should be
considered as part of a separate package of anti-drug legislation
now being prepared.
   ``We do not want to deal with this problem on a piecemeal
basis,'' Aspin said. ``We have a drug bill coming up in which we
have to deal with not just the military involvement, but all the
questions about drugs.''
   But Davis and other supporters didn't want to discuss
technicalities. ``Americans aren't going to understand what we're
doing here. America only wants this amendment to be adopted. They
want the military involved in stopping drug traffic,'' said Davis.
   Today's vote came a day after Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci warned that he might recommend a veto of the bill unless
Congress votes enough money for Reagan's Star Wars missile defense
system.
   His admonition came as the Democratic-controlled House voted
223-195 to provide $3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.
   That is $1.3 billion less than Reagan sought for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 and is even below the current $3.9 billion budget
for the 5-year-old program.
   But the decision Wednesday is part of the maneuvering in the
complicated congressional budget process, according to Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   The Senate next week will begin considering its version of the
defense budget bill and even though that chamber is also controlled
by Democrats, it is more conservative and Reagan's defense program,
including Star Wars, has generally fared better in the Senate.
   The Senate bill proposes $4.6 billion for Star Wars. If that
figure remains, the House-Senate conference committee called to
reconcile differences will likely reach a compromise at about $4.1
billion, Aspin said.
   ``We'll probably split the difference in conference between our
$3.5 billion we voted today and the Senate number and come in
around $4.1 billion,'' Aspin said after the long series of votes.
   The House Armed Services Committee had originally recommended
$4.1 billion, but that was rejected on a 227-190 vote. Earlier, a
312-105 decision turned down an amendment to grant Reagan his
entire $4.9 billion request, and a 299-118 tally rejected another
proposal to block all SDI spending.
   Carlucci, in a letter read during the debate, said he was
unhappy with the $4.1 billion level voted by the committee because
it ``would cause major restructuring and delays in the program.
Further reductions in funding or other restrictions on the program
would have the gravest consequences.''
   Carlucci said that ``if the Congress sends the president a
defense bill that contains a funding level for SDI that is in my
view inadequate, I would have no choice but to recommend a veto of
that bill.''
   But his letter didn't define that inadequate level. Aspin said:
``I don't know exactly what it is, but I would think that if we do
come in at $4.1 billion, that would be enough. I would hope so.''
   Aspin noted that Reagan has threatened in past years to veto
Pentagon budget bills which contain Democratic-backed restrictions
the administration opposes, but has yet to carry out that threat.
   The House also voted 244-174 Wednesday to limit spending on
SDI's ``phase one'' to 40 percent of the total budget. ``Phase
one'' is aimed at building an early version of the missile defense
and current plans called for raising ``phase one'' spending from 40
percent to 50 percent of the SDI program.

   Popcorn king Orville Redenbacker
will receive an honorary doctor of agriculture degree from Purdue
University on May 15 for his more than 40 years of corn research.
   ``This is truly an honor to receive such a degree from my alma
mater,'' said Redenbacker, a 1928 graduate of Purdue.
   ``After all, Purdue not only pioneered research in popping corn
hybridization, but they also helped begin my `pop to the top' in
the popcorn industry,'' said Redenbacker, 80, who now lives in
Coronado, Calif.
   Redenbacker worked as a county extention agent and then as a
farm manager in Indiana before establishing Chester Inc., a
diversified agricultural company, in Valparaiso in 1952. He
marketed his popping corn personally, traveling across the country
to persuade store owners to carry it and appearing in his own
commercials.
   In 1976 he sold his business to Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson, but he
continues to be a spokesman for the label that carries his name.

   A state child protection worker with a
history of disciplinary problems shot her supervisor and a
co-worker in their office, killing one and critically injuring the
other, authorities say.
   Paulette M. Fiedler, 37, of Aurora, an investigator with the
state Department of Children and Family Services since 1980, was
ordered held without bond Thursday, said Assistant State's Attorney
Robert Kilander.
   Ms. Fiedler was charged Wednesday with murder and attempted
murder in the death of Dale Rowell, 39, of Wheaton, and the
wounding of Bob Heft, 38, of Villa Park.
   Police believe she walked into the office of Rowell, her
supervisor, Wednesday afternoon and shot him while he sat at his
desk.
   ``Mr. Rowell was on the telephone and told the person to whom he
had just been speaking that he had just been shot,'' said DCFS
spokeswoman Jo Warfield.
   Police said Heft apparently heard the shots and approached.
   ``Seeing what had happened, he turned to walk away and was shot
in the back,'' said Du Page County Sheriff's Lt. Bruce Wachtel.
   After the shooting, office workers said, Ms. Fiedler walked to
her desk and sat there until police arrested her.
   Heft was in critical condition today at Loyola University
Medical Center, said Linda Blaha, a spokeswoman.
   Ms. Warfield said DCFS officials were checking files to
determine what problems might have existed between Ms. Fiedler and
Rowell.
   ``I think it could be best characterized as a troubled
relationship with her supervisor,'' the spokeswoman said. She added
that she did not know if Ms. Fiedler had been threatened with
dismissal.
   But Ms. Warfield said Ms. Fiedler had ``experienced difficulties
in dealing with co-workers, and the department had been working
with her trying to resolve that.''
   The DCFS child-protection system recently came under fire from
employee representatives. Two women who had worked as agency
caseworkers were indicted in April on charges of criminal
misconduct for falsifying records of home visits. At issue in both
cases was the death of an abused child.
   Union leaders contend the two women are being used as scapegoats
for an overburdened system.

<HEAD>Banned D.H. Lawrence Novel To Be Published In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   D.H. Lawrence, the controversial author whose
sexually explicit novel, ``Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' was
effectively banned in China last year, is now hailed here as one of
England's finest writers.
   For the past year, conservatives in China's leadership launched
a so-called ``anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign'' against
Western culture, and Lawrence's classic was one of the targets.
   Although the book was not illegal, the government had
discouraged its publication, according to the Press and Publication
Administration.
   In January, a publishing house in southern China's Hunan
province announced plans to again publish the novel, in addition to
a six-volume collection of Lawrence's works.
   ``Lawrence seems to be regaining his place in China's literary
community,'' said the official English-language China Daily on
Thursday. It said the change was the result of more open attitudes
toward art and literature.
   The author of the comments was Suo Tianzhang, an English
professor who wrote the introduction to the six-volume collection
of Lawrence works.
   Suo said the announcement by the North China Literature and Arts
Publishing House of plans to publish the novel ``heralded his
(Lawrence's) rehabilitation.''
   ``Lawrence is not a frivolous writer, and his `Lady Chatterley's
Lover' is not pornography,'' he said.
   ``Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' written in 1928, is the story of an
English noblewoman who has a love affair with her husband's
gamekeeper. It caused an uproar because of the explicit sex scenes
and was banned in the United States and England for many years.
   According to Suo, participants at a recent Chinese literary
seminar called Lawrence ``the most important English novelist since
Thomas Hardy, some placing him one niche higher than Irishman James
Joyce.''
   He said Lawrence was introduced to China in the late 1920s and
early 1930s but lost favor in the 1950s and was regarded as a
decadent writer.

   The Soviet Union's Bolshoi Ballet will give its
first performance in China in 30 years in 1989, Soviet Minister of
Culture V.G. Zaharov said Thursday.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted Zaharov, now visiting
Beijing, as saying he hoped the visit would strengthen cultural
ties between China and his country.
   Almost all political, economic and cultural contacts between the
Soviet Union and China were suspended after the two Communist
governments split over ideological and strategic matters in 1960.
   China still refuses to normalize political ties because of the
Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and Soviet support for
Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia.
   However, since the early 1980s there has been a gradual increase
in trade and gradually improving cultural and academic ties.
   There were no details on when the visit would take place or
where the ballet would perform.

   China's construction of a nuclear power plant
43 miles away does not require Hong Kong to draw up an emergency
evacuation plan, a report released Thursday said.
   The report, drawn up for the British colony by the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, said Hong Kong is far enough away
from the Daya Bay plant that only monitoring and possibly control
of foodstuffs was needed in case of an accident, a government
statement said.
   The report called for establishment of a hot line between the
Daya Bay Control Center and Hong Kong's Royal Observatory.
   The Daya Bay plant is scheduled for completion in 1991.
   After the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the Soviet Union
in 1986, nearly 1 million Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents signed
petitions calling for the scrapping of Daya Bay.

   A burglar kidnapped a family of four today,
then shot to death an elderly couple and held one woman hostage,
authorities said. The hostage escaped and police later arrested a
suspect.
   Police said the crime spree began around 3 a.m. with a burglary
attempt at the home of William Morris, 44, his wife, Dea, 43, and
their sons, Robert and William, both 15.
   The intruder forced the family to drive approximately 50 miles
from their home near Spartansburg to Girard, where all four were
released unharmed.
   Dr. Mary Love, 69, and her husband, Frank, were slain by rifle
shots just before dawn in their home near Girard, said state
Trooper William Shaffer.
   After the Loves were slain, their assailant left in the couple's
car, holding a gun to the head of his hostage, police said.
   The woman, who was not immediately identified, got away
unharmed, said Shaffer, although he did not know how she escaped.
   Shaffer said the suspect was identified as Donald Harry Fultz,
35, of Union City. He was being held by state police but was not
immediately charged with any crime.

   Ipsita Roy Chakrabarty, self-described
witch and former schoolteacher, is accusing officials of failing to
protect witches in West Bengal state, where at least 20 suspected
sorcerers were murdered last year.
   The 44-year-old housewife went public Saturday after Chief
Minister Jyoti Basu, the top government official of West Bengal
state, disclosed the slayings during a discussion on crime in the
state.
   ``Are we repeating and perpetrating the misdeeds and mistakes of
medieval Europe ?'' Mrs. Chakrabarty said. ``Why is there nobody to
call the killing of witches in present-day India brutal and
superstitious ?''
   Basu, who heads the Communist Marxist Party in West Bengal, said
April 27 that at least 27 people had been arrested in the killings
of the suspected witches in the eastern state, which borders
Bangladesh.
   Basu had no details on how the women were killed or who was
arrested, but he said the women were slain only because they were
suspected of practicing witchcraft.
   Tribal members in parts of West Bengal believe that many women,
especially widows, have the power to heal the sick and the ability
to cast evil spells. Women thought to be witches often are attacked
when misfortune befalls members of the tribe.
   ``There is no such woman as the storybook witch,'' Mrs.
Chakrabarty told a news conference in Calcutta, capital of West
Bengal state.
   ``It is unthinkable that Jyoti Basu, leading a Marxist
government which believes neither in God nor the devil, should
nonchalantly reel out figures of the murders of innocent women as a
piece of statistics.''
   Mrs. Chakrabarty said she is the eastern high priestess of a
Montreal-based coven, which she refused to identify further.
   She told reporters that she lived in the Canadian city when she
was a young woman before returning to her parents' home in Calcutta
in 1968 to complete her education. She majored in English
literature and taught at a prestigious secondary school before her
marriage.
   Her husband is a government official, but she prefers not to
publicize his name and job title for fear of repercussions. The
couple has a 10-year-old daughter.
   ``Witchcraft is not black magic, and it need not necessarily be
evil,'' Mrs. Chakrabarty said. ``It can be misused, but that
depends on the practitioner. Any science can be evil if put into
the wrong hands.
   ``I, as the high priestess of a witches' coven, claim that we
have worked successfully for the benefit of individuals who have
been suffering from various disorders,'' she said. ``We are not
superwomen, but we have succeeded in helping where conventional
science has failed.''
   Mrs. Chakrabarty said witches use water electrically charged by
touch or rock quartz to cure the sick.
   ``Our touch can calm. Our eyes can comfort or impart energy if
the need be so,'' she said. ``We believe that the powers we invoke
from the outer elements charge us with a certain strength, which
can pass onto others.''

   Neighbors of a Shell Oil Co. refinery said
thoughts of bombings, plane crashes or worse crossed their minds as
they were jolted out of bed today by an explosion.
   The powerful blast blew doors from their hinges and damaged
roofs, walls and furnishings. One plant worker died, several people
were missing and at least 30 people were injured, authorities said.
   About 2,800 people were briefly evacuated from the area around
the plant.
   ``When I first heard it, I thought it was either a small plane
crash or the Shell plant,'' said Alan Migliore, who lives about
three blocks from the refinery complex.
   ``I was sleeping in the kitchen and it knocked me to the floor.
From there, I looked up and could see that the whole area to the
Shell was on fire. ... It blew both of the front doors in, and the
deadbolts took the frames out,'' he said.
   His mother, Mary, said: ``I have a four-post bed and one of the
posts stopped the door from hitting me. That post saved my life.''
   Another neighbor, Adam Mashia, said: ``When it blew, it knocked
me out of bed. I had no idea what it was. It was just a great
thunder. It went boom and then boom again. It knocked me to the
floor and as I was getting up, it knocked me down again.''
   Mashia, 65, was among 55 people who sought shelter at Destrehan
High School.
   Mashia said he pulled on some clothes, got into his car and
drove to the shelter immediately. He noticed the ground was still
shaking as he made his way out of the house.
   ``It all went through my mind,'' he said. ``I thought, `Well,
maybe the Russians dropped a bomb.'''
   Eula Vickner, 53, was spending the night with her mother, Lelia
Landry, 80, across the street from Migliore. ``I was laid down on
the bed and then we heard the explosions. All the windows were
blown in and the doors,'' she said.
   Mrs. Landry said she had just spent more than $1,000 to buy a
new roof and repairs walls.
   ``It sounded like a big bomb. What am I going to do now?'' she
said.

<HEAD>Jackson Aide Says He Was Mistaken About $46,000 In Payments From

   An aide to Jesse Jackson says he was mistaken
when he described some $46,000 of the presidential candidate's
earnings last year as coming principally from entertainer Bill
Cosby. But he said Cosby, through his production company, did pay
some money to the Jackson family company.
   ``I was simply mistaken in terms of the Bill Cosby money,''
longtime Jackson associate Frank Watkins said Wednesday, reversing
an explanation he gave a day earlier as Jackson's presidential
campaign released four years worth of his income tax returns.
   Watkins said the $46,535 Jackson reportecome on
his 1987 tax return was honoraria paid directly to Jackson for
speaking engagements.
d as business in   In addition, Jackson was paid $159,000 by Personalities
International, Inc., a company headed by his wife that received
payments for his other speaking engagements and publications.
   Jackson is paid as an employee and consultant of the company but
is not a corporate officer, Watkins said.
   Watkins had said Cosby was the principal source of the $46,535,
and that Jackson had performed unspecified services for the sum.
   ``That was my mistake. They (Cosby and hdes today in a pre-dawn raid
at the
Nowa Huta steel mill and arrested the leaders of a 10-day-old
strike, official and church sources said.
   An opposition leader said police beat and injured 41 people at
the huge plant in Krakow. The government said some work resumed
there after the crackdown.
   At the Gdansk shipyard, site of another major work stoppage,
communist authorities ordered a lockout, and police in full riot
gear ringed the yard.
   In Warsaw, the national spokesman for the outlawed independent
Solidarity union federation was reported arrested. The government
accused strike leaders of trying to provoke a crisis in Poland's
most severe labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown on
Solidarity.
   The government reported new strikes today among transit workers
in the northwestern port of Szczecin and the nearby municipality of
Police. Students also began a strike at Warsaw University.
   ``The moment of the solution similar to that at Nowa Huta is
approaching,'' Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in a taped
interview smuggled out of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk. In a
tense-sounding voice, he vowed to be ``the last to leave.''
   In a communique, the shipyard strike committee had called on
workers to come to the yard: ``We continue the strike with a
feeling of responsiblity for the shipyard and for the country.''
   Hundreds of workers inside loudly chanted ``Solidarity,
Solidarity,'' and sang religious songs and the national anthem.
   Riot police turned away a crowd that gathered outside the yard,
birthplace of Solidarity.
   At Nowa Huta, police entered strike headquarters, detonated
percussion grenades and arrested most strike committee members,
said Krzystof Kozlowski, a senior Roman Catholic journalist in
Krakow. Percussion grenades are designed to create a loud noise and
no injury.
   Later, riot police entered and ordered all strikers to leave.
Half the plant's 32,000-worker force had been on strike.
   ``Nobody suffered any harm or injury,'' government spokesman
Jerzy Urban said in a telephone interview. State-run radio said at
least 38 people were arrested.
   But Zygmunt Lenyk of the conservative opposition group
Confederation of Independent Poland said some strikers not detained
were severely beaten. He said 32 people suffered cuts, eight people
were left unconscious and one man had two legs broken.
   The official PAP news agency said some plant departments resumed
work while others remained idle so that maintenance work could be
done on equipment stopped ``without preparation'' during the strike.
   On Wednesday, Urban had accused strike leaders of ``terrorist''
tactics and threatened to use force if the ``anarchy'' continued.
Today, he said Walesa and his followers want to ``evoke crisis''
and he reiterated the government's refusal to negotiate with
Solidarity activists.
   Walesa said authorities were ``sinking our country into ruin.
... I'm still convinced our strivings are right, and I can't behave
in any different way.''
   Dissident intellectual Adam Michnik, just released from two
days' detention, told reporters in Gdansk today that breaking the
Nowa Huta strike was ``the most foolish thing these authorities
could do.''
   ``This is the last nail in (Polish leader) General (Wojciech)
Jaruzelski's political coffin,'' he said.
   PAP said today that the Nowa Huta strike had threatened ``the
fundamental interests of the society and national economy.''
   It also quoted Gdansk shipyard management as saying workers not
joining the strike would be given paid leaves of absence.
   About 7,000 workers at the 12,000-worker shipyard in the Baltic
port went on strike Monday, the fourth stoppage since the labor
unrest began April 25.
   The two other strikes were settled when the government agreed to
increase wages to offset price increases of 42 percent so far this
year.
   At Nowa Huta and Gdansk, strikers also demanded independent
local unions, reinstatement of fired union activists and the
release of political prisoners.
   Phones of opposition activists in the Krakow area appeared cut
off today, said Barbara Labuda, a Solidarity spokeswoman in
Wroclaw. Joanna Onyszkiewicz, wife of Solidarity national spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz, said her husband was taken away by police from
his Warsaw home this morning.
   Just after midnight, strike leaders at Nowa Huta announced that
Roman Catholic Church mediators had persuaded management to
negotiate with strikers there later today. Strike leaders in Gdansk
said management there had refused to negotiate with them.
   On Wednesday, the nation's Catholic bishops called on
authorities to seek common ground with aggrieved citizens.
   Urban indicated on Wednesday that authorities might crack down.
   ``We shall not allow any anarchy,'' he said on national radio
and television. ``The two wildcat strikes have degenerated, and I
am warning, they may result in serious consequences.''
   Urban accused strikers of coercing workers into honoring the
strikes at both plants and impeding deliveries of materials.
   ``We are talking here about terrorist actions,'' he said.
   Three times in postwar Poland, labor trouble has toppled
governments.
   Walesa, a 44-year-old electrician who won the 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize, co-signed the 1980 accords that made Solidarity the only
free labor movement ever officially recognized in the Soviet bloc.

   Fire still smoldered today at a 400-foot
crater in the ruins of a rocket fuel plant destroyed by
earthquake-force explosions that flattened an industrial park,
leaving one person dead, one missing and injuring more than 250.
   ``This thing could have been much worse. ... We may have a
miracle on our hands here,'' Gov. Richard Bryan said late Wednesday
after blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in Las Vegas and
tweaked seismographs 200 miles away.
   The detonations destroyed or severely damaged 12 buildings at
the site of the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. of Nevada
plant and an adjoining marshmallow factory.
   The blasts _ at least three powerful concussions and a string of
lesser explosions _ peeled off roofs, upended cars and even rocked
a jetliner in flight. More than 250 people were injured, four
critically, most from flying glass.
   The tattered body found in the ruins was identified today as
Bruce Bernard Halker, 56, vice president of operations at Pacific
Engineering. A search continued for another possible victim.
   ``We have a missing person but we're not sure what it is. Maybe
the person just left and hasn't contacted anyone,'' said Clark
County Deputy Fire Chief John Pappageorge.
   Bryan said he was declaring the blast zone and its environs a
state disaster area, and would seek federal disaster relief for
this southern Nevada desert community of 54,000.
   ``All the windows are smashed in and the roofs are peeled
back,'' the governor said. ``In one shopping center, all the glass
is blown out and the top part of the building caved in. The force
had to be enormous.''
   This morning fire still smoldered at the ruined plant, said
Pappageorge, but it was not threatening or causing firefighters any
problems. The blasts left a crater 400 feet across.
   ``Right now there are no fumes that are emitting from the ruins
that we're aware of,'' Pappageorge said on the CBS ``This Morning''
program. ``The last measurement that was taken, the particles were
measured at zero.''
   He said of the low death toll: ``Unbelievable would be the word.
As my first thoughts when I arrived out there was there would
probably be several hundred. But it's remarkable there was only
one.''
   The explosions also spewed a 5-square-mile plume of toxic smoke
into the sky, but winds carried the cloud away from populated areas
and it eventually dissipated. By nightfall, evacuated residents
were back at home.
   Pacific is one of two manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate, an
oxidizer in fuel for the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters and
the Minuteman and Titan missiles. The other is Kerr-McGee, also
near Las Vegas.
   The explosions and fire were caused by an equipment malfunction,
said Pacific president Fred Gibson Jr. No monetary estimate of the
damage was available.
   The first explosion at 11:53 a.m. measured about 3.0 on the
Richter scale and the second at 11:57 a.m. had a magnitude 3.5,
said Bob Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology, 200 miles away in Pasadena.
   ``I find that absolutely amazing. That is extremely powerful,''
said Finn.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, of
Henderson, who was in her pickup truck when the blasts occurred.
   ``It felt like somebody sent me back to Vietnam,'' said Rick
Rieckmann, 41, a maintenance welder who was one of four plant
workers hurled through a wall in the first blast.
   ``It blew us out of the building. It sent us through a
fiberglass wall and into the desert,'' Rieckmann said. None of the
four was seriously hurt.
   Gamblers briefly abandoned gaming tables at several casinos on
the outskirts of Las Vegas, but ducked back inside after it was
clear the danger had passed.
   A Las Vegas-bound jetliner approaching McCarran International
Airport was rattled by the blasts, said America West passenger John
Conrad, 62, of Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``We felt a little jolt. The second explosion looked like a
mini-atomic bomb,'' he said. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   The Pacific plant employed about 300 workers, and about 200 of
them on duty Wednesday fled seconds before the first blast, Fire
Chief Roy Parrish said.
   ``Employees tried to put the fire out but it got out of control.
... Most of the employees had exited the building or were in the
foothills when the first explosion occurred. Seconds later, there
was a second explosion that completely demolished the building,''
Parrish said.
   Kidd & Co., based in Ligonier, Ind., expanded to the Gibson
Business Park and opened its 36,500-square-foot marshmallow plant
about two years ago. It employed 85 people, but only 25 to 35 were
on duty at the time of the blast.

   Slain racing promoter Mickey Thompson's
friends, relatives and associates boosted their reward for
information on the contract-style shootings of Thompson and his
wife to $255,000.
   The people who raised the reward also announced a 60-day
deadline on the offer in hopes of jarring a response from anyone
who may know about the March 16 killings.
   Police say they believe Thompson, 59, and his wife, Trudy, 41,
were the victims of hired killers, but have few leads.
   The reward had stood at $175,000 as of March 21.
   ``In addition to losing loved ones, it is the terrible feeling
of knowing that the person or persons who did this are still out
there somewhere, living scot free,'' Collene Thompson Campbell,
Thompson's sister, said Wednesday at a news conference.
   Investigators are circulating composite drawings of two men
believed to have been the gunmen and a third seen nearby.
   Thompson, the first driver to break the 400-mph land speed mark,
promoted motor sports events in arenas and stadiums.

   Thieves have plucked lawn art worth
nearly $15,000 from three homes, police said.
   In the latest theft, John Childs said the life-sized bronze
statue of an Oriental woman playing a flute vanished from his lawn
Monday or Tuesday.
   ``They had to be very clever,'' Childs said. ``The statue was
secured on a coral stone and pedestal, and they didn't take the
pedestal.''
   The lawn ornaments were taken since last weekend, police
spokesman Craig Gunkel said Wednesday.
   The largest theft occurred Friday night, when two ``extremely
heavy'' bronze sphinxes were unbolted from their marble pedestals
in a yard, Gunkel said. The 2-foot statues are worth about $4,500
each.
   In another incident, a 19th-century stone urn valued at $500 was
stolen, police said.

   An assault team stormed a secluded
island cave in this French Pacific territory Thursday and freed 23
hostages in a bloody rescue mission that left 17 people dead,
authorities said.
   Fifteen of the dead were Melanesian separatists holding the
captives, and two were rescuers, said Bernard Pons, France's
minister for overseas territories.
   The team pelted the cave with tear gas canisters, forcing most
of the estimated 30 captors out, Pons told reporters in the
capital, Noumea. A ``particularly violent battle'' ensued, he said.
   Three members of the assault team and three captors were injured
in the nearly seven-hour battle in the thick underbrush of Ouvea
island in the Loyalty island group, he said.
   The hostages _ 22 gendarmes and an assistant prosecutor _ were
seized in two groups on April 22 and April 27 by Melanesian
separatists seeking independence for the island and protesting
French-dominated regional elections April 24.
   The hostages freed their manacled hands with a key that had been
sneaked in earlier and defended themselves with two pistols also
obtained before the attack, Pons said.
   ``Taking advantage of the smoke created by tear gas bombs, the
hostages were able to escape through a chimney in the back of the
cave,'' he said.
   The key and pistols had been smuggled in by Capt. Philippe
Legorjus, a hostage who at one point acted as intermediary, leaving
the cave for talks with French government officials.
   During the negotiations, the kidnappers told Legorjus the other
hostages would be killed if he did not return to the cave.
   ``The situation inside the cave had become extremely
dangerous,'' Defense Minister Andre Giraud said in Paris. ``In any
case, it was entirely intolerable that representatives of the
forces of order might be held hostage.''
   The rescue operation was carried out by an elite gendarmes
squad, paratroopers, a marine commando unit and a special action
unit of the French counter-espionage agency, military officials
said.
   The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the main
Melanesian separatist organization, called for a mobilization to
protest the assault, which it called ``colonial barbary.''
   ``This will not stop the determination of the Kanak people in
their demand for independence,'' Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the front
president, told The Associated Press by telephone from his home in
Hienghene at the northern end of the main island.
   Premier Jacques Chirac said the operation was ``infinitely
difficult'' given the rough terrain on Ouvea and the almost
inaccessable location of the cave. The cave is at the bottom of a
50-yard-by-30-yard crater.
   He said it was decided on after ``friendly attempts'' to free
the hostages failed.
   Chirac called on Caledonians to ``work together for mutual
understanding, dialogue and a peaceful solution to the problems of
New Caledonia.
   ``This French territory has clearly spoken about its wish to
remain French,'' he said in apparent reference to the elections.
The front boycotted the voting, in which pro-French settlers
dominated.
   The separatists took captive 27 gendarmes, police under military
orders, in an attack on a police station April 22 in which four
gendarmes were hacked to death.
   Eleven were freed three days later. But on April 27, seven
gendarmes and the assistant prosecutor were captured when they went
to the hideout for negotiations. A sick hostage also was freed that
day.
   Besides cancelling regional elections, the militants were
demanding that hundreds of French troops be removed from Ouvea and
that a mediator be sent to discuss independence for the
archipelago, a French territory since 1853.
   Forty-three percent of the territory's 145,000 inhabitants are
native Melanesians, most of whom want independence. European
settlers make up 36 percent of the population, with the rest Asian
and Polynesian.
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, speaking on television,
defended the decision to take action, saying, ``You don't make an
omelette without breaking eggs.''
   Pasqua said he did not know if Chirac decided on the assault
before or after news of the release of three French hostages in
Lebanon.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, of the extreme right National Front, praised
the operation and implied that similar tactics should have been
used in Lebanon.
   ``There is only one way to deal with terrorists, that used in
Ouvea,'' he said.

   The average public school teacher now earns
$28,031, up 5.6 percent over last year, the National Education
Association said today.
   Average salaries ranged from a high of $40,424 in Alaska to a
low of $19,750 in South Dakota.
   Ten states, including Alaska, now pay teachers more than $30,000
on average. South Dakota is the only state where teachers earn less
than $20,000 on average.
   The typical classroom teacher has more than 15 years'
experience, according to past surveys by the union.
   The national salary figure is up by $1,477 over the average of
$26,534 during the 1986-87 school year, union researchers said.
   The union did not estimate how much salaries will rise this
fall, but if teachers get another 5.6 percent salary increase, they
will be earning $29,600 on average for the 1988-89 school year.
   The $28,031 figure is an estimate based on salary data compiled
from all 50 states. The NEA figure is widely cited, including by
the U.S. Department of Education, as the most accurate indicator of
how much the nation's nearly 2.3 million classroom teachers in the
public schools are earning.
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said recently that
teacher salaries have risen 20 percent since 1980-81 after
adjusting for inflation.
   The highest paying states were: Alaska, $40,424; District of
Columbia, $36,465; New York, $33,600; Connecticut, $33,515, and
California, $33,092.
   The lowest paying were: South Dakota, $19,750; Arkansas,
$20,340; Mississippi, $20,669; Louisiana, $20,885, and North
Dakota, $21,660.
   Here are average salaries for all 50 states:

<HEAD>Byrd Concentrating On General Election, Not Tuesday's Primary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With heated races for governor and
state Supreme Court competing for the voters' attention, Sen.
Robert C. Byrd's bid for a sixth term has attracted little notice
in West Virginia _ and that's just fine with him.
   Byrd, who recently announced he is giving up his post as Senate
majority leader, faces only a nominal challenge in Tuesday's
Democratic primary.
   The 71-year-old politician, who has become a fiddle-playing
institution in the Mountain State, held several fund-raisers last
fall but plans no campaign stops and no media blitz before the
primary, said Tina Evans, a spokeswoman for the senator.
   ``In the early stages of the campaign, I am focusing on talking
with individual West Virginians, getting around the state and
working for West Virginia in the Senate,'' Byrd said.
   His only opponent in the primary is 59-year-old former state
Board of Education member Bob E. Myers who says ``no one should be
allowed to run unopposed, especially in a six-year office.''
   Byrd has amassed a 1988 election war chest of more than $1
million, while Myers said in his latest spending report that he has
raised nothing and spent $212.
   In the Republican primary, freshman state Sen. Jay Wolfe faces
Bernie Lumbert of Buckhannon, a welfare recipient whose campaign
consists maily of telephoning reporters to relate tales of
conspiracies by public officials.
   Byrd's announcement that he would give up his majority leader
job amid growing dissatisfaction over his style of leadership among
fellow Democrats in Washington. He said that if Democrats retain
control of the Senate next year, he would assume the chairmanship
of the Senate Appropriations Committee in an effort to funnel more
federal dollars to West Virginia.
   Byrd acknowledged that ``the economic recovery that other
regions have enjoyed for the most part bypassed our state.''
   He said he ``cannot work miracles'' but will have ``a new
opportunity to have a more direct influence on the allocation of
our nation's scarce fiscal resources.''
   Byrd's move has been labeled a demotion by some political
observers, and Republican Gov. Arch Moore said he would be
``hard-pressed to suggest West Virginians will notice any
difference as a result of the change.''
   Wolfe, 33, decided to try for Byrd's Senate seat after backing
out of the gubernatorial primary, in which he would have faced
Moore and Morgantown millionaire John Raese.
   Wolfe flew to Washington earlier this year to discuss his plans
with the Republican National Senatorial Committee and hopes to
raise at least $250,000 for the general election.
   In the state Senate, Wolfe primarily has been a proponent of
right-to-work legislation and also has called for a constitutional
amendment to prohibit abortion on demand.
   Lumbert, 57, said he is on welfare and cannot afford to spend
money on the election. He said he campaigns as often as he can
``for free'' by addressing groups and organizations, but his
requests to speak to groups nearly always are turned down.
   ``I'm a very hated person,'' Lumbert said. ``I'm probably the
most despised person in the state.''
   The primary ballot will be crowded with contests, including
Moore vs. Raese and seven Democrats competing for their party's
nomination for governor. In addition, five Democrats are battling
for two nominations to the state Supreme Court, including
incumbents Darrell McGraw and Thomas Miller. Two issues in the
bitter campaign have been allegations that the court is
anti-business, and complaints about McGraw's repeated run-ins with
court employees, sheriff's deputies, lawyers amd reporters.

   Soviet and U.S. veterans of the Cold War today
proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union stop
intervening in the developing world as a step toward reducing their
military competition.
   The motto for the group might be ``No more Afghanistans, No more
Vietnams,'' said Arthur Macy Cox, a former CIA official who
organized the effort with Georgi Arbatov, an adviser to Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and head of Moscow's USA-Canada
Institute.
   In a position paper issued at a Washington news conference, the
Soviets and Americans called for the ``progressive demilitarization
of U.S.-Soviet competition,'' including sharp cuts in strategic
nuclear and conventional arsenals, elimination of chemical weapons
and adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   All those areas are under negotiation between the superpowers.
   The proposal breaks new ground by proposing a deal to end the
Cold War in the developing world, saying, ``We believe that
military intervention by the superpowers in regional conflicts has
reached a dangerous dead end and should be terminated by mutual
agreements.''
   The difficulty of interpreting such an agreement became evident
during the news conference as Cox and Arbatov, professing
unanimity, could not agree whether the use of pro-Soviet Cuban
troops in Angola constituted ``proxy forces'', which would be
barred under the proposal.
   The U.S. government calls Cuban forces used in Third World
conflicts Soviet proxies.
   ``I cannot regard them as proxy forces,'' said Arbatov,
describing the Cubans as ``friends.''
   ``We regard them as proxy forces,'' said Cox.
   Whether the Cubans are Soviet proxies or merely friends, said
Arbatov, superpower intervention in the developing world is
``counterproductive.''
   Cox said that the two sides did not discuss the 1981 martial law
crackdown against the Solidarity trade union in Poland as a form of
indirect Soviet intervention.
   ``There was no intervention by the Red Army or proxies into
Poland,'' said Cox.
   The Reagan administration took a radically different
interpretation at the time of the military crackdown. Then
Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger described Polish leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski as a ``Russian in a Polish uniform.''
   Arbatov told a news conference that although many of the ideas
in the paper reflect Kremlin views, it was a purely unofficial
exercise.
   The time is ripe for a U.S. Soviet rapprochement, far better
than during detente, said one American in the group, Townsend
Hoopes, undersecretary of the Air Force under President Lyndon
Johnson. The Americans were all members of the American Committee
on U.S.-Soviet Relations and include former CIA director William
Colby, former undersecretary of state George Ball and former Sen.
John Culver.
   Detente _ a period of thawing superpower relations under
Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter _ produced a series of arms
control agreements and increased trade between the superpowers, but
floundered amid U.S. accusations that the Soviets were continuing
their military buildup and using force to install allied
governments in the developing world.
   ``We have a clear idea of why detente was ruined,'' Hoopes said
in an interview. The Soviets understood detente to exclude behavior
in the developing world, the opposite of the U.S. understanding.
   This time, says Hoopes, ``We are convinced of the sincerity on
the Russian side.''

<HEAD>Tough Decisions Ahead For Participants In Angola Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary peace talks this
week marked an unprecedented step toward ending Angola's civil war,
but the warring parties face a daunting task in securing an outcome
that allows them all to save face.
   Since the war began in 1975, the antagonists have been given to
belligerent talk. It will not be easy for them to tone down their
rhetoric if they feel that national honor is at stake.
   South Africa has justified its support of the Angolan rebel
movement UNITA as necessary to thwart a communist onslaught in
southern Africa. Angola's Marxist government, backed by 40,000
Cuban troops and about 1,000 Soviet advisers, has derided UNITA as
a puppet of South Africa's ``racist regime.''
   The two-day talks in London placed Cuba, Angola and South Africa
at the same bargaining table for the first time. A joint communique
issued Wednesday said they would meet again soon.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who served as
chairman, said the session was an important step toward withdrawal
of Cuban and South African troops from Angola and independence for
South-West Africa, the South African-controlled territory known as
Namibia.
   ``But it is fair to be skeptical,'' Crocker said. ``There are
big, tough issues that lie ahead.''
   Among those issues:
   _UNITA, which was excluded from the London talks, insists that
it must be included eventually. The rebels' leader, Jonas Savimbi,
is reviled by Angolan government officials, but he is a proud,
self-confident commander who is unlikely to stand aside in the
interests of a settlement. The United States, which helps arm the
rebels, says it won't abandon him.
   _Angola will not want to be seen by other Third World countries
as yielding to the white-minority rulers of South Africa. Mere
withdrawal of South African troops from its territory is unlikely
to suffice, and Angola will probably insist on unconditional
independence for Namibia.
   _South African negotiators will likely balk at any steps that
could be depicted by extreme-right whites as capitulation to
Soviet-bloc pressure. There is skepticism about South Africa's
public commitment to allowing U.N.-supervised independence
elections in Namibia once Cuban troops leave Angola. Such elections
would likely be won by the South-West African People's
Organization, the leftist guerrilla movement that has been fighting
South African rule for 22 years. South Africa may pursue some
arrangement that would lessen SWAPO's chances of taking power.
   Even as the talks concluded, the hostile rhetoric continued.
   An Angolan general claimed his troops had forced a retreat by
UNITA and South African units in southern Angola. Such boasts, true
or false, are unlikely to induce concessions from South African
leaders who view conservative whites as their main constituency.
   In South Africa, the state-run broadcasting company issued a
commentary describing Cuba's troop deployment as the central
problem.
   ``As in the case of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan, the Cubans
in Angola have been the cause of the destruction of that country,
the destabilization of the region and a growing threat to the
strategic interests of the Western world,'' the South African
Broadcasting Corp. said.
   South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof ``Pik'' Botha, suggested
that his country might try to play upon the U.S. government's
apparent eagerness to broker a settlement.
   Botha said U.S. congressmen should understand that further
sanctions against South Africa would jeopardize the peace
negotiations.
   Balancing the potential obstacles to peace are several factors
conducive to a settlement. Perhaps foremost is the increasing cost
of the war, which has become the most intense conventional warfare
in Africa since World War II.
   The Soviet Union, which supplies the Cuban-Angolan forces,
appears interested in a non-military settlement. Angola knows its
battered economy cannot be rehabilitated without peace, and it
reportedly has held secret talks with UNITA recently. South Africa
would like to avoid raising the death toll of its white conscripts.
   The London talks focused on an Angolan proposal for Cuban troops
to stage a phased withdrawal while South Africa pulled its forces
out of Angola and Namibia.
   Cuba has suggested a four-year timetable and wants UNITA to be
barred from military operations. South Africa has said the Cuban
withdrawal must be completed before it would begin moves toward
Namibian independence.
   The Cubans came to Angola in 1975, helping the Marxist movement
which now runs the government to win a power struggle with UNITA
following independence from Portugal.
   The United States has been trying for eight years to get the
Cubans out of Angola. But Crocker said pressure for a settlement
was on the warring parties, not the United States, because ``it is,
after all, their boys who are dying.''

<HEAD>Asking Allies To Pay More for Defense Is Risky Game, Carlucci Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional demands that America's allies
pay more for defense are misguided and amount to a ``high-stakes
game of `chicken''' that the United States can't afford to play,
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Thursday.
   Carlucci, addressing the Foreign Policy Association in New York
City, said recent attacks in Congress on the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and other allies like Japan and South Korea suggest
``a growing inclination towards isolationism _ a kind of withdrawal
syndrome from our international obligations and interests.''
   ``It is now quite commonly assumed that the United States
carries more than its `fair share' of the burdens of alliance
defense, and that in return America gets little in the way of
support or even appreciation from its allies,'' the defense
secretary said.
   ``Calls for cutting back our contributions to our alliances _ or
punishing allies who fail to contribute more _ are getting a
hearing. These proposals are sometimes recommended as a sort of
shock treatment that will result in our allies deciding to shoulder
more responsibility for alliance security.
   ``Well, I do not think we should risk our security interests in
what is in effect little more than a high-stakes game of `chicken.'
We cannot trust to chance America's national security.''
   The Pentagon released a copy of the speech in Washington.
Carlucci aides described the address as a statement of policy aimed
at the growing number of members of Congress who have begun
attacking the NATO alliance.
   Last week the House voted on two different proposals to reduce
the number of American troops in Europe. While both proposals were
defeated, the debate featured harsh attacks on NATO by the two
sponsors, Reps. John Bryant, D-Texas, and Tommy Robinson, D-Ark.
   ``Let's get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect
them to pay their fair share,'' Bryant said at the time. ``We are
subsidizing their defense.''
   Robinson was even more blunt. ``The real purpose of this
amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that we've had it. These
people are stealing our jobs because we have been suckered into
paying for their defense.''
   But in his speech, Carlucci said the United States does not
maintain alliances ``as a favor to our allies. We do so because it
is in our interest. Collective security and the strategy of forward
defense have been central to our national security for more than
four decades.''
   Over and beyond military factors, America's economy depends upon
international trade, the secretary continued.
   ``And we cannot expect to protect those interests and prosper if
we isolate ourselves from the rest of the world,'' Carlucci said.
``The implications for our national security should be clear: We
cannot hope to expand our economic horizons at the very moment we
scale back our international security commitments.''
   On the other hand, there is no question but that ``there remains
room for improvement'' on defense spending among the allies, he
said.
   ``Determining an equitable allocation of roles, risks and
responsibilities among 16 sovereign NATO partners is not an easy
task,'' Carlucci said.
   ``But, clearly, the United States will be hard pressed to
persuade its allies to do more to bolster their defenses if we
ourselves succumb to the temptation to do less,'' he concluded.

   Bogeys, and lots of them, were par for the
course.
   The 74 competitors at the Worst Golfers Tournament hacked their
way through two rounds that produced two excruciatingly long days
of golf. But competitors and organizers were talking about doing it
again next year.
   The event raised $5,000 for United Cerebral Palsy and Easter
Seals.
   ``I had a super time and I'll definitely be back next year,''
said Tim Boehlke, of Goshen, Ind., who took home the trophy for the
worst of the worst. ``Hey, the only place I can go is up.''
   He averted a tie when he blew a short putt Monday on the final
hole. His scores for the tournament were 172-152 for a total of 324
_ 178 over par.
   Runner-up was Al Mitchell of Coal Valley, who said he had played
just one round before the tournament and was determined not to take
home the trophy.
   Boehlke said he was happy to claim the dubious distinction.
   ``I play with my friends and have fun doing it,'' said Boehlke,
a five-year veteran of the greens.
   His best-ever score for 18 holes?
   ``In the 130s,'' he said.

   Nationality has become somewhat irrelevant
at the German Heritage Days as a British family is serving as
honored guests. The reason: Their last name is McCook.
   Tom and Carol McCook and their children, Sarah, Helen and James,
have been getting the VIP treatment in McCook this week and will
serve as grand marshals of the German Days parade Saturday.
   The idea for their journey began a year ago when Sarah, 13, was
looking over a map and spotted the town of McCook.
   ``She wondered how it got its name and I said it was probably
named after a cattle rustler who got hung,'' Tom McCook joked.
   According to Perkey's Nebraska Place Names, McCook was named in
honor of Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general in the Civil
War.
   Sarah wrote to the McCook Daily Gazette requesting information
about the city in March 1987. Editor Jack Rogers sent her a
centennial edition and many residents mailed letters.
   Through the correspondence, she became a regular pen pal of
three children and last summer a fund-raising drive was begun to
bring her to McCook.
   Enough money was raised to pay for Sarah and one other family
member to visit, and the McCooks paid expenses for the rest of the
family.

   Police said Thursday that a woman and
four men, all from Switzerland, died in an avalanche in the
Engadine Alps.
   The giant snowslide Wednesday swept down Mt. Sissone close to
the Swiss-Italian border, burying the five skiers under more than
seven feet of snow.
   It was the season's second-worst avalanche following an April 1
slide just under Mt. San Lorenzo, also in the Engadine, that killed
six Dutch members of a ski party.
   Wednesday's avalanche raised the death toll in the Swiss
mountains from avalanches to 25 so far this year. There were no
other details on the latest victims.

   Plainclothes police surprised sleeping
workers with percussion grenades today in a pre-dawn raid at the
Nowa Huta steel mill and arrested the leaders of a 10-day-old
strike, official and church sources said.
   An opposition leader said police beat and injured 41 people at
the huge plant in Krakow. The government said some work resumed
there after the crackdown.
   At the Gdansk shipyard, site of another major work stoppage,
communist authorities ordered a lockout, and police in full riot
gear ringed the yard.
   In Warsaw, the national spokesman for the outlawed independent
Solidarity union federation was reported arrested. The government
accused strike leaders of trying to provoke a crisis in Poland's
most severe labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown on
Solidarity.
   The government reported new strikes today among transit workers
in the northwestern port of Szczecin and the nearby municipality of
Police. Students also began a strike at Warsaw University.
   In Washington, the White House warned the Polish government
about using ``repressive measures'' against striking workers and
cautioned that the labor unrest can only be solved by the Polish
people themselves.
   ``We deplore the reported actions of last night and we strongly
urge the government of Poland to begin a productive dialogue with
all segments of Polish society, including Solidarity,'' spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The moment of the solution similar to that at Nowa Huta is
approaching,'' Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in a taped
interview smuggled out of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk. In a
tense-sounding voice, he vowed to be ``the last to leave.''
   In a communique, the shipyard strike committee had called on
workers to come to the yard: ``We continue the strike with a
feeling of responsiblity for the shipyard and for the country.''
   Hundreds of workers inside loudly chanted ``Solidarity,
Solidarity,'' and sang religious songs and the national anthem.
   Riot police turned away a crowd that gathered outside the yard,
birthplace of Solidarity.
   At Nowa Huta, police entered strike headquarters, detonated
percussion grenades and arrested most strike committee members,
said Krzystof Kozlowski, a senior Roman Catholic journalist in
Krakow. Percussion grenades are designed to create a loud noise and
no injury.
   Later, riot police entered and ordered all strikers to leave.
Half the plant's 32,000-worker force had been on strike.
   ``Nobody suffered any harm or injury,'' government spokesman
Jerzy Urban said in a telephone interview. State-run radio said at
least 38 people were arrested.
   But Zygmunt Lenyk of the conservative opposition group
Confederation of Independent Poland said some strikers not detained
were severely beaten. He said 32 people suffered cuts, eight people
were left unconscious and one man had two legs broken.
   The official PAP news agency said some plant departments resumed
work while others remained idle so that maintenance work could be
done on equipment stopped ``without preparation'' during the strike.
   On Wednesday, Urban had accused strike leaders of ``terrorist''
tactics and threatened to use force if the ``anarchy'' continued.
Today, he said Walesa and his followers want to ``evoke crisis''
and he reiterated the government's refusal to negotiate with
Solidarity activists.
   Walesa said authorities were ``sinking our country into ruin.
... I'm still convinced our strivings are right, and I can't behave
in any different way.''
   Dissident intellectual Adam Michnik, just released from two
days' detention, told reporters in Gdansk today that breaking the
Nowa Huta strike was ``the most foolish thing these authorities
could do.''
   ``This is the last nail in (Polish leader) General (Wojciech)
Jaruzelski's political coffin,'' he said.
   PAP said today that the Nowa Huta strike had threatened ``the
fundamental interests of the society and national economy.''
   It also quoted Gdansk shipyard management as saying workers not
joining the strike would be given paid leaves of absence.
   About 7,000 workers at the 12,000-worker shipyard in the Baltic
port went on strike Monday, the fourth stoppage since the labor
unrest began April 25.
   The two other strikes were settled when the government agreed to
increase wages to offset price increases of 42 percent so far this
year.
   At Nowa Huta and Gdansk, strikers also demanded independent
local unions, reinstatement of fired union activists and the
release of political prisoners.
   Phones of opposition activists in the Krakow area appeared cut
off today, said Barbara Labuda, a Solidarity spokeswoman in
Wroclaw. Joanna Onyszkiewicz, wife of Solidarity national spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz, said her husband was taken away by police from
his Warsaw home this morning.
   Urban indicated on Wednesday that authorities might crack down.
   ``We shall not allow any anarchy,'' he said on national radio
and television.
   Three times in postwar Poland, labor trouble has toppled
governments.
   Walesa, a 44-year-old electrician who won the 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize, co-signed the 1980 accords that made Solidarity the only
free labor movement ever officially recognized in the Soviet bloc.

<HEAD>House Panel Urges DOT To Widen Probe of Eastern Airlines</HEAD>

   A House committee approved legislation today
urging the Transportation Department to widen its investigation of
Eastern Airlines and its parent company, Texas Air Corp.
   By a voice vote, the Public Works and Transportation Committee
sent the measure to the full House. The resolution already has 210
co-sponsors, nearly half the House's membership.
   The resolution is non-binding, and simply states that the
Department of Transportation should look more closely at the
management, labor practices and safety procedures of Texas Air and
Eastern.
   But the issue has aroused strong feelings among lawmakers, whom
the company's management and labor unions have been lobbying hard
for support. The airline has been seeking wage concessions from
workers, and the two sides have been fighting each other for months
in Congress, the courts and in newspaper advertisements.
   ``Morale is very much related to ability to do the job,'' said
the measure's original sponsor, Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House aviation subcommittee. ``And to me, that very
much becomes a safety concern.''
   The Transportation Department said last month that it would
examine the management and business practices of Texas Air,
Eastern, and Continental Airlines, another Texas affiliate. The
congressional resolution calls on the department to look more
closely at how Texas Air's and Eastern's practices affect the
public.
   In another development, Eastern asked a federal appeals panel
today to overturn a contempt citation and injunction barring the
sale of its shuttle, but the court questioned whether it had
jurisdiction in the case.
   Philip A. Lacovara, an attorney representing the financially
troubled airline, told the U.S. Court of Appeals panel that selling
the Northeast shuttle operations was ``essential to Eastern's
ability to survive.''
   Eastern last year arranged to sell its profitable Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle to a newly created Texas Air subsidiary for
$225 million.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL-CIO, challenged the proposed sale and transfer to the
new subsidiary of about 6,000 jobs, claiming a violation of the
collective bargaining agreement.
   ``This is part and parcel of a scheme to dismantle Eastern
Airlines to rid Texas Air of its only unionized subsidiary,''
contended union attorney Joseph Guerrieri Jr.
   In March, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt held Eastern in
contempt for trying to sell the shuttle in violation of his July 2,
1987, injunction directing Eastern to maintain the status quo under
its contract with the union. He barred Eastern from taking further
steps to sell the shuttle.
   Appeals Court Judge Harry Edwards told Lacovara that since the
case was still pending before Pratt and contempt citations could
rarely be appealed, there was doubt as to whether the appeals court
had jurisdiction at this stage.
   ``There is a significant question as to whether you are properly
here because contempt citations are not generally appealable,''
Edwards said.
   Eastern contends that the proposed sale is a ``managerial
prerogative'' that does not affect the collective bargaining
agreement. The union says the sale is in violation of the Railway
Labor Act because it changes working conditions without an attempt
at bargaining.

   Colossus, the biggest male gorilla in
captivity, may not be looking for the gorilla of his dreams, but
he's getting a girlfriend anyway.
   Muke, a 21-year-old western lowland gorilla, is being brought
from the St. Louis Zoo to teach him about love and socializing.
   Until he moved to The Zoo near Gulf Breeze a couple of months
ago from Benson's Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., Colossus had never
been out of an indoor cage since he was captured in Africa more
than 20 years ago. He has never seen another gorilla outside his
African family.
   ``She is supposed to be a very good-looking gorilla,'' noted Pat
Quinn, president-director of The Zoo.
   Muke is a non-breeder, said Roger Birkel, deputy director of the
St. Louis Zoo. Quinn says that's OK.
   ``If we can get him socialized with other gorillas and we can
get him turned on to breeding, then we can bring in a viable
breeder,'' said Quinn, who plans to bring Muke to The Zoo as soon
as he can work out arrangements.

   A fire raged through five floors of a
62-story office tower today, killing a man trapped in an elevator
and injuring at least 40 people while a rescue helicopter plucked
10 people from the top of the city's tallest building.
   ``It looked like Dante's Inferno,'' fire Capt. Steve Varney
said. ``Everything that was burnable, burned down. It was just
metal and that was red hot.''
   The fire broke out before 11 p.m. Wednesday on the 12th floor of
the First Interstate Bank building and was put out shortly after 2
a.m. today, said firefighter Gary Svider. The cause of the fire was
under investigation.
   Flames visible for 10 miles burned in a red band across the
859-foot building, shooting 20 feet out into the air, and grey and
white smoke poured through other floors. Glass from fire-shattered
windows sprayed the street.
   It was not known how many people were inside when the fire broke
out. Some workers climbed stairs to upper stories before they were
lifted to safety by a helicopter, but one man trapped in a freight
elevator could not get away.
   ``One of the men was saying `Car 33' was in flames and he was
screaming `Please help!''' said cleaning supervisor Zora Imamovic,
who heard the man on her two-way radio as she made her way to the
roof.
   Firefighters found the body of an unidentified man after prying
open the elevator's doors on the 12th floor about two hours after
the fire was extinguished, Svider said.
   The building, one of the West's tallest skyscrapers, did not
have a sprinkler system because it was erected before codes
required one. Officials said the building's firefighting system was
being upgraded when the blaze hit.
   No damage estimate was immediately available and there was no
early indication of arson, said fire Cmdr. Donald Anthony.
   Firefighters continued to search for other possible victims, and
two people were brought down from the 37th floor around 6 a.m.
   Officials used radio announcements to ask workers to stay home
this morning, but some came in anyway.
   ``What else are you supposed to do?'' asked Patricia Bigler, 28,
a marketing representative. ``This is half of my life ... I just
have a sick pit in my stomach.''
   First Interstate's headquarters were closed, but the bank
continued securities sales and stock trading today from other
offices, said chairman William Siart. First Interstate is the
nation's eighth largest banking company, with assets of $58.5
billion and offices in 19 states.
   Anthony said at least 40 people _ 37 maintenance workers and
three firefighters _ were injured. All were treated for minor cuts,
burns or smoke inhalation and released.
   Broken, heat-blasted glass showered onto the streets, severing
fire hoses, and fire Capt. Mike Bowers said firefighters couldn't
replace the hoses because they also could be cut.
   Some firefighters landed on the roof by helicopter and worked
their way down to lower floors.
   Firefighters searched the floors above the burning levels for
other people, Fire Chief Donald Manning said.
   One fire official said the blaze frustrated firefighters because
they had to use portable oxygen tanks.
   ``We're running out of air real quick,'' said Capt. Steve
Varney. ``You've got to walk up 15 stories and by the time you get
to the 15th story, you run out of air after five minutes. That's no
way to fight a fire.''
   Tom Scalia, 29, said he was working on a sprinkler system for
Cosco Fire Protection when the blaze broke out.
   ``We were installing sprinklers and they are not in service at
all,'' said Scalia.
   Fire Inspector Ed Reed, who has been with the department for 23
years, said the blaze was the worst high-rise fire in the history
of the nation's second-largest city in terms of severity and damage.
   Four helicopters with searchlights swooped around the rooftop to
locate people, and a Police Department helicopter lifted 10 people
from the roof, officers said.
   ``We came out and we couldn't see anything but smoke,'' said
Radmila Radich, a cleaning woman who escaped.
   The fire chief said the building contained no sprinkler system
because it was built before local fire codes were modified to
require them. The water system in the building's standpipe _ to be
used in case of fire _ was turned off at the time the fire broke
out because it was being upgraded, he said.
   Manning said it was lucky the fire did not strike during the day.
   ``You might have 6,000 or 7,000 people in there all trying to
exit through heavy smoke. The chances are we would have had a lot
of injuries a lot of fatalities,'' Manning said on CBS' ``This
Morning.''

   A 24-year-old man pleaded innocent today to
15 counts of second-degree murder and one count of arson in
connection with a rooming house fire that killed 15 people four
years ago on the Fourth of July.
   James Carver broke down, shaking and in tears, during the
reading of the indictment in Salem Superior Court before Judge
Peter Brady. He left the courtroom for 15 minutes to regain his
composure.
   Carver, of Ipswich, was accompanied by his wife, MaryJane, 21,
his parents and his attorney, Dennis Jackson.
   Carver was arrested Wednesday night on a warrant after an Essex
County grand jury handed up a sealed indictment. Brady set bail at
$1 million surety or $100,00 cash. A pre-trial conference was set
for May 23.
   Jealousy and a love-triangle were the apparent motives, Essex
County District Attorney Kevin Burke said today. He said Carver
formerly was engaged to a woman who was dating a resident of the
boarding house. The alleged target of Carver's jealousy died in the
fire.
   Burke said Carver was among many early suspects because he had
been seen around the rooming house right after the fire. But he
said the case was cracked when an unidentified individual told
police that Carver had confessed.
   But Jackson said Carver was asleep at home in Danvers when the
fire broke out. Jackson said Carver ``feels pretty strongly that
they don't have a case against him'' but that he was not surprised
by the indictment.
   The July 4, 1984, predawn fire at the Elliott Chambers rooming
house was the worst in Beverly's history.
   It shocked local and state officials into improving safety for
boarding houses, which accommodate people who often have nowhere
else to go.
   The 36 people staying at the seedy, 35-year-old rooming house
the night of the fire were a mix of the elderly, welfare
recipients, people released from psychiatric hospitals and drifters.
   The fire began in the front stairway of the three-story, wooden
building, trapping people inside. The building had no sprinklers,
although it had a new fire alarm.
   Flames raced up the stairs and through the top floor, trapping
six people in their beds. Others died while trying to beat down a
locked entryway. One man died after jumping from a third-story
window. All told, 14 people died in the fire and another died later.
   Six of the dead were so badly charred they could only be
identified through dental records and jewelry found on their bodies.
   Investigators said the fire was deliberately set and that it was
started in newspapers inside a locked front door.
   In the aftermath of the fire in this town 25 miles north of
Boston, fire officials stepped up enforcement of safety codes, the
state Department of Mental Health expanded fire safety training for
mentally ill patients and the state enacted a law giving the
communities the option to require sprinklers in rooming houses.
   After the fire, the building was converted to office space.

   An prominent labor activist freed from a
Polish jail so he could receive medical treatment abroad said
Thursday he was forced off a plane and deported after he flew back
to Poland.
   Morawiecki, leader of a militant splinter group of the outlawed
trade union federation Solidarity, said Polish officials initially
told him he would be allowed to return home, then blocked his
attempt to return Wednesday.
   Morawiecki, a 47-year-old physicist, is the head of the
underground group known as Fighting Solidarity.
   He was flown from Poland last week just as a series of tense
labor strikes and political demonstrations were beginning. He was
allowed out under a deal worked out by the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``I think the church was cheated as much as I was. The
authorities broke their guarantee to me and to the church that I
would be able to go back,'' he said.
   In Warsaw, a Polish government official confirmed that
Morawiecki tried to return home Wednesday. The official said
Morawiecki was given the choice of jail or leaving the country and
chose to leave.
   Morawiecki said he was jailed in November while authorities
investigated what he called bogus charges of smuggling.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Morawiecki said he and fellow
prisoner Andrzej Kolodzej were released from jail in Warsaw on
Saturday on the condition they travel to Rome for medical treatment.
   But after learning of the labor strikes in Poland, the men
refused to board the plane and were returned to prison, Morawiecki
said.
   Two intermediaries from the Roman Catholic church persuaded the
men to depart, arguing that refusal to leave would jeopardize
church efforts to solve similar cases for other prisoners,
Morawiecki said.
   The men flew to Rome, he said. Kolodzej started to receive
treatment for suspected duodenal cancer, but Morawiecki said
doctors found nothing seriously wrong with him, and he decided to
return to Poland.
   Polish authorities had given the men passports containing stamps
permitting them to return to Poland until 1991, he said.
   However, Morawiecki said he was denied permission Tuesday to
board a flight from Rome to Warsaw on Polish LOT airlines. The next
day, he took a flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw but was taken from
the plane by police, held for four or five hours and then put on a
plane for Vienna.
   Morawiecki said authorities canceled the stamp on his passport
allowing him to return to Poland.

   Malaria continues to pose a risk for U.S.
travelers to many countries, striking about 1,000 a year, federal
experts said Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, in its weekly report,
reviewed for physicians and other health and travel professionals
the details of pre-travel precautions and post-infection treatment
for malaria.
   The disease, which causes fever and flu-like symptoms and can be
fatal, is transmitted by mosquitoes.
   Although malaria is almost never reported in the United States,
transmission continues in parts of Central and South America,
sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the
Middle East and the Pacific Islands, the CDC said.
   ``All travelers to malaria-endemic areas are advised to use an
appropriate drug regimen and personal protection measures to
prevent malaria,'' the CDC said. ``However, travelers must be
informed that, regardless of methods employed, malaria can still be
contracted.''
   The CDC recommends that most travelers to malaria areas begin
taking anti-malaria drugs a week or two before travel, continuing
during the trip and for four weeks afterward.
   In some areas, the drug chloroquine should be sufficient, but
resistance to that drug has become widespread in malaria areas, the
CDC said.
   ``That's the reason that nowadays the risk of malaria is much
higher than it used to be,'' said Dr. Hans Lobel, a CDC malaria
specialist.
   An alternate drug, Fansidar, can cause severe and even fatal
skin reactions, the CDC cautioned. Travelers to areas with
chloroquine-resistant malaria should carry a dose of Fansidar and
take it only if they develop a feverish illness when professional
care is not available, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   ``We really discourage the drug ... it's caused so many serious
adverse reactions,'' Lobel said. ``We are really waiting for some
more effective and safer drugs to come down.''
   Each year, malaria strikes about 1,000 Americans traveling
abroad, Lobel said, noting that if a traveler takes no precautions,
the risk in an area such as west Africa is about one in 50.
   The risk in Kenya, where many Americans traveling to Africa
visit, is about one in 200.
   In addition to drug precautions, the CDC urges travelers in
malaria areas to take other precautions at night, when mosquitoes
feed. These include wearing clothes that cover most of the body and
using mosquito nets and insect repellent.

<HEAD>Company Denies Wrongdoing In Disappearance of Heavy Water</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A company that produces heavy water, which
can be used to make nuclear weapons, said Thursday it was confident
its workers followed all the rules in shipping 15 tons of heavy
water that disappeared.
   The Foreign Ministry said police were beginning a criminal
investigation into the apparent misdirection of the heavy water,
which was to have been delivered to West Germany in 1983.
   ``We are very strict on following all the rules for exporting
heavy water,'' said Petter A. Christoffersen, spokesman for Norsk
Hydro A.S., which produces the water. ``We are quite certain that
all the rules have been followed to the last comma.''
   He said Norsk Hydro had given all its files and papers on the
matter to investigators.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Lasse Seim said the government traced
the air-freighted consignment to Basel, Switzerland but lost track
of it there. He said West Germany also was been asked to
investigate.
   A report in the newspaper Verdens Gang, which broke the story
April 21, said the material was sent to Dubai in the Persian Gulf
and probably shipped to India from there.
   Norway refuses to sell heavy water to India because it has not
signed the nuclear non-proliferation agreement.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, looks like ordinary water but
has an extra neutron and cools a nuclear reactor by moderating the
speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction.
   It enables the reactor to run on natural uranium instead of
enriched uranium fuel and to produce plutonium, which can be used
for nuclear weapons.
   About 40 of the world's 330 research reactors and 28 of the 387
nuclear power stations that were operating in 1986 use heavy water
for peaceful purposes, Christoffersen said.
   Norway has made heavy water since the 1930s as a by-product of
ammonia fertilizer and Norsk Hydro, Norway's only producer, has
made about 10-20 tons annually over the last 30 years,
Christoffersen said. That is about 2 percent of world production.
   German occupation forces took over the Norwegian factory in
World War II and it was the subject of the movie ``Heroes of
Telemark'' in 1965.
   Norwegian resistance fighters blew up the factory, hampering
Germany's nuclear research. It reopened after the war, but ammonia
production there has stopped.
   Norway tightened regulations on sensitive exports earlier this
year after a weapons factory was found to have sold technology to
the Soviet Union that would enable it to build quieter submarines.

   Preliminary results show that two of
three joints on the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket did not
leak during an April 22 qualifying test, a NASA official said today.
   Dave Mobley, NASA deputy project manager for the redesign
effort, said that engineers have inspected the aft and center field
joints and found both to be working as designed. Results of tests
on the forward joint are expected Friday.
   Mobley said today that engineers found that the center field
joint, which had an intentional flaw built into it for an April 22
test-firing at the Morton Thiokol plant 25 miles west of here, did
its job.
   He said the center field joint flaw allowed superhot gases to
reach insulation and the joint's O-ring, but the ring held.
   ``There was no damage to the O-ring at all,'' he said. ``There
was no evidence the gas got past'' the ring.
   Failure of an O-ring seal is blamed for triggering the Jan. 28,
1986, explosion that destroyed the space shuttle Challenger and
killed its seven-member crew.
   The booster tests are designed to evaluate the redesigned
booster, which is made up of several sections that are joined
together, and qualify the joints for use in an actual launch.
   Mobley also said engineers found no damage to the rocket's
nozzle section. In a December test-firing, a redesigned boot ring
on the section came apart.
   The April test used a boot ring that had proven reliable in the
past.
   Mobley said engineering evaluations would be conducted late
today on the redesigned booster's forward field joint, with results
expected Friday. He noted that while thorough, results from the
evaluations were tentative.
   A final report, based on more extensive study, isn't expected to
be ready for several weeks, he said.
   Two more full-scale tests of the booster are planned for June
and July, and the shuttle launch is tentatively set for late August
or early September.

<HEAD>Illegal Alien Groups Fear More Exploitation of Undocumented
Workers</HEAD>

   Illegal aliens in this country face a
``miserable existence'' of exploitation on the job as immigration
authorities move their emphasis from amnesty to employer sanctions,
according to groups working with undocumented residents.
   Life could get worse for the undocumented beginning June 1 when
the employer penalty program becomes fully operational under the
November 1986 immigration law. If the concept works, jobs will grow
more scarce for the undocumented.
   ``The concern is that employers who choose to violate the law
may ... reduce wages and lower working conditions ... because these
folks _ unlike in the past _ are not going to be able to quit and
go somewhere else to work,'' said Charles Kamasaki of the National
Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization.
   The INS this month will end its year-long phase-in period for
the sanctions, during which first offenders were only issued
warnings for knowingly hiring illegal aliens.
   Starting June 1, violaters face heavy fines, whether a first or
repeat offender. In the phase-in period, there were 2,200 citations
issued against repeat violators, and 80 fines imposed totaling
$250,000.
   Bud Coster, INS associate commissioner for enforcement, said the
agency will have 8,500 enforcement personnel to deal with the
sanctions program, although voluntary compliance still will be
stressed.
   The program of employer education and financial penalties is
designed to dry up jobs for illegal aliens, which by INS estimates
could number 4 million following the end of Wednesday's amnesty
application period.
   ``The fear is that people will be forced further underground
into a more clandestine labor market,'' said The Rev. Monsignor
Nicholas DiMarzio, director of migration and refugee services for
the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``They will have few, if any, rights
or the ability to get out of those situations.''
   DiMarzio said aliens facing a declining job market ``have few,
if any, rights. ... For the people who are stuck, it will be a
rather miserable existence.''
   Kamasaki, director of policy analysis for La Raza, said, ``For
people who don't have work, it will be tougher to get a job. For
those who have jobs, it will be more difficult to quit.
   ``Employers are going to have substantially more leverage over
their undocumented employees than they did before the law passed.''
   Groups in contact with the aliens predicted relatively few will
go back to their native lands.
   Some fear political persecution in countries such as Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and, lately, Panama. Others face
such terrible poverty in their native lands that they will take the
risk of getting caught by staying in the Unite States. If deported,
they would only be sent back home, anyway.
   Jess Quintero, a vice president with the League of United Latin
American Citizens, said while aliens may not go home, some may end
up in Canada.
   ``Some of us have personally spoken with Salvadorans who have
now left for Canada,'' Quintero said. ``They tried to get
documented in the United States and were turned down. As little as
three weeks ago, when they arrived in Canada, they were immediately
accepted for documentation.''
   Linda Wong, immigration director for the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund in Los Angeles, said many aliens would
remain in the country illegally as ``a last desperate effort'' to
find security.
   ``They have tried to make it on their own in their country of
origin, and were not able to support themselves and families,'' she
said.
   She predicted that the illegal aliens ``will manage to get
work'' because some employers will take the chance that they won't
be caught. But she said the available work will not be the type
that will produce increased security for alien families. Much of
the work will be temporary, she said.
   Ms. Wong said a recent decline in public school enrollment of
Hispanic-surnamed students in her city could be a result of the
1986 immigration law.
   Illegal aliens, she said, ``fear the immigration service will go
to public schools and pick up students as well as parents.''
   And as job opportunities decrease, she said, ``there will be
increased pressure on school-age children to become principal
breadwinners for families.''

   The French, jubilant at the return of their last
three hostages from Lebanon, seemed largely impervious Thursday to
complaints that France had dealt with terrorists while 18 other
foreigners remain captive.
   The French government denied any deals were struck or payments
made.
   ``I think it's thoroughly bad,'' said Peter Temple-Morris, the
parliamentary specialist on Lebanon for Britain's Conservative
Party. ``No responsible nation and no responsible government _ and
I say that directly to the French government and the French people
_ should deal with terrorism.''
   ``Brazen and cynical,'' added David Owen of the Social Democrats.
   In Washington, the Reagan administration reiterated its refusal
to deal with kidnappers. ``We hope that deals were not made of a
kind that we object to in our own policies on terrorism,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   French Premier Jacques Chirac, who received credit for the
release four days before facing President Francois Mitterrand in
presidential elections, said after greeting the hostages Thursday,
``We have never ceased to act with dignity and honor, conforming
strictly to values shared with other countries, adhering strictly
to the grand principles of our foreign policy, to those of our
friends.''
   Media reports said France agreed to pay Iran the remaining $400
million of a longstanding $1 billion loan frozen after the Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
   Persistent speculation is that Chirac also agreed to temper arms
sales to Iraq, Iran's enemy in a 7{-year-old war, and increase
those to Iran, along with a direct payment labeled for some other
purpose. None of this could be confirmed.
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua insisted, ``We have not ceded
to any claim. We have not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone,
not a franc, not a dollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''
   
   Peggy Say, sister of Associated Press correspondent Terry
Anderson who has been held hostage since March 1985, said she
thinks the United States is doing little to free the hostages. ``It
almost appears the French government places a higher priority on
the lives of their people than the American government does,'' she
said in Batavia, N.Y.
   Despite the government denials, Remy Leveau, professor and
Middle East expert at the prestigious Political Sciences Institute,
said he was certain a deal had been struck. Even so, he said it
would not encourage terrorists.
   
   ``This phenomenon has become generalized, and it is with you,
whether you pay or you don't pay,'' he said. ``The Americans proved
with Irangate that they are also willing to deal in the end.''
   ``This has gotten to be the hotel business,'' he said. ``France
paid the bill.''
   Ivor Stanbrook, another British Conservative Party legislator,
directed reproach at Chirac.
   ``It is a desperate attempt by Chirac to save his
candidacy...disgraceful. The consequences for all Europeans in the
Middle East will now be that much more dangerous, and for the
French they will be dire. It is a desperately foolish thing to have
done,'' he said.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reaffirmed her
determination not to pay ransom to the captors of Britons missing
in Lebanon. ``We will not in fact pay ransom or make any particular
payment of that kind in order for the hostages to be released,''
she told Parliament.
   But Mitterrand's campaign manager, Pierre Beregovoy, said the
hostages were released ``in conditions that do honor to our
country.''
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National
Front who ran against Mitterrand and Chirac in last month's
preliminary presidential election and was eliminated from the
runoff, called the deal ``a defeat.''
   `There is the other side of this, a death and the price that I
would like to know. There is only one way to deal with terrorists,
that used in Ouvea.''
   He was referring to the French police raid on Melanesian
separatists holding hostages in New Caledonia. Fifteen
hostage-takers were killed, and the 23 hostages were freed.
   Abroad, comment ranged from dubious to scathing. The influential
Swiss daily, Tribune de Geneve, editorialized:
   ``In freeing (the hostages), Tehran raised stakes to the
maximum. What is the price paid by Paris? Very high, most
likely...not counting eventual ransoms denied officially but
insinuated privately.''
   Reporters watched for a possible release of Anis Nacache, held
in a French prisoner for the attempted assassination of former
Iranian prime minister Shahpour Bakhtiar.
   French papers offered triumphant headlines but subdued comment.
The normally iconoclastic and widely read daily, Liberation,
limited itself to a signed comment by Marc Kravetz, its foreign
editor.
   ``First, the joy, undiluted joy,'' he wrote, adding later:
``This liberation is certainly a considerable success for those who
obtained it. Success for shadowy diplomacy and bargaining.
   ``Forget money paid to kidnappers, secondary players in the
operation. Iran wanted arms, political concessions, prisoners
released. We do not know _ will we ever know? _ what was paid.
   ``Joy cannot hide the uneasiness,'' Kravetz concluded. ``It is
as absurd to deny this happiness as it is legitimate to worry over
the immediate future.''
   The influential daily, Le Monde, published Thursday afternoon,
did not mention British criticism, and its editorial skirted
foreign comment. But it raised key questions:
   What was Algeria's role? Why did Iranian leaders _ and Shiite
Lebanese who follow them _ accord to Chirac what they refused a
Socialist prime minister two years ago?
   And, finally, the question everyone is asking and no one has
answered convincingly: What was the price?``

   Raymond Keller was routinely following his
trash collection route when he found that someone had put out a
better quality trash than usual _ a pile of bills that added up to
$2,178.
   ``I thought, `What did somebody do, rob a bank or something?'''
Keller said Wednesday.
   He stuffed the money in his pocket, finished his route and went
to his boss for advice. Then Keller went to Garfield County Sheriff
Bob Burnett.
   ``He came in and said he needed to talk to me and then reached
into his pocket and pulled out a wad of bills,'' Burnett said. ``We
counted it over and over and it came to $2,178.''
   Burnett traced the money to a businessman, at whose home the
money was found with the trash.
   The businessman, who asked to remain anonymous, said the money
accidentally got in the trash when his wife cleaned out his safe.
   Keller, who was given a $200 reward, said he never thought about
keeping the money.
   ``My dad told me you've got to be honest and stay honest. If you
get into trouble you aren't going to get out,'' he said.

   Officials at two federal prisons where Cuban
inmates rioted last November failed to secure the facilities partly
because early signs of trouble were not relayed to them by prison
personnel, according to a Justice Department report.
   Officials at the Oakdale, La., and Atlanta, Ga., federal prisons
also had no plans for dealing with institution-wide disturbances,
said the report, dated Feb. 1 but not made available until
Wednesday.
   The rioting, which lasted for eight days at Oakdale and 11 days
at Atlanta, included the taking of prison guards as hostages and
resulted in one death of a detainee and millions of dollars in
damage to the institutions. It was triggered by a State Department
announcement of a pact with Cuba that would have led to deportation
of some of the inmates.
   The report said ``takeovers as complete as those at Oakdale and
Atlanta literally were unimagined.''
   It said Oakdale officials ignored ``warning signs,'' including
an inmate food fight in the cafeteria, and said important
information was not conveyed to the warden or other officials.
   On Atlanta, the report said Warden Joseph Petrovsky ``would have
attempted a lock-down had he received enough reliable information
that a disturbance was likely.'' It said he was told by his staff
that Atlanta inmates were calm after the Oakdale rioting began.
   ``In actuality,'' the report said, ``line staff had overheard
detainees' conversations about hostage-taking, received warnings
from informants and noticed other indications of potential unrest.''
   Thomas Boyd, assistant attorney general, acknowledged in a
letter accompanying the report that Justice Department training
programs dealing with emergency responses and hostage situations
``may be further improved.''

<HEAD>Dyson Denies Rumors of Homosexuality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STUCKEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HUGHESVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emerging from seclusion following the
apparent suicide of his top aide, Rep. Roy Dyson firmly denied that
either he or the aide were homosexuals.
   The Maryland Democrat said at a Wednesday news conference that
he thinks Tom Pappas committed suicide Sunday because he believed
his reputation would be destroyed by a story in The Washington Post.
   The Post had reported that Pappas imposed unorthodox demands on
young male staffers, requiring them to attend social functions,
asking one to perform a strip tease at a staff retreat and firing
another for leaving a party.
   Pappas, Dyson's administrative aide and campaign manager, died
in a fall from the 24th floor of a New York hotel on Sunday.
   Asked the nature of his relationship with the 46-year-old
Pappas, who had been with him throughout his political career,
Dyson said the two ``were very, very good friends.''
   ``He was like a brother. We had a personal and professional
relationship,'' Dyson said.
   Dyson was asked if Pappas was a homosexual.
   ``No, he was not,'' he said.
   ``Are you?'' he was asked.
   ``No, I am not,'' he replied firmly.
   Dyson complained that the Post story was based on interviews
with a few disgruntled former staffers and gave only one side of
the story.
   ``What I would certainly have preferred was that the other side
be given a chance,'' he said. However, he admitted that the Post
had asked him for comment on the original story and he had declined
on the advice of his attorneys.
   Dyson said he, Pappas and Todd Skipper, another staff member,
had gone to New York for a long-scheduled trip to visit a defense
contractor's plant. He said part of the expenses, including
Saturday night tickets to the hit musical ``Phantom of the Opera,''
were paid for by the contractor.
   Reviewing the hours before Pappas died, Dyson said he talked to
his aide twice after the Post story was read to Pappas by a staffer
in Maryland on Sunday morning.
   ``The impression I had was that he was very upbeat, that we
could cope with it,'' Dyson said. But he said Pappas also knew
``that his reputation would be ruined.''
   Dyson said he doesn't recall the contents of a note left in the
room by Pappas, but that it was not addressed to anyone, did not
mention any names and ``did not seem like a suicide note to me.''
   The congressman said he didn't think his chances of winning
another term will be hurt by publicity surrounding Pappas' death.He
said he has a new chief of staff, Katie Tucker, and a new campaign
chairman, Christopher Robinson, and is ready to get back to work.
   Dyson said Pappas made some mistakes, but called him ``a man of
integrity, of compassion.''

<TEXT>
   The destruction of a Nevada plant that
makes fuel for the space shuttle could delay production for the
shuttle's booster rocket, but NASA says it probably won't delay the
shuttle's next flight.
   The explosions Wednesday leveled the Pacific Engineering &
Production Co. plant at Henderson, Nev., but Billie Deason, a NASA
spokeswoman in Houston, said the Kerr-McGee plant in Henderson
could provide Morton Thiokol Inc. with the oxidizer, ammonium
perchlorate, used in the boosters.
   ``The production of both suppliers was planned to support a
shuttle flight rate of about 24 per year. We don't expect supply
problems,'' she said.
   Don Amitor, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said Thiokol had enough ammonium perchlorate
for the next five shuttle launches. Under the present schedule, the
fifth launch would be in mid-1989.
   However, Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said there could be
performance differences in the oxidizers produced by the two plants.
   ``If the Pacific Engineering plant is down for an indefinite
period of time, there could be delays in our production,'' Raab
said. ``We're looking into our stockpiles to determine how much of
the material we have.''
   An oxidizer is needed in the booster rockets to provide an
oxygen supply so that the rockets' fuel can ignite and burn.
   Raab said the matter is complicated further because government
specifications for solid-fuel rockets are based on which plant
produces the oxidizer.
   ``Whatever supplier made the materials for the motor you qualify
for, that's the supplier you're supposed to use in the kind of
motor you're making,'' he said.
   ``We're determining what motors were designed for the ammonium
perchlorate we got from Pacific Engineering. We just don't have an
answer yet on exactly how we'll be affected.''
   Every solid-fuel rocket motor made in the United States has some
ammonium perchlorate in it, and only Kerr-McGee and Pacific
Engineering produce it. Thiokol buys material from both plants, as
do other aerospace companies and the Department of Defense.
   ``The Department of Defense could step in and claim all the
production at Kerr-McGee,'' Raab said.
   Ted Olsen, spokesman for rocket-maker Hercules Inc. in Magna,
Utah, said Kerr-McGee and Pacific Engineering also supply Hercules
with oxidizer. He said company officials are working to determine
what impact the plant's destruction will have on Hercules.
   A Pentagon official, who asked not to be named, said it was
``certainly premature'' to suggest the Defense Department might
monopolize production at Kerr-McGee.
   ``We do not expect to see any immediate impact,'' the official
added.
   According to the Pentagon, ammonium perchlorate is used on the
MX, Titan and Minuteman missiles and would be needed if a decision
is made to build the Midgetman mobile nuclear missile.
   The Pentagon and armed forces do not contract with Pacific
Engineering directly, however, instead leaving that to three prime
contractors: Morton Thiokol; Hercules, and Aerojet.
   The first 50 MX missiles are now being deployed and the accident
won't affect that work, the Pentagon added.

   Captain Kangaroo is OK for kids, but some
students at Western Connecticut State University say it could be a
tad embarrassing to have Bob Keeshan as commencement speaker.
   ``This is the first time in 35 years I have encountered this
reaction,'' Keeshan said Wednesday from his Babylon, N.Y., home.
``I don't know what they expect, Mr. Moose and dropping pingpong
balls? I will give them stuff to think about and if they can't be
open to my message, then WestConn did not do a good job on them.''
   Supporters note that Keeshan, 61, has received the Peabody Award
for Outstanding Television three times and six Emmy Awards, among
other honors.
   But Joshua P. Marks, a senior, wrote in a letter to the school
newspaper: ``I'm sure Captain Kangaroo is a delightful fellow, but
it is of the opinion of many students he offers no insight or
inspirational impetus for our seniors to attain career pursuits.''
   Rick Haught, the school's assistant director of student
activities, worked with the senior class in picking Keeshan for the
May 15 ceremonies.
   ``OK, I'll admit it, I love the Captain!'' Haught wrote in the
school paper. ``But Captain Kangaroo is not the person who will be
addressing our new graduates, Bob Keeshan the man, will.''

   A Scottsdale-based company that markets a
product called Rain-X is suing Andy Rooney.
   The company is displeased with remarks the commentator made
April 17 on CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' In short, Rooney said Rain-X
doesn't work.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Phoenix,
names Rooney and CBS Inc. as defendants.
   Unelko, the company that markets Rain-X, is seeking $15 million
in punitive damages, saying Rooney's comments tarnished the
reputation of its product.
   Rain-X is a liquid that, when applied to a vehicle's windshield,
is supposed to make rain and snow roll off more quickly to improve
visibility.
   An attorney for CBS, Douglas Jacobs in New York, said that when
Unelko demanded a retraction, CBS officials asked them to make an
official request by letter, but Unelko declined.
   CBS had ``60 Minutes'' anchor Mike Wallace read a letter on the
air Sunday from race-car driver Mario Andretti praising Rain-X. But
Wallace also noted that Andretti is a spokesman for Unelko.

   ``The Devil in the White House'' provoked the
Battle of the Publishing Houses, and suspense novelist Lawrence
Sanders is richer for it.
   His latest book sold at auction Wednesday for $2.85 million in a
tug-of-war among eight publishing houses. The Putnam Publishing
Group bought the hardback and paperback rights.
   The author of such successful novels as ``The Anderson Tapes''
and ``The First Deadly Sin,'' Sanders demanded and got a 15 percent
royalty on all hardcover and paperback sales. Under most contracts,
hardcover royalties begin at 10 percent, while paperback royalties
rarely reach 15 percent until hundreds of thousands of copies are
sold.
   It was the second blockbuster literary sale this week. On
Monday, Simon & Schuster and Pocket Books agreed to pay
mystery-suspense writer Mary Higgins Clark a minimum $10.1 million
for four books and a collection of short stories.

   Librarians and manuscript curators are uneasy
about Nobel laureate Saul Bellow's plans to sell all rough draft
material from his 1970 novel ``Mr. Sammler's Planet.''
   The unprecedented sale has them echoing the concerns of Lola
Szladits, curator of the Berg Collection of the New York Public
Library. She worries that a purchase by an investor will cut
scholars' access to the archive.
   ``For him (Bellow) it's over, but it's not over for the reader
and the literary critic, and it is not over in the flow of literary
history,'' Ms. Szladits said. ``The written traces of great
creative minds will just disappear if their manuscripts do.''
   The material is on loan to the Regenstein Library of the
University of Chicago, where Bellow is a professor of English and
social thought.
   The four handwritten notebooks, typescript, galleys and all
papers relating to the book go on the block June 7 at Sotheby's. It
will be the first archive of a major living author's published work
to be auctioned, and the first manuscript material sold by Bellow.
   The pre-sale estimate of the collection's value is $60,000 to
$100,000, according to David Redden, head of Sotheby's books and
manuscripts department.

   Trade, presidential politics, women in politics

prime minister of Finland and Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy.
   Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, who said he was in the United
States to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the landing of the
first Finns in America, flew to Boston from Washington.
   ``Most of the ice breakers in the world are made in Finland and
used all over ... except in the United States,'' Holkeri said.
   He added, with some pride, that the Finns also make cruise ships
_ including the Pacific Princess, featured in television's ``The
Love Boat.''
   Holkeri also called it ``quite obvious'' that Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis will be the Democratic presidential nominee and told Murphy
``I'm informed that your personal future is involved.''
   ``Yes, I'm cheering him on,'' Murphy said.

   Israeli troops barking orders
through megaphones demanded a three-day halt to all West Bank
commerce Thursday and threatened to weld shut the shops of defiant
Arab merchants.
   Near the village of Beita, where an Israeli teen-ager was slain
last month, hundreds of Jewish settlers trudged along a mountain
path waving Israeli flags. They chanted ``expel the Arabs!'' and
vowed not to leave the occupied West Bank.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, troops fired tear gas at about 150
children who set tires ablaze and raised the Palestinian flag to
protest the army's closing of Arab schools.
   Israeli troops ordered the ban on West Bank commerce to punish
Arab residents for a one-day strike Wednesday that was called by
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Soldiers ordered shops to stay closed until Sunday, and they
threatened to weld shut the shops of merchants who disobeyed the
mandate.
   In Jericho, the army shut down the West Bank's largest vegetable
market, and stores were ordered shut in Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem,
Hebron and Bethlehem.
   In Nablus, troops erected roadblocks and prevented Arab taxis
and buses from leaving the city to punish residents for adhering to
Wednesday's work stoppage, which paralyzed the occupied territories.
   Businessman Saed Kenaan of Nablus said the army action was aimed
at creating dissension between Palestinians and the underground
leaders who order the strikes.
   ``It's clear the Israelis are trying to drive a wedge between
the people and the leaders,'' Kenaan said. ``But people are aware
of the Israeli games.''
   In Gaza City, scores of school children chanting ``PLO yes,
Israel no!'' hoisted the Palestinian flag onto a pole at a school
run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, an Arab reporter
said. The Palestinian flag is outlawed in Israel.
   Troops fired tear gas to disperse the children, who erected
barricades of boulders and set tires ablaze in front of the school,
the reporter said.
   During a four-hour march Thursday, about 1,000 Jewish settlers,
many with rifles slung over their shoulders, retraced the route
taken by teen-age hikers when a bloody clash erupted April 6 at the
Arab village of Beita. A 15-year-old Israeli girl and two
Palestinians were killed.
   ``We want to finish what we started 30 days ago,'' said Menachem
Ilan, one of two armed escorts with the hikers last month. ``We
intend to show people everywhere that the nation of Israel can walk
freely in every part of the land of Israel.''
   ``I'm proud to do it again, but it feels like a nightmare,''
said 15-year-old Ariel Avivi, one of 16 teen-agers who took part in
the April hike.
   In a report that caused an uproar in Israel, the army determined
the slain girl, Tirza Porat, was accidentally shot to death by an
Israeli guard accompanying the hikers. But Jewish settlers have
accused Arabs have causing her death by stoning the hikers.
   The girl and a soldier are the only Israelis to die since
Palestinians began their five-month uprising against Israeli rule
in the occupied lands. According to U.N. figures, 183 Palestinians
have died in the violence.
   On Thursday, the hikers clapped and sang nationalist songs as
they trekked along a rocky path that began in the Jewish settlement
of Tappuah, about five miles south of Beita. It ended at an army
base about eight miles away, where the settlers held a ceremony in
the girl's honor.
   The march did not go through the village of Beita or to the dry
riverbed nearby where the Israeli hikers clashed with Arab
villagers. Organizers of the march said it followed the route the
hikers intended to take before they were led by the Arabs into
Beita.
   A military helicopter circled overhead and dozens oftroops
watched the march from a mountaintop.
   ``We want to show those Arabs they can't destroy us and we're
not afraid of them,'' said 15-year-old Rina Efrach, from the nearby
settlement of Kadumim. ``Of course I'm afraid personally, but we
can't show that because then they will break us.''

   A Supreme Court justice today refused to block
the extradition of a former Argentine general charged with 39
murders in his country's so-called ``dirty war'' against suspected
subversives in the 1970s.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, by denying an emergency request,
cleared the way for the return of Carlos G. Suarez-Mason to
Argentina from San Francisco, where he is in the custody of federal
marshals.
   He had sought to stay in this country while a federal appeals
court studies his case.
   A federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
previously had refused to grant Suarez-Mason any emergency help.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zanides, who represented the
Argentine government in the case, said O'Connor's action removes
the last practical barrier to Suarez-Mason's extradition. Zanides
said all records in the case are now in the hands of the State
Department, which makes the final decision on extraditions.
   Lawyers for Suarez-Mason have said that if the courts refuse
emergency intervention, they will ask Secretary of State George
Shultz to postpone action on an extradition until their appeal of
last week's ruling can be heard in full.
   Suarez-Mason, 64, was a high-ranking general in Argentina's Army
during the reign of a military junta that took power after
President Juan Peron's death in 1974.
   Suarez-Mason commanded one of five military zones, the one in
which the capital city of Buenas Aires was located.
   According to U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen, the military
junta's method of dealing with suspected opponents ``was direct:
abduct anyone they suspected of subversion off the street or out of
their homes; transport them to secret detention centers; torture
them physically, psychologically and often sexually; and, in vast
numbers, kill them.''
   Jensen said more than 12,000 people disappeared, and were
presumably killed, during the junta's reign, which ended in 1983.
The judge said some 5,000 people disappeared in the military zone
commanded by Suarez-Mason.
   He faces charges on 39 counts of homicide in Argentina.
   Suarez-Mason asked O'Connor to postpone his extradition, which
he said could be imminent, until the 9th Circuit court considers a
formal appeal he has filed with it.
   If Suarez-Mason is turned over to Argentine officials before
then, his lawyers said, ``his appeal becomes meaningless.''
   The emergency request said a treaty between the United States
and Argentina forbids extradition for either political or military
offenses.
   Suarez-Mason also has been sued in U.S. courts by survivors of
the military junta's ``dirty war.''
   A federal judge in San Francisco recently ordered him to pay
$21.7 million in damages to Horacio Martinez-Baca, an Argentine
lawyer who was imprisoned and tortured for four years in the Buenas
Aires area but now lives in Oakland, Calif.
   Suarez-Mason's ability to pay any of the judgment against him
remains a matter of contention.
   The case is Suarez-Mason vs. Robinson, A-847.

   Three freed French hostages returned to France
today after three years of captivity in Lebanon, and Premier
Jacques Chirac thanked Iran for intervening to free the Frenchmen.
   Iran said it intervened for ``humanitarian reasons.'' Chirac
said normal relations with Iran, broken July 17, ``could be
envisaged.''
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua told reporters that no money
was paid to free the hostages and that France did not negotiate
with the captors. But a Syrian mediator said France repaid $670
million in borrowed money to Iran and made other compensation to
the kidnappers.
   Diplomats Marcel Carton, 62, Marcel Fontaine, 45, and journalist
Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, arrived at the military airport of
Villacoublay in a special government jet. They were freed Wednesday
evening in Beirut.
   ``It's an incredible day,'' Kauffmann said, looking thin but
healthy. ``But it's also a day which remains overshadowed because
we are just three.''
   Kauffmann then spoke at length about Michel Seurat, the French
researcher captured with him who is believed dead. Kauffmann said
earlier that Seurat, said to have been executed by his kidnappers,
probably died of cancer.
   ``I'm a little ashamed to be here today,'' Kauffmann said. He
then recalled Western hostages still being held in Beirut ``leading
that nightmare life.''
   Carton said the three saw other hostages, but did not know who
they were.
   Chirac, in a short address, also thanked Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Lebanese military authorities for their help in gaining
freedom for the hostages, who were held by pro-Iranian extremists.
   ``As we all know, the liberation of our hostages falls into the
framework of our relations with Iran,'' Chirac said. ``It's the
authorities in Tehran who intervened with the captors so that they
free our countrymen.'' He said that France had been awaiting the
releases ``for weeks and for months.''
   Iran's official Tehran Television, monitored in Cyprus, quoted
Ali Reza Moayyeri, a deputy prime minister for political affairs,
as saying that Iran interceded with ``the Moslem people of
Lebanon'' on behalf of the hostages.
   The broadcast quoted Moayyeri as predicting the release would
lead to the restoration of diplomatic relations with France.
   Chirac, evoking questions about the means by which the hostages
were freed, said the government ``never ceased to act with dignity
and honor.''
   Commentators immediately raised the issue of a deal and began
speculating about what transpired. Ten French hostages have been
freed since Chirac's government took office in March 1986.
   In response to questions from reporters, Pasqua said: ``We have
not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone, not a franc, not a
dollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''
   ``There were no negotiations with the captors,'' he continued.
``I think that would have been completely useless.''
   There were reports in Beirut that France agreed to repay Iran's
fundamentalist rulers the outstanding two-thirds of a $1 billion
loan made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   A Syrian mediator said in Geneva today that France finished
repaying the loan as part of the deal.
   ``It was paid back in three installments, the last one just very
recently,'' Omran Adham told The Associated Press. ``This is my
information from the French, Syrians and Iranians.''
   Adham, a 41-year-old Syrian businessman, undertook several
mediation missions over the past two years in which he asked Assad
to intervene with Iran for the freeing of the hostages.
   He said he was certain the French government offered other
``compensation for the kidnappers,'' though he had no proof. The
government expelled Adham from France Tuesday.
   It was not known what effect the release might have on Chirac's
chances in Sunday's presidential runoff against President Francois
Mitterrand. The Socialist president, who is seeking a second
seven-year term, has been considered the favorite.
   The hostages arrived at the airport at 10:37 a.m. (4:37 a.m.
EDT).
   Carton's wife, Denise, left Beirut today to join her husband in
Paris. Airport sources said she was flying via Zurich.
   ``As soon as the detention of our hostages in Lebanon ended, the
reestablishment of normal relations between France and Iran could
be envisaged conforming to our concept of what rapport between
states should be,'' Chirac said.
   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations last summer in a
dispute over an Iranian Embassy employee, Wahid Gordji, who refused
to submit to questioning about the series of bombings in Paris in
September 1986.
   Carton, former embassy vice consul in Beirut, told a reporter
aboard the plane that he and the other captives ``saw other
hostages, but we did not know exactly who they were.''
   Seurat, a 39-year-old academic researcher, was kidnapped May 22,
1985, along with Kauffmann, a magazine reporter with whom he was
working. Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, claimed it killed him March 5,
1986. His body was not found, but his wife said French officials
confirmed his death.
   Carton and Fontaine, an embassy protocol officer in Beirut, were
seized by Islamic Jihad on March 22, 1985.
   There are still 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing
and believed held hostage in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest
held. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, responding to reports that Carton
had spent time as a hostage with Anderson, said she was encouraged.
   ``I was very anxious to view the other hostages as they got off
the plane,'' she said in an interview in Batavia, N.Y. ``The very
fact that they were walking and talking was encouraging to me. And
especially now that I know that Mr. Carton spent time with Terry.''

   The Reagan administration today charged
Nicaragua's government with systematically undermining peace talks
by moves that a Republican congressman said are designed to hold up
U.S. humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels.
   ``We are very concerned by the systematic moves of the
Sandinista government to undermine the peace process and intimidate
its political opposition,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Fitzwater said actions in the last 72 hours by Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega ``have once again held his true colors
high, showing that he has little intention of supporting a free
press, of allowing democratic dissent or making the reforms called
for by the Guatemala City peace plan.''
   Meanwhile, at a news conference, Contra political leader Adolfo
Calero accused the Sandinistas of trying to force the rebels into a
choice between ``hunger and surrender.''
   He said the insurgents refuse to accept that choice and plan to
continue negotiations with the Sandinistas on the basis of the
temporary cease fire agreement signed six weeks ago.
   But, he said, the rebel forces will not enter the seven cease
fire zones which have been mutually agreed to ``if there is no
assurance of delivery of the aid which has been approved.
   The aid of the U.S. government ``has been held as hostage by the
Sandinista government all this time.''
   In Managua, Nicaragua, spokesmen for opposition parties said
that police detained more than 25 opposition leaders who had
gathered to support workers on a hunger strike and held the leaders
for about two hours.
   On Tuesday, the Nicaraguan Interior Ministry barred the
privately owned Radio Mundial and the Roman Catholic station Radio
Catolica from broadcasting news for eight days. It also closed
Radio Corporacion for 24 hours for airing ``false news'' about the
strike.
   Fitzwater said, ``This intimidation of the media and political
opposition can only be a further hindrance to the peace process.''
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., who met with Secretary of
State George Shultz along with other members of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said, ``There is a deep concern about the
situation that is developing in Nicaragua.''
   ``The Sandinistas are stalling on the negotiations and holding
U.S. aid as hostage,'' Broomfield said after an hour-long
closed-door meeting with Shultz, who declined to answer reporters'
questions. ``You could just feel his letdown on this development.''
   Broomfield said a $49 million aid package approved a month ago
to encourage peace talks between the two warring sides seemed to be
having the opposite effect. ``The action taken by Congress has
really helped the Sandinistas jeopardize the Contras,'' he said.
   ``It seems to me the Democrat leadership has a responsibility to
put pressure on the Sandinistas to carry out the intent of Congress
and supply humanitarian aid,'' he said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, acknowledged that aid was not
flowing as Congress intended but said the problem seemed to be more
with State Department officials administering the aid than with the
Sandinistas.
   Wright was scheduled to meet separately later in the day with
officials of the State Department's Agency for International
Development and with a group of Contra leaders.
   ``We're going to sit down with them and find out what's the
holdup,'' he said. But he noted that none of the $10 million
earmarked to pay expenses of a Nicaraguan verification commission
has been spent. ``That's where the thing may have broken down.''
   The commission is made up of Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo and Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the Organization
of American States, and is to monitor the March 23 cease-fire
agreement between the two sides.
   Among the commission's tasks is to inspect cargo destined for
the Contras in the field to ensure there are no weapons included,
and to mediate disagreements over what agency or contractor is to
deliver the aid.
   AID officials have awarded contracts to begin a $17.7 million
program of medical care for children on both sides of the conflicts
who are victims of the nearly seven-year war, and a small amount of
that money has begun to flow. A limited amount of food, clothing
and medicine also has been delivered to Contra troops inside the
Honduran border.
   Negotiations to implement a 60-day cease fire agreed to March 23
in Sapoa, Nicaragua, have stalled, and the situation has been
further complicated by a split in Contra ranks over negotiating
strategy and who is to provide military leadership.

   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead will
hold talks with Algerian officials next week regarding their
government's role in ending the hijacking of a Kuwaiti jetliner,
the State Department announced Thursday.
   Whitehead will visit Algeria, Tunis and Morocco between May 9
and 15, said spokesman Charles Redman. He will then travel to Paris
for talks with officials there and a meeting of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, an association of the
major industrial countries.
   In his talks in Algiers, Whitehead will ask for information
regarding the fate of the hijackers and the terms of the deal under
which they released 31 hostages following their 16-day ordeal last
month.
   Algeria has been reluctant to disclose details of the case,
contending it must maintain its international credibility as a
crisis negotiator.
   Redman said the United States still does not have any indication
that the hijackers left Algeria, despite news reports that the
Iranian-backed extremists traveled from Algiers to Syria and then
to Lebanon.
   U.S. officials said last week that Kuwait had apparently
conveyed to the hijackers a promise that it would grant an early
release to five of the 17 prisoners whose freedom was being sought
by the hijackers. The 17 were convicted in the 1983 bombings of
U.S. and French facilities in Kuwait.
   The officials say Kuwait, which has denied making any deal,
probably does not have any intention of keeping its promise. They
also say Syria has firmly denied that the hijackers came there from
Algiers.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz praised Algeria for
mediating the hostages' release but criticized it for letting the
hijackers get away.

<TEXT>
   Bishop Eugene A. Marino was greeted with applause
from priests, parishioners and civil rights leaders today as he
entered a packed auditorium for his installation as the nation's
first black Roman Catholic archbishop.
   The audience at the 4,580-seat Atlantic Civic Center included
members of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.'s
family. The Mass was also being beamed by closed circuit television
to overflow crowds at a nearby theater and on local and national
cable TV networks.
   In March, Pope John Paul II chose the 53-year-old cleric to
become archbishop of Atlanta.
   The Mass was also attended by more than 800 members of the
clergy, including nearly 100 Roman Catholic bishops and four
cardinals, as well as local officials, representatives of local
Catholic congregations and other state religious leaders.
   Archbishop Pio Laghi, the pope's representative in the United
States, was leading the celebration.
   Claud Shirley, assistant director of communications for the
archdiocese, recalled that when Atlanta's last archbishop was
installed, the Mass was held at the Cathredral of Christ the King,
a 50-year-old Gothic church in the upscale Buckhead section of
Atlanta.
   Scant attention was paid to the installation of Archbishop
Thomas A. Donnellan on July 16, 1968, he said. Marino succeeds
Donnellan, who died in October.
   Shirley said the differences in the two Masses are attributed to
more than Marino's status as the first black archbishop in the
country.
   ``The pope has set the tone for these major events insofar as he
enjoys seeing and being seen by as many people as possible,''
Shirley said. ``The trend is towards large public events, when it
is a major event.''
   Marino's installation has been divided into two services, one
Wednesday night at Christ the King, where he presented his
credentials and was received by the 200 priests in the archdiocese.
   Marino, who spent the last 14 years as auxiliary bishop in
Washington, D.C., said he is comfortable returning to the South,
despite the discrimination he experienced firsthand as a youth in
his hometown of Biloxi, Miss.
   ``I think that the South has changed and come of age and
grown,'' he told one interviewer. ``In many ways, the race question
has been more effectively addressed in the South than it has been
in the North.''
   Marino has been a pioneer for blacks within the U.S. Catholic
Church, becoming the first black to hold office in the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   But he downplays his role as the church's spokesman on civil
rights, even though he comes to Atlanta, the base of many past and
present civil rights leaders.
   He said his appointment presents ``a great sign of hope to all
of our people, to all of our black Catholics and to black people in
our country.''
   While in Washington, Marino developed a reputation as an
advocate for the poor, the imprisoned and the homeless, frequently
serving as their spokesman in national and local legislative forums.
   In the seven weeks since his appointment, Marino has kept up
with developments in the Atlanta area, according to the Rev. Peter
Dora, director of communications for the archdiocese.
   Among those events was the indictment of a former priest at a
large suburban church on charges of molesting altar boys.
   Authorities have said they are investigating whether
archdiocesan officials knew of the allegations but withheld
information, and one priest at the church was disciplined after he
blamed celibacy for sexual and behaviorial aberrations among the
clergy.
   Marino also will face dissension at the cathedral that will
serve as his home church.
   The cathedral needs repairs, and a consultant has recommended
that renovation include the addition of chapels.
   But opponents say the plans will ruin the church's traditional
beauty and they claim the proposals have caused people to leave for
other churches. In February, the cathedral's administrator, the
Rev. Richard Kiernan, promised no decision would be made without
``the wisdom and guidance of our next archbishop.''
   The archdiocese covers 69 counties of north Georgia and has a
Catholic population of 156,000 out of a total population of 3.7
million. About 200 priests are in the archdiocese.

<HEAD>1918 Graduates of Danvers High Class Reunite: Both of Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was a great turnout for the 70th
reunion of Danvers High School's class of 1918. All the graduates
showed up _ all two of 'em.
   It was a no-fuss affair. Elsie Stahly, 87, cooked cube steaks
and Louise Gaddis, 88, supplied the Rocky Road cookies and set the
table. There was plenty of reminiscing and laughter about their
school days.
   ``I don't remember ever having an argument,'' said Mrs. Stahly,
who was valedictorian. ``We always saw eye-to-eye on things.''
   Their class originally had 16 members but by the time they were
seniors, all but Elsie and Louise had left school and the entire
student body had dwindled to nine. The school in Danvers,
population 920, closed in 1967.
   At last week's reunion in Mrs. Stahly's apartment, the two
talked fondly of their other friends at school and how the boys and
girls each had ``secret societies.'' And there was the war effort
for which they remembered knitting white string washcloths.
   ``Those were the days,'' Mrs. Stahly said. The two knew many in
the war, but said they could not recall any of their classmates
leaving school for the war effort.
   Their graduation ceremony included a formal baccalaureate
service, despite its size.
   ``We had the works,'' Mrs. Stahly said. ``We had a real
program.''
   Although there were no caps and gowns, a speaker came from
Springfield, the girls chose a motto _ ``Only a Commencement'' _
and their colors were khaki _ because of the war _ and rose.
   Announcements went out and the girls, decked out in their white
graduation dresses, were handed diplomas rolled in their class
colors.
   ``All at once it came to me,'' Mrs. Stahly said. ``This is the
end of high school. This is the end. I thought I was going to cry
up there on stage.''
   Mrs. Gaddis also was caught up in the emotion of the ceremony.
   ``It was sentimental,'' she said.
   However, their friendship was far from over. Both taught school
after graduation and married farmers the same year. Their first
babies were the same age and graduated together from Danvers High.
   Now, both are widows and live in apartments in Bloomington,
about 10 miles east of Danvers. They've celebrated about six
reunions, although last year, they simply spoke on the telephone.
   ``I'm so thankful we're together yet,'' Mrs. Stahly said.
``We're figuring on hanging in there for our 80th reunion.''

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael S.
Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, reported $108,957 in income for 1987
and paid nearly one-quarter of that amount in federal taxes,
according to tax forms made public Thursday.
   The couple's income was about half the total reported by
Democratic rival Jesse Jackson and a little more than one-third the
1987 income reported by Vice President George Bush, the likely
Republican presidential nominee.
   In all, the Dukakises paid $25,892 in federal taxes, just under
24 percent of their income. Most of the taxes had been withheld
during the year, but they sent a check for $975 to the Internal
Revenue Service along with their tax return.
   Dukakis earns $85,000 a year as governor. He reported an extra
$176 in income from the state, an amount aides said reflected the
benefit he derived from his occasional use of state vehicles for
personal use.
   Through his wife and his mother, the governor is also a
potential beneficiary of family trusts totaling more than $1
million. But he received no disbursements from the trusts in 1987,
according to campaign spokesman Steve Akey.
   The couple also reported $1,445 in taxable interest income, from
two Massachusetts bank accounts, along with $452 in taxable income
they had from tax refunds they received a year ago.
   Mrs. Dukakis reported $20,000 in salary for her role as a
part-time director of the Public Space Partnership Project at the
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, a collaborative
program that mobilizes public and private resources to improve the
appearance of prominent public spaces.
   In addition, Mrs. Dukakis reported $2,000 in income for her role
as a director of Mastery Education Corp., a publisher of college
textbooks. The company was founded by Dukakis' chief campaign
fund-raiser, Robert Farmer, who has retired from the firm.
   Dukakis reported no deductible interest payments. The mortgage
on his home in suburban Brookline has been retired, and the
governor does not use credit cards.
   His return indicated he spent $300 to have his taxes prepared by
an accountant. He also noted $100 in union dues _ his cost for
keeping up membership in the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists.
   The couple reported making $2,560 in charitable contributions.
   The governor and his wife each checked the boxes designating $1
for the presidential election campaign fund.
   They also marked their state return so as to contribute $2 to
the Massachusetts campaign election fund. In addition, they marked
in donations of $25 to an organ donation fund and $5 for endangered
wildlife conservation on their Massachusetts form.
   The Dukakises' state tax bill was $4,964.
   On his state income tax form, Dukakis received a $29 credit as a
result of a cap on total state tax collections adopted by the
voters in 1986 over his objections.
   Two weeks ago, Bush, who has secured enough delegates to win the
Republican presidential nomination, and his wife Barbara reported
1987 earnings of $308,396 and a federal tax bill of $86,684. This
week, Jackson and his wife Jacqueline reported 1987 income of
nearly $210,000 and payments of $53,631 in federal taxes.

   President Reagan has nominated the admiral in
charge of Navy intelligence operations to become the next director
of the super-secret National Security Agency, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Rear Adm. William O. Studeman will
be promoted to vice admiral and replace Army Lt. Gen. William E.
Odom, who is retiring on Aug. 1.
   Studeman, 48, a native of Brownsville, Texas, has been director
of Naval Intelligence since September 1985. A highly decorated
veteran of Vietnam, Studeman has spent nearly his entire Navy
career in the intelligence arena.
   He is a graduate of the Naval War College and the National War
College and holds a master's degree in international affairs from
George Washington University.
   The NSA is the most secret of all American spy agencies, with
responsibility for electronic intelligence-gathering around the
world as well as for the security of U.S. government electronic
systems. It is based at Fort Meade, Md.
   In other military moves, the Pentagon said the president had
nominated Adm. Powell F. Carter Jr. for assignment as the
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Carter, 56, of Los
Angeles, now is the U.S. representative to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's Military Committee.
   Reagan nominated Rear Adm. Roger F. Bacon for promotion to vice
admiral and assignment as commander of Atlantic Fleet Submarine
Forces, and Rear Adm. Peter M. Hekman Jr. for a promotion and new
assignment as the head of the Naval Sea Systems Command.
   Bacon, 50, from San Diego, Calif., now commands Submarine Group
Eight.
   Hekman, 54, a native of Ripon, Calif., is a deputy commander at
Sea Systems Command, the organization responsibility for new ship
contracting. Hekman will replace Vice Adm. William H. Rowden, who
will retire on Oct. 1.
   The Pentagon also said Reagan has chosen Maj. Gen. Henry J.
Hatch to become chief of Army engineers with the rank of lieutenant
general. Hatch, 52, of Pensacola, Fla., now is director of civil
works for the Army engineers.

<TEXT>
   A city commissioner has withdrawn a
resolution calling for a week of official mourning for Benjamin
Linder, the former Portland resident shot to death by Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Commissioner Mike Lindberg withdrew the resolution at
Wednesday's City Council meeting, which about three dozen people,
many wearing badges reading ``No Honor for Treason,'' attended.
   Lindberg later said he withdrew the resolution because he didn't
want the hearing to become a forum for a debate over U.S. policy in
Central America.
   ``I was afraid that what was supposed to be a simple memorial
would end up being hurtful and damaging to the family,'' he said.
   Opponents of the resolution said they were prepared to speak
about Linder at the hearing, said Mike Wiley of the Oregon
Citizens' Alliance. ``In my opinion, Benjamin Linder was a traitor.
He's not a hero or martyr, he's a traitor,'' Wiley said.
   Linder, 27, was killed in an attack by the U.S.-backed rebels,
known as Contras, on April 28, 1987, while he was working on a
hydroelectric project in rural Nicaragua. Relatives have traveled
around the nation during the past year to speak out against U.S.
military involvement in Nicaragua.
   Last year, the City Council unanimously approved a resolution
honoring Linder and opposing further U.S. aid to the Contras. That
resolution, introduced by Lindberg, drew little opposition. Because
of the lack of opposition last year, Lindberg said, he hadn't
expected a fight this time.

<HEAD>Environmental Groups Want Lasso Herbicide Withdrawn; Monsanto Says
No</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocacy groups asked Monsanto Corp. to take
Lasso, the nation's most popular herbicide, off the market Thursday
because of its cancer-causing potential. The company refused.
   In a letter to Monsanto's chairman delivered to the company's
Washington office, the groups asked that the company honor previous
pledges not to sell unsafe products ``by recognizing the
unacceptable risks posed by Lasso.''
   Though the names of 58 organizations were attached to the
letter, many were state or local affiliates of four groups whose
staffs passed out leaflets or addressed a sidewalk rally six floors
below: Clean Water Action Project, National Coalition Against the
Misuse of Pesticides, Public Interest Research Group and Public
Citizen.
   Upstairs, Robert Harness, vice president for environmental
affairs, told reporters: ``Monsanto has absolutely no intention of
pulling Lasso from the market. We are very proud of the product.''
   Lasso is the trade name for alachlor, a herbicide used widely
for weed control on corn, soybeans and peanuts. More than 80
million pounds are used each year.
   After three years of special study, the Environmental Protection
Agency in December decided to allow continued sale of alachlor, but
restricted use to state-certified applicators.
   Alachlor causes tumors in laboratory animals, and EPA classifies
it as a probable cause of cancer in humans.
   EPA has required Monsanto to undertake new studies of
groundwater, into which it says alachlor can leach. The herbicide
has been found in groundwater in 11 states.
   An earlier Monsanto study found alachlor in 4 percent of 246
wells in the cornbelt, in concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 22
parts per billion. EPA said it believed a lifetime of drinking
water contaminated at 1 ppb would increase the chance of cancer in
humans by four in a million at most.
   Harness said Monsanto does not believe alachlor can leach into
groundwater and when it has been found there ``generally speaking,
that's been tied back to an improper well or a spill, and that's
sopmething that can be corrected.''
   Outside, Rick Hind of Public Interest Research Group noted that
Du Pont Co. is supporting the withdrawal of ozone-destroying
chemicals and said, ``Our last hope is the good will of companies
like Monsanto,'' since federal pesticide law requires EPA to permit
sale of chemicals whose benefits outweigh the risks of use.
   Kevin Thorpe, an entomologist on the staff of the National
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, said EPA's risk-benefit
calculation was flawed because it did not consider non-chemical
weed control.

<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of three redesigned joints on the
space shuttle booster rocket passed their first qualifying tests
with flying colors, Morton Thiokol Inc. engineers said Thursday.
   Engineers have inspected both the aft and center joints between
segments of the solid fuel booster and found both worked as
designed during an April 22 full-scale test-firing, Dave Mobley,
NASA deputy project manager for the redesign effort, said.
   Results of tests on the forward joint are expected Friday.
   The center joint held up even though an intentional flaw was
built into it for the test-firing at the Morton Thiokol plant 25
miles west of here.
   Two more full-scale qualifying tests of the booster are planned
for June and July, and the shuttle is tentatively set for launch in
late August or early September, the first since Challenger exploded
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Mobley said the center joint flaw allowed superhot gases from
the burning fuel to reach insulation and the joint's O-ring gasket,
but the ring held.
   ``There was no damage to the O-ring at all,'' he said. ``There
was no evidence the gas got past'' the ring.
   Failure of an O-ring seal is blamed for allowing exhaust gas to
escape from one of Challenger's boosters. A presidential commission
found the gas ignited the shuttle's exterior liquid fuel tank,
triggering the explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its
seven crew members.
   Mobley also said engineers found no damage to the rocket's
nozzle section. In a December test-firing, a NASA-designed boot
ring on the section came apart. The April test used a Morton
Thiokol-designed boot ring that was reliable in the past.
   A final report, based on more extensive study, isn't expected
for several weeks, he said.

<HEAD>State Department Says Israel's Raid Brought Tragic Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Thursday marked the
conclusion of a two-day Israeli raid into Lebanon by equally
condemning all parties to cross-border violence and declining to
accept Jerusalem's explanation that the drive was aimed at
terrorists.
   ``We won't try to characterize this particular operation one way
or the other,'' department spokesman Charles E. Redman said after
issuing a statement that lent no support to Israeli claims that the
raid was retaliatory.
   For more than a decade, the statement said, a long series of
cross-border violence has left death and destruction in southern
Lebanon and northern Israel.
   ``They're tragic, and inevitably set back prospects for
achieving security and stability in the area,'' Redman said.
   During the raid, at least 40 Arabs were killed along with three
Israeli soldiers, the Israeli army said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would not hesitate to
conduct more raids in its ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon to
purge it. ``There is nothing worse than allowing terror elements
who are active against us to establish themselves freely and feel
free to act against Israeli and targets in the security zone,'' he
said.
   Rabin said the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, Shiite
Moslem movement was singled out by the Israeli forces because it
``has become one of the elements that most cooperates with
(Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser) Arafat.''
   The State Department, however, said security should be pursued
through ``agreed-on arrangements'' between Israel and Lebanon that
could provide security ``for the peoples of southern Lebanon and
northern Israel, who deserve it.''
   Redman also called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from
Lebanon as ``the only way'' to achieve security and stability in
the region.
   He apparently referred both to Syria, which plays a dominant
role in Lebanon and whose army controls large areas of the country,
and Israel, which periodically sends forces into a belt along the
border manned by pro-Israeli Lebanese soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen blew up
dozens of homes in a southern Lebanon village Thursday in the final
stage of an assault by Israeli troops against Arab guerrillas.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said more similar raids by the
militiamen could be expected.
   Israeli television said the South Lebanon Army destroyed about
60 houses in the village of Maydoun, which Israeli officials said
was used as a base by the radical Shiite Moslem militia Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
   Israeli troops seized about 20 suspected guerrillas and brought
them back to Israel during the two-day thrust into Lebanon that
ended Wednesday, Israeli sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Israel said at least 40 guerrillas were killed in the operation,
most of them Hezbollah members killed Wednesday in Maydoun, two
miles north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern
Lebanon.
   Two of the three Israeli soldiers killed in the assault were
buried Thursday.
   Sheik Subhi Tofeili, a Hezbollah leader, said only 10 of his
guerrillas were killed. He also said the Hezbollah would avenge the
attack.
   ``We shall retaliate. The battle with Israel is still in its
initial stage,'' he told a news conference in Mashgara, four miles
north of Maydoun. ``The torch of resistance will continue to burn
despite Israel's attacks.''
   Lebanon protested the raid and requested an urgent meeting of
the U.N. Security Council to condemn the operation. U.N. officials
said the 15-member council likely would meet Friday.
   Lebanese Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury, in a letter made public
Thursday, said the Lebanese government holds Israel, the Security
Council and the United Nations ``responsible for this fresh act of
aggression.''
   According to Lebanese reports, Israeli soldiers blew up homes
and bunkers in Maydoun after the fighting ended and used bulldozers
to bury the rubble and the bodies of the dead guerrillas.
   Israel radio and television reported that South Lebanon Army
returned Thursday to destroy more homes, apparently almost all that
remained after the attack.
   Israeli officials said the mission's aim was to halt escalating
guerrilla attacks against Israel soldiers and their Christian
allies.
   ``(Our) activity cannot only be defensive,'' Rabin said on
Israel radio. ``From time to time we must initiate action against
the terrorist bases that operate against us.''
   The security zone, a 6-to-10 mile wide strip north of the
Israeli border, was designated as a buffer zone after Israel ended
its three-year occupation of south Lebanon in June 1985.
   ``Israel will have to keep up its offensive operations,'' the
daily Haaretz quoted Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, commander of Israeli
forces in the north, as saying. ``If you don't take the offensive,
you may save some lives in the short run. But six or seven months
later, the number of casualties could be inestimably higher.''
   Haaretz quoted unnamed military officials as saying Israel would
forfeit its success at Maydoun unless it continued to take the
initiative in its war with the guerrillas.
   Martin Kramer, a specialist on the Hezbollah at Tel Aviv
University, said the Shiite fundamentalist organization is Israel's
implacable enemy.
   ``They want to destroy Israel,'' Kramer said on Israel radio.
   But some critics questioned the wisdom of the attack on Maydoun,
noting that the Hezbollah had not taken part in any of the dozen
infiltration attempts by guerrilla groups since November.
   ``Why Hezbollah?'' asked military analyst Uzi Mahanaimi in a
front-page commentary in the Yediot Ahronot daily. ``Hezbollah is
not the Israeli army's main enemy in south Lebanon and hasn't tried
to penetrate into northern Israel.''

<TEXT>
   Nineteen University of Illinois students
have been accused of disrupting classes at the University of
Wisconsin by such doing things as jumping on a professor's back and
lighting a stink bomb.
   An investigation conducted by officials at the Illinois school
found members of the Acacia fraternity disrupted five classes April
8, William Riley, the Illinois school's dean of students, said
Thursday.
   Results of the investigation have been forwarded to the
University of Illinois' Board of Fraternity Affairs for a decision
on any disciplinary action.
   ``We could cause them to no longer exist as a student
organization,'' said Riley. ``It's almost endless, the number of
things that are possible.''
   At the Wisconsin campus in Madison, Professor Harold Scheub, who
teaches an African language and literature class, said there was
shouting while he tried to give a test and later someone jumped on
his back.
   Professor Linda Hunter said someone set off a stink bomb in her
African language and literature class, and then tried to provoke a
fight with one of her students.
   Riley said one Acacia member stole a fire extinguisher and a
papier-mache bear that was part of an art class.
   Other classes affected included math, advertising and
Scandinavian literature. A few University of Wisconsin students
were also involved.
   At least one fraternity member made a racial comment to a
student the following day, Riley said.
   Mike Rutkowski, president of the Acacia chapter at the
University of Illinois, said the actions at Madison were not
racially motivated, the campus newspaper, the Daily Illini
reported. He said he could not comment on specifics.

   A man impaled by a tree limb in a logging
accident got out of intensive care Thursday, and was recovering
from his injuries.
   ``I remember everything. I remember asking the Lord to help me,
to get the stick out of me,'' said Gary Crawford, 31, who was in
fair condition at a Savannah hospital.
   Crawford of Hazlehurst said he suffered only nerve damage when
22 inches of the limb pierced his groin.
   ``I consider myself pretty lucky,'' he said.
   Candler County Sheriff Homer Bell said Crawford was operating a
skidder, a type of heavy tractor used to haul logs, at a site near
Stilson last week when the limb penetrated the protective cage on
the tractor and pierced Crawford's body.
   He was flown to Memorial Medical Center in Savannah, where he
underwent surgery to remove the limb.
   Crawford's mother, Colleen Crawford of Hazlehurst, said the limb
entered her son's body in the groin area and bypassed his liver,
kidneys and bowels to press against the skin of his back. It was
more than 36 inches long, she said.
   ``It (the limb) didn't break the skin in his back,'' she said.
``But 22 inches of the stick were inside my son's body.''
   ``I am simply amazed. I am so happy,'' said Crawford's wife,
Dianne. ``I was scared, I was terrified. I thank God that my
husband is still with me and our kids.''

<TEXT>
   Iran claimed credit Thursday for the
release of three French hostages who had been held by Moslem
extremists in Lebanon for three years.
   Tehran Television quoted Ali Reza Moayyeri, a deputy prime
minister for political affairs, as saying in an interview that Iran
interceded on behalf of the hostages ``for humanitarian reasons.''
   Diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine and journalist
Jean-Paul Kauffmann were freed Wednesday near a seaside hotel in
Moslem west Beirut.
   The Tehran Television broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Moayyeri as predicting the release of the hostages also would lead
to the restoration of French-Iranian diplmatic relations, severed
in July.
   Moayyeri said: ``The Islamic Republic of Iran asked the Moslem
people of Lebanon to help in connection with France's problem (the
hostages).
   ``As a result, the three remaining French hostages were
liberated and, according to the latest reports, they returned to
France,'' Moayyeri said.
   The three hostages were kidnapped separately in March 1985 and
May 1985.
   Moayyeri said Iran was encouraged to intervene in the case
because of ``positive reactions made by French Premier Jacques
Chirac regarding Iranian demands.''
   He did not spell out the demands. Media reports have said France
agreed to repay the outstanding balance of a $1 billion loan made
by the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before the Islamic
revolution overthrew the Iranian monarchy in 1979.
   French government officials denied striking a deal.
   Fontaine, Carton and Kauffmann were held by a group calling
itself Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   The group comprises Shiite Moslem Lebanese followers of Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Eighteen other foreigners are still held in Lebanon by
extremists loyal to Iran. They include nine Americans. Terry
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated
Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Art and artists still connected to Cuba have split
the Cuban exile community along generational lines as it struggles
to find a balance between anti-communism and artistic freedom.
   Seventeen older directors and five top officials resigned from
the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture following a tumultuous
emergency meeting Wednesday night, 24 hours after a pipe bomb blew
out the empty building's front door.
   The resignation of the mostly older directors, in their 50s and
60s, left the museum in the hands of younger, less militant Cubans.
   Older anti-Castro activists make no pretense of objectivity.
They say the museum has lost touch with the community it serves and
the trauma suffered by Cubans oppressed and sometimes imprisoned in
the homeland, and now separated from their families.
   ``This is a museum of exiles,'' said founder Raul Alvarez, one
of the directors who resigned. ``This is not a museum in New York
or Little Rock.''
   The resignations were triggered by their failure to oust two
museum vice presidents who defended an auction that included
paintings by artists still living in Cuba.
   Many directors also wanted an upcoming exhibit by Cuban painter
Amalia Palaez canceled because they felt she is too close to Cuban
leader Fidel Castro.
   Exhibit curator Giulio Blanco said the chaos following the
resignations may accomplish that goal.
   ``Pseudo-patriotic hysterics are responsible for all this,'' he
said. ``They've made total fools of themselves and all of Miami.''
   The remaining directors, most in their 40s, drafted a statement
that energetically denounced the pipe bombing and vowed to
guarantee ``respect for diversity of views.''
   ``The museum reaffirms its unswerving commitment to freedom and
democracy, and repudiates totalitarianism, which has so made our
people suffer,'' they said.
   Wednesday's showdown followed increasingly bitter complaints
about the April 22 art auction. Phone threats to the museum and
slashed tires followed the event, and culminated in the pipe bomb
blast Tuesday night.
   No organization claimed responsibility for the attack, but
similar bombings have plagued other Miami-area facilities that have
had dealings with Cuba.
   Ramon Cernuda, one of the two vice presidents who refused the
board's request to resign, accused the directors of caving in to
fear.
   ``The issues are no longer censorship and intolerance,'' said
Cernuda. ``The issues are intimidation and terrorism.''
   A majority of the board's 54 members attended Wednesday's
meeting, at which museum president Nunzio Mainieri offered his
resignation, saying ``I'm not up to the pressure anymore.''
   The president invited all the musuem officers, including
auction-defenders Cernuda and Teresa Saldise, to join him. All went
along except Cernuda and Ms. Saldise.
   The directors then voted 19-16 to request their resignations as
well. Again Cernudca and Ms. Saldise refused, and 17 directors
stalked out.

<HEAD>Orioles Losing Ways Now Part Of Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago advertising agency has turned the
heartache over the Baltimore Orioles' losing ways this season into
a case of heartburn.
   A full-page newspaper ad with a picture of an Orioles jersey, a
bottle of Pepto-Bismol and the words, ``The one that coats is the
only one you need,'' started appearing Tuesday in some large
newspapers, including papers in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   The team set a major league record for the most consecutive
losses at the start of the season, losing 21 in a row before
beating the Chicago White Sox 9-0 Friday.
   ``Everyone recognizes the situation, that the team has been
facing problems winning games,'' said Linda Ulrey, a spokeswoman
for Cincinnati-based Proctor & Gamble, the maker of Pepto-Bismol.
   The ad ``also helps to lighten a tense situation,'' she said
Thursday.
   The Orioles supported the concept created by the Chicago-based
Leo Burnett of USA advertising firm.
   Robert Aylward, the Orioles vice president of business affairs,
said the team agreed to allow P&G to run the ad with the Orioles
jersey ``if it doesn't make a mockery of the team. And it doesn't.''
   ``I think when people pick up the paper and see the ad they get
a little smile on their face. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek.
People laugh,'' Aylward said.
   He refused to say how much the Orioles received for the ad from
P&G.

<HEAD>White House Expresses `Concern' Over Violence Against Polish
Strikers</HEAD>

   The White House said Thursday it deplored
Poland's use of violence to squelch the latest outbreak of labor
strikes and suggested the Polish government seek ``a dialogue''
with the Solidarity labor movement.
   Taking note of reports that Polish police on Wednesday used
percussion grenades against strikers to end a 10-day-old walkout at
a Krakow steel mill, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration was ``watching with concern.''
   It was the second such statement in as many days. On Wednesday,
President Reagan said he hoped the government of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski ``will hear the voice of the Polish people _ and that
economic reform and recovery will soon begin.''
   In Thursday's statement, Fitzwater said: ``We deplore the
reported actions of last night and we strongly urge the government
of Poland to begin a productive dialogue with all segments of
Polish society, including Solidarity,'' the outlawed Polish labor
union movement, he added.
   ``Such a dialogue would inspire confidence in economic reform in
Poland and in the country's future. Any resort to repressive
measures, and particularly the use of force against peaceful
demonstrators, can only have the reverse effect,'' Fitzwater said.
   The strikes that have swept across Poland since April 25 amount
to the most serious since the imposition of martial law and the
1981 military crackdown on Solidarity.
   ``The problems in Poland can only be resolved by the Poles
themselves. And they can only be resolved with wisdom and foresight
on the part of those in positions of authority,'' Fitzwater said.
``We hope and pray that the Polish government will hear the voice
of the Polish people.''
   Asked if the statement's reference to solutions being found by
the ``Poles themselves'' amounted to a warning against Soviet
interference in its Warsaw Pact ally's affairs, Fitzwater said:
   ``This is a matter best defined by dialogue between the Polish
government and the various elements that are involved in Poland.
Outside influences, from whatever source, are not always the best.''
   The spokesman said it was ``a helpful sign'' that the Catholic
Church was attempting to mediate.
   Asked if the administration was concerned the unrest might
affect the summit later this month between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Fitzwater said he did not
expect it to present ``seriously detrimental effects,'' but that it
could come up for discussion.
   The spokesman was asked if any more strong-arm tactics by the
Polish government could trigger a new round of U.S. sanctions or
affect the country's relations with such organizations as the
Internatinal Monetary Fund.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions against Poland
after the imposition of martial law and attempts to repress
Solidarity.
   ``I don't want to make any threats,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
simply point out there could be detrimental effects in terms of the
reform process and we would urge them to be aware of those effects
and hope that they don't happen.''
   An East German leader on a trip to Washington, meanwhile, urged
both superpowers to avoid interference in Polish affairs.
   Politbureau member Herman Axen, the highest-ranking East German
to visit the United States, told a National Press Club audience
that the 35-nation East-West security and human rights agreement
signed in Helsinki in 1975 forbids interference, and he made clear
he was talking about both the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``So nobody should interfere,'' Axen said. ``It's a Polish
problem. We are confident they will find an adequate solution.''

   Military officials said Thursday at
least 20 people were killed in a new outbreak of guerrilla warfare
during the previous 24 hours.
   Airports were put on alert across the nation to prevent ousted
President Ferdinand E. Marcos from returning for his mother's
funeral.
   Brig. Gen. Galileo Kintanar, deputy chief of staff for
intelligence, said 1,291 people had been slain in more than 1,200
``insurgency related'' incidents in the first four months of the
year: 584 rebels, 346 soldiers and 361 civilians.
   The communist New People's Army began fighting 20 years ago when
Marcos was in power.
   President Corazon Aquino said Thursday she was standing firm on
her refusal to let Marcos return for the funeral of his mother,
Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died in a suburban hospital Wednesday at
age 95.
   Marcos lives in exile in Hawaii. Airports were alerted to stop
him or members of his family from slipping into the country.
   Military officials said nine soldiers were killed and eight
wounded on Negros Island in fighting between soldiers and 400 New
People's Army guerrillas that began Wednesday and continued
sporadically into Thursday.
   Officials said two soldiers were killed and eight wounded in the
initial fighting, when a military patrol stumbled onto an NPA
training camp in the mountain village of Umas, 350 miles southeast
of Manila.
   Seven more soldiers were killed in follow-up operations later
Wednesday and on Thursday, officials said. No rebel casualty
figures were available.
   Military reports said two other soldiers, eight rebels and a
military informant were killed in clashes Wednesday on the main
island of Luzon, on Samar in the central Philippines and on
Mindanao in the south.
   Mrs. Aquino cited national security in refusing permission for
Marcos to attend the funeral of his mother, who died a day after
asking that she be permitted to see her son.
   Marcos, his wife and children fled to Hawaii after the February
1986 civilian-military uprising that swept him from the office he
had held for 20 years and put Mrs. Aquino in power.
   He said in a statement released Wednesday in Honolulu that he
would ``exhaust all posibilities'' to return for the funeral.
   On Thursday, however, Mrs. Aquino told reporters her decision
was final.
   ``I suppose we'll have to wait for him to exhaust all those
measures, but I stand firm on my decision not to allow him to come
back,'' she said.
   The former president's younger brother Pacifico and sister
Fortuna Barba said they would bury their mother in Ilocos Norte
province, home of the Marcos family. They said they had not set a
date because they still hoped Mrs. Aquino would change her mind.
   Marcos was not allowed to attend the funeral of his youngest
sister, Elizabeth Marcos-Keon, who died in December 1986.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Attack Pentagon, State Department for Korean Rifle Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers on Thursday lambasted the Defense
and State departments for allowing American-designed rifles built
in South Korea to be sold to foreign interests despite a
U.S.-Korean agreement forbidding such sales.
   Democrats and Republicans on the House Armed Services
investigations subcommittee charged that U.S. officials ignored
repeated warnings and evidence of illegal Korean sales of M-16
rifles.
   The warnings came from Colt Industries Inc., the Hartford,
Conn., maker of the M-16.
   ``Our government continued to sleep at the switch through
repeated warnings from industry,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky.
   The hearing focused on a General Accounting Office investigation
that said the 1971 U.S.-Korean agreement, which banned sales to
third countries without U.S. permission and placed a limit on the
number of M-16s Korea could build, was violated on both counts.
   GAO Associate Director Joseph E. Kelley said many of the
problems stemmed from uncertainty over which government agency
should have been in charge of the program. In large part, Kelly
said, oversight of the program was left to Colt, which was a
partner in the 1971 pact.
   Paul G. Gubbins, a former assistant counsel at Colt, said the
company repeatedly presented U.S. officials with documented
evidence of attempted sales of rifles and parts and several
completed sales to Indonesia through intermediaries, but that
produced little more than ``perfunctory inquiries.''
   ``In every instance when Colt approached the government it
received a polite hearing,'' Gubbins said.
   ``In some instances, there was a perfunctory inquiry or polite
admonition to Korea. On more than one occasion, government
representatives wished us well in our efforts to resolve the matter
privately. But never ... was there any serious or meaningful effort
to stop what was obviously happening.''
   In 1983, Colt asked Edwin Meese III, the attorney general who
then was counsel to President Reagan, that the M-16 problem be
brought up by the president during a planned trip to Korea. The
request was rejected, Colt said.
   Glenn A. Rudd, deputy director of the Defense Security
Assistance Agency, said the Defense Department, ``for better or for
worse,'' treated the rifle program and the developing problems
largely as a commercial matter.
   Colt sued the Korean government after the company stopped
receiving royalties of $7 per rifle. That occurred in 1982 when
Korea turned over operation and ownership to a private company,
Daewoo Precision Industries, of a government operated arms-making
plant Colt had helped build.
   Colt officials told lawmakers they never wanted to get into the
program, noting that they would have made much more money if they
built the rifles at their Connecticut plants and sold them to Korea.
   But the Nixon administration wanted to give the South Koreans
weapons-producing capabilities to keep it competitive with North
Korea.
   Gubbins said then-Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard
personally lobbied for the proposal, and Colt eventually ``acceded
to the wishes of its own best customer.'' The Pentagon buys about
80 percent of the M-16s Colt manufacturers.
   Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., chairman of the subcommittee, has
asked GAO to investigate other weapons-making agreements the United
States has with Korea and other nations.

   Two teams reached the summit of Mount
Everest from opposite sides Thursday and broadcast stunning
pictures of azure skies and the craggy, snow-covered Himalayas
rising above the clouds at the top of the world.
   It was the first time two parties had scaled the world's highest
mountain simultaneously, and it was the first live telecast from
the summit.
   The 10 climbers wept and congratulated each other. Some fell to
their knees after wading through waist-deep snow to the 29,028-foot
peak.
   They were from Japan, China and Nepal, the nations that received
the live broadcast.
   ``This is the greatest event in the history of climbing,'' said
Kunga Sherpa, the leader of the team that climbed from the Nepal
side, as a camera recorded the breathtaking panorama.
   Images were relayed by satellite from a small camera attached to
the helmet of Japanese climber Susumu Nakamura.
   ``We made it!'' the climbers gasped, their voices rasping in the
thin air. Most wore goggles and oxygen masks along with their red,
blue and yellow parkas. Eyebrows were coated with ice in
temperatures of about 30 degrees below zero.
   They stretched bright-colored banners across the summit and
scooped dry, powdery snow into small bottles. One poured whisky on
the snow to honor mountaineers who have died trying to conquer
Everest, including Hidetaka Mizukoshi. He died of a heart attack on
a climb last month.
   The teams began their assaults on Everest last month from base
camps on the south face in Nepal and the north face in Tibet.
   After the rendezvous, in another first, three climbers who
scaled the south face descended by the north and three who ascended
the north face went down via the south.
   More than 200 people were involved in the project, the most ever
for an Everest expedition.
   It was timed to mark the 35th anniversary of the first
conquering of Everest _ on May 29, 1953, by Edmund Hillary of New
Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, his Sherpa guide. Nearly 200 climbers
have reached the summit since then, some more than once.
   Sir Edmund, who was knighted for his feat, could not be reached
for comment Thursday. Earlier this week he said of the simultaneous
assaults, ``I think some of the expeditions nowadays are on the
gimmicky side,'' but conceded that ``it's one method of raising
money.''
   ``The ones I admire are those who do a tough and difficult new
route and do it cleanly and with style,'' he said.
   Hillary now is his country's ambassador to India, Nepal and
Bangladesh. Tenzing, called ``Tiger of the Snows'' by other
Sherpas, died in 1985.
   Nihon Television Corp. of Japan, which paid most of the
expedition's cost of $12.5 million, arranged the telecasts. All
three countries received several hours of broadcasts Thursday,
including footage of the ascents and descents.
   Thursday's telecasts were the first in which the Nepalese had
seen the top of their famous mountain.
   Many elderly people in the kingdom, which was nearly closed to
the outside world until 1950, have thought foreigners scaled the
great peak seeking jewels and other treasure.
   ``But I saw them today,'' said Ram Jung Thapa, 74. ``They were
just gathering and putting samples of ice in their bottles. I now
realize they go there in an adventurous spirit.''
   Mathura Man Amatya, who walked two days in 1953 to meet Hillary
and Tenzing, said the mountain ``was never so near as we have seen
today. ... Until now we have only ... heard the story from the
climbers.''

   Elliott Trueluck is a familiar figure
here, a disabled veteran who used to sing to a pack of dogs that
followed him on his daily walk to a coffee shop. But he says he's
afraid to walk downtown since a police officer opened fire on his
followers.
   ``It scared the I-don't-know-what out of me,'' said the
61-year-old Trueluck. ``I did what that boy (police officer) told
me to do and got out of there. What if he had turned the gun on me,
instead of the dogs?''
   The April 29 shooting, which killed at least two dogs including
one of Trueluck's own, has angered residents who watched the little
band pass by each day for years. While defending the officer, city
officials also promised an investigation, and charges have been
filed by a judge.
   ``I've walked right by them on the sidewalk, and all they did
was wag their tails,'' said Judy Thompson, who witnessed the
shooting. ``It's bad to think you live in a town where the cops
just pull up and go to shooting.''
   Harriett Dixon, director of the Okefenokee Humane Society in
nearby Waycross, said police Sgt. James Mock killed up to eight
dogs. Some were killed by shotgun blasts, while wounded dogs were
then beaten to death with a billy club, she said.
   Mock has refused to discuss the incident, but Mayor Harry Adams
said the officer shot two dogs on orders from City Hall. Adams said
Trueluck had laughed off warnings that the dogs' presence violated
the city leash law.
   Warrants issued by a probate judge charged Mock with cruelty to
animals, and he is free on $500 bond. The judge issued the
warrants, which allege that at least four dogs were injured or
killed, after hearing statements from the Humane Society and a
witness.
   Several residents of this community of 3,500 said dogs that
followed Trueluck each morning posed no threat.
   ``We watched him every day,'' said one resident, Rebecca
Jacobson. ``He had different dogs with him every day. He'd walk and
they would follow him. If one of them strayed, he'd sing.''
   Mrs. Jacobson said she was working in a drugstore when she heard
shots and ran outside.
   ``He was out there beating them with a stick,'' she said.
``There was one injured dog that was trying to get away. He'd run a
little and sit down. We could tell he'd been shot in the back.''
   A town ordinance requires that dogs be on leashes when out of
their owners' yards. But several people who work at the shopping
center said unleashed dogs belonging to prominent white citizens
roam the center's parking lot while their owners are inside,
ignored by police. Trueluck is black.
   Police Chief Dennis Martin said he has asked the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation to conduct an independent inquiry to determine if
any of the state's anti-cruelty statutes had been violated.
   But he added: ``My officers haven't done anything wrong.''
   Trueluck's wife, Myrtice, said he receives a small monthly
disability check because he never recovered from shell shock
suffered during World War II.
   ``He ain't been right since they shot the dogs,'' she added.
``He's got bad nerves.''
   A symptom of Trueluck's condition is that he laughs at just
about everything. During a recent interview, he chortled constantly
while recalling his fear during the shooting. But he confirmed that
he had been warned.
   ``They had warned me that if I brought them back again they'd
put me and the dogs in jail,'' said Trueluck.
   Now that he has stopped walking to town, Trueluck sometimes sits
on the steps of his cinderblock home, talking to Nobody, a black
Labrador retriever that escaped the gunfire and clubbing.

<TEXT>
   A body-builder accused of beating a
hitchhiker to death and tying his body between two poles was insane
at the time of the murder because he was taking anabolic steroids,
his lawyer says.
   Attorney Richard Lubin will rely upon a defense of
steroid-induced insanity during the trial of Horace ``Ace''
Williams, according to documents he filed with the court. The trial
is scheduled to begin Monday.
   Anabolic steroids _ synthetic versions of the male hormone
testosterone _ are used by some athletes and weightlifters to
stimulate the production of proteins that increase muscle size and
strength.
   But the drugs, which are available legally only by prescription,
are also blamed for making users more aggressive.
   Lubin said Wednesday that Williams, 23, had taken the drug
orally and by injection for months before the crime.
   The combination of the steroids and beer he drank that night
caused Williams to ``lose his ability to understand or reason
accurately,'' Lubin said.
   In an effort to prove the steroids made Williams insane, Lubin
said he would offer the testimony of two experts, doctors from Duke
and Harvard universities.
   Williams, 23, was charged with first-degree murder in the Sept.
6, 1986, death of Michael Shane Patterson. Police said Williams and
his weightlifting buddy, William Whitmore _ also charged with
murder _ picked up Patterson on a state highway.
   They drove Patterson to a remote field owned by Williams'
father, police said.
   Williams, a high school dropout, told officers he and Whitmore,
21, were ``bored _ nothing to do, so we figured we're going to have
fun with this guy,'' according to police reports.
   But Williams told police he and Whitmore never intended to kill.
   ``We weren't out to do this guy any major injustice, you know,''
Williams told police. ``We were all pretty buzzed and just laughing
... and we're not, nowhere near, murderers.''
   Police never asked Williams if he had been using steroids but
Whitmore told police Williams had been taking the drug.
   There, Williams and Whitmore allegedly beat Patterson with a
pipe and heavy pieces of wood, cut hair from his head and
underarms, rammed Patterson's body with a car and then hog-tied him
between two poles.
   Patterson's naked body was found the next morning.
   In an article in the April issue of the Amereican Journal of
Psychiatry, researchers said steroid abuse by athletes could lead
to severe depression, manic behavior and other serious mental
problems.

   Cash and McCartney will be joined by their wives, June Carter
Cash and Linda McCartney, to record ``Man, We Was Lonely.''
   Ex-Beatle McCartney wrote the song, which will be recorded in

   Cash, a long-time friend of McCartney, is now on a concert tour
of Germany and England.
   McCartney has made several records in recent years with other

   A national AIDS hot line is trying to hire
more operators to deal with the calls expected after an educational
pamphlet on the fatal disease is mailed to every household in the
country, officials said.
   ``This is a pretty important subject and is hitting people in a
personal way,'' said Carol Humphries, 43, coordinator for the
National AIDS Hotline operated in the Research Triangle Park.
   The American Social Health Association, operator of the
toll-free hot line under a contract with the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control, will expand its staff by 50 percent over the next
few weeks to handle the expected increase in calls, she said.
   The pamphlet, ``Understanding AIDS,'' is being mailed to 110
million homes by the federal government and should appear in
mailboxes beginning May 26, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
announced Wednesday.
   Humphries said the mailings have forced some ``high-powered''
recruiting of operators through advertisements and flyers. This
week, Humphries said, the hot line had 130 operators fielding calls
here, but she hopes to recruit an additional 120 by the end of the
month.
   The 24-hour hot line, 1-800-342-AIDS, has had its headquarters
in Durham County since October. The health association also
operates a bank of phones in New York City.
   Some 200,000 people called in April, bringing the total for the
past year to more than 1 million calls. The number of calls is
expected to double in 1988.
   The hot line operation also is working with telephone companies
to add 12 phone lines to the 32 already in use.
   ``We heard about the mailout in March and started to plan for
it. This is not something you do overnight. It's taken quite a
while to put things together,'' Humphries said. ``This is pretty
high tech when you get right down to it.''

   Mexicans watched the deadline for amnesty
under the new U.S. immigration law pass on Thursday but didn't
expect the measure would stop the flow of job-seekers crossing the
border.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the governing party's candidate in
July 6 presidential elections, said the new law ``cannot defeat the
economic reality that is experienced in the United States, where
Mexican workers continue being needed.''
   He said, however, that extra steps must be taken to make sure
workers' human and labor rights are protected on both sides of the
border and to increase employment opportunities in Mexico's
northern states.
   Salinas de Gortari said in a campaign speech Wednesday in
Morelos state, southwest of the capital, that some in the United
States might try to take advantage of Mexican workers after the law
takes effect.
   ``The concern that I have is that, with the deadline passed,
this law might be invoked as a prextet to abuse Mexican migrant
workers,'' he said. ``We also must increase effort, vigilance and
attention for our countrymen who might return from the United
States so that they might not be abused or exploited by Mexican
authorities on our territory.''
   Salinas de Gortari is the candidate of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has not lost a presidential race since
its inception in 1929. It is almost certain he will defeat five
minority candidates and be inaugurated to a six-year term
succeeding President Miguel de la Madrid on Dec. 1.
   The speech dominated front pages Thursday in local newspapers.
The newspapers gave ample attention to developments in the United
States, where 107 immigration offices closed their doors to the
one-time offer of amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.
   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, presidential candidate of the tiny
Revolutionary Workers Party, said the Mexican government must bear
responsibility for workers' need to go to the United States in
search of jobs because of difficult economic conditions here.
   The minimum daily wage in Mexico is 8,000 pesos, or about $3.50.
   She said the government ``doesn't defend the undocumented
workers'' and accused the United States of giving dollars to Mexico
in exchange for cheap labor.
   The government newspaper El Nacional said in an editorial that
no law alone can solve economic problems of any country.
   It said that, despite the law, the United States ``still will
require the labor, the vigor of Mexican workers who, at extremely
convenient prices for American employers, made possible the
economic flourishing of that country, along with millions of other
immigrants.''
   Many here see the traffic across the border as part of
centuries-old patterns that date back to when the American
Southwest belonged to Mexico.
   Although some Mexicans have said they returned because of the
new law in the United States, no statistical studies have been
completed since the start of the period for amnesty began. Fears
that the new law would lead to mass deportations of Mexican workers
in the United States appear to have largely abated.
   Others believe the impact of the new law will not be fully seen
until after June 1, when companies employing illegal aliens could
be fined.
   Hilda Patricia Neira, a researcher at the Colegio de la Frontera
Norte in the border city of Tijuana, said the law will likely fuel
a black market in false documents.
   Tijuana Mayor Federico Valdes Martinez told reporters there is
space available there for any Mexicans who might return, at least
on an emergency basis.

<HEAD>Substance in Saliva Blocks the AIDS Virus, Preliminary Research
Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary studies have found that human saliva
contains a factor that blocks the AIDS virus from infecting cells,
indicating the body may have a natural defense against the deadly
disease, researchers said Thursday.
   Isolating and understanding the inhibitory element in saliva may
help researchers learn how to naturally prevent transmission of the
virus, said Philip Fox, head of clinical studies at the National
Institute of Dental Research and senior investigator in the study.
   ``The significance is that it's a demonstration of a natural
defense that people have against the AIDS virus,'' Fox said in a
telephone interview from the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   A report on the study appears in the May issue of the
Chicago-based Journal of the American Dental Association.
   The research also provides a biological explanation of why the
mouth isn't a transmission route for the disease, Fox said. That's
good news for dentists and others concerned about catching AIDS
through contact with the saliva of infected people.
   ``This supports biologically what we have been seeing
epidemiologically,'' said Irwin Mandel, director of the Center for
Clinical Research in Dentistry at Columbia University in New York.
``There is essentially no chance of transmission of the virus
through saliva.''
   ``Fears about kissing, contact with eating implements and so on
could be dispelled by this kind of evidence,'' said Enid Neidle, an
assistant director of the American Dental Association.
   Fox and four co-workers collected saliva samples from the mouths
of three healthy men and secretions directly from their major
salivary glands.
   None of the three was at risk for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, which destroys the body's defenses against disease and
leaves a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain
cancers
   The samples were mixed with the virus that causes AIDS and
lymphocytes, immune system cells that are the major targets of the
virus.
   The virus wasn't able to infect the lymphocytes in the saliva or
the secretions from the submandibular and sublingual glands at the
bottom of the mouth, the researchers found.
   However in two of the men, lymphocytes in secretions from the
parotid salivary gland near the ear were infected. Secretions from
the parotid gland of the third man were not infected.
   The researchers aren't certain how the inhibitory element works,
but Fox said it may interfere with the surface receptors though
which white blood cells are infected by the AIDS virus.
   The researchers are expanding their work to include women,
children and people infected with AIDS, Fox said.
   The latest study expands on research done two years ago in which
scientists found that the AIDS virus was neutralized by saliva from
humans and chimpanzees, Fox said. At the time, researchers didn't
know whether the neutralizing agent was a product of the salivary
glands or one of the other elements of saliva, such as blood
components, bacteria or cells.
   The new study shows that the neutralizing element is a product
of the submandibular and sublingual glands, Mandel said.
   Theoretically, the study results could lead to the discovery of
a natural immunization against AIDS, Mandel said.
   Researchers now must isolate the neutralizing element in saliva,
find out how it works and then learn how to activate it in the body
as a defense against AIDS, said Mandel, a pioneer in the study of
saliva as a protective factor against disease.
   The AIDS virus is spread most often through sexual contact, the
sharing of comtaminated syringes shared by drug abusers, infected
blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   More than 60,000 cases of AIDS and 34,088 AIDS deaths have been
reported in the United States from June 1981 through May 2,
according to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

   All right, trivia buffs of the future.
Memorize the answer now.
   Who are the only two people to win the Country Music
Association's video of the year award?
   Although popularity is not usually a problem for the music
industry, the CMA has decided to axe its music video bauble because
it was being chosen on the basis of personal popularity rather than
creativty and technical aspects.
   The association said in a news release Thursday that the CMA
board decided to wipe out the whole category in this October's
awards rather than take the vote away from the membership and have
the winner picked by committee.
   So the only winners are:
   Hank Williams Jr., who won in 1985 for ``All My Rowdy Friends
Are Comin' Over Tonight'' and in 1987 for ``My Name Is Bocephus.''
   George Jones won in 1986 for ``Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes.''

   A man accused of holding up a BayBank
branch broke out of jail and held up the same branch and the same
teller, police said Thursday.
   Steven W. Bergeron, 31, was still being sought, said Detective
Sgt. Gilbert Larson.
   In the second holdup Wednesday, the teller recognized Bergeron
as the man who pulled a stickup March 25 at her bank window, Larson
said.
   The suspect recognized her, too.
   As Larson recounted it:
   ``He said., `I want you to help me again.'
   ``She said, `No.'
   ``He said, `I have a gun. Don't make me use it.'''
   She handed over the money.
   Police would not disclose how much money.
   Bristol County Sheriff David Nelson said Bergeron scaled a wall
of the jail, climbed over a roof and slid down a drain pipe to
escape Wednesday.
   Bergeron was serving several jail terms and was awaiting trial
on charges in three bank heists, including the one at the BayBank.
   Bergeron was sentenced Tuesday in New Bedford District Court to
two concurrent two-year sentences on charges of breaking and
entering in the daytime with intent to commit a felony, and larceny.

   Popcorn king Orville Redenbacher
will receive an honorary doctor of agriculture degree from Purdue
University on May 15 for his more than 40 years of corn research.
   ``This is truly an honor to receive such a degree from my alma
mater,'' said Redenbacher, a 1928 graduate of Purdue.
   ``After all, Purdue not only pioneered research in popping corn
hybridization, but they also helped begin my `pop to the top' in
the popcorn industry,'' said Redenbacher, 80, who now lives in
Coronado, Calif.
   Redenbacher worked as a county extention agent and then as a
farm manager in Indiana before establishing Chester Inc., a
diversified agricultural company, in Valparaiso in 1952. He
marketed his popping corn personally, traveling across the country
to persuade store owners to carry it and appearing in his own
commercials.
   In 1976 he sold his business to Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson, but he
continues to be a spokesman for the label that carries his name.

   Rebels in Ethiopia's Tigre province
claimed Thursday that air force planes bombed Aksum, the ancient
northern capital, in a series of raids on towns no longer held by
the government.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front also said 130 people were
killed in four earlier raids. It reported no loss of life in the
Aksum raid, which it said occurred Tuesday.
   It asked the international community and concerned organizations
to condemn the alleged attacks on Aksum, Wukro, Adigrat, Yehilla
and Hargereselam. The rebels made the claims in a telex from their
London office to The Associated Press in Nairobi.
   Rebels in Eritrea, north of Tigre, claimed Wednesday that planes
sent by the Marxist government in Addis Ababa dropped napalm on
houses and farms in Halhal, about 20 miles northwest of Keren.
   A broadcast by the clandestine radio of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front did not mention casualties but said 10 houses and
some crops were destroyed by fire.
   Western sources in Addis Ababa recently confirmed a raid on
Wukro. They said MiG fighter planes supplied by the Soviet Union,
Ethiopia's main ally, bombed the town April 8, killing at least 50
people.
   Wukro was an important food-distribution center until the army
withdrew from much of Tigre and Eritrea after rebel offensives in
March. Western and government relief organizations also operated
drought-aid stations in Aksum and Adigrat.
   Aksum, 340 miles north of Addis Ababa, was the capital of a
northern kingdom from about 500 B.C. until the 7th century.
   Crop failures in Eritrea and Tigre have left an estimated 3.2
million people in the two provinces threatened with starvation. A
huge relief operation has been hamstrung by the government's
military priorities in the region.
   Western relief officials fear 2 million people are beyond the
reach of the aid network because of the government withdrawal and
its expulsion of foreign aid workers from the north.
   Secessionist rebels in Eritrea began fighting 27 years ago and
rebels in Tigre have been fighting 14 years.

   Jesse Jackson, who complained Thursday that
Democratic ``super delegates'' are supporting Michael Dukakis far
out of proportion to the popular vote, has won 28 percent of the
votes in primaries so far but has just 16 percent of the super
delegates who have expressed preferences.
   Jackson is supported by 46 of the super delegates _ the 643
party leaders and politicians, including governors and members of
Congress, who are delegates to the Democratic National Convention
by virture of the offices they hold.
   The Massachusetts governor, meanwhile, has won 37 percent of the
votes cast in the primaries and is supported by 166 super delegates
_ 58 percent of those whose views are known.
   Unlike the delegates picked through state primaries and
caucuses, the super delegates are not required to declare their
support for a presidential candidate and are free to change their
minds at any time.
   Overall, Dukakis has 1,500 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, while Jackson has 927, according to The Associated
Press delegate count.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., even though he has suspended his campaign,
still has 45 super delegates in his 419 delegate total. Sen. Paul
Simon, who also has suspended campaigning, has 28.5 super delegates
among his 184.5. Gore has won 17 percent of the primary popular
vote, and Simon under 6 pervent.
   While campaigning in Nebraska on Thursday, Jackson complained
that Dukakis has an ``inflated, padded lead'' caused by the super
delegates. He said he would be contacting them with ``appeals to
fairness,'' asking that they make their votes correspond to the
popular vote in the presidential campaign.
   Earlier in the week, Jackson objected that the popular vote for
the nomination is not directly reflected in the number of delegates
each candidate wins.
   ``There must be some reasonable correlation between the popular
vote and the delegate count in a democracy,'' he said. ``We're not
talking about generosity. We're talking about reciprocity.''
   However, Tad Devine, who oversees delegate selection for the
Dukakis campaign, said the super delegates have been following
popular will.
   ``A lot of this campaign's success in recent weeks with super
delegates is directly related to its success with voters,'' Devine
said in a telephone interview from Boston.

<HEAD>Dukakis Criticizes `Silent' Bush; Jackson Complains About
Democratic Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Thursday he wants a vice president
``who speaks up and speaks out,'' in a gibe at Republican George
Bush's explanation for staying silent at Cabinet meetings. Jesse
Jackson said Dukakis' delegate lead was disproportionately
``inflated, padded'' by party leaders and elected officials.
   Jackson said he will make ``appeals for fairness'' to the 643
Democratic ``super delegates'' to follow the lead of voters in
their districts.
   ``There must be some reasonable correlation between the popular
vote and the delegate count in a democracy,'' Jackson told
reporters in Kearney, Neb.
   In the 29 primaries held to date, Dukakis received 6.7 million
votes or 37 percent of the total, while Jackson got 5.1 million or
28 percent.
   In The Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis has 1,500 of the
2,081 delegates needed for a convention majority while Jackson has
927. Dukakis' total included 166 so-called super delegates, while
Jackson's total included 46.
   Jackson scheduled quick campaign stops in Nebraska and then New
Mexico before heading to California, where Bush spent the day.
California offers a delegate treasure trove _ 314 Democratic and
175 Republican _ bigger than all the other remaining state contests
combined. Next up are West Virginia and Nebraska primaries on
Tuesday, with a total of 62 delegates at stake.
   Bush told reporters in Sacramento on Wednesday that he sometimes
keeps silent at Cabinet meetings.
   ``I hold back speaking in meetings because I don't want the
president to have to be choosing between his vice president and the
other members of the Cabinet. And I hold back sometimes because I
worry about leaks,'' he said.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart told reporters the next morning that
Bush ``reserves his advice for the president.''
   Hart said Bush's reserve at Cabinet meetings ``has enabled him
to have a uniquely individual relationship with the president. ...
   ``He's been a very effective vice president, due in part to that
unique relationship he has had with the president for the past 7{
years.''
   Dukakis, campaigning in the coal country of West Virginia, said
he liked his lively, contentious Cabinet in Massachusetts.
   ``That's the way you get good give-and-take. ... I hope I'll
have a vice president who speaks up and speaks out,'' said the
governor.
   Dukakis also took a swipe at Bush's repeated statements that he
wants to be known as the ``education president.''
   ``The next president must be this nation's No. 1 advocate for
educational opportunity and good schools; not just during election
years, but every day and every week and every month,'' he said.
   Bush was asked at a high school in a Mexican-American
neighborhood in Los Angeles about the prospects for federal help to
pay college tuition. He replied there would be ``a changing of
priorities to some degree'' as part of his plan to stress education.
   But he went on to say, ``There has to be a limitation on what
the federal government can do.''
   Dukakis also released federal tax returns that showed the
governor and his wife, Kitty, had joint income of $108,957 last
year and paid $25,892 in federal taxes.

   Michael Jackson's autobiographical ``Moonwalk''
has floated to the top of The New York Times non-fiction best
seller list less than a month after it reached bookstores, its
publisher said Thursday.
   The $15.95 hard cover book will debut at No. 2 on the list May 8
and hit No. 1 on the May 15 list, Doubleday announced. The Times
issues its placings 10 days in advance on a recorded telephone
message.
   The list is based on sales in a sampling of bookstores around
the nation. ``Moonwalk'' had an initial printing of 300,000 copies
and is going into a second printing of 150,000 more, said Doubleday
spokeswoman Jacqueline Deval.
   The book will debut at No. 1 on The Los Angeles Times best
seller list Sunday and was No. 1 on the Sunday Times of London list
May 1, she said.
   ``Moonwalk'' includes 19 color photos and 78 black and white
photos of its entertainer author. Ms. Deval said she understood
from bookstores and articles that it was being bought largely by
teen-agers, who have been targeted by the publisher through radio
promotions and giveaways.

   The conservative-dominated California
Supreme Court refused Thursday to let the Legislature cut Medi-Cal
payments for abortions for poor women, a stinging defeat for
anti-abortion groups.
   It is the 10th straight year that state courts have overturned
the Legislature's budget restrictions, which would have eliminated
state funding for all but a small fraction of Medi-Cal abortions.
   Anti-abortion groups hoped for a change this year, because it
was the first time the issue had been considered by a court with a
5-2 majority of Gov. George Deukmejian appointees. The Republican
governor backed the restrictions on abortion funding and was
prominent in the 1986 campaign that defeated the court's previous
liberal majority, led by Chief Justice Rose Bird.
   Only Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas and Justice Edward Panelli
voted to grant a hearing on the appeal by Deukmejian's
administration of a lower-court order requiring full funding of
abortions to continue. Four votes are needed for a hearing by the
seven-member court.
   ``It means that over 80,000 poor women in California are going
to continue to have the right to abortion, and that the Legislature
can't restrict their reproductive choices to only childbirth and
sterilization,'' said Martha Kegel, associate director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.
   ``To the extent that the right-to-life movement was hoping that
a mere change in the composition of the California Supreme Court
was going to mean the overturning of established precedent, they're
dead wrong.''
   The 1988-89 state budget, similar to every budget since 1978,
would have allowed state-funded abortions in only a few types of
cases: if childbirth would endanger the woman's life, if the
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest reported to authorities, if
the woman was under 18 and had notified her parents of the
abortion, or if the fetus was severely deformed.
   The budget set aside $12.86 million for abortions and said no
other funds would be allowed. Abortion-rights groups said
unrestricted funding would cost $25 million, but that the
restrictions would eliminate about 90 percent of all Medi-Cal
abortions.
   The budget restrictions have never taken effect because of
orders by state courts.
   In 1981, the state Supreme Court ruled that as long as Medi-Cal
paid for childbirth, the restrictions on abortion funding violated
a poor woman's right of privacy, under the state constitution, to
decide whether to give birth.
   That ruling conflicted with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, under
less-protective privacy standards of the U.S. Constitution,
allowing states to limit abortion funding. California is one of
only 14 states that has continued to pay for poor women's abortions
since the federal government cut off most funding in 1977.
   The San Francisco-based 1st District Court of Appeal ruled Feb.
19 that the abortion restrictions were invalid on two grounds: a
violation of the right to privacy, as defined by the 1981 state
Supreme Court decision, and a violation of the state constitutional
rule that a new law cannot cover multiple subjects.
   Because the Medi-Cal law requires funding for all
childbirth-related medical services, including abortions, the
budget restrictions conflict with that law and should have been
contained in a separate bill rather than attached to the budget,
the appeals court said.

<HEAD>Cold War Veterans Urge U.S., Soviet Non-Intervention in Third
World</HEAD>

   Soviet and U.S. veterans of the Cold War on
Thursday proposed that their nations stop intervening in the Third
World as a step toward reducing tension, but they differed over the
use of Cuban forces abroad and agreed to overlook the 1981
crackdown in Poland.
   The proposal was presented in a working paper that one
co-author, Arthur Macy Cox, said could have been subtitled ``No
more Afghanistans, No more Vietnams.''
   Cox, a former CIA official, organized the 3{-year effort to
produce the paper, along with Georgi Arbatov, who is an adviser to
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and head of Moscow's USA-Canada
Institute.
   ``We believe that military intervention by the superpowers in
regional conflicts has reached a dangerous dead end and should be
terminated by mutual agreements,'' said the paper, which was
produced by seven Soviets affiliated with official news
organizations and research institutes and seven American former
officials and scholars.
   The paper also touched on areas that already are under
negotiation, such as sharp cuts in strategic nuclear and
conventional arms, strict controls on chemical weapons and
adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which would
doom President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The new ground lay in the area of intervention in the Third
World, a topic believed to be under hot debate in the Kremlin
following the decision to withdraw the Red Army from Afghanistan by
early next year.
   The problem of defining limits to such intervention became
evident during a news conference Thursday as Cox and Arbatov,
professing harmony, could not agree whether the use of 45,000
pro-Soviet Cuban troops in Angola constituted ``proxy forces.'' The
paper calls for a ban on such forces.
   The U.S. government calls Cuban forces used in Third World
conflicts Soviet proxies.
   ``They are not our proxy forces,'' Arbatov said. ``This is
simply a friendly nation that has its forces on the invitation of
the Angolan government in Angola. I cannot regard them as our proxy
forces.''
   Cox interjected: ``Let me say that we do regard them as proxy
forces, and it is spelled out in here (in the position paper) ...
So I hope we cannot have any mistaken conclusions.''
   On another area of East-West tension, the working paper listed
the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968
as ``direct'' intervention, but did not mention the martial law
crackdown which crushed Poland's Solidarity trade union in 1981.
   The subject was not raised during the lengthy discussion that
preceded release of the paper, Cox said. ``There was no
intervention by the Red Army or by other proxies into the affairs
of Poland.''
   The Reagan administration had a radically different
interpretation at the time of the crackdown. Then-Secretary of
Defense Caspar W. Weinberger described Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski as a ``Russian in a Polish uniform.''
   And Ryszard Kuklinski, a Polish colonel who helped draft plans
for the military crackdown and later defected to the West, has said
the Soviets were involved in preparations for martial law and
relentlessly pressured Jaruzelski, threatening to invade if the
Polish Army did not suppress Solidarity.
   Arbatov is a member of the policy-making Communist Party Central
Committee, and several other Soviets on the panel are regarded as
advisers to Gorbachev.
   Soviet participants in the paper included: Fyodor Burlatsky, a
prominent journalist; Valentin Falin, head of the semi-official
Novosti news agency; Vitaly Zhurkin, head of a newly created
institute on European affairs; and several of Arabatov's aides:
Sergei Plekhanov, Henry Trofimenko and Andrei Kortunov.
   The Americans who contributed to the position paper were all
members of the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations and
included, besides Cox: Townsend Hoopes, undersecretary of the Air
Force under President Johnson; William Colby, a former CIA
director; George Ball, former undersecretary of state; John Culver,
a former U.S. senator; William Miller, formerly head of the Senate
Intelligence Committee staff; and Adele Simmons, president of
Hampshire College in Massachusetts.

   At least 45 passengers burned to death
Thursday when a bus caught fire after hitting a tree in central
India, a government official said.
   Sharad Upasani, managing director of the Maharashtra State Road
Transport Corporation, said more than 22 people were injured in
what the United News of India news agency called the worst road
accident in the country this year.
   Upasani said the state-owned bus burst into flames after the
driver lost control on a curve and the vehicle hit a tree and
overturned near the town of Nandad, about 285 miles east of Bombay.
   Upasani said at least three of the injured were seriously burned.
   Some passengers jumped from the bus windows to escape the
flames, while others were trapped inside the vehicle, UNI

<HEAD>Nebraska's GOP Senate Primary Heats Up; Daub Calls Karnes Rubber
Stamp</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf of Orr reaction after 2nd pvs bgng ``Karnes

<TEXT>
   Rep. Hal Daub turned up the temperature
Thursday in the increasingly bitter Republican primary for U.S.
Senate, criticizing incumbent David Karnes as a ``rubber stamp''
for President Reagan and Gov. Kay Orr.
   Karnes called the charge ``crazy'' but said he would not be
drawn into negative campaign tactics before Tuesday's election. His
top media aide, Brent Bahler, called Daub's comments the ``rhetoric
of a desperate candidate who knows he's lost the nomination.''
   Mrs. Orr said it was ``sad'' that Daub ``feels he has to take a
desperate approach.''
   The race for the GOP nomination is considered too close to call.
An Omaha World-Herald poll last week showed Karnes backed by 41
percent of those interviewed, while Daub was supported by 40
percent. Nineteen percent were undecided, and the margin of error
was 4 percentage points.
   The GOP candidate likely will face former Gov. Bob Kerrey, who
has only token opposition in the Democratic primary.
   Karnes was appointed by Mrs. Orr to replace Sen. Edward
Zorinsky, a Democrat who died in March 1987.
   Daub, a four-term congressman, has mounted an aggressive
campaign. Some party regulars have described him as a ``pit bull.''
   The latest assault by Daub came as the candidates _ first Daub
then Karnes _ appeared before 300 people at the Nebraska Life
Underwriters convention.
   ``I haven't been a rubber stamp for anybody,'' Daub said. ``I've
been independent of my governor and my president when I believe it
to be in the best interest of Nebraskans.''
   Daub said Karnes ``flip-flopped'' on many votes to please
Reagan, including last year's highway bill that raised the speed
limit to 65 mph.
   ``David Karnes first voted for the highway bill, but then
changed his vote when the president and the governor told him to,''
he said. ``When the trade bill came up, I knew all along it was
anti-agriculture, but David Karnes voted for it until the president
told him to change his vote.''
   Karnes made no reference to Daub's comments in his Thursday
speech to the underwriters.
   ``We're going to be positive for the rest of the campaign,''
Karnes said in an interview later. ``If he (Daub) wants to
rubber-stamp around the rest of the campaign, that's fine.''
   Daub was among the party regulars lobbying for the Senate seat
when Mrs. Orr appointed Karnes, a political unknown who helped the
governor in her 1986 election.
   Daub said Mrs. Orr and political ``outsiders'' were working to
re-elect Karnes against the wishes of Nebraskans.
   ``The governor and a small group of people in the Republican
Party with a narrow view are trying to control the process, the
process of electing our next United States senator,'' Daub said in
his speech.
   ``I believe Nebraska voters _ with our proud history of
independent thinking _ will reject this control of the process by a
few.''
   Mrs. Orr was in meetings in Omaha on Thursday and could not
immediately be reached for comment on Daub's statements.
   Daub, asked in a interview if he was trying to distance himself
from the Reagan administration, said:
   ``I'm trying to differentiate myself from my opponent and the
approach we will take to speak for Nebraskans in the U.S. Senate.
When the president is right, I've supported him.''
   Bahler said Daub's comments were ``absolutely nonsense.'' He
said Karnes had voted against Reagan on several issues and ``he
certainly has not been an arm of the governor.''
   Reagan has been a popular figure in Nebraska, piling up huge
margins of victory in both 1980 and 1984 in this traditionally
Republican farm state.

   George Bush says he sometimes keeps quiet in
Cabinet meetings for fear of leaks or of forcing President Reagan
to choose between him and other officials. But an aide said
Thursday that doesn't mean Bush avoids giving Reagan his opinions.
   ``He reserves his advice for the president,'' said Bush
spokesman Stephen Hart.
   The vice president, on a three-day campaign swing through the
West, told reporters in Sacramento on Wednesday, ``I hold back
speaking in meetings because I don't want the president to have to
be choosing between his vice president and the other members of the
Cabinet. And I hold back sometimes because I worry about leaks.''
   On Thursday, Bush focused on the issue of education, sitting in
on a calculus class at James A. Garfield High School taught by
Jaime Escalante, who has earned a national reputation for his work
in teaching advanced math concepts to disadvantaged students.
   One student asked Bush about possible problems class members
might have in paying for college expenses in light of reductions in
some federal educational loan programs.
   Bush said that, if elected, there would be ``a changing of
priorities to some degree'' to reflect more emphasis on education
in his administration.
   But he added, ``There has to be a limitation to what the federal
government can do.''
   Bush, who has stressed education in his campaign, drew scoffs
from the class and the teacher when he asked if they used
calculators or other machines.
   ``I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President, no calculators,'' said
Escalante, who was recently honored at a White House reception.
   The day before, talking of White House meetings and the
possibility that private discussions would become public, Bush
said, ``Generally speaking, I don't like kiss-and-tell books.''
That was an apparent reference to much-publicized books written by
former White House spokesman Larry Speakes and former chief of
staff Donald Regan.
   ``If you think somebody is there writing a book putting his or
her own spin on it, you hold back,'' Bush said, adding that concern
about such a possibility ``inhibits freedom of expression'' in the
White House.
   Hart denied that Bush's comments on his reluctance to speak out
reflected any meekness on the part of the man who has a lock on the
GOP presidential nomination.
   ``Some people may think he's ineffective, but it's only the way
he operates,'' Hart said.
   ``It's been long established that the vice president does not
give his advice in Cabinet meetings,'' Hart added. ``Rather he
reserves that for private meetings, his weekly lunches with the
president and morning staff meetings.''
   Asked if Bush had been afraid of speaking in front of former
chief of staff Regan, Hart said, ``I can't point to any specific
person who would cause him to worry about leaks.''
   In his own book, ``Looking Forward,'' published last September,
Bush said Reagan's Cabinet meetings were the only chance for many
Cabinet officials to communicate directly with the president.
   ``Knowing this, I saw the vice president's role at these
sessions as limited,'' Bush wrote. ``With open, direct access to
the Oval Office, there was ample opportunity to weigh in with my
opinion on administration policy, without cutting into Cabinet time
or putting the president in a position of having to decide `for' or
`against' his vice president.''
   In the past, Bush has not blamed concern about leaks or books as
a reason for his reluctance to speak out.
   Bush's reserve at Cabinet meetings ``has enabled him to have a
uniquely individual relationship with the president,'' Hart said.

   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia
declared Thursday it will avenge an Israeli attack on one of its
strongholds in which the Israelis say about 40 guerrillas were
killed.
   ``We shall retaliate. The battle with Israel is still in its
initial stage,'' said Subhi Tofeili, a clergyman who is a leader of
Hezbollah, an extremist Shiite Moslem group whose name means Party
of God.
   ``The torch of resistance will continue to burn despite Israel's
attacks,'' Tofeili told a news conference at a mosque in this Bekaa
Valley town four miles north of Maydoun, the stronghold assaulted
by the Israeli army the day before.
   Mashgara, the Syrian army's most forward garrison town in the
Bekaa, came under Israeli artillery fire Wednesday, but no
casualties were reported. Syria has about 50 soldiers in Mashgara
and about 16,000 in the Bekaa.
   An Israeli announcement said the battle, and the army's two-day
thrust into south Lebanon in search of guerrillas, ended Wednesday
night with three Israeli soldiers dead and 17 wounded. It said
about 40 Hezbollah fighters were killed at Maydoun.
   Tofeili conceded 10 guerrillas killed. He said eight were
wounded and one was taken prisoner ``in the heroic battle.''
   He said the Israelis demolished Maydoun's 60 houses after the
fighting.
   A Hezbollah statement claimed more than 30 Israeli soldiers were
killed or wounded in the 11-hour battle for Maydoun.
   Hezbollah sources said the Israelis remained in the village
Thursday. Reporters who tried to enter Maydoun on foot at about
noon Thursday came under fire and returned to Mashgara.
   ``I think the Israelis will eventually withdraw from Maydoun,
but I hope they stay there close to us where they are a precious
and easy prey,'' Tofeili said.
   The Hezbollah leader, wearing a white turban and black robe,
said his organization has ``promised Imam Khomeini that we will
keep up the struggle against the Zionist entity (Israel).'' He was
flanked by a half dozen other Hezbollah clergymen wearing green
battle fatigues under their robes.
   Hezbollah swears allegiance to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Iran's revolutionary patriarch.
   Israel began the operation Monday night, a week after two raids
into Israel by Palestinian guerrillas in which five guerrillas and
two Israeli soldiers were killed.
   Although its main target was Palestinian guerrillas, the
operation developed into a confrontation with Hezbollah at Maydoun.
   Maydoun is north of the ``security zone'' Israel created just
inside Lebanon after it withdrew in June 1985 from a three-year
occupation of south Lebanon.
   The zone, which ranges in depth from 6 to 10 miles, serves as a
buffer against cross-border into northern Israel. It is guarded by
Israeli soldiers and a surrogate militia, predominantly Christian,
called the South Lebanon Army.

   The fire that gutted four floors of First
Interstate Bancorp's high-rise headquarters won't affect customers
at the bank's operations in 19 states, officials said Thursday.
   Most of the computers that control checking and savings
accounts, automatic teller machines, and other business of the
nation's eighth-largest banking company are in a building six
blocks away, said John Popovich, director of public affairs.
   Other computerized operations for First Interstate Bank of
California are controlled from similar centers in the San Francisco
Bay area and the company's banks in other states also have some of
their own computers, Popovich said. The bank continued trading in
securities, and international banking and loan activity were
unaffected.
   The main downtown Los Angeles branch, on the building's ground
floor, was the only one closed by the fire, Popovich said.
   The blaze that started Wednesday night and raged through the
early morning hours gutted four floors of the 62-story tower, the
tallest in the city, injuring 40 people and killing one maintenance
man who was trapped in an elevator.
   Engineers began checking the glass-and-metal tower for
structural damage, but by mid-morning, bank officials hadn't been
allowed in to see what records and files had been lost.
   Operations on the gutted floors _ the 12th through the 15th and
part of the 16th _ included the foreign exchange trading, corporate
loan administration, personal trusts, economics, advertising and
public affairs.

<DATELINE>BIHAC, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main defendant in the trial of 25
officials indicted in a major financial scandal said Thursday he
was the victim of a power struggle and demanded that the case be
moved to another Yugoslav republic.
   Fikret Abdic, 49, director general of the Agrokomerc
food-processing plant, went on trial before the high court of this
Bosnian town on charges of circulating uncovered promissory notes
worth about $1 billion in the nation's biggest postwar financial
scandal.
   Both Abdic, who claimed that the Bihac court was biased, and
most of the 25 defense attorneys challenged the court's ability to
stage an impartial trial. Bihac is near Velika Kladusa, where the
Agrokomerc company is headquartered.
   Court president Rifat Konjic, head of a five-judge panel,
adjourned the trial until Monday to consider the defense's demands.
   Abdic also demanded that the national premier, Branko Mikulic,
and Raif Dizdarevic, who takes over the rotating federal presidency
this month, appear before the court.
   The main charge against the defendants is the criminal offense
of ``counterrevolutionary threat to the social system,'' which
carries a maximum of 20 years in prison.
   The 25 officials also were indicted for abuse of authority to
undermine the economy ``under especially grave circumstances,''
embezzlement, illegal dealings with foreign companies and attempts
to disrupt Yugoslavia's banking and financial system.
   Abdic spoke of an ``an unprecedented struggle for power on the
backs of 13,000 people and the back of Fikret Abdic.''
   His statement was a reference to Agrokomerc's 13,000 workers.
Four thousand have quit since the financial scandal surrounding the
firm was exposed by the state-supervised media last August. About
9,000 are still on the payroll with minimum wages.
   Abdic and the attorneys contended that by expelling Abdic from
the Communist Party and denouncing other Agrokomerc officials,
party leaders, the state-run media and officials in Bosnia have
prejudiced the republic's judiciary and made any trial in the
republic unfair.
   Abdic himself demanded the trial be held in Ljubljana, capital
of Slovenia; Zagreb, capital of Croatia; or Novi Sad, capital of
Vojvodina province.
   Asked about prospects for a transfer of the trial, Kresimir Abel
of Zagreb, Abdic's chief attorney, said with a smile, ``The
question is superfluous,'' suggesting this would not happen.
   Other defendants include Ibrahim Mujic, deputy chief of the
food-processing enterprise, Alija Alesevic, the director of the
Agrokomerc bank, and bankers Ismeta Junuzovic and Mujo Vukovic.
   ``The circumstances have forced Agrokomerc (to engage in) such
business practices,'' Abdic told the court about the large-scale
issuance of bad bills of exchange.
   He requested that ``the causes, the essence and the
consequences'' of the scandal be established rather than his
personal guilt.
   Demanding the appearance in court of top leaders, Abdic made a
fleeting reference to an alleged comment Mikulic made April 30,
1987, to the head of a Sarajevo company that ``it will all be
settled'' in connection with uncovered promissory notes.
   Mikulic and other senior leaders have denied any guilt in the
affair which was first reported by the Belgrade daily Borba last
August.
   Abdic also sought to implicate the Bosnian police and their
chief Dusan Zgojanin. ``We cannot influence a lot, but we can
influence some and assist you,'' Abdic claimed he was told by
police investigators when he was asked to testify against Hakija
Pozderac.
   Pozderac, now a 69-year-old pensioner, is the second most
important defendant and a former economics minister.
   His brother, Hamdija Pozderac, died in April after resigning as
federal vice president following allegations he was involved in the
Agrokomerc affair.

<HEAD>NASA Chief Says Civilian Space Program `Facing Extinction'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of NASA contended Thursday that the
country's civilian space program ``is facing extinction this year''
if Congress carries out threats to cut space funds.
   ``The outlook is grim,'' said Dr. James C. Fletcher.
   The proposed space station, he said, will be doomed if Congress
doesn't grant the money that the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and President Reagan have requested.
   ``If there isn't enough money, we just can't go on,'' he said.
``It's curtains for the space station'' if Congress appropriates
much below the $900 million NASA needs.
   Fletcher carried his fight for funding to a symposium on science
education, saying the space program's future rides on the outcome
of current budget deliberations in Congress.
   Reagan has proposed $11.5 billion for NASA in the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1, but members of the Senate and House
appropriations committees have said the amount will be $10.7
billion or less.
   ``It may come as a surprise to you, but the nation's civil space
program is facing extinction this year,'' Fletcher said. ``While I
remain optimistic about the launch of the space shuttle this
summer, I believe Americans must know that the long-term future of
the space program hangs in the balance this year.''
   Fletcher said that if the amount set in the House budget
resolution _ $10.2 billion _ prevails, the civil space program will
be stopped in its tracks.
   Originally, NASA wanted $1.8 billion in 1989 for the station, a
manned facility designed for 30 years of scientific research and as
a platform for exploration of outer space. The president cut that
request down to $967 million in the budget he submitted to Congress.
   Fletcher would not say how much below a funding level of $900
million would cause him to kill the station program. But he told
the educators that budget levels being discussed ``would spell
death.''
   The result would be, he said, that major commitments to the
station's international partners would have to be cancelled,
advanced astronomy observatories designed to be serviced from the
station would never get off the ground and scientific research
won't take place.
   ``The shuttle program, on which so much attention is focused
today, will be able to operate only at a reduced flight rate in the
years ahead,'' Fletcher said. That would mean, he added that
scientific and national security payloads would have to wait longer
and the country would fall further behind while the Soviet Union,
Japan and Europeans move ahead.
   ``I speak out today because the crisis is real,'' Fletcher said.
``If the United States, the richest nation on Earth, cannot afford
to invest a fraction of 1 percent of its budget in its future, then
clearly it cannot afford to be a world competitor in space or on
Earth.''

<HEAD>INS Says Amnesty Program Successful, Despite Not Hitting 2 Million
Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amnesty program that pulled in more than
1.6 million aliens seeking to live legally in the United States
won't be extended and ``has proceeded very successfully'' despite
not hitting the 2 million mark, the nation's top immigration
official said Thursday.
   ``We'll take our 85-percent batting average on that as quite
good,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Alan
Nelson told a news conference. He said INS officials had been
making a ``rough estimate'' a year ago when they predicted the
program would attract 2 million undocumented residents.
   He said the one-year amnesty application period which ended at
midnight Wednesday would not be prolonged even in the face of two
court rulings. He said the courts ``have both been extremely narrow
in their holdings.''
   A federal appeals court in Manhattan extended the midnight
deadline for aliens with children born in the United States who are
receiving welfare benefits. A federal judge in Washington extended
the midnight deadline for a broader group _ those aliens who
overstayed their visas.
   Hispanic groups say some 100,000 aliens could be eligible under
that ruling, but Nelson questioned the figure.
   ``The numbers we believe are very small ... and there's also a
lot of question as to what the rulings are,'' the INS commissioner
said.
   ``No one should read these court decisions as any indication
that they're going to be extensions here, other than there might be
some very narrow ones,'' Nelson added.
   But Charles Kamasaki, director of policy analysis for the
National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, said it was
possible there could be ``a crazy quilt pattern of judicial
extensions'' for the amnesty program, which Congress refused to
extend last week.
   Kamasaki pointed to class-action cases in federal courts in
California, one involving people who were out of the country for
extended periods after 1982 and the other for people who left the
United States briefly after the amnesty program began and returned.
   In addition, he said, there have been 15 changes in the INS
regulations since the amnesty program went in effect last May.
   ``I hope Nelson will reconsider his position on simply resisting
firm and then reluctantly complying with these court decisions,''
Kamasaki said.
   The INS ``did a good job, but they fell short,'' said Mario
Moreno, legal counsel for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund.
   Immigration officials ``could have done a better job on public
information campaigns in the early months of the amnesty
application period,'' Moreno said. He estimated there were 600,000
to 800,000 illegal aliens who would have qualified for amnesty but
who did not apply.
   Nelson, however, said no one knows how many illegal aliens there
are who might qualify who didn't apply. He said the INS program
succeeded in the face of heavy criticism.
   ``The so-called fear factor, in which people were believed to be
afraid to submit applications directly to INS, never
materialized,'' Nelson said.
   He said more than 80 percent of amnesty applications came
directly to INS offices without the involvement of lawyers or other
agencies.
   ``Many illegal aliens may have a trust and an appreciation for
this country and this government beyond that of many citizens,''
Nelson said.
   The amnesty program is part of the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act which was designed to stem the flow of illegal aliens
across the nation's borders. Under the amnesty portion of the law,
aliens who came to this country prior to Jan. 1, 1982, and have
lived here since then may apply for legalization.
   Following optimistic predictions by the INS of a heavy flow of
applications, turnout at many offices was light. But there was a
last-minute crush of requests under the program, and on Wednesday,
the final day of the program, the INS received some 125,000
applications.
   According to the INS, California had the most applicants, with
55 percent of the total, while Texas had more than 17 percent and
Illinois nearly 7 percent. New York was fourth with 5.9 percent and
Florida was fifth with 2.9 percent. Arizona was sixth with 1.7
percent, New Jersey was seventh with 1.3 percent and New Mexico was
eighth with 1.1 percent.
   More than 70 percent of the applicants were from Mexico, 8
percent were from El Salvador and less than 3 percent were from
Guatemala.
   The median age of applicants was 30 years old, and nearly 80
percent of those applying were between the ages of 15 and 44.
   There is a separate program for agricultural workers who may
continue to apply for legalization. The applications under the
agricultural program have totaled 479,500 to date.

<HEAD>Bahamian Prime Minister Attacks Drug Allegations as `Fairy Tales'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
attacked allegations that he accepted bribes from drug traffickers
as ``absolutely untrue'' and said his government will stand up for
its sovereign rights.
   ``We will take our case to the world. We are citizens of the
world, and we have a right to be heard,'' Pindling told a rally
Wednesday night at a government schoolhouse.
   Earlier, Pindling released a statement denouncing the
allegations against him made in testimony during the U.S. drug
trial of reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas, and
news reports in the United States that federal grand juries are
investigating him.
   Pindling, who led the archipelago of 700 islands and 225,000
people to independence after defeating the white-minority
government in 1967, was overwhelmingly re-elected last year in the
aftermath of a 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry that studied
corruption in the Bahamian government and law enforcement. The
probe stopped short of linking Pindling directly to drug bribes.
   Pindling said in his statement he wasn't surprised by the
allegations that have been made at Lehder's trial, but would be
surprised if any of the grand juries reportedly investigating his
affairs indicted him.
   ``This is so because the testimony given concerning me is
totally and absolutely untrue,'' Pindling said. ``I have never been
offered a bribe and have never accepted a bribe.
   ``For any grand jury anywhere to produce indictments of the kind
speculated about in the press I would regard as a gross miscarriage
of justice and a serious breach of faith on the part of the U.S.
government,'' his statement said.
   Several prosecution witnesses testified at Lehder's trial in
Jacksonville, Fla., that Pindling took money from smugglers such as
Lehder, who allegedly used Norman's Cay in the Bahamas as a key
transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for Florida and Georgia.
U.S. drug officials have estimated some 40 percent of all South
American cocaine reaches the United States from Bahamian transfer
points.

   For Ron Bates of Nevada Glass Co., ``it's
busy, busy, busy.''
   But for many of the residents of Emerald Point, no such silver
lining exists in the aftermath of the toxic cloud and concussion
from the exploding space shuttle fuel plant nearby.
   As many in this desert community of 54,000 residents surveyed
the damage to their homes and businesses, they found foundations
and walls shifted, windows broken, nails popped loose and doors
blasted off. For some, cars were trapped because garage doors had
been warped by the explosion.
   The Emerald Point housing tract of about 100 homes, priced in
the $100,000 range and a mile from the blast site, sustained heavy
structural damage.
   One insurance company responded curtly to homeowner queries:
``You're on the list.''
   Resident George Horvath, flashlight in hand, was up at dawn
Thursday checking for damage. He saw wide cracks in his stucco and
cement, and smashed window panes.
   When the Pacific Engineering & Production Co. of Nevada fuel
plant blew up Wednesday, Horvath and his wife, Hilda, thought an
airliner had crashed at nearby McCarran International Airport.
   ``You just get that numb feeling,'' Horvath said.
   Across the street, the front door to Marvin and Pat Coolidge's
home was blown in by the force of the explosion. The couple spent
Thursday morning cleaning up the feathery fiberglass insulation
blown from the ceiling.
   Walls were cracked throughout the house, the door frame was
ripped out and splintered and a living room wall was pushed out
about an inch from its foundation.
   The couple's teen-age daughters refused to stay in the house,
fearing it would fall down. They spent the night with friends.
   ``They're under so much stress. They are sick. They are throwing
up,'' Mrs. Coolidge said.
   Schools were evacuated after the blast and ordered closed for a
week so inspectors could determine if the buildings were safe.
Teen-agers rode skateboards and congregated at a neighborhood
7-Eleven.
   Glass was shattered and drywall panels were ripped off by the
force of the blast at a new tract of $135,000 homes under
construction a mile from the blast site.
   ``I just hit the deck,'' said construction superintendant Larry
Reese, who was in a small trailer a half-mile from the plant when
the blast occurred.
   ``I ran out of the house,'' said Mrs. Coolidge, recalling the
moments after the explosion. ``I didn't have to open the door.''

<HEAD>Student Senate Members Apologize Over Defacing Jackson Picture</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note language in 8th graf, `Of the...'.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WINONA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of the Student Senate at Winona
State University have apologized to a black group for defacing and
writing insults on a magazine cover picture of Jesse Jackson, a
school official said Thursday.
   Jon Kosidowski, administrative assistant to the vice president
of student affairs at the school, said an investigation by the
school's affirmative action office concluded the two students were
not motivated by racism, but that what was written on the picture
was ``derogatory and insensitive.''
   Kosidowski refused to identify the students, and others involved
in the matter also have refused to identify them. He said the
students will remain in the Student Senate.
   The two students wrote individual letters of apology to the
Black Cultural Awareness Association, which had filed a complaint
of harassment and discrimination with the school's affirmative
action office last month. The association is a multiracial group
with about 25 active members.
   The university, about 120 miles southeast of Minneapolis, has
6,400 students, about 96 percent of them white, Kosidowski said.
   Members of the Student Senate found the Jackson picture, from
the April 13 cover of Time magazine, on a desk used by several
people in the senate office. Senators and school officials who
investigated the incident said the magazine did not appear to have
been left for everyone to see. It was taken to the school
newspaper, shown to black leaders and published.
   The Democratic presidential candidate's face was disfigured,
horns were on his head and an arrow was drawn through it. Several
disparaging slogans were written on the picture.
   Of the slogans, some were racially neutral insults. Others
included, ``Let's go get whitey'' and ``Where's those hymies?'' The
second was an apparent reference to Jackson's off-the-record
comment, made public amid a storm or controversy during the 1984
campaign, referring to Jews as ``hymies.'' The BCA also had
demanded apologies from those responsible and it also sought their
resignations from the senate.
   But a BCA spokeswoman said Wednesday that the group has accepted
the apologies and would no longer seek resignations. ``We're
satisfied with everything so far,'' BCA President Dena Gosha said
of the written apologies.
   Gosha, a sophomore from Chicago, said the school's
administration ``has been very fair about it, especially President
(Thomas ) Stark. He took us seriously. That meant a lot to me and
gave me a little more faith in this school.
   ``At times, we feel we don't belong here. But the way this has
been handled makes me proud that I go here,'' Gosha said. She
referred to complaints by some black students about racist remarks
directed at them by some white students.
   ``We definitely agree it (magazine defacing) was not done with
racial motivation,'' Kosidowski said, but he conceded there are
complaints by black students that they are the targets of racial
slurs by some white students on campus.

<HEAD>Credit Checks Among Education Department Proposals on College Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Education on Thursday called
for new curbs on federal aid for college, including mandatory
credit checks on borrowers 21 or older, a ban on assistance for
high school dropouts and penalties for institutions that fail to
educate their students.
   The Reagan administration has proposed some of these changes to
Congress previously, and it has not yet lined up any sponsors for
this new package of legislative proposals.
   However, Bruce Carnes, the department's deputy undersecretary,
said that with defaults costing taxpayers a ``horrendous'' $1.6
billion a year, support is growing on Capitol Hill for cracking
down on defaulters and schools that are eager to sign up
prospective students but remiss at educating them.
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett stirred a controversy
last fall by proposing to bar colleges or trade schools from the
student aid programs if their students' default rates exceeded 20
percent.
   Bennett also has proposed stricter accreditation rules for
colleges. The department is still drafting such rules to be
presented to Congress.
   In a statement, Bennett said Thursday his new proposals would
``restore credibility and integrity'' to the $9 billion student aid
programs by cracking down on defaults and closing ``loopholes that
allow some schools to exploit ill-prepared, often disdvantaged
students.''
   Both the House and Senate are expected to act later this year on
proposals to attack the loan default problem. The lawmakers are
considered less likely, however, to take up some of Bennett's other
proposals, such as his call for college ``accountability plans.''
   Bennett asked Congress to require institutions to submit
``accountability plans'' to qualify for College Work-Study and
Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant funds.
   Each college would have to develop a plan ``to assess in
quantifiable terms (its) success in providing an education of
demonstrable value to its students,'' according to Bennett's draft
legislation.
   ``We won't specify particular outcome measures. The schools will
do that, but I expect they will include such things as performance
on standardized tests, dropout rates and job placement rates,''
Bennett said. ``It's high time in student aid ... to begin to
reward success and penalize failure.''
   He also asked for repeal of a provision in the law that allows
institutions to admit students without a high school diploma or
equivalency degree if they are deemed to have the ``ability to
benefit'' from the training.
   ``Too often these students ... are enticed into postsecondary
institutions by promises of grants and loans, only to end up
dropping out and in debt,'' Bennett said.
   Among his proposals are:
   _Mandatory credit checks on borrowers 21 and older, and
co-signers for those with poor credit histories. Lenders would be
allowed to charge up to $25 for the credit checks.
   _Requiring borrowers to give the school their driver's license
number, post-graduation address, next-of-kin address and other
information when they leave school.
   _Limiting Pell Grants to three years for students in programs
lasting two years or less.
   _Reducing the guarantee on loans from 100 percent to 90 percent
for banks, and even lower for student loan guarantee agencies.
   _Strengthening the secretary of education's powers to suspend a
school from participating in the aid programs ``when federal funds
are at risk.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Republicans Urge Dukakis To Take Leave Of Absence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three prominent Massachusetts Republicans called
Thursday for Michael S. Dukakis to step aside as governor while he
pursues the Democratic presidential nomination. Dukakis, through a
spokesman, refused.
   Citing a ``major mess'' in state government, the Republican
officials demanded that Dukakis take an unpaid leave of absence,
but stopped short of calling for his resignation.
   The call for Dukakis to step aside came from state Republican
Party Chairman Ray Shamie; state Sen. David Locke, who is a
Massachusetts election co-chairman for Republican Vice President
George Bush; and House Minority Leader Steven Pierce.
   Dukakis was re-elected governor in November 1986 with nearly 70
percent of the vote. He has said he will not resign unless and
until he is sworn in as president. His press secretary, James
Dorsey, said Thursday Dukakis will not step aside.
   ``We are persuaded that this is partisan tomfoolery and a
somewhat befuddled attempt by the Republican leadership to
demonstrate that it has a sense of humor,'' Dorsey said.
   Dukakis was campaigning in Nebraska and West Virginia on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Koch To Skip Democratic Convention</HEAD>

   Mayor Edward I. Koch will travel to Ireland with
Cardinal John O'Connor this summer to protest violence in Northern
Ireland rather than attend the Democratic National Convention.
   ``I'm not going. I'm going to Ireland. That decision to go to
Ireland was made on St. Patrick's Day when I was asked to go,'' the
mayor said in an interview.
   He said the dates of the visit to Ireland conflicted with those
of the party convention in Atlanta. The convention is scheduled
from July 18 to 21 while the Cardinal's trip is set for July 21 to
27.
   The mayor, who had hoped to go to the convention to lead a draft
movement for Gov. Mario Cuomo, had come under sharp criticism for
his attacks on Jesse Jackson in the New York state primary last
month.
   He had supported Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee over Jackson and
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the front-runner for the
party nomination, after Cuomo withdrew his name for a draft.
   Koch later said he had told Dukakis, who won the New York
primary, that he would be ``a soldier in his army.''

   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., has done what
she said she would do _ she has refunded about $24,000 to
contributors to her exploratory Democratic presidential campaign.
   When the Denver Democrat, after a summer of testing the waters,
decided last September not to enter the presidential race, she
promised to refund donations to anyone requesting them. But she
warned she would pay her bills first and then give back a prorated
share.
   Schroeder since has returned $24,000 to 556 individuals, her
campaign treasurer, Max Snead, told The Denver Post's Washington
bureau. Contributors received a little less than half their
original donations, said Snead.
   Schroeder raised nearly $1 million while considering a
presidential run. About $400,000 remains in her presidential fund,
now renamed ``Schroeder Fund for the Future,'' said Snead.

   It has been rare that Democratic presidential nominees have

   Harris noted a recent Omaha World-Herald poll that suggested
Bush barely edging Dukakis, 42 percent to 40 percent, in

   ``Who would have believed that Dukakis would be able to take on

<HEAD>National Urban League Outlines Agenda For 1988 Candidate
Evaluation</HEAD>

   The National Urban League released its
``agenda for change'' Thursday as a guide of critical issues upon
which to evaluate the presidential contenders.
   ``What we are trying to do with this document is to force the
candidates to tell us where they stand on critical issues as they
relate to our community,'' said John E. Jacob, league president.
   Jacob told a press conference that the agenda was also designed
to help black voters evaluate the candidates and maintained that
the issues raised should be included the formulation of each
party's platform _ ``a platform designed not only to attract the
black vote but designed to address black needs.''
   ``We believe civil rights and social justice to be an agenda
item on any president's program. An agenda item in the sense that
the pulpit of the presidency is used as a bully pulpit to be an
advocate, an activist president on the behalf of civil rights,'' he
said.
   Jacob is one of several civil rights leaders scheduled to meet
with the vice president on May 19.

<HEAD>East German Calls For Broader Trade, Cultural Ties With U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's top foreign policymaker ended
talks in Washington on Thursday with a call for broader trade and
cultural relations with the United States, but U.S. officials said
little progress was made toward settling major differences.
   Hermann Axen, a politbureau member and the highest-ranking East
German to visit Washington since the country was established after
World War II, told a National Press Club audience ``we favor a
broadening and stabilization of the political dialogue btween our
governments, an expansion of contacts between our parliaments.
   ``The conclusion of a mutually advantageous trade agreement is
important.''
   Axen said that though the two countries have had diplomatic
relations for 14 years, real contacts ``are still at the
beginning.''
   ``This fact is especially striking when one looks at the dynamic
and continuous development of the German Democratic Republic's
interaction with the overwhelming majority of states in the
world,'' he said. ``We have to catch up in our mutual
relationship.''
   Of the Soviet Union's allies, East Germany traditionally has
been among those most willing to follow Moscow's lead on foreign,
economic and human rights policies.
   As a result, until the rise of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, relations between the United States and East Germany
were icy, in large part due to U.S. unwillingness to expand
relations with a country considered to have one of the worst human
rights records in Europe.
   Relations remain cool _ as evidenced by a bilateral trade of
only $150 million last year _ but on the diplomatic level there
have been some signs of thaw. Deputy Secretary of State John C.
Whitehead visited East Berlin last year and Secretary of State
George P. Shultz met with Axen on Tuesday.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Shultz
raised the issue of individual freedoms, which according to the
State Department's latest human rights report are tightly
restricted in East Germany.
   The official said the East Germans continue to seek an increase
in trade but there is no inclination on the part of the United
States to grant special commercial privileges, including ``most
favored nation status,'' it has given to Hungary, Poland and
Romania.
   The two countries also remain aprt on the settlement of U.S.
claims against East Germany for seizure of American property during
and after World War II. The claims total more than $78 million.
   Axen acknowledged that differences remain but said ``it is our
belief that trustful dialogue and constructive bilateral ties can
positively contribute to the betterment of the international
situation.''
   His appeal included a personal note. Axen, a Jew who joined the
communist party in the early 1930s, was imprisoned in the Nazi
concentration camp, Buchenwald, which was liberated when U.S. Army
troops under General George S. Patton approached in April 1945.
   ``On my first visit to your country I feel I owe a debt of
gratitude to the great American people,'' he told the press club.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of stockbrokers told a House
subcommittee Thursday that last October's financial crash and the
prevalance of program trading is frightening the average American
away from the stock market.
   The brokers told members of the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee that the dramatic price swings that have
characterized trading in recent months, and computer-driven
transactions by huge institutions, are making the public reluctant
to invest in stocks.
   ``The confidence level of the average investor in the stock
market is today appreciably below any level that I have seen in
almost 20 years in this business,'' said George Strum, senior vice
president of Legg Mason and Co., a Baltimore brokerage firm.
   Strum said most of his clients are middle-class investors with
portfolios that are in some cases worth less than $1,000, yet have
continued investing through tough economic times in the past.
   ``However, these same clients today are pulling back from making
any investments in any equities, fundamentally because they are
worried that the market seems to go up and down, very quickly and
very substantially, without any rhyme or reason,'' he said.
   ``They are absolutely disspirited over volatility in the market,
and look now at the market with almost disdain,'' said Richard J.
Heckmann, a senior vice president for Prudential Bache Securities
in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
   The subcommittee has been examining the nation's financial
markets since the record 508-point drop of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average last Oct. 19, and the wildly surging prices that have
become common ever since. The panel has yet to propose any
legislation.
   A number of federal agencies and financial market organizations
also have studied the crash's reverberations, and several have
concluded that a variety of program-trading strategies _ large
transactions driven by computers _ have diminished stability in the
markets.
   Some of the studies and several market participants have
produced figures showing that heavy program trading has, at times,
shoved the market downward, despite an absence of bad economic
news. Computer trading techniques such as index arbitrage are
instead driven by price differences between the stock markets and
the stock index futures and options markets.
   ``Our equity markets exist for the purpose of capital formation
and to provide investment vehicles for our people,'' said Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee's chairman. ``When they
become playgrounds for computer traders, arenas where a very few
large institutions and investment banks can engineer nearly risk
free profits while scaring the individual investor out of the
market, something must be done.''

   Beautiful eyes and lovely skin are some
obvious traits of Coastal Russet, a new, pure white baking potato
that will be on its way this fall to grocery shelves, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Coastal Russet is a 6- to 8-inch-long potato recently released
to growers by plant breeders in New York, Florida, Virginia, New
Jersey and Maine.
   Although developed specially for the diverse growing conditions
of the eastern coastal areas from Maine to Florida, researchers
found Coastal Russet can be grown throughout the United States.
   ``Consumers will find this baked potato to be whiter and moister
than Russet Burbank, the nation's leading baking potato,'' said
Robert W. Goth, a plant pathologist in the department's
Agricultural Research Service. ``Many potatoes turn light beige
inside when baked, but not Coastal Russet.''
   The potato was developed over 10 years of research led by
retired plant pathologist Raymon E. Webb at the agency's vegetable
laboratory in Beltsville, Md.
   ``Its shallow eyes and attractive skin pattern look good in a
package, making it pleasing to the producer and the consumer,''
Goth said.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham has turned his
car dealership over to a former competitor, who says he plans to
spruce up the business and increase staff and advertising.
   Kemp Biddulph, who owns other auto franchises, took over the
business Wednesday as Mecham Pontiac license plates were scooped up
as souvenirs and workers replaced signs.
   The deal had been announced in March following several months of
quiet negotiations. Biddulph earlier in the year bought Mecham's
Jeep-Eagle franchise.
   The sale was announced during Mecham's impeachment trial, and at
the time Mecham Pontiac officials acknowledged a steady decrease in
sales as Mecham's troubles as governor increased.
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 when the Arizona Senate
convicted him of impeachment charges, one related to the
dealership. That accused him of misusing a state protocol fund by
loaning $80,000 from it to his dealership.
   Impeachment trial prosecutors contended Mecham Pontiac was in
financial trouble and needed the infusion of cash, but Mecham
denied that and said he ordered the loan to get a better interest
rate for the fund.
   Dennis Mecham, the former governor's son and general manager of
the dealership, said at the time the sale was announced that the
deal involved $4 million, but he said the transaction had other
components which he would not disclose.
   The dealership had 76 employees. Biddulph said he plans to bring
the staff up to about 100 employees.
   His first priority is to improve the business's physical
condition, Biddulph said.
   ``We need to clean up, patch up and get some sweepers in there.
We're going to put in new landscaping and put down some new
blacktop,'' he said.
   Biddulph, known for his aggressive marketing, also said he plans
to increase advertising of the dealership by including it in
campaigns already devised for his other dealerships.
   Mecham Pontiac had been the only area Pontiac dealership not to
participate in the local dealer advertising association.

<HEAD>Navy Considering Challenge of Ruling that Freed Billig from Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Navy is going to take another week to
decide whether to challenge the court ruling that freed Dr. Donal
M. Billig from prison, officials said Thursday.
   Billig, the former chief heart surgeon at the Bethesda, Md.,
Naval Hospital, was convicted two years ago at court martial of
killing patients through surgical negligence.
   On April 13, the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review
struck down that conviction and ordered Billig freed from Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., concluding the evidence against him was simply
not sufficient to establish guilt ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Lt. Brian Cullin, a Navy spokesman, said Thursday the Navy had
decided to forego its legal right to ask the same court to re-hear
arguments in the case. The Navy had until Wednesday to file such an
appeal.
   Cullin declined to offer a reason for the Navy's decision. But
another official who asked not to be named noted the Navy-Marine
Corps court had heard Billig's case ``en banc,'' or with all
members participating, and thus was unlikely to change its mind.
   By foregoing the right to appeal the matter with that court, the
Navy now has until May 13 to appeal the case to a higher court, the
U.S. Court of Military Appeals, Cullin said.
   ``Right now, no decision has been made on an appeal,'' the
spokesman added. ``But we are still within the time limit to
request such a review.''
   The decision on whether to challenge the Billig ruling will be
made by the Navy's judge advocate general and Navy Secretary
William Ball, Cullin said.
   According to the spokesman, Billig, who holds the rank of
commander, is still in the service. He has been assigned to the
Kansas City, Kan., Navy-Marine Corps Reserve Center pending the
next decision in his case.
   Billig, 57, was the former chief heart surgeon at the Navy's
flagship hospital. He was convicted in early 1986 on charges of
involuntary manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three
patients, and subsequently sentenced on March 3, 1986, to four
years in prison. Last summer, he was rebuffed in his first bid for
parole.
   Billig's case attracted great public attention, in part because
of the sensational nature of some of the charges. It also prompted
congressional reviews of military health care in general and
several large monetary settlements between the government and
relatives of Billig's patients.
   Prosecutors described Billig as an egocentric man, nearly blind
in one eye, who hid his visual handicap and continued performing
complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was
killing patients.
   The appeals court concluded last month, however, the prosecution
never really produced any evidence or testimony to demonstrate that
Billig's surgical technique and conduct in the operating room were
so out of line as to constitute criminal conduct.

<HEAD>Bee Mite Quarantine Canceled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month-old, 13-state federal quarantine to
curb the spread of tiny bee mites is being canceled because it has
proved to be unworkable, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The states are Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the restrictions are being
lifted, effective Friday, on the movement of bees and equipment
from those states.
   Although not known to be harmful to other creatures, the mites
are considered a major threat to the nation's honey and beekeeping
industry.
   The tiny killer mites, Varroa Jacobsoni, were first discovered
in the United States last September in a Wisconsin apiary. They
since have spread to the other states.
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood. It causes decreased brood, deformed
bees and a weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants
and produce honey. Infestation can occur so gradually that the
mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done.
   ``Information received from state governments, beekeepers,
growers and researchers has caused us to conclude that the
regulatory program established under the quarantine is not the
appropriate mechanism to contain the interstate spread of Varroa
mites,'' Glosser said.
   The original purpose of the quarantines was to issue permits for
out-of-state movement of only bees and equipment found to be free
of the mites.
   ``However, we've found that the requirements under the
quarantine are not uniformly appropriate or workable because the
role of honeybees in the agricultural economy varies widely from
state to state,'' Glosser said. ``Many beekeepers have found it
impossible to comply with the regulations and still meet their own
deadlines.''
   For example, he said, a beehive might have to be moved out of
its home state several times a year. Treating a hive against mites
requires 21 days, which is longer than most beehives are scheduled
to stay in a state when they are moved for pollination purposes.
   Beekeeping is credited by USDA with the pollination of many
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around $20
billion. Those include many fruits, vegetables and hay crops.
   Glosser said other factors weighed on the decision to cancel the
quarantines, including a shortage of treatment materials, and
limited state and federal resources to conduct and coordinate
surveys and inspections.
   ``The movement of hundreds of thousands of hives and other
regulated articles tends to occur during short periods in the
spring and fall, intensifying the demand for inspection services
beyond the limits of current federal and state resources,'' he said.

<HEAD>Veterans Group Challenging Bonuses For VA Appellate Boards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterans group filed suit Thursday accusing
the Veterans Administration of violating law and procedure by
paying productivity bonuses to members of appellate boards that
rule on benefit claims.
   The lawsuit by the Vietnam Veterans of America Inc. challenged
the production quotas set by the Board of Veterans Appeal for
members who sit on three-member panels to review VA denials of
disability benefit claims for service-related medical injuries.
   The suit, also brought on behalf of a veteran who was denied
disability benefits for psychosis and depression, charged that the
board's chairman, Kenneth Eaton, kept a list of senators and
congressman whose constituents got favorable treatment of their
appeals.
   The practice of paying annual cash bonuses to members of the
appeal boards for high productivity ``compromises the quality of
BVA decisionmaking'' and denies claimants due process, said the
suit filed in U.S. District Court.
   In order to be eligible for annual bonuses, panel members must
decide at least 40 cases a week, according to the lawsuit. To speed
up decisionmaking to meet the quotas, one or two members of the
panel would review the case and get a ``courtesy'' signature from
the remaining members, according to the suit.
   As a result of these procedures, the lawsuit charged ``thousands
of vets have had and continue to have their appeals denied under
circumstances where the deciding BVA panel members do not review
the appeals thoroughly and carefully.''
   VA spokeswoman Donna St. John said, ``We don't normally comment
on pending litigation.''
   The lawsuit charged that complaints bearing supporting letters
from lawmakers on Eaton's list were referred to the chairman's
office for special consideration.
   This procedure ``has no rational basis and bears no relationship
to the purpose for which VBA was established,'' the suit said.
   In the 1987 fiscal year, the board decided 41,296 appeals from
initial reviews by VA regional offices.
   It allowed 12.8 percent of the disability claims, denied 65
percent and sent the rest back to VA regional offices for further
review, according to Eaton's testimony earlier this year to a House
Government Operations subcommittee.

   Responding to questions about Attorney General
Edwin Meese III's legal problems, FBI Director William Sessions
said Thursday he would resign his own post if the public felt he
had engaged in improprieties.
   ``If it is perceived that the director of the FBI ... is not
properly, legally and ethically carrying out his responsibility, I
always have open the route of resignation for myself,'' Sessions
said when asked, in the context of Meese's legal troubles, what he
would do if he sensed the public thought he was acting improperly.
   Sessions added that ``I think there's a great deal of difference
between'' a hypothetical situation involving himself and ``the
circumstances'' involving unproven allegations relating to Meese,
who has been under criminal investigation since last May 11.
   When a reporter asked whether Sessions would be unhappy if his
remarks were interpreted as suggesting that Meese, his boss,
perhaps ought to resign, the FBI director responded:
   ``No, I think you'll have to draw your own conclusions.'' But he
quickly added that ``I'm trying to talk about general principles
that I do believe apply to conduct of public officials. ... I can
speak as to myself, but I am not trying to speak as to those
circumstances that might involve Mr. Meese.''
   In an interview with reporters, Sessions refused to address
Meese's legal problems specifically. But he did respond in general
terms about the importance of the public perceiving that law
enforcement officials uphold the highest legal and ethical
standards.
   Independent counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese's
ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline
and other matters Sources familiar with the probe say McKay is
expected to issue a report raising several ethical questions about
the attorney general's ties to longtime friend E. Robert Wallach,
who is under indictment in the Wedtech case.
   Sessions said it would be ``pure speculation'' for him to
address whether Meese's legal problems have contributed to a
general feeling among Americans that they can pick and choose the
laws they obey.
   But the FBI director added:
   ``I don't have any question in my mind that it's very important
to put leaders, particularly those who are related to the import of
the law, to be generally perceived by the American public as being
people who do abide by the law that they seek to enforce.''
   ``In the area of the (FBI) bureau itself, it's extremely
important ... that we are like Caesar's wife, above reproach,''
Sessions continued.
   ``I read the newspapers, I see the television and I know the
attack he (Meese) is generally under,'' the FBI director said.
   ``But until such time as there is a procedure that tells me that
he is in violation of the law, that is, a charge with criminal
offenses,'' it would be ``pure speculation'' to address whether the
attorney general has contributed to a loss of respect for law by
the public.
   Asked about the prospect of ethical questions being raised about
Meese's activities short of indictment, Sessions said that
``ethical conduct in connection with lawyers particularly is a very
sensitive matter.''
   ``I think it's even more important when you're dealing with a
person who is, in fact, the attorney general of the United States,
and I think that Mr. Meese would strongly agree with that,'' the
FBI director added.
   After checking with Meese about Sessions' remarks, Justice
Department spokesman Terry Eastland declined to comment.
   Sessions, a U.S. District Court judge in Texas before coming to
Washington, has been on the job about six months.
   He said the bureau has not launched an investigation of graffiti
written on Justice Department walls in recent weeks apparently
aimed at Meese. One inscription near the attorney general's office
said ``resign.'' Another said ``sleazy.'' It is a crime to deface
government property.

<HEAD>U.S. Criticizes Jordanian Press Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Thursday criticized
Jordan's expulsion of an American television reporter and the
removal of press credentials from two Jordanian reporters.
   ``We're strongly opposed to penalties imposed on journalists for
what they write and report,'' said State Department spokesman
Charles Redman.
   Redman said ``it's particularly disturbing to the U.S.
government when an American reporter is expelled from a friendly
country for what he's reported.''
   Jordan last week expelled NBC correspondent Rick Davis, citing
``dissatisfaction' with his coverage of the country and its ruler,
King Hussein.
   This week Jordan withdrew the press credentials of two
Jordanians who write for overseas publications.
   ``We have expressed our strong opposition to Mr. Davis'
expulsion and our deep concern over restrictions against
journalists in general. We're continuing to make these points to
the Jordanian authorities,'' Redman said.

<HEAD>House Votes to Use Military to End Narcotics Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reflecting what one lawmaker called
election-year concerns, the House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to
order President Reagan to use the nation's military might to end
drug smuggling.
   The 385-23 tally approved a proposal by conservative Republicans
directing Reagan to ``deploy equipment and personnel of the Armed
Forces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of United States
borders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics.''
   But even supporters of the measure admitted it is a long way
from becoming law. ``Yes, it is flawed,'' said Rep. Jack Davis,
R-Ill.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said before the vote, ``Of course it will pass easily.
In an election year, it won't even be close. Drugs is an issue.''
   The proposal was attached as an amendment to the bill
authorizing defense spending of $299 billion for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1.
   The House passed similar anti-drug amendments in 1985 and 1986
on the same bill, but the provisions were later dropped by the
House-Senate conference committees that reconciled the House bills
with Senate-passed versions.
   No such anti-drug proposals, which are opposed by the Pentagon,
are part of the Senate bill that will be on the floor of that
chamber starting next week.
   In other action, the House voted to spend $600 million for
research into the single-warhead Midgetman nuclear-tipped missile
and only $100 million for the rail-based version of the MX missile.
   The anti-drug proposal came when Aspin sought House approval to
increase spending by $350 million for the Coast Guard, which has
reduced anti-drug patrols by 55 percent because of budget problems.
   The money would be used to pay for more Coast Guard patrols,
along with buying six more patrol helicopters, six patrol boats and
a pair of radar aircraft to track smugglers.
   But Davis and other Republicans raised the total to $475
million. They also added an amendment ordering Reagan to have
military equipment and personnel seal the U.S. borders against drug
traffickers.
   ``Such equipment and personnel shall be used to locate, pursue
and seize such vessels and aircraft and to arrest their crews,''
the measure said.
   Davis said, ``The problem is that our southern borders are just
a sieve of cocaine and heroin coming over unchallenged every night.
We want to bring the front lines into this battle against this
poison coming across our borders.''
   Rep. Tommy Robinson, D-Ark., said, ``It's time to use the armed
forces to stop the drug cartel.''
   Aspin argued that the proposal should be considered in separate
anti-drug legislation now being prepared. ``We do not want to deal
with this problem on a piecemeal basis,'' he said.
   But Davis didn't want to talk technicalities. ``Americans aren't
going to understand what we're doing here. America only wants this
amendment to be adopted. They want the military involved in
stopping drug traffic,'' he said.
   The decision on the nuclear-tipped missiles was a blow to the
Pentagon, which is seeking to develop a railroad version of the
10-warhead MX and wants to eliminate the Midgetman.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., termed the MX rail plan a ``mobile
Chernobyl,'' referring to the 1985 accident at a Soviet nuclear
power plant.
   Reagan had sought $793 million for the MX plan and only $200
million for the Midgetman. The pending Senate legislation proposes
$700 million for the rail-based MX and $50 million for Midgetman.
   By a 233-171 margin, the House decided to spend only $100
million for the rail-based MX and $600 million for the Midgetman.
   Earlier, the chamber voted down, 309-100, a plan to halt all
Midgetman spending; rejected, 265-143, another amendment to
eliminate all money for the rail-based MX; and defeated, 247-156, a
third proposal to give $650 million to the MX and $350 million for
Midgetman.
   The dispute involves the future of America's land-based
missiles, which are part of the nation's nuclear ``triad'' that
also includes submarine-launched missiles and bombers.
   The Minuteman is now the heart of the land-based force, but
Reagan, after a long fight, has won approval of Congress to build
50 MX weapons for deployment in land-based silos. He wanted 50 more
and the Air Force is studying a plan to build 25 trains and put two
MX missiles on each.
   By contrast, tenative plans for the Midgetman call for building
up to 500 of the weapons, which supporters say would make it more
difficult for the Soviets to attack.

<HEAD>Supplies Of Red Meat And Poultry At Record Levels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Record supplies of red meat and poultry for
the sixth straight year are expected to bite into the financial
returns of livestock producers in 1988, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   Although that is not good news for producers, the huge supplies
will help hold down meat and poultry prices at the retail level.
   ``Reduced beef supplies are being more than offset by increased
volumes of pork and poultry,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said. ``Feed costs are rising due to expanding exports,
increased domestic use and reduced production.''
   Poultry output is being led by an expected 5 percent increase in
broiler production, with most of the increase coming in the first
half of the year.
   Commercial pork production rose 7 percent from a year earlier in
the first quarter of 1988, reflecting a gradual increase by hog
producers. Production is expected to be up 10 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, 8 percent in the third, and about even
in the fourth.
   ``Returns to (hog) producers may fall to near break-even before
the third quarter ends,'' the agency reported. ``And negative
rekturns are possible in the fall.''
   Beef production will likely rise above year-earlier levels in
the second quarter because of more feedlot cattle going to
slaughter at heavier weights.
   ``Returns above cash costs for cow-calf producers are expected
to remain positive in 1988, but returns to Great Plains cattle
feeders may turn negative during the late spring and summer,'' the
report said.

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old man accused of setting a 1984
rooming-house fire that killed 15 because he was jealous of a
tenant pleaded innocent Thursday.
   James Carver of Ipswich, whose arraignment was held up about 15
minutes after he broke down in tears, was ordered held on bail of
$1 million bond by Salem Superior Court Judge Peter Brady. He was
charged with 15 counts of second-degree murder and one count of
arson in the July 4, 1984, fire at the Elliott Chambers rooming
house in Beverly.
   Carver was arrested Wednesday night in Ipswich as he drove from
a drugstore with his wife, MaryJane, 21, and their 6-week-old baby,
Kaitlyn, who reportedly suffers from serious health problems.
   Essex County District Attorney Kevin Burke said Carver
apparently was jealous that his then-fiancee was dating a tenant of
the rooming house. Burke said the man was one of the victims of the
blaze but declined to identify him or the former fiancee.
   Burke said Carver had been a suspect during the entire four-year
investigation by Beverly and state police, becoming the principal
target last year after a person claimed that Carver had admitted
setting the fire. Burke would not identify that person.
   Carver was identified in an April 21 police line-up in Danvers
ordered by an Essex County grand jury, Burke said. Several
witnesses had reported seeing him outside the rooming house around
the time of the fire, the prosecutor said.
   But defense attorney Dennis Jackson said in court Thursday that
Carver's parents have told police their son was ill and asleep at
their Danvers home the morning of the fire.
   The fire, the worst in Beverly's history, raged out of control
for more than two hours in the rundown, frame building. It trapped
six people in their rooms and killed others while they tried to
break down a locked exit. One man leapt from a third-story window
to his death.
   One of the victims was an 8-year-old boy who was visiting his
grandfather. Six of the dead were so badly charred they could be
identified only through dental records and jewelry found on their
bodies.
   The blaze in the three-story rooming house, which had no
sprinklers, prompted calls by state lawmakers for tougher fire
prevention codes.
   Essex County Assistant District Attorney Robert Wiener, who is
prosecuting the case, said Carver allegedly lit a pile of
gasoline-soaked newspapers in a doorway on the first floor of the
rooming house.
   Carver, who suffers from mild epilepsy and ulcers, was led from
the courtroom in tears after he lost composure during reading of
the third murder count. He returned about 15 minutes later.
   If convicted, Carver faces a mandatory life sentence for each
second-degree murder count and up to 20 years for the arson charge.
   A pre-trial hearing wass scheduled for May 23.

part-time director of a Harvard program to spruce up public places,
according to tax documents made public Thursday.
   Mrs. Dukakis' earnings accounted for nearly one-fifth of the
total 1987 joint income of $108,957 she and her husband reported.
   Mrs. Dukakis was the founder in 1985 of the Program on Public
Space Partnerships, a department of Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School Of Government that tries to bring together business,
government and neighbors in cooperative projects to spruce up the
appearance of public places.
   As director, she draws a half-time salary of $20,000 annually.
   According to Renee Robin, the program's executive director, Mrs.
Dukakis approached Kennedy School Dean Graham Allison in 1985,
expressing her ``long-standing conern over the deteriorating
condition of public spaces in Massachusetts, ranging from downtown
plazas to larger conservation areas.''
   The department was established late in 1986, and Mrs. Dukakis
earned $2,500 from the job in that year.
   Robin said the program's goal is a combination of demonstration
projects and research, with a special interest in long-term
maintenance strategies that will prevent future cycles of vandalism
and neglect. The program is funded by grants from corporate and
philanthropic foundations.
   Examples of the program's work include Winthrop Park near the
heart of Harvard Square, a pocket park in Boston near the
Massachusetts College of Art and Government Center in suburban
Malden.

   A blind lawyer who was arrested for
refusing to change seats on an airplane at National Airport outside
Washington said Thursday the charges against her are being dropped.
   The Virginia state president of the National Federation of the
Blind hailed the action as a victory, but said the case
demonstrates the need for better enforcement of a law prohibiting
airlines from discriminating against the disabled.
   Peggy Pinder, 35, practices law in Grinnell, Iowa, but was
visiting Washington on Republican Party business when the incident
occurred March 31 on a Midway Airlines jet. She was charged in
Arlington County with criminal trespassing when she refused to
change seats on a flight that was designated ``open seating.''
   Pinder said that she had found a seat she liked on the plane and
saw no reason to move. She didn't leave until police came and took
her away.
   ``My attorney told me the charges were being dropped,'' Ms.
Pinder said in a telephone interview from Iowa.
   ``Our policy states that disabled passengers are to be placed
near the floor-level emergency exit,'' said Sandra Allen, director
of corporate communications for the Chicago-based Midway Airlines.
   ``Our position is that this isn't the end of it,'' said Charles
Brown, Virginia president of the blind federation.
   ``The issue is institutionalized prejudice,'' he said. ``The
airlines get away with it.''
   Ms. Pinder said the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 was intended
to solve the seating problem, but because it did not, the blind
have sought stronger legislation. A bill pending in Congress would
bar air carriers from using visual acuity or a passenger's use of a
white cane or guide dog as the basis of seating.

<HEAD>US Accuses Managua Of Intimidating Political Opposition</HEAD>

   The Reagan administration accused Nicaragua's
Marxist-led government Thursday of ``systematic moves ... to
undermine the peace process and intimidate its political
opposition.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented on reports from
Managua that police detained opposition leaders, suspended two
radio stations from broadcasting and closed one station for 24
hours.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, also said he was concerned
that the Contras have wound up on the losing side of an unbalanced
equation in the peace talks. He promised to send a message to
Nicaragua warning against moves to snuff out remaining Contra
opposition.
   In a meeting with Contra leader Adolfo Calero, rebel military
commander Enrique Bermudez and other members of the Contra
political directorate, Wright promised to signal ``that the
majority in the Congress would not look with favor at all on any
return or resort to military engagement,'' and hoped instead for
good-faith negotiations.
   Wright also said he had asked the State Department's Agency for
International Development, which is administering a $48 million aid
package for the rebels and for children injured in the war, to get
the aid flowing quickly.
   ``A near miracle happened at Esquipulas,'' the town in Guatemala
where the original regional peace accord was signed last Aug. 7,
the House leader said. ``A near miracle happened March 23 at
Sapoa,'' when the two sides agreed to a 60-day cease-fire. ``Let's
work for the third miracle.''
   In sharply critical remarks at the White House, Fitzwater said
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had ``once again held his true
colors high, showing that he has little intention of supporting a
free press, of allowing democratic dissent or making the reforms
called for by the Guatemala City peace plan.''
   ``This intimidation of the media and political opposition can
only be a further hindrance to the peace process,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Managua, spokesmen for opposition parties said that police
detained more than 25 opposition leaders for about two hours after
they gathered to support workers on a hunger strike.
   On Tuesday, the Nicaraguan Interior Ministry barred the
privately owned Radio Mundial and the Roman Catholic station Radio
Catolica from broadcasting news for eight days. It also closed
Radio Corporacion for 24 hours for airing ``false news'' about the
strike.
   Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, members of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee met with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Rep.
William Broomfield, R-Mich., said after the meeting, ``There is a
deep concern about the situation that is developing in Nicaragua.''
   ``The Sandinistas are stalling on the negotiations and holding
U.S. aid as hostage,'' Broomfield said. Shultz declined to answer
reporters' questions after the hour-long, closed-door meeting.
   Broomfield said the aid package approved a month ago to
encourage peace talks between the two warring sides ``has really
helped the Sandinistas jeopardize the Contras.''
   ``It seems to me the Democrat leadership has a responsibility to
put pressure on the Sandinistas to carry out the intent of Congress
and supply humanitarian aid,'' he said.
   The Sandinista-Contra cease-fire agreement allows the rebels to
receive humanitarian aid inside Nicaragua. But the only shipments
thus far have been to rebels based on the Honduran side of the
border.
   At a news conference, Contra leader Calero accused the
Sandinistas of trying to force the rebels into a choice between
``hunger and surrender.''
   He said the insurgents refuse to accept that choice and plan to
continue negotiations with the Sandinistas on the basis of the
temporary truce signed six weeks ago.
   But, he said, the rebel forces will not enter the seven
cease-fire zones which have been mutually agreed to ``if there is
no assurance of delivery of the aid which has been approved.''
   The aid of the U.S. government ``has been held as hostage by the
Sandinista government all this time,'' he said.
   Wright said none of the $10 million earmarked to pay expenses of
a Nicaraguan verification commission has been spent and added,
``That's where the thing may have broken down.''
   The commission was formed to monitor the March 23 cease-fire
agreement between the two sides, but negotiation have stalled. The
situation has been complicated by a split in Contra ranks over
negotiating strategy and who is to provide military leadership.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspapers Call for a Broader Debate, Including Stalinists</HEAD>

   Soviet newspapers are challenging the limits of
the Kremlin's policy of greater openness by saying opponents of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms should get also media attention.
   The latest press comments run counter to guidelines issued last
month by Pravda, the Communist Party daily, and show the
uncertainty and varying views on how far the state-run media can go
in the campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness.
   The boldest of the commentators, Moscow News columnist Anatoly
Strelyany, holds that banning dissenting voices will not guarantee
the success of Gorbachev's campaign for ``perestroika,'' or social
and economic change, but could instead make reformers a lot like
their foes.
   ``I'm afraid that the conservatives will be forced to shut up
and go underground,'' Strelyany wrote in the May 1 edition of the
weekly. ``If we seal their lips, we may begin to resemble them, and
imperceptibly to ourselves, to become them.''
   Thursday's Sovietskaya Rossiya daily, in a lengthy article on
glasnost, said limits are necessary in public debate, but that
outright ``taboos'' were not permissible.
   Writer Lev Ovrutsky, interviewed in the latest edition of the
weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta, said: ``A dialogue between proponents
and foes of perestroika is normal in a democratic society.''
   In April, Sovietskaya Rossiya, which like Pravda is an organ of
the Communist Party Central Committee, was forced to knuckle under
after Pravda criticized its decision to print a letter from a
Leningrad teacher who defended dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   Nina Andreyeva lauded the role of Stalin in her country's
history and accused his detractors of subversion and ideological
collusion with Leon Trotsky, Stalin's archfoe.
   Pravda called the March 13 publication of her letter ``an
attempt, little by little, to revise party decisions,'' and said
papers should not print material that criticizes Gorbachev's reform
drive.
   Gorbachev, the Communist Party chief, has condemned the
political terror and repression of Stalin's 29-year reign. Pravda
said Gorbachev's opponents continue to bring praise Stalin because
because they feel more comfortable with his tyrannical ways, or
because it serves their personal interests.
   Pravda added: ``The Soviet press is not a private shop and
Communists writing in the press and editors should be aware of
their responsibility for articles and publications.''
   On April 6, two days after the Pravda attack, Sovietskaya
Rossiya had to eat crow by reprinting the full-page Pravda article.
   The Communist Party daily's criticism and Sovietskaya Rossiya's
backtracking seemed to indicate that glasnost would not extend to
conservative government critics, or to Stalinists at least.
   Moscow News protested, and Sovietskaya Rossiya strongly implied
that conservatives should be allowed freedom of expression.
   ``A Stalinist demands that my lips be sealed (that's what makes
him a Stalinist) and that people listen only to him,'' Strelyany
wrote in Moscow News. ``I don't want his lips to be sealed or mine:
people should be able to listen to both of us.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said that it was ``impermissible that taboos
be laid down that cover shifting opinions and judgments in
general.''
   If that happens, journalist Nikolai Yerofeyev wrote, glasnost
will resemble the heavy-handed censorship of the past.
   ``It will easily put us on the same level with those who only
recently exorcised the spirit of any dissent from literature,
cinema, the theater and newspaper pages,'' the paper said.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya did not mention the dispute caused by the
publication of the pro-Stalin letter, or Pravda's response, but the
majority of its readers would be aware of those incidents and would
regard the Wednesday article as the latest chapter in the debate on
glasnost.

   A television reporter paid two teens to say that
Tawana Brawley was at a birthday party during the time she was
allegedly kidnapped and raped by a white gang, the girl's advisers
charged Thursday.
   And one teen's father said his son never knew Miss Brawley and
had treated the whole television interview as ``a big joke.'' The
boys received between $10 and $100, said the father, Gregory
Fleming Sr.
   The reporter, who was covering the news conference called by
Miss Brawley's advisers, denied the charge but said he reimbursed
one teen-ager $10 for gasoline.
   The dispute was the latest volley of charges and counter-charges
in the highly publicized case that has pitted the black teen-ager
and her family against state prosecutors and other officials.
   Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls disappeared last Nov. 24
and was found four days later, huddled in a trash bag with racial
slurs scrawled on her torso and feces smeared on her body near an
apartment where she used to live.
   She has said she was a victim of a sexual and racial assault
involving up to six white men, one of whom flashed a police-like
badge.
   But the girl's advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys C.
Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, have refused to allow her to appear
before a grand jury investigating the case and have charged
prosecutors with a cover-up.
   Wednesday night, WCBS-TV reported that Miss Brawley was seen at
a birthday party in Newburgh the day before she was found. And the
New York Daily News said Thursday that the girl had run away at
least twice before and had been beaten by her family when she was
found.
   At their news conference, Miss Brawley's advisers accused the
media of ``racist journalism'' and ``journalistic rape.''
   Sharpton labeled the WCBS report ``a media hoax built on the
whims of young kids and the paranoia of some crack addicts in
Newburgh.'' He promised legal action against the station.
   ``I would call it bribery,'' added Mason. ``I would call it
paying for a story. I would think there should be ethics even in
racist journalism.''
   Mike Taibbi, the WCBS reporter who broke the story, said the
only money he paid was for sodas at a fast-food restaurant for the
two teens, and $10 to one of the young men to reimburse him for
gasoline used up driving around during the interview.
   ``We offered no money, and we specifically told them we do not
pay for stories,'' said Taibbi.
   In the WCBS report, an unidentified witness who appeared on
camera with his face concealed said he spoke with Miss Brawley at a
Nov. 27 birthday party in Newburgh for Anthony ``Prune'' Burden.
   He also said that during part of the four-day period when Miss
Brawley claimed she was held captive she spent time with ``a former
boyfriend'' and ``drug dealer,'' identified by WCBS-TV as Jason
``Chico'' Colon.
   A second teen-ager also appeared briefly on the program. Taibbi
said he didn't know his name but assumed that he was the young man
that Fleming said was his son.
   Gregory Fleming Sr. said the mystery witness and his son came
home laughing after they appeared on camera.
   ``It was a big joke to them,'' Fleming told a roomful of
reporters. ``They didn't understand the position they were in. ...
They were taken advantage of by the reporter.''
   Attorney General Robert Abrams, who is the special prosecutor
for the Brawley case, issued a statement saying: ``All aspects of
this case, including reports that Tawana Brawley may have been seen
in Newburgh, are under continuing investigation.''
   The Daily News reported Miss Brawley twice ran away from home,
disappearing for more than 24 hours each time, before last November.
   According to the News, the first incident allegedly occurred
when Tawana was 13 and she spent the night with a teen-age boy
watching television. When the girl was 14, she took off from school
on a Friday afternoon and spent two days in Beacon, smoking
marijuana, drinking beer and partying with a girlfriend and two
men, the report said.
   In each case, her family searched frantically for the girl but
did not report the disappearance to police, the newspaper said,
quoting unidentified friends of the girl. And in each case, the
girl was beaten by her mother when she was found, the paper said.
   The paper quoted Sharpton as saying that he did now know if the
stories of the girl's running away and then being beaten were true,
``but if they did (hit her), it's not abnormal. If anything, it
ways Tawana came from a family who cared. ... It doesn't follow she
fabricated her story.''

<HEAD>Iranian Gunboats Growing in Number and Increasingly Active</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's fleet of armed small boats has
grown and increased its activity since Iran's April 18 clash with
the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf, but observers said Thursday the
purpose of the buildup remains a mystery.
   Gulf-based shipping and salvage officials said commercial
vessels passing through the Strait of Hormuz, the southern gateway
to the gulf, noted more activity by Iranian craft in the last two
days.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``People reporting in say there haven't been any challenges, but
they see a lot of movement by the small boats,'' said one executive.
   In Washington, Pentagon officials also reported an unexplained
increase in numbers and activity of Iran's small boats along the
Hormuz coast this week.
   The fast boats carry weapons ranging from machine guns and
portable rocket-propelled grenades to mounted anti-aircraft cannon.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards use them to attack neutral ships, in
retaliation for Iraqi air raids on Iranian oil tankers.
   Iraq on Thursday claimed its warplanes hit a tanker off Iran as
the week's fourth convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers headed
down the gulf toward Hormuz.
   There was no independent confirmation of the raid, reported by
Baghdad's official news agency. The report, quoting a military
spokesman, was monitored in Cyprus.
   On Tuesday, Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
accused the United States of backing Iraq in the 7{-year-old gulf
war and said Iran would continue its blow-for-blow attacks on
shipping.
   The Pentagon officials, speaking on the condition of not being
identified, said U.S. intelligence monitors were alert for signs
that Iran might challenge Washington's new, get-tough policy which
went into effect on Tuesday.
   The policy permits American warships to intervene in Iranian
attacks on vessels not flying the American flag. Previously the
U.S. vessels were restricted to defending American-flagged ships.
   Iran condemned the change as proof of ``U.S. aggression'' and
promised to avenge last month's clash, in which U.S. forces wrecked
two Iranian oil platforms and sank or disabled six craft.
   Iran's losses included two of its best naval frigates, a
missile-armed patrol boat and three Swedish-built Boghammar Marin
speedboats.
   The U.S. action was in retaliation for Iran's laying of mines,
one of which damaged the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts on April 14
and wounded 10 crew men.
   Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed. Two Marine Corps pilots
died when their AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost, evidently
to hostile fire.
   Pentagon officials said they were monitoring an increase in the
number of small gunboats at Bandar Abbas, Iran's main naval base,
overlooking the strait.
   One source said the fleet had grown in the last two days to
about 100 from a normal level of ``several dozen.''
   The officials said U.S. intelligence analysts were ``not overly
excited'' by the buildup, but the reason for it was not known.
   They said it was too early to conclude that Iran was planning a
large-scale move to test the new U.S. policy. Depite its losses,
Iran's naval force is still potent, according to military analysts.
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said during a visit to Manama that ``there are a number of
threats that the Iranian navy still represents.''
   Iran has about ten large ships _ not all of them seaworthy _ 10
fast patrol boats and a variety of other craft. The lost Boghammars
were only a small fraction of hundreds of high-speed armed boats.
   Iran said three days ago that its patrol boats in the Hormuz had
resumed challenging commercial vessels, in search of war-related
cargo for Iraq.
   Iran also claimed that an American warship stopped an Iranian
cargo ship, Iran Mehrab, on Tuesday and questioned its crew.
   U.S. officials in Manama were not available to comment on that
claim.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
said the incident ``proves Washington's intentions to expand its
aggression in the Gulf.''
   The United States now has 17 warships in the gulf, including a
missile cruiser, two destroyers and four missile frigates.
   The convoy sailing southward included the 79,999-ton oil
products tankers Chesapeake City and Ocean City. The voyage began a
day after another convoy arrived at Kuwait.

   The Middle Ages have gotten a bad rap,
and the approximately 2,000 medieval scholars meeting here are
trying to improve the era's image and promote it as an avenue of
study.
   The 23rd International Congress on Medieval Studies convened
Wednesday at Western Michigan University, which has one of the
oldest medieval studies programs in the country and holds the event
each year.
   ``It is very much a distortion to look at the Middle Ages as the
Dark Ages _ full of misery and ignorance,'' said Otto Grundler,
director of Western's Medieval Institute. ``This was a period of
enormous creativity and advancement in all fields.''
   The first conference was held in 1962, one year after the
institute was established, as a way to bring scholars in the field
together and present their current research, Grundler said.
   For the first few years, it was a regional meeting with about
150 participants. Now, more than 2,000 professors and graduate
students representing 23 countries attend the four-day conference,
Grundler said.
   Research is presented on nearly 100 subjects, ranging from
medieval magic and medicine to family relationships in the Middle
Ages, considered the period of European history from 476 A.D. to
1450 A.D., ending with the Renaissance.
   ``There are a lot of academic conferences where historians talk
to historians, and people in Old English talk to people in Old
English, but here we talk across the boundaries of disciplines,''
Grundler said.
   ``You can't understand the social history of the Middle Ages
without understanding its political history, or the economic
conditions without knowing church history,'' he said. ``The whole
field of medieval studies represents one of the best examples of
the need for general knowledge and a broad-based education.''
   Western's program has graduated 50 students with master's
degrees in medieval studies, and Grundler said he's seen a dramatic
increase in interest in the program.
   ``Students get all kinds of romantic notions about the medieval
period through movies and books, and after taking a course simply
become fascinated,'' he said.
   Grundler said many students who earn master's degrees in the
program later get their doctorates and go into teaching.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs $13.3 Billion Foreign Aid Bill With Few Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee, with relatively little
dispute, approved a $13.3 billion foreign aid bill Thursday for the
year beginning Oct. 1, largely continuing current programs.
   The Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee adopted the
measure on a voice vote at the end of a closed-door drafting
session. It represents about a 2 percent increase over last year's
aid spending level, and now goes to the full Appropriations
Committee, which is trying to expedite passage of its 13 individual
spending measures this year.
   ``It's a spare bill,'' said chairman David Obey, D-Wis. ``But it
addresses the most urgent needs we have.'' Obey said the
administration generally supported the measure, the passage of
which was eased by agreement on a spending ceiling in last year's
budget agreement between Congress and the White House.
   As usual, the lion's share of aid will go to Israel, which is
guaranteed $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in
economic help. Egypt ranks a close second, with $1.3 billion in
military assistance and $815 million in economic aid.
   Pakistan, which has served as a conduit for U.S. aid to the
rebels fighting the Soviet army in neighboring Afghanistan, would
receive $220 million in economic aid and $240 million in forgiven
loans for purchase of military goods.
   Another $124 million in economic aid and $125 million in
military aid was earmarked for the Philippines, and $90 million in
economic support and another $655 million in economic development
money would be used for African countries.
   In Central America, Honduras would get $85 million in economic
aid, Costa Rica $90 million, El Salvador $185 million and Guatemala
$80 million. Military aid for those and other countries was not
earmarked, but would come out of separate military aid and credit
accounts.
   The bill also would give economic aid of $40 million to
Portugal; $20 million to Morocco; $10 million to Tunisia; $15
million to Cyprus; between $10 million and $35 million for Ireland;
and $2 million for Poland's Solidarity trade union.
   Some $34 million would be set aside for Middle East development
projects, of which $11 million is for projects in Jordan and $23
million for those in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.
   The bill also would allocate $150 million to the Peace Corps,
$101 million for international narcotics control, $362 million for
migration and refugee assistance, $35 million for the prevention of
AIDS worldwide and $254 million to pay past-due debts of
international financial institutions.
   It would send $217 million to support a long list of United
Nations organizations, and stipulate that the money for UNICEF must
be obligated within 30 days of passage of the bill, or the
administration would suffer an automatic cut of $50 million in
money for military aid.

   A day after a state lawmaker turned up two
phantom workers in the Treasury Department, Treasurer Robert Bowman
announced Thursday that he was firing the ghostly bureaucrats.
   Bowman said the practice of signing phony names on letters to
taxpayers had worked well for years, but he no longer could defend
the policy because it hurt the agency's credibility with the public.
   ``Today at three o'clock we received the resignation of Scott
Shepard and Susan, Sally, what was the other one's name, Susan
Stadler?'' Bowman told reporters at a whimsical press briefing in
his conference room.
   ``I had a hard time defending to myself why we do it,'' Bowman
said, noting that the policy began about 1981, two years before he
took office.
   State Rep. Mat Dunaskiss had called a news conference Wednesday
to complain that a constituent received warning letters signed by
Treasury Department employees Susan Sadler and Scott Shepard,
neither of whom exist.
   Bowman, who said he first learned of policy two weeks ago,
originally defended it Wednesday as a way to speed up the handling
of taxpayer calls.
   On Thursday, he explained: ``The problem we've run into in the
past is they've (taxpayers) asked for the person who signed the
letter and the supervisor's not there ... that's when they start
playing telephone tag. They want to talk to the person who signed
the letter. We're hopeful we will be able to overcome that.''
   Reporters had been told they would be attending a ``funeral''
for the two ghost employees, and Dunaskiss got into the spirit,
playfully presenting Bowman with a bouquet of flowers.
   ``Your sensitivity as always to these employees is
overwhelming,'' Bowman said with a laugh. ``I greatly appreciate
that. We will send it on to their respective families.''
   On a more serious note, Dunaskiss said he was pleased the policy
was dropped quickly. He had described it as ``a serious breach of
public trust.''
   He handed reporters a picture of a tombstone with an inscription
reading: ``Here lies Susan & Scott. We thought they were, but they
were not. We hope they eternally rest in peace and taxpayers
harassment will finally cease.''
   Bowman said it's common for consumer-oriented businesses across
the nation to use the phony names to speed up service, but said he
also realized the state should behave differently.
   ``We were not trying to dodge taxpayers. To the contrary, we
were serving taxpayers well. But I just couldn't dodge the
accountability angle. Because if Scott Shepard does exist, people
ought to be able to come here and see Scott Shepard,'' he said.
   Bowman said he didn't know how many phony names his department
used during the past eight years.
   From now on, all taxpayer letters will be signed by the division
supervisors with a note on the bottom for callers to ask for a
specific division, Bowman said.
   Dunaskiss said the treasury department wasn't the first in
Michigan to be found to have ``ghost'' employees.
   ``People were shocked a few months ago when a ghost named Fred
Johnson surfaced in the Department of Natural Resources. Now we've
found ghosts in the area of tax collection,'' Dunaskiss had said
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commisssion acted
Thursday to reduce the opportunity for insider trading by
authorizing brief trading halts across domestic markets when
important news affecting a specific stock is pending.
   The commission, by a 3-2 vote, voted to give the National
Association of Securities Dealers authority to ban over-the-counter
trading in exchange-listed stocks, a practice called ``third market
trading.''
   Currently, when the New York Stock Exchange or another exchange
halts trading because of a pending announcement, the NASD can bar
its member firms from using the association's automated systems to
offer quotes on the stock.
   However, it cannot bar brokerage firms from making a private
market while exchange trading is halted.
   Some firms, such as Jeffries & Co., have been willing to act as
an intermediary for professional traders who want to buy and sell
stock before announcements of takeovers, major contracts and other
news.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, in supporting the proposal, said it
would reduce the opportunity for insider trading. He also said he
was troubled by the current arrangement, which appears to favor
professionals with more access to market information over small
investors.
   Any perception that professional investors are being given an
advantage will harm efforts to encourage small investors, rattled
by the October stock market crash, to return to the market.
   The action was opposed by commissioners Charles C. Cox and
Joseph A. Grundfest, who argued that it would unnecessarily
restrict the freedom of the market.
   Grundfest said stock holders have a right to reduce their risk
by selling stock before an announcement and that a trader willing
to take on the risk had a right to buy. He said the rights of small
investors would not necessarily be enhanced by restricting
professional traders.
   Cox said he has seen no evidence that small investors have been
harmed by their inability to take part in ``third market trading.''
   He said insider trading is rarely caused by the ability to trade
a few minutes before a news release. ``You can always prevent
insider trading by preventing trading, but obviously we are not
going that far,'' he said.
   Joining Ruder were commissioners Aulana L. Peters and Edward H.
Fleischman. They acknowledged that expanding trading halts could
impinge on the freedom of the market, but they said that concern
was outweighed by the need to protect investors.
   In another matter, the commission voted 5-0 to ask Congress for
authority to issue subpoenas and take testimony on behalf of
securities regulators and foreign governments.
   As part of an international effort to combat insider trading and
other securities fraud, the SEC is asking foreign governments to
assist the United States in pursuing evidence of violations. The
SEC needs additional authority from Congress to reciprocate.
   The SEC and regulators in the Canadian provinces of Ontario,
Quebec and British Columbia signed a cooperation agreement in
January. Ruder has said he is pursuing cooperation pacts with Japan
and Great Britain.

   A helicopter plucked office workers from the
roof of Calfornia's tallest building as fire gutted four floors of
the 62-story First Interstate Bank Tower and left one person dead
and 40 injured early Thursday.
   Damage was estimated at $450 million, making the blaze the worst
high-rise fire in Los Angeles history, fire officails said.
   A sprinkler system was being installed in the 859-foot
skyscraper but was not quite complete.
   ``It looked like Dante's Inferno,'' fire Capt. Steve Varney
said. ``Everything that was burnable, burned down. It was just
metal and that was red hot.''
   A small but undetermined number of people were working in the
office tower when the blaze broke out about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.
During the workday the building is occupied by 3,500 people.
   ``It could have been a `Towering Inferno.' It could have been
worse,'' said City Councilman John Ferraro. The 1974 movie ``The
Towering Inferno'' depicted a Los Angeles office building fire.
   Some workers fled down stairs in thick smoke. Others fled to the
roof as the fire roiled around the 12th through 15th floors and
rained glass and flaming debris on downtown streets.
   Four helicopters with searchlights swooped around the rooftop,
and one helicopter lifted 10 people to safety, officers said.
   ``We came out and we couldn't see anything but smoke,'' said
Radmila Radich, a cleaning woman who escaped.
   Firefighters wearing air tanks had to lug hoses down stairs from
the roof and up from the ground to attack the flames. Some air
tanks ran out, and firefighters had to do without them, said Fire
Chief Donald Manning.
   ``They had 2,000-degree temperatures they were fighting,''
Manning said of the 300 firefighters. ``The individuals in there
were committed so far in on the fire that they would run out of
air, they could not back out. They had to stay there and fight that
fire or they knew, as they told me, they were gonna die.''
   ``This had a potential of killing a lot of my people,'' Manning
said.
   Damage was estimated at a preliminary $450 million, said Fire
Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation, said fire Cmdr.
Donald Anthony.
   If a sprinkler system had been operating, ``it would probably
would have contained the fire to a very small area,'' Anthony said.
   A preliminary inspection indicated the structural framework
remained sound, said Frank Kroker, an official of the Department of
Building and Safety.
   A cleaning supervisor, Zora Imamovic, said that while she and
five others made their way from the 58th floor to the roof to be
flown to safety, she heard a man calling for help over her two-way
radio.
   ``One of the men was saying `Car 33' (a freight elevator) was in
flames and he was screaming `Please help!,''' she said.
   The badly burned body of janitor Alexander Handy, 22, of
Palmdale was found in an elevator stuck on the 12th floor, said
county coroner's spokesman Steve Stewart.
   Thirty-seven maintenance workers and three firefighters were
treated for burns or smoke inhalation, but no one was hospitalized,
officials said.
   The fire was declared under control 3{ hours after it was
reported. Two survivors weren't brought down from the 37th floor
until about dawn.
   The skyscraper had no sprinkler system because it was built in
1973, before fire codes required sprinklers, Manning said. Workers
were installing a $3.5 million system after the bank voluntarily
decided to do so.
   William Siart, chairman and president of First Interstate Bank,
said the system was 90 percent installed.
   Art Devine, chief of management in the building department, said
he will meet with the Fire Department to determine whether City
Council should be asked to revise the code.
   Workers were told by radio stations to remain at home Thursday,
but some were too curious to stay away.
   ``When I got to the corner and I saw the firefighters, I said,
`Oh my God,''' said Claudia Gonzalez, 26, a trust administration
specialist. ``I'm still counting the floors. I could have been
there,'' said the 11th-floor worker.
   First Interstate has assets of $58.5 billion and is the nation's
eighth largest banking company with 44 banks and offices in 19
states. The fire is not expected to affect customers, said
spokesman John Popovich.
   Operations on the gutted floors included foreign exchange
trading, corporate loan administration, personal trusts, economics,
advertising and public affairs.
   The bank keeps backup copies of customer records, but
correspondence and some other files were lost, Popovich said. Most
of the computers that control checking and savings accounts and
other business are in a building six blocks away, he said.

   Weary strikers in the shipyard where the
short life of free unionism began roused themselves to chant
``There is no freedom without Solidarity!'' Hundreds of riot police
ringing the yard listened impassively.
   The workers began Thursday morning to prepare for an assault by
police, after riot squads stormed the Nowa Huta steel mill in
southern Poland, ending a 10-day-old strike. Their only question
was when.
   Lech Walesa said he would be the last to leave as the deadlock
continued into the night in this Baltic port. He is the shipyard
worker who built a fledgling strike in August 1980 into a movement
that brought down a government and won him the 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize.
   After withdrawing a blockade of the huge Lenin shipyard for a
few hours early Thursday, police returned in force before 9 a.m.
and put it under virtual siege.
   Officers diverted traffic several blocks from the main gate and
a cordon of riot police prevented entry to the plant. Strikers in
Poland occupy the place they work rather than leaving it.
   Security forces patrolled the streets of Gdansk, which are lined
with solid brown brick buildings and working-class apartment
houses, and they occasionally checked the papers of pedestrians.
Only people living near the yard were allowed through the blockade.
   Dozens of people watched the shipyard scene from their balconies
or windows.
   A huge Solidarity banner hung from the main gate. Dozens of
strikers sat on the gatehouse roof.
   Crowds of several hundred had gathered in front of the main gate
before the blockade, but riot police dispersed them.
   Shouts of ``There is no freedom without Solidarity!'' from
inside the yard could be heard several blocks away.
   Police built a metal fence during the day around the square
outside the gate.
   The square's dominating feature is a huge monument with three
crosses, honoring Baltic Coast workers killed during strikes in
1970 that brought down another Polish government.
   Building it was a promise Walesa made in 1980 and it was
dedicated later that year. Solidarity, the first independent union
in the Soviet bloc, was suppressed and crushed after martial law
was imposed Dec. 13, 1981.
   Dozens of police vehicles were parked about 300 yards from the
gate during the day, so the strikers could see them clearly.
   Management refused to meet with the strikers, who gradually
became convinced a raid was imminent unless they gave up. Walesa
told them: ``I'll be the last to leave.''
   The blockade appeared to relax somewhat by late afternoon.
Regular police withdrew, leaving only the riot officers, and most
of their vehicles moved out of view.

<HEAD>Orchestra Heading for Soviet Union for 10 Days of `Symphonic
Summitry'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Philharmonic will travel to the
Soviet Union in late May for 10 days of ``symphonic summitry''
coinciding with President Reagan's summit talks with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, orchestra and Soviet officials announced
Thursday.
   The orchestra will be performing in Leningrad while Reagan and
Gorbachev are meeting in Moscow, and neither leader was expected to
attend a concert during their five-day summit, officials said.
   The philharmonic, making its first Soviet tour with music
director Zubin Mehta and only the third in its 146-year history,
will travel to Moscow for a series of concerts starting June 4, two
days after the Reagan-Gorbachev talks officially end.
   Albert K. Webster, managing director of the orchestra, said he
told Soviet officials the tour would be an exercise in ``symphonic
summitry'' but they did not comprehend his meaning. ``The idea is
totally untranslatable in Russian,'' he said.
   At a news conference in an oak-paneled, chandeliered salon of
the Soviet Embassy, cultural attache Alexander Potemkin hailed the
philharmonic tour as an important event in the U.S. and Soviet
cultural exchanges that have proliferated since the first
Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in 1985.
   ``I assure you the Soviet public is awaiting you with great
interest,'' Potemkin told Mehta.
   The Soviet attache said plans are being arranged for a U.S. tour
by the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra starting next October.
   The climax of the philharmonic's seven performances in Leningrad
and Moscow from May 28 to June 9 will be a joint final concert with
the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra in Moscow's famed Gorky Park on
June 8.
   Mehta will lead the combined orchestras in Hector Berlioz's
rousing ``Symphonie Fantastique,'' and will share the baton with
Soviet conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who will lead the players
in Dmitri Shostakovich's 5th Symphony.
   The philharmonic also will present the world premiere of a
``Symbolon,'' a work which the orchestra commissioned for the tour
from Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer Ellen Taaffe Zwilich.
   Mehta told reporters he did not anticipate any difficulty
communicating with Soviet musicians in rehearsal even though he
doesn't speak their language, because musical notations are
traditionally written and spoken in Italian.
   ``Piu forte (louder) is understood by every musician in the
world,'' Mehta said.
   The philharmonic tour, arranged at the invitation of the Soviet
Ministry of Culture, is the first since 1976 when it was led by
Erich Leinsdorf and Thomas Schippers. The first Soviet tour took
place in 1959 under Leonard Bernstein and Schippers.
   ``I believe it has been too long since the New York Philharmonic
has been in the Soviet Union and in contact with the great musical
community there,'' said Stephen Stamas, the philharmonic president.
   Mehta said he has taken the philharmonic on tours around the
world in his 10 years as music director, but never to the Soviet
Union. ``The last cultural vacuum in my life will be filled,'' he
said.
   The tour is sponsored by The Coca-Cola Co., Combustion
Engineering Inc. and RJR Nabisco Inc.

   A Jewish settler trying to
drive Palestinian shepherds away shot one of them to death Thursday
and seriously wounded another, according to Israel radio and Arab
reports.
   In Jerusalem, plainclothes police arrested Mubarak Awad, an
Arab-American who advocates non-violent resistance to Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The radio said the shooting incident began when an Israeli woman
saw several Arab shepherds in a field between Turmus Aiya, a West
Bank village 17 miles northeast of Jerusalem, and the Jewish
settlement of Shillo.
   She called other settlers, the Arabs responded with stones and
``one of the settlers opened fire, apparently on the
stone-throwers, killing one and wounding another,'' the radio said.
   A reporter for the Al Quds newspaper in Arab east Jerusalem said
Jewish settlers tried to drive Arabs out of fields in which they
were working near Shillo. He said the dead man, Jude Abdallah Awad,
28, was shot in the head and Rizik Abu Naim, 29, was wounded in the
right eye when he tried to help Awad.
   About 18 plainclothes police arrived at Awad's house at
midnight, his wife Nancy Nye told The Associated Press. She said
the agents would not identify themselves and had no orders for the
arrest, but her husband was taken to Jerusalem police headquarters.
   Last year, Israeli authorities confiscated Awad's identity card
and said he would be expelled, but the order was not carried out.
   Awad, 44, has homes in Jerusalem and in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Many
elements of his strategy of non-violent resistance have been
adopted by Palestinian activists during the five months of
rebellion in the occupied territories.
   Earlier Thursday, Israeli troops shouting orders through
megaphones told all West Bank merchants to close for three days or
their shop doors would be welded shut.
   The army ordered the ban on commerce to punish Arabs in the West
Bank for a one-day strike Wednesday called by Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Many strikes have swept the occupied lands since Dec. 8, when a
rebellion against Israeli occupation began among their 1.5 million
Palestinian residents. Israel captured the territories from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Near Beita village, where a teen-age Jewish settler was slain
last month, hundreds of Jewish settlers trudged along a mountain
path Thursday waving Israeli flags. They chanted ``Expel the
Arabs!''
   In the Gaza Strip, troops fired tear gas at 150 children who set
tires ablaze and raised the Palestinian flag to protest the army's
closing of Arab schools. The youths chanted ``PLO yes, Israel no!''
Soldiers shot and lightly wounded a 15-year-old Arab in the Gaza
town of Khan Yunis, Israel radio said.
   Hundreds of Arabs have been wounded in the five months of
violence and at least 184 have been killed. Two Israelis were slain
_ the teen-ager, Tirza Porat, and a soldier.
   Police in Jerusalem detained Elias M. Zananiri, managing editor
of the Palestine Press Service and the weekly Al Awdah's
Arabic-language edition. Rafi Levy, the police spokesman, said
Zananiri would be held at least 48 hours for investigation on
charges of inciting to riot.
   Israeli authorities have closed the Arab-run press agency and Al
Awdah, which also has an English edition.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the Palestinians have scored
a media victory with their rebellion, but said violence would not
help them.
   ``I don't deny that people have demonstrated courage, threw
stones and achieved a media victory,'' he said. ``But where it
leads to? What will happen tomorrow, in a month, in two months?
Nothing.''
   In Jericho, the army shut down the West Bank's largest vegetable
market, and stores were ordered shut in Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem,
Hebron and Bethlehem.
   In Nablus, soldiers built roadblocks and prevented Arab taxis
and buses from leaving the city, to punish residents for adhering
to Wednesday's work stoppage.
   Businessman Saed Kenaan of Nablus said the army action was
intended to create dissension between Palestinians and the
underground leaders who order the strikes.
   During a four-hour march Thursday, about 1,000 settlers, many
with rifles slung over their shoulders, retraced the route planned
by teen-age hikers involved in a bloody clash in the Arab village
April 6. Miss Porat, 15, and two Palestinians were killed.
   ``We want to finish what we started 30 days ago,'' said Menachem
Ilan, one of two armed escorts with the hikers last month. ``We
intend to show people everywhere that the nation of Israel can walk
freely in every part of the land of Israel.''
   ``I'm proud to do it again, but it feels like a nightmare,''
said 15-year-old Ariel Avivi, one of 16 teen-agers on the April
hike.
   An army investigation concluded that Miss Porat was accidentally
shot to death by the other guard. Jewish settlers have said the
Arabs caused her death by stoning the teen-agers.

   A freed French hostage said Thursday he shared a
cell with Terry Anderson, the 40-year-old American journalist who
has been held longer than any other foreign captive in Lebanon.
   Asked by a French television reporter how he felt, Marcel
Fontaine replied: ``We survived. I passed the time playing dominoes
and chess with my cellmate.'' Asked who his companion was, Fontaine
replied, ``The American, Terry Anderson.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   His sister, Peggy Say, said she was encouraged by the releases.
She said she planned to ask the French hostages ``what Terry is
thinking and dreaming about, what his hopes are, how he's
surviving.''
   Mrs. Say spoke with the AP by telephone from her home in
Batavia, N.Y.
   Fontaine, Marcel Carton and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann were
abducted in 1985. They were released Wednesday and arrived in Paris
on Thursday.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Izvestia photographer was killed and another
seriously wounded by a grenade attack on the military convoy in
which they were riding in Afghanistan, Soviet media reported
Thursday.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, published front-page
photographs of Alexander Sekretarev, 29, who was killed in the
attack Wednesday, and his wounded colleague Sergei Sevruk. The
headline on an accompanying article was: ``While Fulfilling
Professional Responsibility.''
   The newspaper and a Tass news agency report said others were
killed or wounded in the ambush three miles north of Kabul, the
capital of Afghanistan, but it did not say how many.
   ``Grief from Afghanistan has visited many a home in our
country,'' Izvestia said.
   Tass said Sekretarev was killed when three armored personnel
carriers came under fire from a grenade launcher in a vineyard
along the road to the Salang tunnel, which runs under the Hindu
Kush mountain range.
   Anti-communist rebels have fought the Soviet-backed government
since a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces
entered the country in December 1979.
   About 115,000 Soviet soldiers now are in Afghanistan, but the
Kremlin has agreed to pull them out in nine months beginning May 15.
   Izvestia said Sekretarev was sent to Afghanistan two weeks ago
to report on the withdrawal.
   ``His memory will be preserved in the photos which he took and
transmitted to the editorial office,'' Tass said.
   The convoy probably was one of the military units preparing to
leave, since the route out of Afghanistan for the Soviets is
through the Salang tunnel.
   Western diplomats based in Kabul told reporters who have been
there in the past few weeks that rebels plan to attack Soviet
convoys leaving the country.

   A Namibian rebel leader said Thursday the
United States should support independence for his homeland without
regard to the presence of Cuban troops in neighboring Angola.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the South West Africa People's
Organization, met with senior U.S. officials on Thursday and called
on the United States to pressure ``the racist South African
regime'' into granting independence and black majority rule to
Namibia, Africa's last colony.
   Nujoma visited the State Department after talks earlier this
week in London with officials from the United States, South Africa,
Angola and Cuba.
   Among the issues they discussed was the situation in Namibia,
where Nujoma's forces have fought South African colonial rule for
more than two decades.
   The United States and South Africa believe independence for
Namibia should be linked to the withdrawal of the more than 40,000
Cuban troops from Angola.
   ``We hope the U.S. will not continue to insist on linking
Namibia's independence with the withdrawal of Cuban troops,''
Nujoma said, reaffirming a long-standing position, after his
meeting with Michael Armacost, the State Department's third ranking
official.
   ``We don't want that linkage. SWAPO disagrees with that
linkage,'' he said, adding that SWAPO is ready to sign a cease-fire
with South Africa.
   Nujoma said he wants immediate implementation of a U.N. Security
Council resolution that sets down procedures for a transition to an
independent government in Namibia.
   South Africa would benefit from an independent Namibia, he said,
because the war is a drain on South African resources and the
occupation army has been suffering numerous casualties.
   While supporting independence for Namibia, the United States has
been wary of SWAPO because it has received Soviet backing for
years. Nujoma expressed hope that the ``atmosphere of
reconciliation'' between the United States and the Soviet Union
will speed the independence process in Namibia.

   A U.S. attorney who formerly ran the Justice
Department's narcotics division announced through an aide Thursday
he is being considered as head of the department's criminal
division.
   On Wednesday, an administration source speaking on condition of
anonymity said that Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia, was the choice of Attorney General Edwin Meese III to
fill the position.
   If approved, Dennis would be the highest-ranking black
appointment in the Justice Department during Meese's tenure. Meese
has been faulted for a dearth of appointments of blacks and women.
   First Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Lee confirmed that Dennis
is under consideration but declined further comment pending a
formal decision. Dennis was in meetings with the Justice Department
on Thursday, Lee said.
   The source on Wednesday said that Dennis is apparently the only
name Meese has submitted to the White House for the position. A
background check is under way.
   Dennis, 43, has built a reputation during his five years as
United States Attorney through a vigorous prosecution of political
corruption.
   Dennis would fill a vacancy created by the resignation of
Assistant Attorney General William Weld, chief of the criminal
division.
   Also forwarded to the White House was the name of Harold G.
Christensen of Salt Lake City for the job of deputy attorney
general. Christensen, 67, is a partner in the firm of Snow,
Christensen & Martineau.
   Weld and Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns resigned March 29
out of concern that Meese's continued tenure at Justice despite a
nearly yearlong criminal investigation hurt the department's
operation. Several top level Justice Department posts have been
left vacant.
   The two vacancies at the top have been an embarrassment for
Meese and the Reagan administration. Other candidates for the jobs
have rejected the offers or have withdrawn their names after
damaging disclosures about their personal lives.
   Republican Senate aides have said privately that anyone Meese
nominates for the vacant top posts in Justice may have a difficult
time being confirmed, but one such aide said Dennis might have a
better chance because he is a career Justice Department employee.
   Weld said Wednesday that Dennis ``is an outstanding'' U.S.
attorney and ``would be on my short list for any top job at the
Justice Department.''
   ``My understanding is that the attorney general has met and
talked'' to Dennis ``and the attorney general thinks very highly of
him,'' said Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland.
   Any announcement on who will fill the criminal division post
``is a matter for the White House'' to decide, said Eastland.
   Weld said Dennis did an excellent job running the narcotics
section in the criminal division before taking the post in
Philadelphia in 1983. Dennis also has moved aggressively against
organized crime, he said.
   ``I cannot say enough good things about him,'' he said.
   Dennis attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He
worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania's Eastern
District. In 1980, he became chief of the Justice Department's
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Division.
   When he took over the Philadelphia office, an investigation of
police corruption had just started. Dennis set out to crack the
``code of silence'' that prevented police officers from testifying
against each other.
   After a four-year investigation, his office won more than 25
convictions, ranging from patrolman to deputy commissioner.
   In his most notable case, Dennis personally won convictions
against reputed mob boss Nicodemo Scarfo; City Councilman Leland
Beloff, and Beloff's chief aide on charges of trying to extort $1
million from a developer.
   Scarfo was sentenced to 14 years in prison.

   An overcrowded motor launch rammed
several floating logs and sank in the central Philippines on
Thursday and at least 15 people drowned, the Coast Guard said.
   Forty-eight others were rescued and a search was under way
between Leyte and Samar islands for more survivors, officials said.
   The 20-ton, wooden-hulled launch ``He-Man'' was approaching the
town of Lawa-an on Samar Island when it rammed floating logs and
broke up at 8 a.m. (8 p.m. Wednesday EDT), a Coast Guard report
said.
   It had left the port of Tacloban on neighboring Leyte Island
seven hours earlier with an undetermined number of passengers, the
report said.
   The sinking occurred 100 miles northeast of Cebu City and 365
miles southeast of Manila.
   Lt. Cmdr. Edgardo Duarte, chief of staff of the Coast Guard
regional office in Cebu City, said he has ordered an investigation
because the vessel was a cargo boat authorized to carry no more
than 11 passengers and a crew of nine.
   He said five of the confirmed fatalities were children and the
rest were women.
   A Coast Guard officer who spoke on condition he was not
identified speculated that up to 100 people may have been aboard
the vessel, trying to attend Lawa-an's town fiesta Thursday.

   Production of a fuel component for the
space shuttle and military rockets was halted Thursday after a
blast destroyed one plant and a defense contractor closed the only
other plant making the compound.
   NASA and Pentagon officials said the accident should not
immediately affect the shuttle or military programs such as the MX
missile.
   However, Morton Thiokol Inc., a prime contractor on the shuttle,
said the blast Wednesday that leveled a Pacific Engineering and
Production Co. plant near Henderson could delay production of
shuttle booster rockets.
   The earthquake-force blast killed two people and injured more
than 250, four critically. The plant manufactured ammonium
perchlorate, which is used in solid rocket fuel for the shuttle and
the MX, Titan and Minuteman missiles.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. of Oklahoma City on Thursday shut down
production of ammonium perchlorate at its plant in Henderson, a
mile from the Pacific plant.
   The contractor said it wanted to determine what went wrong at
the Pacific plant and assess the minor damage that the Kerr-McGee
Henderson plant sustained from the blast's concussion, including a
damaged wall and broken windows.
   Kerr-McGee officials would not say when the plant would reopen.
   ``We're just being absolutely certain there's no problem,''
Kerr-McGee spokesman Paul Reed said in a telephone interview from
Oklahoma City. ``If we've got any doubt there's a joker in the
deck, we would take another look.''
   ``At this point we have no idea how it happened,'' said M.P.
Grotheer, director of process technology at Kerr-McGee.
   Grotheer said the Army Armament and Research Development Command
tested ammonium perchlorate in 1982 and found the compound ``is not
explosive per se.''
   The tests mixed the compound with blasting caps, black powders
and matches, and although the mixtures would burn, they would not
explode, he said.
   Pentagon officials said Thiokol has a two-year supply of
ammonium perchlorate. They said Pacific produced about 60 percent
of the ammonium perchlorate needed for the shuttle, with Kerr-McGee
producing the rest.
   Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said the Defense Department might
claim all of the ammonium perchlorate produced at the Kerr-McGee
plant for missiles.
   ``If the Pacific Engineering plant is down for an indefinite
period of time, there could be delays in our production,'' Raab
said.
   A Pentagon official on Thursday said it was too soon to say if
the military would monopolize Keer-McGee's production of ammonium
perchlorate.
   NASA officials have said that solid-fuel boosters have been made
already for the next five shuttle launches, including the planned
late August launch of Discovery, the first shuttle mission since
the Challenger accident.

   Rain fell from the Carolinas to New Jersey and Pennsylvania on
Thursday, and a strengthening storm over Nevada and California
generated strong winds over the Southwest.
   Sunshine prevailed over the Gulf Coast, the central Plains, the
Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.
   Rain was heavy in parts of the East, with Altoona, Pa., and
Quantico Military Corps Air Station, Va., receiving more than a
half-inch in the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT. Many other cities
received a quarter to a half inch.
   Thunderstorms produced marble-size hall over interior North
Carolina.
   The rain kept temperatures in the 50s to low 60s from North
Carolina to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but temperatures climbed
into the upper 70s in northern New England, northeastern New York
and northern Midwest states.
   Caribou, Maine, reported 77 degrees at 3 p.m. EDT and Duluth,
Minn., set a record high for the day of 78 degrees.
   The Southwest storm whipped winds across southeast Idaho and
western Utah, and from southern portions of California and Nevada
to Arizona. Winds gusted to 43 mph at Pocatello, Idaho, and 45 mph
gusts were recorded at Milford, Utah.
   A high wind warning was posted for the southwest valleys of
Utah, southern Nevada, parts of southern California and all of
Arizona.
   Temperatures varied widely in the southwest, with Palm Springs,
Calif., reporting 68 degrees at 3 p.m. EDT and Tucson, Ariz.,
hitting 87.
   Scattered thunderstorms hit parts of New Mexico and were
expected to develop across much of the rest of the western third of
the nation.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 34 degrees at Mammoth
Lakes, Calif., to 91 degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for the
western Plains across to the Northwest and parts of California.
Windy conditions were expected for the northern and central Plains
and central and southern Rockies. Rain was predicted from New
England and the Middle Atlantic states to North Carolina.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s in coastal New England,
western Pennsylvania and the Pacific Northwest; and in the 80s in
Florida, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Great Plains, southern
New Mexico and southeast Arizona. Highs were predicted to be in the
60s and 70s elsewhere.

   ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' the most
popular movie of all time, will be released in video come fall with
a mammoth advertising campaign.
   Pepsico and MCA announced the promotional effort Thursday at a
Universal Studios sound stage decorated to look like a wooded scene
from the 1982 movie.
   The videocassette will be released Oct. 27 at a retail price of
$24.95, said Gene F. Giaquinto, president of MCA Home Entertainment
Group.
   Pepsi Cola will support the release with a series of TV
commercials featuring ``E.T.'' and by offering a $5 rebate on the
video's purchase, said Roger Enrico, president of Pepsi Cola World
Wide Beverages.
   Enrico said Pepsi will have ``E.T.'' displays in more than
60,000 stores and sponsor a sweepstakes giving away more than
100,000 copies of the video.
   Giaquinto said the two companies will spend $25 million
promoting the release.
   Steven Spielberg's movie tells the story of an endearing little
alien who is marooned on earth and befriended by children. They
protect him from government agents looking for him and help him
return to his world.
   The worldwide box office for the movie is estimated at nearly
$500 million.
   Giaquinto said MCA is taking unprecedented security steps to
ensure that customers receive a legitimate copy, not a counterfeit.
He did not say what those steps would be.
   MCA, Pepsi and Spielberg's company will contribute some of the
proceeds of the video sale to the Special Olympics for the mentally
retarded.

   A Syrian businessman involved in efforts to free
the last French hostages in Lebanon said Thursday that France
finished repaying a $1-billion-dollar Iranian loan in order to free
the men.
   ``It was paid back in three installments, the last one just very
recently,'' Omran Adham said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``This is my information from the French, Syrians and
Iranians.''
   Adham, 41, a commodities trader with a Syrian diplomatic
passport, was expelled from France Tuesday night and is staying at
a Geneva hotel.
   He said he was certain the French government offered
``compensation for the kidnappers,'' although he had no proof.
   ``There were presents for everybody,'' he said, declining to
elaborate.
   Reports in Paris and Beirut said that in exchange for the
release of Marcel Carton, Marcel Fontaine and Jean-Paul Kauffmann,
France agreed to repay the outstanding balance on a loan originally
totaling $1 billion made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
The French government froze payments after the 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran.
   Radio France Internationale, citing diplomatic sources, said two
payments had been made and the French government will sign a check
for $400 million in the next few days.
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua vigorously denied Thursday that
France paid a ransom.
   Adham said French President Francois Mitterrand asked him to
mediate in March 1986, and gave him a letter for President Hafez
Assad of Syria.
   Adham said he contacted Assad about 10 times in two years and
asked the Syrian leader to pass messages to Iran, which was
believed to have influence over the kidnappers.
   Adham said he most recently traveled to Damascus, the Syrian
capital, on March 9 as part of an official French delegation
including negotiator Jean-Charles Marchiani, Pasqua's personal
representative.
   Prior to his expulsion, Adham lived in Paris for 11 years with
his French wife and four children.
   He charged Prime Minister Jacques Chirac ordered him to leave in
order to monopolize credit for the release of the three hostages,
held since 1985. Chirac is a candidate for the French presidency in
a runoff election on Sunday.
   In Paris, Arab diplomatic and French government sources have
said that Pasqua, who is close to Chirac, was annoyed by Adham's
statements to the media about an imminent release of the three
hostages just before the first round of the presidential elections
April 24.
   Adham said the French government wanted to ``divert all credit
from me.'' ``They are seeking maximum advantage from the hostage
affair. They knew on Tuesday that the liberation was nearly at
hand,'' he said.
   He said he drew no material benefit from his missions.
   ``I don't need the French government financially because I have
good business all over the world. I can live wherever I want,'' he
added.
   But he said lawyers are challenging the expulsion and he expects
to return to Paris.

<TEXT>
   A bank-robber who shot and wounded himself when
police cornered him was identified Thursday as the courteous Dapper
Bandit who baffled authorities for a decade with dozens of smoothly
executed hold-ups.
   Mark Ervin Reeves, 34, was held on $500,000 bail on an
aggravated robbery charge in a hold-up Wednesday of a bank, police
Capt. John Holt said.
   Reeves, who shot himself in the neck as police surrounded his
car at a stoplight a half-hour after the robbery, was in critical
condition in Humana Hospital Medical City Dallas, spokeswoman Linda
Henry said.
   Holt said Reeves is the Dapper Bandit, the well-dressed,
well-groomed robber with a meticulous knowledge of banking
procedures. The Dapper Bandit has been blamed for 25 robberies,
most in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
   Other state and federal charges are being considered against
Reeves because of evidence, including surveillance-camera
photographs, linking him to a number of other holdups, Holt said.
   ``We have photographs from virtually all of those'' 25
robberies, Holt said.
   ``First of all, he's very good. Second of all, he's very
lucky,'' Holt said of the Dapper Bandit's ability to elude capture.
``He planned well, he executed well and he was well-disguised''
with wigs and false moustaches.
   ``We and the FBI naturally are very relieved,'' he added.
   Officers who searched Reeves' expensive apartment found weapons
taken from bank security guards _ the Dapper Bandit's method was
always to disarm any guards before robbing the bank _ as well as
explosives, police said.
   The Dallas Morning News quoted an unidentified woman Thursday
who said she had dated Reeves for two years. She described him as a
gun-toting cocaine abuser who lived like a playboy and had no
apparent source of income.
   He raced cars professionally in the Southwest and maintained an
apartment in a Dallas complex that charged between $525 and $900
per month, she said.
   Police caught up with Reeves at an intersection Wednesday,
recognizing his car as matching the one used in other Dapper
crimes, Holt said. Reeves shot himself as police shouted at him to
drop the gun, witnesses said.
   An undisclosed amount of money was recovered from a briefcase in
the car, and a handheld police monitor, wig and false moustache
were also found, police said.

   Three Frenchmen freed by pro-Iranian kidnappers in
Beirut came home Friday to a jubilant nation and families that had
awaited the day for three years. Premier Jacques Chirac hinted that
France might restore diplomatic relations with Tehran.
   Diplomats Marcel Carton, 62, Marcel Fontaine, 45, and journalist
Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, arrived at the military airport of
Villacoublay outside Paris in a government jet.
   Iran said its intervention brought about the release of the
three. Tehran Television, monitored in Cyrpus, quoted Ali Reza
Moayyeri, a deputy prime minister for political affairs, as saying
Iran interceded ``for humanitarian reasons.''
   French goverment officials denied they paid ransom for the
hostages' release. Comment abroad, however, ranged from dubious to
scathing. Complaints from Britain and elsewhere accused France of
dealing with terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage.
   Fontaine said his cellmate was Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   ``We survived,'' he told a reporter from French television's
Channel 5. ``I passed the time playing dominoes and chess with my
cellmate.''
   Asked who his companion was, Fontaine replied, ``The American,
Terry Anderson.''
   Anderson, 40, is the longest held of the remaining hostages. He
was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Carton, Fontaine and Kauffmann appeared ashen and shaky as they
walked slowly down the airplane steps on arrival in Paris.
   Kauffmann drew back uncertainly when his 13-year-old son,
Alexander, approached him. Then, when he recognized him, Kauffmann
expressed delight at how much the boy had grown.
   Alexander's eyes filled with tears as he put his hands on his
father's shoulders and looked him at him silently.
   ``As we all know, the liberation of our hostages falls into the
framework of our relations with Iran,'' said Chirac, who greeted
the men at the airport. ``It's the authorities in Tehran who
intervened with the captors so that they would free our
countrymen.''
   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations July 17 after an
Iranian Embassy employee, Wahid Gordji, refused to submit to
questioning about bombings in Paris in September 1986. Gordji was
allowed to leave Paris two days after two French hostages were
freed in Beirut.
   ``It's an incredible day,'' Kauffmann told reporters. ``But it's
also a day which remains overshadowed because we are just three.''
   The journalist for the weekly magazine L'Evenement de Jeudi said
earlier that Michel Seurat, the 39-year-old researcher captured
with him on May 22, 1985, probably died of cancer, rather than
having been executed, as claimed by the kidnappers.
   Carton and Fontaine were kidnapped March 22, 1985.
   Kauffman praised Seurat's courage and said Seurat encouraged his
companions during his early days in captivity. ``That he could die,
all alone, after contributing so much, is awful. I cannot forget,''
he said.
   ``I'm a little ashamed to be here today,'' he said, recalling
the other Western hostages, including nine Americans, held in
Lebanon and leading what he called ``that nightmare life.''
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said she was encouraged by the
releases. She said she planned to ask the freed French hostages
``what Terry is thinking and dreaming about, what his hopes are.
How he's surviving.''
   She spoke in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
from her home in Batavia, N.Y.
   The former hostages were taken to the Val-de-Grace military
hospital in southern Paris for two days of observation and were
visited by President Francois Mitterrand.
   At the airport, Chirac thanked a ``friend of France and Iran,''
but provided no details. Political observers said he was referring
to Algeria, which was believed to have played a key role in the
hostage negotiations.
   The premier also thanked Syrian President Hafez Assad and
Lebanese military authorities.
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua supervised the negotiations.
   Reports in Paris and Beirut said that in exchange for the three
Frenchmen, France agreed to pay the outstanding balance on a loan
originally totaling $1 billion made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
   ABC News reported that France's mediator was Iranian businessman
Manucher Ghorbanifar, who was involved in the U.S.
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   The station also said France agreed to repay the rest of the
loan in food and other non-lethal supplies and re-establish
relations with Iran. It said Iran agreed there will be no further
terrorist attacks against France.
   Radio France Internationale, citing unidentified diplomatic
sources, said the French government will sign a check for $400
million in the next few days, the third repayment on the loan. Two
other payments of $330 million and $300 million have already been
made, the radio reported.
   On Nov. 11, 1986, six days before France agreed to the $330
million payment, pro-Iranian extremists released two French
hostages. On Dec. 24, another hostage was released.
   A total of 10 French hostages have been freed since Chirac's
government took office in March 1986.
   The latest release occurred just four days before Chirac's
presidential runoff against Mitterand, a Socialist who was favored
to win a second term.
   In Washington, the Reagan administration said Thursday it hoped
no deals were made for the freedom of the three Frenchmen.
   Asked whether France had paid a ransom, Pasqua said: ``We have
not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone, not a franc, not a
dollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''

   Four little known actresses have been
selected to star in an updated version of the late 1970s hit series
``Charlie's Angels.''
   The four, selected from more than 20,000 interviewed, were
introduced at a news conference Thursday by producer Aaron Spelling
and Fox Broadcasting. They will appear in ``Angels '88'' on the Fox
network.
   The show will not be a sequel of its predecessor, a private-eye
series that ran on ABC from 1976 to 1981 and catapulted Farrah
Fawcett to stardom. There won't be any Charlie, there will be four
Angels instead of three, and one is black.
   ``This is the 1980s and we really wanted a black angel and we
set out to find one. We found so many talented actresses it was a
tough choice,'' said Spelling, creator of the original ``Charlie's
Angels.''
   ``These angels will not report to any man,'' said Spelling.
``The premise is that they're actresses whose show went up against
`The Cosby Show' and was canceled. They stumble upon a case and
solve it.
   ``It's a contemporary show. We'll also see their private lives.
They'll date, we'll get into sex, safe sex, but it's not going to
be sexy. It's action-adventure with a lot of comedy.''
   The four actresses were introduced as Claire Yarlett, a blonde
raised in an English convent; Karen Kopins, a brunette and native
of New York who is appearing on ``Dallas''; Sandra Canning, the
first black Angel, born in the Virgin Islands, and Tea (pronounced
TAY-a) Leoni, who was discovered in Boston and says her previous
``occupation'' was wind-surfing.
   Spelling said he had a commitment from Fox for a two-hour movie
and 13 episodes.
   It is uncertain when the show will go on the air because of the
two-month-old strike by the Writers Guild of America. Spelling said
only the movie pilot has been written.

   Jesse Jackson sharpened his criticism of
the Democratic delegate-selection process Thursday, complaining of
a push for ``coronation'' of rival Michael Duakis.
   ``We must not give the impression by the inflated, padded lead
made by the super delegates and their friends'' that the race is
over, resulting in a feeling among Jackson supporters that ``their
vote does not count,'' he said.
   Jackson complained vigorously about party rules during his 1984
presidential bid but has generally steered clear of such objections
this year.
   He said Thursday he has no intention of formally challenging the
rules as he did in 1984 but expects party leaders to intervene when
the delegate count _ especially among at-large delegates and the
643 ``super delegates'' _ varies widely from the popular vote in
the Democratic primaries.
   ``That's all we're asking for, a matter of good judgment,'' he
said.
   Jackson has won 28 percent of the votes in primaries so far but
is publicly supported by just 46 super delegates. The Massachusetts
governor, meanwhile, has won 37 percent of the votes cast in the
primaries and is supported by 166 super delegates.
   The super delegates were created for this year's campaign
specifically to give the party establishment a significant voice
outside the primary process in choosing the nominee. They are party
leaders and politicians, including governors and members of
Congress, who are delegates to the Democratic National Convention
by virture of the offices they hold.
   Overall, Dukakis has about 1,500 delegates while Jackson has
about 930, according to The Associated Press delegate count.
   Jackson brought up the delegate matter as he ate breakfast with
a Nebraska farm family outside Kearney, and again in talking to
reporters at the airport.
   He said his campaign will contact super delegates and at-large
delegates in congressinal districts where he won and try to
persuade them to follow the voters' choices when they vote at the
party convention this summer.
   ``We'll be making appeals for fairness and we certainly hope
people will respond,` he said.
   Jackson delegate counter Steve Cobble said he and other
officials recognize that the rules do not require delegates to
commit themselves proportionately with the popular vote.
   ``We're saying here's another way they could behave,'' Cobble
said.
   Some states do choose delegates in proportion to the popular
vote. But in Pennsylvania, for example, which does not have such a
system, Jackson got 28 percent of the vote and only 8 percent of
the delegates, Cobble said.
   ``The race is much closer than the pundits and the press
project,'' Jackson said. ``What the people are saying must not be
covered up by all the horse talk of the coronation and `the race is
over.' The race is on,'' he said.
   Jackson said he was not threatening to withhold support from the
party if his wishes are not met, but he also recounted past
elections in which he said Republicans won a embittered Democrats
stayed home.
   He cited the 1980 re-election bid of then-President Carter, who
had been challenged in the primaries by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   After the divisive primary race, many of Kennedy's followers
became ``embittered by the process (and) some had taken an
anybody-but Carter position,'' Jackson said. Carter lost to Ronald
Reagan.
   ``At this point, let's be positive about it. Let's be hopeful
about it. The most positive consequence of being fair is that
people are inspired ... When people are inspired and diligent, they
work diligently,'' Jackson said.
   However, he added that the perception he was being treated
unfairly could keep his supporters away from the polls in November.
``They get discouraged,'' he said.
   Jackson addressed a high school audience in Kearney, a small
rural town of mostly white residents.
   Dressed for the day in blue jeans, a vest and trucker's cap,
Jackson then flew to Albuquerque, N.M., for a rally.
   Talking there with a busload of Hispanic and civic leaders,
Jackson spoke against the idea of making English the national
language, saying that is ``not reaching out, it's pushing out.''
   The movement is strongly opposed by Hispanics.
   He also spoke about immigration affairs, saying U.S. policy
should begin with efforts to help Latin American nations improve
their standards of living.
   Jackson flew from Albuquerque to Los Angeles, where his schedule
included a visit to the city's historic downtown Olivera Street,
traditional hub of Hispanic culture, and a Hollywood fundraiser
later.

<HEAD>French Arrest Canadian Trawler in St. Pierre-Miquelon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian trawler was arrested
Thursday by authorities from the French-held islands of St. Pierre
and Miquelon, which are the subject of a boundary and fishing quota
dispute between Canada and France.
   Tom Rideout, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, said preliminary
reports indicated the trawler was stopped in contested waters about
48 miles from St. Pierre.
   ``If that is the case, both countries have agreed not to arrest
boats in that area and this is a very, very serious matter,''
Rideout said. ``The only motivation I can think of is political _
the French presidential elections.''
   He was referring to the runoff elections this Sunday between
incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand and conservative Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac.
   A French military vessel arrested the trawler, said John Banys,
a federal Fisheries Department official in Ottawa.
   Residents in St. Pierre said the trawler, the Maritimer, fishes
out of Fortune, Newfoundland, and has a crew of five or six. After
the arrest at sea, the trawler was directed into port at St. Pierre
and Miquelon.
   ``I'm outraged by it and I'm sure all Newfoundlanders will be
outraged as well,'' said Richard Cashin, head of the fishermen's
union that represents the crew. ``It's an example of French
arrogance.''
   The incident appeared to be retaliation.
   Last month a trawler from St. Pierre was arrested in Canadian
waters and 21 French citizens on board, including four politicians,
were jailed for fishing illegally. The French government posted
bail of $510,300 (U.S.) to get them released and temporarily
withdrew its ambassador from Ottawa.
   At the heart of the dispute is France's claim of a 200-mile
economic zone around St. Pierre and Miquelon, where the population
of 6,000 relies on fishing and tourism to survive.
   Canada recognizes only a 12-mile French zone around the islands,
whose closest point is just 10 miles from Newfoundland.
   The two countries dispute the international boundary of St.
Pierre and Miquelon, and the share of cod and other fish they can
take from the waters south of Newfoundland. When attempts at a
negotiated settlement failed last year, Canada closed its ports to
all French fishing vessels and banned them from the nearby Gulf of
St. Lawrence.
   Talks resumed last month in Paris and both sides agreed to seek
a neutral mediator.

   Treaty Beer, the brew touted as a
fund-raiser for groups fighting Indian treaty rights, appears to
have flat in Washington state.
   Following negative publicity, cries of racism and a call by Gov.
Booth Gardner for a boycott, sponsors are having trouble finding a
distributor.
   Indian leaders said Thursday they're gratified by the public
reaction against ``this racist product.''
   The key distributor that marketers had planned to use, Lindberg
Distributing Co. of Tacoma, backed out Wednesday. General Manager
Gary Mustain said the controversy was more trouble than it was
worth.
   ``We're not here to champion causes,'' he said. ``We became
involved in a political decision we did not want an part of.''
   Dean Crist, the Minocqua, Wis., man who created the product to
help finance groups fighting Indian treaty rights to fish and game,
said plans to sell in Washington are on hold while sponsors
scramble to find a distributor.
   Crist, who sells the brew in his home state, charged that
distributors are responding to the political pressures whipped up
by the liberal media.
   He added that his news conference in Seattle last week was a
little like ``President Reagan addressing the Iranian press.''
   He denied that his intent was racist and said he wants to help
finance efforts to manage and allocate the fish runs on an equal
basis.
   The governor, church and civic leaders, environmentalists, the
timber industry and Indian rights groups banded together last week
to blast Treaty Beer and urge a boycott.
   Bill Frank Jr., chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries
Commission, on Thursday praised Lindberg's decision not to carry
the beer and the ``groundswell of public support we have received
in rejecting this product.'
   ``It should be obvious to anyone that Indian and non-Indian
relations have come a long way here,'' he said. ``We are building
something very positive together, and confrontation ... is being
left behind. We are setting an example for the entire nation to
learn from.''

   Women in Denmark's armed forces can
now drive tanks and perform other duties once carried out
exclusively by men, the Defense Ministry announced Thursday.
   The decision was based on a study of women's performances in the
army, air force and navy.
   Women have been training and serving alongside men on naval
vessels on an experimental basis for several years. Psychologists
and physicians monitored the experiment and recommended that the
arrangement be made permanent.
   ``After evaluating the reports from the experiments I am
satisfied that the time has come for opening up generally for women
in the armed forces,'' said Defense Minister Bernt Collet.
   The action was in keeping with a government policy of moving
toward full equality in all fields, Collet said in a statement.
   ``In principle, equality applies throughout the military, but a
final decision on allowing women to train as F-16 jet fighter
pilots depends on the results of continuing medical
investigations,'' Collet said..
   So far no country allows servicewomen to fly supersonic F-16s.
   Defense authorities did not say whether women would enter combat
but it appeared they would do so under new policy.
   The minister stressed that admittance and education reqirements
in the military will be the same for men and women.
   ``We cannot compromise with respect to the units' combat
readiness and efficiency,'' the statement said. ``Therefore,
everybody regardless of sex must fulfil requirments set by the
different branches.''

   A 7-year-old with AIDS-related complex
encountered dozens of angry parents Thursday as he joined other
first-graders in class Thursday after months of isolation in a
nearby trailer.
   ``He looked like he was ready to cry,'' Jason Robertson's
mother, Tammie, said after she walked her son to Prather Elementary
School.
   ``They threatened me and my son on the way in and on the way
out,'' she said of the protesters. ``They said playing with Jason
was like playing with a loaded gun.''
   Jason had been the lone student in a trailer on the school
grounds since Nov. 16 and had been tutored at home previously. On
Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James L. Foreman ordered him back in
the classroom in response to a suit by the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Thirty students stayed away from the 750-pupil school because of
Jason, and five more left during the day, said Gilbert Walmsley,
superintendent of the Granite City schools. In Jason's class, 28 of
30 pupils attended.
   Mrs. Robertson said Jason ``said that his day went well and that
he made a lot of friends. The teachers said that they (classmates)
were all fighting over who would get to play with him.''
   The boy, a hemophiliac, apparently became infected with the AIDS
virus through a contaminated blood product, officials said.
   After school, Mrs. Robertson said roughly 40 angry parents met
her and Jason outside, chanting, ``Back to the trailer.'' She said
about 30 children then surrounded her and her son, telling the
crowd, ``Leave him alone.''
   ``The children were wonderful,'' she said.
   The symptoms of AIDS-related complex include swollen lymph
glands, low-grade fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss,
extreme fatigue and chronic diarrhea.
   Twenty percent of patients with ARC will develop AIDS within two
years, scientists say. Researchers do not yet know if the rest of
them will go on to get AIDS after a longer period.

<HEAD>Striking Workers End Fast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 42 striking construction
workers and car mechanics ended their 10-day fast Thursday after
the Sandinista government agreed to negotiations next week, union
leader Alejandro Solarsano said.
   Solarsano, a leader of the General Workers Federation, said the
fast for higher wages was a success because it ``restored dignity
to workers.''
   The group began a hunger strike at federation headquarters on
April 25 to back a strike that began Feb. 25 and is supported by
4,500 workers, according to the union.
   Rolando Velasquez, the federation's secretary of labor relations
and one of the hunger strikers, said the construction workers and
auto mechanics would continue their walkout.
   ``The hunger strike is suspended, but the work stoppage will
continue until the demands of the working class are obtained,'' he
said.
   The federation groups socialist unions. The fast has been a
particular irritation to a leftist government that considers itself
in the vanguard of workers rights.
   Sandinista police diverted traffic from a four-lane highway at
the site of the federation headquarters. The strikers filed out and
were loaded into civilian cars. Some held their arms above their
heads.
   Police barred journalists from approaching and roughly pushed a
TV crew.
   Solarsano said four of the hunger strikers were taken to a
hospital for treatment.
   Labor activist Nilo Salazar said 42 workers took part in the
fast.
   Federation director Carlos Salgado told reporters Thursday the
deteriorating physical condition of the hunger strikers was a
factor in calling off the fast. He said the government cut off
water supplies to federation headquarters and kept relatives from
bringing medical supplies inside.
   Police have detained more than 70 people since the hunger strike
began.
   The Interior Ministry shut down news shows for eight days on two
private radio stations for broadcasting what it said was false
information. A third station was shut down completely for 24 hours
but allowed to reopen Thursday.
   Also on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry said a CIA center based
in neighboring Costa Rica provided false documents to sully the
Nicaraguan government's image.
   ``It has been increasing in direct relation to the negotiation
process'' with Nicaraguan rebels, Alejandro Bendanda, the
ministry's secretary-general, told a news conference.
   He blamed the Reagan administration, saying ``the line is to
prove negotiations have not produced results.''
   The Sandinistas have been trying to work out a definitive
cease-fire agreement with the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras.
An agreement between the two sides was signed March 23, shortly
after the U.S. Congress voted down additional military aid for the
rebels.
   The Contras have fought the Sandinista government since late
1981, two years after it came to power in a revolution that ended
42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty.
   Bendana said the CIA documentation center was in San Jose, the
Costa Rican capital, and was uncovered by an Interior Ministry
investigation. He declined to elaborate.
   He said at least eight false documents surfaced recently and
said they were an attempt to rob the government of credibility.
   In San Jose, a person answering the phone at the Costa Rican
government's Organization of Judicial Investigation said the agency
knew nothing of any such activity. The person refused to give a
name.

   Fire broke out late Thursday in the Capitol
Hill office of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and the blaze
raged unimpeded for 10 minutes due to a lack of fire hoses and
alarms, says a congressman who was one of the first at the scene.
   Two U.S. Capitol Police officers were treated for smoke
inhalation at the scene, but they did not require further medical
attention, said officer Dan Nichols.
   The fire in Wright's second-floor corner office of the Longworth
Building, across the street from the Capitol, was caused by an
electrical problem, said District of Columbia Deputy Fire Chief
Jamelia Jackson. He estimated the damages at $120,000 and said the
offices will need extensive restoration.
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., whose offices are next door to
Wright's, said the fire was able to spread for at least 10 minutes
after it broke out shortly after 6 p.m. because fire hoses which
are supposed to be in emergency cabinets throughout the building
were missing.
   ``I'm totally frustrated by a congressional building that has no
fire alarms and absolutely no fire hoses in the standpipe
cabinets,'' said Weldon, who is a former fire chief.
   ``We'd have had the fire out. We knew where it was, we were in
there, and we just couldn't get to it,'' he told reporters on the
sidewalk outside, his shirt smudged with soot. ``I guarantee you
I'll raise Cain about it the next time we're in session, which I
guess is Monday.''
   The House had adjourned for the weekend a short time before the
fire erupted.
   Weldon said he and some Capitol police officers smelled smoke
and ran to Wright's office, where they found the fire just starting
in a kitchen area and climbing one wall. They tried to use small
dry-chemical fire extinguishers ``which were just no good,'' he
said.
   There is no alarm system in the seven-story building, so guards
had to be sent running down hallways to evacuate congressional
offices, Weldon said. When District of Columbia firefighters
arrived, they had to drag hoses up to the second floor to get water
on the blaze, he added.
   ``And this is supposedly the nation's Capitol. We're going to
have some heads spinning next week,'' Weldon said.
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., was forced onto the sidewalk in the
rain dressed in a tuxedo. A party he had been holding in the
building to pay off a bet on the NCAA basketball tournament had
been interrupted by the fire.
   ``I don't think anybody was upset. A fire is a fire. You gotta
get out,'' Kolbe said. ``Nobody had even gotten any food. We had to
leave all the food there.''
   ``The speaker's office is pretty much burned out. There's a lot
of heat damage,'' said Weldon. ``That whole corner is going to have
to be redone.''
   Wright's primary office as house speaker is in the Capitol
building. The office where the fire occurred primarily handles his
congressional district business.
   Weldon said he had just formed a congressional fire caucus _ a
group of members concerned about fire prevention issues _ three
months ago, ``because America doesn't have a fire policy.''
   He pointed to a rocket-fuel plant explosion in Nevada, a fire in
a Los Angeles high-rise and the Capitol Hill incident _ all in the
past two days _ as ``the best examples you could have'' of the need
for such a policy.

   The state Supreme Court on Thursday allowed
the California Coastal Commission to require an exclusive Los
Angeles club to take an anti-discrimination pledge in exchange for
permission to develop beach property.
   The Jonathan Club admitted its first black and female members
last summer, and said in court papers it does not discriminate in
its membership practices.
   However, the club has refused to comply with a Coastal
Commission requirement of declaring a non-discrimination policy in
order to receive a permit to expand its Santa Monica facilities.
Part of the land the club occupies is leased from the state.
   The Supreme Court refused a hearing on an appeal by the club of
a lower-court ruling in the Coastal Commission's favor.
   However, the high court unanimously withdrew the ruling as a
precedent for other decisions, leaving the scope of the
commission's power unclear.
   Attorney John Shiner said the club had not decided whether to
appeal.
   Deputy Attorney General Anthony Summers, the commission's
lawyer, said club officials publicly stated their policy for the
first time in their court papers.
   ``It seems to me that if they were willing to tell the
commission (the same thing) they would be complying,'' he said.
   ``That misses the point,'' countered Shiner. ``The Coastal
Commission lacks the authority and the jurisdiction to impose a
condition of this sort on any applicant.''
   In his court papers, Shiner said the commission was seeking
``the power to intrude into the private affairs of every citizen of
this state.''
   The case illustrates how ``perfectly well-intentioned persons
who are seeking to remedy a social evil may develop a witchhunt,
vigilante approach,'' Shiner wrote.
   The club wants to build new paddle tennis courts and a parking
lot, all restricted to members only, on 122,000 square feet of
Santa Monica beach property, 58,000 square feet of which are on
lots leased from the state.
   The leases do not contain anti-discrimination clauses. But when
the club applied for a development permit in 1985, the commission
said it would require a written promise not to discriminate against
minorities or women.
   The club refused, saying its membership policies were irrelevant
to the issue. But a Superior Court Judge ruled in the commission's
favor and was upheld in January by a state appeals court.

   Dozens of guerrillas belonging to a
group holding 13 foreigners and Colombians attacked an eastern
border town before dawn Thursday and battled with police for four
hours, officials said.
   One officer was killed and four were wounded in the attack on
Salazar de las Palmas, a town of 15,000, by about 60 members of the
National Liberation Army, police said.
   The guerrillas said in a news release that the hostages,
captured Monday and Tuesday in various Colombian cities, were in no
danger and will be released by week's end with an important
message. The captives include two West Germans, two Swiss men and a
Frenchman.
   In the statement delivered Wednesday at the Medellin home of
West German Honorary Consul Helmut Luecker, one of the captives,
the group said the hostages were held in the ``New Colombia'' camp
in northeastern Colombia.
   The news release, a glossy pamphlet in Spanish, German and
French, was delivered in an envelope with Luecker's car keys. Other
copies were delivered to news media organizations in Bogota and
Bucaramanga.
   The release said European countries ``should make their
positions known about the dirty war that sweeps our country today
and demand that the Colombian government stop the genocidal
practices.'' This was an apparent reference to recent killings of
peasants in several areas of the country, in which 122 people have
been killed in less than two months.
   Police said Thursday they had no clues. They identified the
abducted foreigners as Sigfried Markert and Luecker, the West
German honorary consuls in Bucaramanga and Medellin; Jean
Christophe Rampal, a press attache at the French Embassy in Bogota;
and Richard Aufereggen and Wilfred Lehner, two Swiss nationals
working for the Colombian-Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Bogota.
   The guerrillas were also holding eight Colombians, including
journalists and the president of the Santander State Assembly and
two politicians of that city.
   The news release, signed by Roman Catholic priest Manuel Perez,
head of the guerrilla group, said the purpose of the abductions was
to ``denounce'' that ``the Colombian oligarchy has surrendered the
best of the country, its natural resources and the national
sovereignty to American imperialism.''
   The group says the Colombian government has placed its oil
resources in the hands of U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum, which
has a 15 percent stake in a 2-billion-barrel oil deposit in eastern
Colombia.
   Ecopetrol, the state oil company, owns 60 percent, Anglo-Dutch
Shell Oil, 20 percent and a Spanish company 5 percent.
   In its campaign against foreign oil companies, the guerrillas
have staged 22 attacks against an oil pipeline with a capacity of
215,000 barrels per day. It runs from the Cano Limon fields near
the Venezuelan border to the Caribbean port town of Covenas.

   Riot squads stormed a steel mill in
southern Poland on Thursday on the 10th day of a walkout, but
workers vowed to continue their strike.
   In Gdansk, thousands of police surrounded a shipyard in a tense
standoff with defiant strikers. Solidarity chief Lech Walesa said
he would be the ``last to leave'' if police tried to crush the
strike at the Lenin shipyard in the Baltic port city.
   At the huge Nowa Huta steel mill in Krakow, riot police rousted
sleeping steelworkers, hurled deafening percussion grenades and
rounded up 38 people.
   The government denied there were injuries, but opposition
spokesmen said that strikers were beaten and that at least 32
required treatment, including a man with two broken legs.
   Strikers said a protest against the raid was held on the
steelworks grounds after the police left and many workers refused
to return to their jobs.
   The strike committee, in its first statement after the raid,
called on workers to stay home in protest.
   ``The brutal actions by the ZOMOS (riot police) and the SB
(secret police) did not break our strike,'' the statement said.
   Strike committee sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Andrzej Szewczuwaniec, chairman of the 16-member committee,
escaped along with five other members. The rest were detained.
   At the Lenin shipyard, chants of ``Solidarity! Solidarity!''
could be heard inside the steelyard.
   ``The moment of the solution similar to that at Nowa Huta is
approaching,'' Walesa said in a taped interview smuggled out of the
yard.
   Shortly before midnight, police convoys moved about Gdansk, in
an apparent show of force.
   Hours before, at 6:30 p.m., a note smuggled out of the shipyard
by the strikers said, ``As far as we know, they (the authorities)
are preparing for a police raid.'' It said civil defense troops
were already in the yard and secret police ``functionaries'' were
in the management building.
   As officials cracked down on the two major strikes, other work
stoppages were reported in Poland's worst wave of labor unrest
since the military declared martial law in 1981.
   Strikes and protests were reported among bus drivers in the
northwestern cities of Szczecin and Police, students in Warsaw and
Gdansk, and shipworkers in Gdynia, near Gdansk.
   Riot squads stormed Nowa Huta just one day after Roman Catholic
church mediators had persuaded plant directors to negotiate with
the strikers.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference that the
decision to storm the steel mill was inevitable.
   ``The majority wanted to work ... We must protect our meager
economic potential,'' he said.
   ``This was a normal restoring of order when the law was being
violated,'' he said.
   Recent events proved that Walesa and his followers want to
``evoke crisis and a confrontation,'' Urban said. And the
government ``has not, does not and shall not talk'' with such
people.
   Police entered the strike center in the steelwork's pressing
department at 2 a.m., only hours after the strike committee, which
said it represented 15,000 of the 32,000 employees, was told it
would have its first talks in a week with management.
   The police set off percussion grenades, terrorizing the
``paralyzed, defenseless and sleeping people,'' said Krzystof
Kozlowski, a senior Roman Catholic journalist in Krakow.
   The Rev. Tadeusz Zaleski was with the strikers at the time of
the raid and was turned over to church officials.
   ``The riot police were beating (people) with very long heavy
sticks,'' he said. Some people ``were chased and beaten. The riot
police were very brutal and on many occasions beat people who
already had been caught.''
   Most strike committee members were detained immediately. Later,
special riot police entered and ordered all strikers to leave.
   ``The whole thing took place without one bruise,'' Urban said in
a telephone interview. ``Nobody suffered any harm or injury.''
   But Zygmunt Lenyk, of the conservative opposition group
Confederation of Independent Poland, said 32 people suffered cuts,
eight people were left unconscious and one man had two legs broken.
   The state-run news agency PAP said some plant departments
resumed work Thursday while others remained idle for maintenance.
   But workers emerging from Nowa Huta at Thursday afternoon said
some people inside had resumed striking. PAP reported that
absenteeism at the plant was 30 percent to 40 percent.
   In Gdansk, the area around the Lenin shipyard was cordoned off
by thousands of police. The shipyard went on strike Monday, the
fourth strike since April 25.
   Walesa joined the strikers and has remained in the plant since
Wednesday.
   ``Once again the possibility of logical and necessary solutions
are being ruined,'' Walesa said in the taped statements. ``They are
sinking our country into ruin. This is unnecessary. They are unable
to do it otherwise.''
   He continued: ``It's certainly obvious that I'll be the last to
leave.''
   The strike committee, led by veteran worker Alojzy Szablewski,
issued a communique that the strike was still on.
   The events dominated state-run radio and television newscasts.
   Solidarity, born in a historic strike at the Gdansk shipyard in
August 1980, says its banning 16 months later, after the
introduction of martial law, was unjust and that it wants dialogue
with the authorities.
   Police kept up pressure on opposition activists around the
country. Among those reported detained with Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Wroclaw Solidarity leader Jozef
Pinior and Gdansk area Solidarity activist Andrzej Gwiazda. Phones
to opposition activists were also cut off.

   The United Methodists on Thursday narrowly
voted in favor of a boycott of Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum, parent
company of Shell Oil U.S.A., to protest its business dealings in
racially segregated South Africa.
   On vote of 475 to 418, the denomination's governing body
endorsed a resolution urging Methodists to refrain from buying
Shell products.
   The vote at the 9.6-million member denomination's conference
came after a sharp debate in which several blacks pushed for the
move and two Texas delegates argued against it, saying Shell is
using its influence to end apartheid.
   Numerous Protestant and Catholic groups, below denominational
level, and labor organizations previously have called for such a
boycott, as has the Unitarian Association, a relatively small
denomination.
   In October, the 1.7-million member United Church of Christ
became the first major Protestant denomination to join in urging a
boycott.
   The American subsidiary has emphasized it has no operations in
South Africa and that it and Royal Dutch Shell firmly oppose
apartheid.
   In a statement Thursday, Shell expressed disappointment with the
vote by the nearly 1,000 Methodist delegates, saying those who will
be hardest hit ``are the innocent American service station owners
and jobbers who sell Shell products.''
   Delegates also urged the use of full ``moral and corporate
resources'' to end South Africa's system of racial apartheid, but
stopped short of an outright call for ``complete disengagements of
companies and banks'' doing business there.
   The delegates at the 11-day conference running through Friday
noted that there is disagreement over such methods.
   The boycott is part of a campaign endorsed by such groups as the
United Mine Workers, the AFL-CIO, the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

<TEXT>
   The headline in USA Today could read:
``Proud Prairie People Pounce on Polyester Pundit.''
   In other words, don't mess around with Lincoln residents when it
comes to polyester.
   The polyester wars began Tuesday when USA Today wrote a story
about Cliff's Notes, those yellow-and-black booklets explaining
literary classics that have been a boon to untold legions of high
school and college students. The company that puts out Cliff's
Notes is based in this town of 172,000.
   ``Some might call this birthplace of Cliff's Notes the edge of
nowhere, a city still comfortable with fulsome waistlines and
polyester,'' wrote the reporter, Karen S. Peterson.
   In mock retaliation, Scott Young, co-host of KFOR radio's
morning show, urged Lincolnites to participate in the ``Plethora of
Polyester Pile-Up.'' The plan was to send Peterson pounds and
pounds of polyester.
   The turnout was better than expected, with a little help from
the folks at Goodwill Industries.
   On Thursday, two Goodwill trucks loaded with 5,000 pounds of
baled polyester clothing pulled up to the station. That was added
to the 50 pounds already collected at the station.
   There were polyester shirts, polyester slacks and polyester
leisure suits.
   Lots and lots of leisure suits.
   After checking the cost of shipping more than 2 tons of
polyester to Peterson at USA Today headquarters near Washington,
D.C., Young and company opted to send her a representative sampling
of Lincoln's sartorial ``best.''
   Peterson will soon be the proud owner of a ``beautiful polyester
collage'' of the state, emblazoned with the tourism slogan
``Nebraska, the Good Life,'' Young said.
   ``We're also going to send her some polyester lingerie and some
snappy polyester slacks,'' he said.
   And, of course, a few leisure suits.
   At USA Today on Thursday, the 50 to 60 members of the Life
section, where the story appeared, were decked out in University of
Nebraska red-and-white to greet a film crew from an Omaha
television station.
   Peterson was not in the office Thursday night, but was preparing
to do some radio interview on Friday _ including one with KFOR.
   ``Obviously, we've been following this very closely,'' Tom
McNamara, managing editor of the section, said in a telephone
interview. ``We're more than willing to good-naturedly eat some
crow on this.''
   ``We love Nebraska. We love Lincoln. We're trying to make
amends,'' McNamara said. Then, knowing the way to a Nebraskan's
heart, he added:
   ``The Life department roots every year for Nebraska to beat
Oklahoma.''

   The 55-year-old University of Pittsburgh law professor succeeds
the Rev. Donald S. Nesti, president since 1980, who resigned in
August.
   Murray earned an undergraduate degree at LaSalle University. He
received law degrees from Catholic University of America and the

Pittsburgh since 1986.
   Murray will be the first president who is not a priest in the

   A man apparently angry about being
romantically spurned shot an elderly couple to death in their sleep
Thursday and abducted the woman who had rejected him, authorities
said. He later surrendered without resistance.
   Donald Harry Fultz, 35, of Union City was jailed without bail on
charges of homicide, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, reckless
endangerment, robbery, burglary and simple assault, state police
said.
   Dr. Elvira Mary Love, 69, and her accountant husband, Malcolm
Frank Love, believed to be in his 70s, were killed around 5:20 a.m.
in their home in this northwestern Pennsylvania community, said
Coroner Merle Wood. The woman who spurned Fultz, Josephine Baxter,
had been staying with them, authorities said.
   The crime spree also included the earlier abduction of a family
of four, who were released before the couple were shot, authorities
said. Neither the family members nor the woman who was abducted
later was injured.
   The Loves operated a drug and alcohol treatment clinic out of
their home. They had recently moved to Girard from Union City,
taking the clinic with them, police said.
   Police said Fultz had been a resident of the couple's treatment
center in both communities. Authorities did not know when he last
stayed there, nor whether Ms. Baxter also was a patient at the
clinic.
   State police said Fultz made a statement to police that revealed
the motive for the killings, but they declined to disclose what he
said.
   State police said they first received a complaint late Wednesday
from Paul A. Fultz, 30, of Centerville that his brother Donald had
held a knife to his throat because he wouldn't give him guns.
   About 3 a.m. Thursday, several miles away near Spartansburg,
Donald Fultz entered the home of William Morris, 44, his wife, Dea,
43, and their sons, Robert and William, both 15, police said.
   The intruder forced them to drive him approximately 50 miles to
Girard, where they were released unharmed.
   After the fatal shots were fired, the assailant left in the
Loves' car, holding a gun to the woman's head.
   Robert McClelland, a Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
worker who had heard about the abducted woman on the police radio,
said he spotted Fultz lying on muddy ground in a wooded area along
a highway near Grand Valley while state police officers were
searching nearby.
   ``I could see his leg and shoes'' 35 to 40 yards from the road,
said McClelland, 51. ``I ordered him to stand up and put his hands
above his head.'' Fultz left his gun and his last hostage in the
car, McClelland said, adding that the woman ``was crying and
carrying on'' but was not injured.
   The state troopers took Fultz into custody, McClelland said.
   According to Erie County Court records, Fultz in 1981 was
sentenced to serve from two to five years in a state prison for
aggravated assault and making terroristic threats. Last November,
he was sentenced to six to 12 months in prison for criminal
trespass. He was paroled Jan. 20.

   One of three men who kidnapped
and buried a busload of Chowchilla schoolchildren in 1976 was
denied parole a ninth time Thursday.
   The three-member State Board of Prison Terms panel voted
unanimously to keep Richard Schoenfeld, 33, in Central Men's Prison
here for his role in the abduction of the 26 children and their bus
driver in 1976.
   Alameda County Assistant District Attorney Don Whyte had argued
that continued imprisonment would be a deterrent to others.
   ``I have no doubt in my mind that Mr. Schoenfeld would not
commit an offense like this (if released),'' said Whyte. ``But I'm
not sure there aren't others lurking around who might.''
   The panel agreed Schoenfeld poses an ``unreasonable risk of
danger to society.''
   Schoenfeld, along with his brother James and Frederick N. Woods,
are serving life sentences for abducting the bus at gunpoint from
rural Madera County about 150 miles southeast of San Francisco. The
men shut the victims in a poorly ventilated moving van buried in a
quarry about 100 miles away in Livermore.
   It took the captives 16 hours to dig their way through the
wood-and earth-covered hole to safety.
   Karen Snell, Schoenfeld's attorney, said he will seek parole
again next year.

   Retired Chicago Bears running back
Walter Payton, the all-time career rushing leader of the NFL, says
car racing takes total concentration, skill and finesse _ just like
football does.
   ``Racing is so mental,'' Payton said. ``It's exactly like
football. You have to be concentrating on every down. In racing,
you have to be concentrating on every lap....
   ``When you're out on the track, you're not only competing for a
fast lap, but you're competing against the other guy,'' he said.
``Besides, I love to go fast.''
   Payton, who retired from the NFL after last season, took part in
a driving school at the four-mile Road America sports car racing
course here, and it was his third driving school in six weeks.
   As for the interest in car racing, he told The Milwaukee
Sentinel that was nothing new.
   ``I've always been interested in racing,'' Payton said. ``Ever
since I was a kid and looked under the hood of my dad's car. It's
just the natural thing.
   ``I thought about racing motorcycles about four or five years
ago, but then that was impossible,'' he said. ``About three years
ago, I thought about racing sports cars when I retired from
football.''
   In the training sessions here, he took the classroom studies, as
required, in a Formula Ford.
   During break times, he got some practice in his own Sport 2000
racer.
   Payton said he hopes to return to the Road America course to
compete in the June Sprints, and he can feel his improvement as a
driver.
   ``I'm getting more confidence with the car,'' he said. ``The
trick is to be smooth with the car coming into and leaving the
turns. Anybody can run fast on the straightaways.''

   Police arrested 401 anti-abortion
demonstrators outside a gynecological service Thursday, but the
district attorney said he does not want to prosecute because he
feels they did no wrong.
   ``I do feel very strongly that when one trespasses at an
abortion clinic in a peaceful and non-violent way, they are doing
so to save lives,'' said Nassau County District Attorney Denis
Dillon.
   Dillon said he was asking a Nassau County administrative judge
to appoint a special district attorney to handle the arrests.
   The demonstrators from Operation Rescue were accused of blocking
the entrance to the clinic. They were charged with disorderly
conduct and released, said Officer Peter Lambert, a Nassau County
police spokesman.
   ``You can use the analogy of someone trespassing on private
property to save the life of someone being strangled. The
trespassing becomes relatively unimportant in that case, in my
view,'' Dillon said.
   A federal judge on Wednesday had continued an order prohibiting
Operation Rescue and its director, Randall Terry, from blocking
entrances to abortion clinics.
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward had threatened $25,000-a-day
fines that would be turned over to the National Organization for
Women.
   However, city attorney Lorna Bade Goodman said it was unclear
whether the fines could be levied because Terry apparently had not
been served with the order prior to the protest in this New York
suburb.
   Demonstrations by Operation Rescue on Monday and Tuesday in New
York City resulted in hundreds of arrests.

   A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday
that private unionized employees can't use state privacy laws to
challenge drug testing, allowing random screening to resume at the
San Onofre nuclear power plant.
   The San Onofre workers can fight a company testing program only
by claiming a violation of their contract through National Labor
Relations Board grievance procedures, said the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in a 3-0 decision.
   The court rejected arguments by the 850 workers that the privacy
rights involved in drug testing are so fundamental that they cannot
be negotiated away. Union contracts often authorize employers to
search workers' possessions, the panel noted.
   In the San Onofre case, the union contract did not mention drug
testing, but the company has interpreted it as allowing such a
program.
   The union has asked the NLRB to review the dispute. But in a
case where a contract expressly authorized drug testing,
Wednesday's ruling would appear to leave workers without recourse.
   ``I'm quite dismayed,'' said attorney John True of the
Employment Law Center, a legal aid office whose clients include
workers challenging drug testing.
   The ruling's scope is limited to unionized workers in
California, since non-union workers still could invoke the right to
privacy against a private employer under the state constitution.
   Southern California Edison Co., the operator of San Onofre,
praised the ruling, saying in a statement that ``unannounced
testing is legal and appropriate under the circumstances to protect
the public health and safety.''
   Although the suit had been filed only on behalf of 850 union
members, Edison spokesman Lou Phelps said the company had halted
testing of a total of 2,000 to 3,000 workers, including non-union
employees.

   Communist authorities said they put an end
today to a 10-day strike at the huge Lenin steelworks outside
Krakow. The city's spokesman said security forces were used.
   The government also said management ordered a lock-out today at
the Gdansk shipyard, site of Poland's other major work stoppage,
and at least one national Solidarity leader was reported taken from
his home by police.

   Earthquake-force explosions from a rocket
fuel plant flattened an industrial park, killing one person and
injuring more than 250, and the governor calls it a miracle that
the loss of life was not greater.
   ``This thing could have been much worse,'' Gov. Richard Bryan
said late Wednesday, after midday blasts shattered windows 10 miles
away in Las Vegas and tweaked seismographs 200 miles away.
   The detonations destroyed or severely damaged 12 buildings and
left a smoldering crater 400 feet across at the site of the Pacific
Engineering and Production Co. of Nevada plant and an adjoining

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis and his tenacious rival
Jesse Jackson both plotted strategy for the final push of the
primary season, and readied for a pair of smaller-scale contests
after weeks of big-state battles. Vice President George Bush,
meanwhile, says fear of ``kiss and tell'' books has sometimes kept
him from speaking up in Cabinet meetings.
   Bush said Wednesday that other times he keeps quiet at the
meetings ``because I don't want the president to have to be
choosing between his vice president and the other members of the
Cabinet.''
   Jackson was vowing to press on despite bruising losses to
Dukakis in Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday. Those defeats capped a
six-week losing streak in the primary contests, broken only by
Jackson's victory the same day in the District of Columbia.

   Bishop Eugene A. Marino's appointment as the
nation's first black Roman Catholic archbishop has drawn so much
attention that officials were worried that the solemnity of his
installation mass would be compromised.
   Today's installation mass was set for the 4,580-seat Atlanta
Civic Center, with closed circuit television beamed to expected

   Since Pope John Paul II named the Mississippi-born Marino to

   The acquittal of mob boss Anthony ``Tony''
Salerno on charges he helped rig the elections of Teamster
Presidents Roy Williams and Jackie Presser strikes a crippling blow

   Salerno was convicted Wednesday of racketeering in the

   A federal law enforcement source, speaking on condition of

   The Federal Trade Commission is under orders
from a House panel to investigate whether the tobacco industry is
waging an illegal ``scorched earth'' campaign of economic
retaliation against corporate opponents of smoking.
   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of a House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee, instructed FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver at a

in illegal boycotts, ``whether real or threatened,'' against
businesses that prohibit smoking.
   Luken referred to RJR Nabisco Inc., which fired the advertising

   The White House said Thursday it deplored
Poland's use of violence to squelch the latest outbreak of labor
strikes and suggested the Polish government seek ``a dialogue''
with the Solidarity labor movement.
   Taking note of reports that Polish police on Wednesday used
percussion grenades against strikers to end a 10-day-old walkout at
a Krakow steel mill, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration was ``watching with concern.''
   It was the second such statement in as many days. On Wednesday,
President Reagan said he hoped the government of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski ``will hear the voice of the Polish people _ and that
economic reform and recovery will soon begin.''

   The amnesty program that pulled in more than
1.6 million aliens seeking to live legally in the United States
won't be extended and ``has proceeded very successfully'' despite
not hitting the 2 million mark, the nation's top immigration
official said Thursday.
   ``We'll take our 85-percent batting average on that as quite
good,'' Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Alan
Nelson told a news conference. He said INS officials had been
making a ``rough estimate'' a year ago when they predicted the
program would attract 2 million undocumented residents.
   He said the one-year amnesty application period which ended at
midnight Wednesday would not be prolonged even in the face of two
court rulings. He said the courts ``have both been extremely narrow

   Measurements of historical levels of radioactive
carbon in California's remote Mono Lake suggest that nuclear waste

   ``We think radiocarbon had to be added to that lake in large
quantities,'' said Wallace Broecker of Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y.
   The researchers used various techniques to rule out other
possible sources of radioactive carbon, such as atmospheric testing
of atomic bombs. ``Increases found in other nearby lakes and in the
ocean can be attributed to the bomb testing, but Mono Lake's
increase is far too great for that,'' Broecker said in a telephone

   Women who often complain they feel cold
may not be eating enough iron, say scientists who studied
swimsuit-clad women while they shivered in chilly rooms and sat in
cool water.
   Women who feel cold should ask their doctors to refer them to
laboratories that test blood levels of an iron-carrying protein
called ferritin, a far more accurate indicator of mild iron
deficiency than measurement of hemoglobin, the iron-containing
protein that makes blood red, said physiologist Henry Lukaski.
   Lukaski, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition
Research Center in Grand Forks, N.D., and Pennsylvania State
University nutritionist John L. Beard conducted separate studies
strongly suggesting that women who often feel chilly suffer iron
deficiency.

   Preliminary peace talks this
week marked an unprecedented step toward ending Angola's civil war,
but the warring parties face a daunting task in securing an outcome
that allows them all to save face.
   Since the war began in 1975, the antagonists have been given to
belligerent talk. It will not be easy for them to tone down their
rhetoric if they feel that national honor is at stake.
   South Africa has justified its support of the Angolan rebel
movement UNITA as necessary to thwart a communist onslaught in
southern Africa. Angola's Marxist government, backed by 40,000
Cuban troops and about 1,000 Soviet advisers, has derided UNITA as
a puppet of South Africa's ``racist regime.''

   Throughout the week, investors awaited the
latest report on employment, confident that in these numbers there
would be a signal of where the economy is headed.
   If today's report was strong, it would indicate to investors
that they had better beware of inflation. If inflation arose
wouldn't higher interest rates certainly follow? And wouldn't that
be bad for stocks?
   If employment didn't rise strongly, or if unemployment didn't
shrink, the report might signify resiliency. Investors might view
inflation and higher interest rates as more distant, and that would
be good for the markets.
   But all that concern may be wasted, because employment reports
tell us only where we have been, not where we are going. That, at
least, is how they have been viewed for years and years.
   Why, then, the interest in the job data?
   Because, it seems, the securities markets are looking for any
hard news to give them direction, and the employment report seems
to have been the latest cue available, even if it is not a leading
indicator.
   Latest, however, is not always best or even good, as Albert Cox
Jr. points out. Cox, a former Merrill Lynch economist and now
economic adviser to other firms, points out there are some older
indicators available to investors.
   Some of these indicators have been on record since before the
Oct. 19 debacle in the securities markets. Based on historical
experience, they all remain pertinent. And all of them have
something to say about the 1988 economy.
   The first of these is the index of leading economic indicators,
which has an average lead time, or forecast term, of about 11
months. It reached a peak last August. Thus, it implies a peak in
the economy for around July 1988.
   Stock prices themselves are an indicator. Peaks or valleys in
the market generally are followed by economic change about 10
months later. Stock prices peaked last August; that would indicate
an economic peak this June.
   The length of the manufacturing workweek is another arrow into
the future. On average, it gives about 11 months' notice. It peaked
last October, which suggests the economic expansion will reach its
peak in September.
   Unemployment claims are another leading indicator, giving on
average about 14 months' notice of economic changes to follow. This
indicator also peaked in October, suggesting that the economy
itself will peak this Christmas.
   Changes in housing permits have one of the longest lead times of
any indicator, averaging about 16 months. They peaked way back in
December 1986. If accurate, they indicate the economy is even now
descending from its peak.
   None of these indicators is infallible. All are subject to
various human misconceptions and miscalculations that go into them.
They have failed in the past; they seem to have worked in the past.
They are only indications.
   But, as Cox views them, their arrows all suggest that we are in
what he calls the ``recession zone,'' and that we will remain in
that zone until the fall.
   While acknowledging the direction of the needles, however, he
observes that such indicators are good only as long as they last.
That is, they have meaning until they are made meaningless by new
statistical peaks and valleys.
   So far they have not been made meaningless, except in the eyes
of some investors.
   Oddly, these investors choose to ignore them and instead seize
the latest set of numbers out of Washington _ even if those numbers
tell them where they have been, economically speaking, rather than
where they are headed.

   Mario Van Peebles was an economics student. He
dealt in limited partnerships in films, and worked as a New York
City budget official. But he wanted to be a star, and he went to
his father for help.
   He got advice, nothing more.
   ``I think it was hip that my dad let me do it myself because if
I couldn't, then I shouldn't be here,'' said Van Peebles, star of
NBC-TV's detective-comedy series, ``Sonny Spoon.''
   His father is Melvin Van Peebles, the author-producer-director
who created the controversial movie, ``Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss
Song,'' Broadway's ``Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death'' and
``Waltz of the Stork.''
   The elder Van Peebles never interceded on the behalf of his son,
except to caution, ``Show biz is a business, learn that business
side.''
   So he took the tortuous route to stardom, from Columbia
University to Wall Street to City Hall and finally to Broadway and
Hollywood.
   Following small parts on stage and in the movies, Van Peebles
appeared in the play ``Waltz of the Stork.'' His film appearances
include ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' ``Jaws: The Revenge,'' ``Exterminator
II'' and ``The Cotton Club.'' He also has appeared on ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``L.A. Law'' and the daytime soap opera ``One Life to
Live.''
   Having a famous father helps, Van Peebles said.
   ``But if you don't have the talent to stay there, they'll slam
the door on your foot,'' he said. ``They're not going to give you a
lead in a show based on who your dad is and people are not going to
watch you.''
   Mario Van Peebles was born in Mexico City. He, his father and
mother, Maria, traveled and lived throughout Europe for eight years
before settling in San Francisco. The time in Europe served him
well.
   ``I learned a lot of accents like that,'' he said. ``I speak a
little French, I speak a little Spanish, a little uptown, a little
downtown. It helps me a lot now in my work.''
   His character on ``Sonny Spoon'' is a streetwise detective who
regularly slips into other characters _ a Japanese chef, an old fat
man, a Frenchman, a church woman, an attorney _ to get the job done.
   Van Peebles finds that having the ability to change characters
helped prevent him from being typecast.
   ``When I first came to LA (Los Angeles) people sort of said,
`you're a young (Harry) Belafonte, you're going to play black
leading men' _ which sort of meant unemployment if you missed `A
Soldier's Story,''' he said, referring to the critically acclaimed
film and play.
   The actor decries the lack of film and TV roles for blacks and
other minorities. ``You have to understand _ whatever you look
like, whether you're fat with red hair, you have to deal with that.
... It's hard.
   ``This is the deal. The bottom line is the golden rule: He who
has the gold, rules,'' he said. ``So just get in there, do your own
show and shut up; have a handle on how you're presented if you
can.''
   Van Peebles said blacks have been supportive of ``Sonny Spoons.''
   ``A lot of people have come up to me and said, `Are you worried
because you're doing a show and there's no hour show where a tan
guy like yourself is in the lead?'
   ``Maybe I would feel more pressured if I didn't feel I was
showing a positive image _ or they (black community) didn't seem to
feel it _ or we didn't seem to feel that we were showing a positive
image.
   ``I insisted the cops and villains be mixed (races) so we break
away from this silly color stuff. I want a human show. If I have a
black show, I've lost,'' he said.
   Van Peebles said his ultimate goal is to become a filmmaker. He
is working on a feature film he wrote and co-produced with his
father called ``Identity Crisis.'' He stars and his father directs.
   ``My dad once said you got two loves in your life: who you're
with and what you're doing. I'm working with my dad and people I
love and care about. I'm doing what I like doing,'' Van Peebles
said.
   ``It's funny,'' he said. ``I remember people used to say `the
only reason you got the job is because of your daddy.' And now,
(they say) `the only reason your dad got the job is because of
you.' So it all comes around, you just have to laugh on it on both
sides and do your thing.''

   The actors Yves Montand likes are the kind of
actor he is himself.
   ``I admire Sean Connery very much,'' he said. ``I like Columbo _
Peter Falk. I like this kind of actors who become older but they
don't lose their youth, really. They go on with some charm and are
human beings. They don't destroy themselves with face lifts, which
are terrible.''
   Montand was recently in New York to receive this year's tribute
from the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the 17th person to be
honored and the first Frenchman. His two most recent films are
``Jean de Florette,'' which won the British Film Academy's prize
for best picture, and ``Manon of the Spring.'' In both, he portrays
a farming village patriarch, Cesar Soubeyran.
   ``The reason I didn't want to make the movies was not because I
look 20 years older,'' said the 66-year-old Montand. ``I said, `Let
the years do their job.' It was because I wanted to go on tour.''
   Montand started as a singer, was discovered by the legendary
Edith Piaf, made his first movie with her in 1945 and sang on stage
and made movies until 1968 when he decided to concentrate on film
acting. In 1982, he made a world singing tour which was a smash
success, and planned to repeat in 1984 but made the two movies
instead.
   ``I think it is a very good story, based on a wonderful book
(Marcel Pagnol's `L'Eau des Colines'). But it was courageous to
make this kind of part, contrary to what people wait for from you.
He is a nasty man. He could be very cruel in some ways,'' he said.
   Montand and actress Simone Signoret, who were married from 1950
until her death in 1985, used to read each other's movie scripts.
   ``Sometimes she would say, `You're going to shoot this thing? It
is awful.' I would say, `You're right but I promised this young
director.' Of course the movie is a flop,'' he recalled.
   ``Sometimes you fall in love with a story you're reading. If a
director has good taste, he puts you in his pocket.''
   Montand has advice about getting older: ``Humor, tenderness and
lucidity cannot change and are important in life as you become
older. You need to laugh, have a sense of humor, first of all
against yourself. Everybody needs tenderness. Tenderness cannot
become old. Never. And if you are clear _ this is right, this is
not right _ you stay a young man or woman.
   ``I'm going to look a little pompous now but I say, never, never
stop working with your memory. You remember a girl. What is her
name? You say it isn't important, forget it. No, no. Make the
effort to discover again the name of this girl, even if it is not
important. This is exercise, like for the muscles.''
   For physical exercise, Montand walks four or five miles every
day when he can. ``Sometimes I make a seven or 10-minute dance in
the morning. Then I take a shower and that's it.''
   At the tribute, French filmmaker Louis Malle called Montand
``one of the most romantic figures the French cinema has ever
known.''
   Montand, however, still hasn't figured out romance. ``I
remembered this morning, lying in bed, the first time a girl kissed
me or I kissed her. I didn't like it. Two months later, someone
else comes, you collapse. Both are very nice looking. It's very
peculiar.
   ``When you are an adult, it is a mystery. You love me. I love
you. It's the only thing you can say. You are mad. It's
unbelievable. It's a volcano inside. What does it mean? We can
understand nothing. Death, love, we don't know anything about.
Maybe it's better, I don't know. It's a wonderful mystery anyway,
thank God.''
   During the interview in Montand's suite in Hotel Maxim's, the
telephone rang several times and a Film Society representative
spoke to women who wished to stop by. ``I'm sure it is only for
autographs,'' the actor said with a charming smile.
   Since ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring,'' Montand
has done a few TV appearances. He plans a TV version about Alfred
Dreyfus, the French army officer who was convicted for treason but
later found to be the victim of anti-Semitism. He also plans to do
a movie about terrorists.
   Montand's next movie, though, will be a musical, ``Three Seats
for the 26th,'' directed by Jacques Demy with music by Michel
Legrand, who collaborated on ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.''
   ``I don't want to tell you the story; I want it to be a
surprise,'' he said. ``It will not be a beautiful masterpiece as
made by Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire.''

<HEAD>`New Era' in Tunisia as Pro-Western Bourguiba Slips into Oblivion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Habib Bourguiba's statue still dominates a
square in central Tunis, but the man who towered over Tunisia for
32 years has slipped into oblivion six months after his ouster.
   His successor as president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has
proclaimed a ``new era'' for the North African nation, appealing to
the nation's Islamic and Arabic heritage, a stand that has won him
immediate widespread support.
   Bourguiba, who had set the nation on a Western course after he
won independence from France in 1956, now is 84 years old and
confined to a chateau outside Tunis. He was declared no longer
capable of governing when he was removed from office Nov. 7.
   Ben Ali took power during a tense crackdown on Islamic
fundamentalists and is universally credited, even by political
opponents, with sparing the nation from a more serious upheaval.
   He has sought to make peace with the Islamic fundamentalists and
others in the Bourguiba opposition.
   Newspapers once banned by Bourguiba are back on newsstands. Many
people say they no longer fear the police. Tunis University,
disrupted three days a week last year by demonstrations, is quiet.
   About 5,000 prisoners, many of them members of an outlawed
Islamic fundamentalist group, have been pardoned.
   The national legislature, dominated by Bourguiba's ruling party
since Tunisia's independence in 1956, has moved toward pluralism
with a new law on political parties.
   In his most risky move, however, Ben Ali has extended a hand to
the growing Islamic fundamentalist movement, Bourguiba's chief
target in his waning years.
   Television and radio now broadcast the five daily calls to
Islamic prayer.
   Islam has alway been the official state religion, but Bourguiba
maintained a secular character in government and daily life.
   Ben Ali, a military man once in charge of the crackdown on
fundamentalists, invokes Allah (God) at the start of his speeches.
   ``It's life that's changed, not just politics,'' said Chakib
Douss, a brassware merchant in the Tunis bazaar. ``Now everyone is
free. We feel it every day, every minute. It's not something you
read about in the newspaper. It's something you touch.''
   Many in the opposition approved of the new climate, if only for
now.
   ``Incontestably, Nov. 7 was a comfort to everyone,'' said a
leading member of the Socialist Democrat Movement, the largest
opposition party, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's still the honeymoon, so everyone feels obliged to
publicly approve him,'' commented M'hamed Jaibi, editor-in-chief of
the weekly Maghreb, reopened in September after being shut down
four years ago.
   ``I hope this is a temporary situation,'' he said of Ben Ali's
popularity. ``Otherwise, we'll be back in the old system with a
president who thinks he is infallible.''
   That was an allusion as well to Bourguiba, who had become so
dominant that he was declared president-for-life, a benign dictator
in charge of a nominal democracy. His Destourian Socialist Party
controlled all seats in the National Assembly. None of the three
legal opposition parties had a meaningful voice.
   But Ben Ali has promised that his new era would ``open the
horizons to a truly democratic and evolved political life.''
   Since taking office, he has moved to abolish the lifelong
presidency, change the electoral code and press laws, dismantle the
feared state security court and given Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights group, a permit to operate here _ its
first in the Arab world.
   Ben Ali has also restored diplomatic relations with neighboring
Libya and stresses closer ties with the Arab world.
   While citizens appear won over by the changes, some opposition
politicians remain cautious and fundamentalists are reserving full
judgment.
   The final year of Bourguiba's leadership was marked by a battle
against the fundamentalist Islamic Tendency Movement, culminating
in a trial in September of 90 fundamentalists on charges of
plotting against the state.
   ``The Islamic dossier remains the hottest one on Ben Ali's
desk,'' said Hassen Ghodhbani, an Islamic lawyer who defended some
of the 90 in the trial.
   He contended the measures taken by Ben Ali remain insufficient.
   ``Islam isn't just prayer and pilgrimage. It's an entire life
system,'' he said.
   In late April, the legislature quashed any hopes that the
Islamic Tendency Movement might become a legal opposition party _
one of its demands. A new law allowed new political parties but
forbade those based on religion, language, race or region.
   ``The government has adopted a double attitude toward Islam,''
said the opposition politician who spoke anonymously.
   ``It is a position both clever and dangerous.''

   The specter of drought hovers over both sides
of America, and climate experts fear that recent rains won't be
enough to alleviate the dryness.
   While some rain has fallen along the Pacific Coast and parts of
the Southeast in recent days, both areas remain dry.
   ``It's one of these very elusive things right now. We are
getting rains, so we're keeping our fingers crossed,'' commented
Paul Sabol of the federal Climate Analysis Center.
   If this summer brings drought, it will fit into a decade that
has been more often dry than wet.
   Indeed, a look back at weather records since 1980 shows only
1982 with no serious drought areas.
   Much of the Southeast is 12 percent below normal in rainfall in
this decade _ the equivalent of a year without rain. Some parts of
Georgia are 70 inches below normal, according to water resources
officials in that state.
   Across the country, dryness has prompted water rationing in San
Francisco and may threaten crops in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
   The Agriculture Department has established a task force to
monitor conditions in both regions.
   Northern California is experiencing its worst water shortage in
11 years, and farmers, businesses and residents have been asked to
cut back on water use. Some water districts have adopted rationing.
   San Franciscans have been told to cut consumption by 25 percent.
In Oakland, some residents are protesting a plan to limit water use
and significantly raise fees for households exceeding the
allocation.
   This winter's precipitation was normal or even above normal
until the end of January, said Gary Barbato, a hydrologist with the
U.S. Weather Service at San Francisco International Airport. ``But
February and March of this year were dismal, drought-producing
months.''
   Officials say the dryness in California isn't as bad as 1976-77,
when rainfall was only 25 percent of normal.
   In Nevada, ``the drought is still on with a passion,'' said the
state's climatologist, John James, who chairs a committee
considering both long-range and short-range measures to alleviate
the problem.
   Farmers are not the only ones affected by drought. Forest fires,
reduced hydroelectric output and increased river and stream
pollution also can be blamed on the dryness.
   ``Back in November people were beginning to become concerned
again about the Pacific Northwest,'' said Tom Ross of the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   That region suffered a drought last year, which extended into
the normally wet winter season.
   Rivers and streams in the Northwest were 35 percent below normal
in March, according to a study by the U.S. Geological Survey. In
the Southeast, streamflows were 54 percent of normal for the month.
Record low flows were recorded at 11 streams in the Southeast and
two in the Northwest.
   Thomas Heddingshaus of the federal Agricultural Weather Center
said that despite recent coastal rains, the interior of eastern
Washington and southwestern Idaho remain very dry, in addition to
California. The Center is operated jointly by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Agriculture.
   In the Southeast, many regional reservoirs are even lower than
they were at this date in 1986, preceeding the drought of that
summer, Ross said.
   Rainfall in parts of North Carolina and Tennessee measured as
little as 25 percent of normal in the first three months of this
year, according to Ross. And problem areas extended into Virginia,
South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.
   The 1986 drought stemmed from a shift in the Jet Stream, the
strong upper atmosphere wind that tends to move weather from place
to place, said Heddingshaus.
   In normal weather, the Jet dips south over the Mississippi
Valley and then turns back to the north again, pulling along
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to water the Southeast.
   In 1986, the Jet Stream dip occurred farther East, with the
result that the return movement north missed the Southeast, he said.
   Elsewhere in America, portions of central and northern Minnesota
also could be vulnerable to drought even with normal rainfall
through the summer, according to state climatologist Jim Zandlo.
   Researchers set odds at from 2-1 to 3-1 in favor of a drought in
those areas this summer, Zandlo said.
   ``It's almost like you saw in the typical 1930s scenes where
clouds of dust are moving across the fields,'' said Fred Kollman,
district conservationist for the Soil Conservation Service in
Norman County. ``You see drifts of dirt almost like snowdrifts in
the road ditches. There is lots of dirt in the air and lots of dirt
in the houses.''
   Here is a year-by-year outlook at dryness in this decade:
   1980:
   Hot and dry summer from the Missouri Valley throughout the
Southeastern states. Rainfall was 25 percent to 50 percent of
normal across much of the nation. The heat wave has been blamed for
as many as 1,200 deaths and crop and livestock damage estimated at
$20 billion.
   Dryness records were reported in parts of Texas, Kansas,
Wyoming, Arkansas and Virginia.
   1981:
   Much of the nation remained in the grip of the drought, which
began in 1980. Light winter snowfall meant that groundwater was not
recharged and municipal water supplies in the Northeast slipped to
dangerously low levels.
   Rains starting in May brought relief to some farm areas,
although abnormally dry weather continued in the northern Great
Plains, Southeast and Middle Atlantic states.
   1982:
   There were no extensive areas of drought, as cool Canadian air
helped produce active rain fronts during most of the summer.
   1983:
   Searing heat struck in July and August, producing severe drought
east of the Rockies.
   The drought was similar to that of 1980 but centered slightly
farther north, in the western corn belt states. Corn and soybean
crops were severely damaged and the dryness extended to the
Mid-Atlantic region. Rain was less than one-quarter of normal in
parts of Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and
Illinois.
   1984:
   Damage to wheat crops totaled more than $1 billion in Montana
and North Dakota, where rainfall was only one-third of normal in
the first half of the year. Many brush fires were reported.
Persistent dryness also damaged crops and grasslands in central
Texas.
   1985:
   Dry conditions led to serious brush and forest fires in
California and in the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains states.
   1986:
   Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee were hit
by a drought that has been described as the worst in more than a
century. Less than one-quarter the normal rain fell in some areas.
   Some relief came in August when rains helped soybean crops, but
it was too late for hay and corn. Regional damage estimates topped
$1 billion.
   1987:
   Forest fires scorched more than 2 million acres when a dry
winter was followed by a sweltering summer in parts of Idaho,
Washington, Oregon and California. Water shortages occurred in
Spokane and some other communities.
   Hot, dry conditions in July and August also contributed to
drought conditions in the Southeast, reducing crop yields sharply.
Heavy rains came along in September, but excessively dry conditions
returned to the Southeast in October and November, particularly
affecting West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

<HEAD>Church Universal and Triumphant: A Threat in Paradise Valley?</HEAD>

   Here in a mile-high valley called
Paradise, a religious group is building its home, a retreat for
thousands that some local people say threatens the pristine
environment bordering Yellowstone National Park.
   The group is the Church Universal and Triumphant, a ``New Age''
sect that moved its headquarters in late 1986 from California to a
12,000-acre ranch it had bought five years earlier in southwest
Montana's Paradise Valley.
   With that move came 200 followers, doubling the number already
there, construction plans for a self-sufficient community, and the
promise of more church members moving into a valley with a
population of about 1,000.
   Next door is Yellowstone, whose wildlife herds often migrate
into the valley during the winter.
   ``This is a place of international significance,'' says Hank
Rate, a local resident. ``If they do what they say they want to do,
that value is going to be diminished _ not only for our time, but
for all time.''
   Rate and others fear the group's building plans and its summer
conclaves that attract thousands will cause environmental damage in
the valley.
   Some critics say they're uncomfortable with the group's beliefs.
   The church was founded 30 years ago in Washington, D.C., by Mark
Prophet, who said he received messages from spiritual figures of
the past, including Christ, Buddha and Pope John XXIII. Upon his
death in 1973, his widow, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, became the
leader.
   Church members believe a human soul is continuously reincarnated
until people realize the God within themselves. They use praying or
chanting to attempt to influence world conditions or personal
concerns. Tobacco, alcohol and drugs are forbidden.
   Ms. Prophet, 47, says her visions suggest a war between the
United States and the Soviet Union before the end of this century.
The church supports President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
and a nationwide civil defense system.
   ``We have a lot of down-home, nice type of folks on this ranch
who are just like the people that are our neighbors,'' Ms. Prophet
says. ``I don't think that all the hullaballoo that's been made in
the press is the reality here.''
   Critics draw comparisons between Paradise Valley and the tiny
town of Antelope, Ore., taken over in the early 1980s and then
abandoned by followers of the Baghwan Shree Rajneesh.
   Church Universal and Triumphant bought some modular housing from
the defunct Rajneeshee community, but church leaders say the
similarities end there.
   Since the church bought the ranch in 1981, its leaders have hit
the local Rotary and Kiwanis club circuit to calm fears that it is
a far-out religious cult bent on political control.
   Church vice president Ed Francis, married to Ms. Prophet, says
church members' political persuasion generally resembles that of
the area _ conservative and Republican.
   Not everyone is reassured.
   ``I'm concerned about the numbers,'' says Leonard Sargent, whose
2,000-acre property borders the church's Royal Teton Ranch. ``No
matter what they happen to believe, it's still an awful lot of
people to bring into a fragile area.''
   Church officials counter that they chose the valley because of
its natural beauty, which they want to preserve.
   The church bought the Royal Teton Ranch in 1981 from magazine
publisher Malcolm Forbes for a reported $7 million.
   Since then, the church has purchased an additional 21,500 acres
in the Paradise Valley, including 5,200 acres of hilly prairie near
Emigrant intended for settlement by church members, about 25 miles
north of the Royal Teton Ranch. It also owns a printing shop in
Livingston that employs 100 people.
   The church won't reveal its income but says it comes from
members' donations and various business ventures, largely the sale
of religious books and videotapes. It also leases land to members.
   The church has advertised the ranch to its members as a
spiritual retreat offering protection from economic collapse, civil
disorder or war. Thousands of followers gather each summer for an
annual conclave in a spectacular mountain valley called the ``Heart
of the Inner Retreat.''
   Ms. Prophet and Francis say the Royal Teton Ranch will become a
monastic, self-sufficient community for 500 or so church members.
   With the help of ranch ``staff'' _ church members who receive
room, board and small monthly salaries _ the church has installed
an extensive irrigation system, grows a wide variety of vegetables
and grains, operates a dairy and raises 2,500 head of cattle and
sheep.
   Members also began work in 1986 on the development's central
complex. Located near the west bank of the Yellowstone River
several miles north of Yellowstone Park, it would include housing
for 260, a church, school, kitchen, dining hall and recreation
facilities.
   But that work halted in November 1986 when the state, prodded by
local residents, launched an environmental review.
   A draft of the review, completed in March, said the project
should be able to proceed without damaging wildlife, water quality
or aesthetics, as long as the church takes several steps to cushion
impact of the development. The state found no threat to the
environment that would justify denying sewage and water permits, if
the conditions were met.
   Following a public comment period _ ``We were overwhelmed with
comment, both for and against,'' said Steve Pilcher, chief of
Montana's Water Quality Bureau _ the state is completing a final
report.
   The draft said the church should build a bear-proof fence around
a tree farm and vegetable fields, monitor groundwater, maintain
minimum flows in three creeks crossing ranch property and postpone
any use of a geothermal spring near the Yellowstone River.
   The church wants to pump water from LaDuke Hot Springs for use
at its central complex. Park officials are concerned the pumping
might affect Mammoth Hot Springs nine miles to the south.
   Francis says the church is willing to accept the
recommendations, but a number of groups have suggested the state
review is inadequate.
   Since the 1970s, the church has occupied and later abandoned
land in Colorado, Idaho and California _ ``a series of steps to get
here,'' Francis says, adding that the church has no intention of
moving again.
   But critics say the church has not been forthcoming about its
plans in the past.
   ``Basically, Ed Francis' credibility with me is zero,'' says
Richard Parks, owner of an outdoor equipment shop in nearby
Gardiner and a member of the Bear Creek Council, a local
environmental group. ``If he told me it was Thursday, I'd check the
calendar.''
   When Church Universal and Triumphant bought the ranch, Francis
said its rural nature would not be changed.
   Francis maintains he has been largely consistent: ``I feel that
a 1 percent use of property in this area for anything other than
open space and wildlife is appropriate and not something that
should cause a lot of alarm.''
   Parks says the church ``changes the ambience of the whole
area,'' bringing the impact of a development but no direct economic
benefits.
   Francis contends that what's really bothering the critics is
simpler: They just don't want others to have a piece of their
paradise.

   The first impression of Dodge's new luxury
full-size sedan, the 1988 Dynasty LE, was of a refined Dodge, one
better than the rest.
   The exterior had some of the same styling of Chrysler's K-cars
but was updated with a nicely squared-off trunk lid in the rear.
The interior, on first glance, seemed a comfortable mix of modern
touches and familiar, old gauges _ all with good quality.
   Unfortunately, first impressions don't always hold up.
   More than 300 miles after picking up the test car, a few things
had gone wrong. The power antenna stuck midway through the test and
wouldn't go up until I pulled off the highway and pried the antenna
free with my fingernails.
   The cigarette lighter didn't fit right and never popped back up
once it was pushed down. The temperature control lever fell out, so
heat could not be regulated. In desperation one day, I finally
figured out a way to jam the lever back in and maneuver it along a
horizontal axis to get some warmth.
   The dashboard was admirably designed as one piece to prevent
squeaks and rattles, but in the test car it didn't seem to fit
quite right. Though there were no squeaks, a passenger noticed he
could see right down to the underlying metal through a gap between
the dash and window pillar.
   And, like Chrysler's K-cars on which it is based, the Dynasty
had a pentastar logo capped over the trunk keyhole that kept
snapping back and pinching fingers as the trunk was opened.
   The Dynasty also had the characteristic K-car hole in the center
of the trunk for a full-sized spare tire that, without a tire
there, meant garment bags would fall inside in a rumpled heap.
   The Dynasty does have decent leg room in the rear, a back seat
that is comfortable and doesn't feel like a bench, and a fine,
optional Infinity II sound system ($767).
   The exterior fit and finish was excellent, and a standard
feature that automatically locks all doors when the car is in gear
and speed reaches more than 15 mph was startling at first but later
comforting.
   The optional electronic fuel-injected V-6 ($660) performed
smoothly.
   Additionally, Chrysler Motors Corp. priced the car below many
competitors. The lowest-priced Dynasty starts at $11,666 compared
with more than $14,400 for an Oldsmobile Delta 88 and more than
$14,000 for a Pontiac Bonneville.
   That fits with Chrysler's plan to lure less affluent buyers _
median income of targeted Dynasty buyers is $36,000 compared with
$40,000 annually for the average buyer in this market segment.
   Target Dynasty buyers also are a bit younger, age 55, compared
with the average age of 61 in this market segment, Chrysler said.
   Seventy percent of the Dynasty buyers are expected to be male.
Chrysler said it introduced the Dynasty in the 1988 model year to
lure new buyers.
   In a press release, the automaker's Dodge Division says the
top-of-the-line Dynasty will compete with Oldsmobile Delta 88 and
Pontiac Bonneville for the younger, more upscale and better
educated buyer looking for up-to-the-minute technology in a
traditionally styled family car.
   But buyers of any age and income expect better quality than what
was on the test car, especially considering that with options, the
price came to $16,700-plus.
   For that price, the Dynasty had best hold up under close
inspection.
   Because the vehicle is new, there are no reliability reports.

<HEAD>East St. Louis: Ragged Riverfront City Struggles to Survive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deep in debt and scarred by scandal,
this ragged riverfront town has witnessed political brawls and
street shootouts. Now it's fighting again _ to survive.
   Too little money and too many problems have created what some
say is the worst crisis ever in this long troubled city, where
crime and corruption are so common the mayor has 24-hour bodyguards
and ex-cons have lined up for his job.
   East St. Louis has garbage on its streets, debts in the millions
and bill collectors at its doors. It also owes $4.1 million to a
man who suffered brain damage after being beaten by a cellmate in
the city jail.
   What's more, two mayoral appointees are under indictment. And on
May 11, the city faces trial on charges of reckless conduct,
accused of endangering several police officers by not supplying
properly working radios or cars.
   The situation? ``Critical,'' said Alderman Melvin Frierson.
``It's in worse shape than I've ever seen it before.''
   ``We've got a lot of poor people, a lot of problems and no money
to deal with them,'' said lawyer Rex Carr, a member of a panel
convened to study those problems. ``I see no hope of getting
adequate funds. There is no hope for East St. Louis under present
circumstances.
   ``Someone I heard say they expect (cities) like East St. Louis
to lift themselves up by the bootstraps,'' he added. ``People have
no boots to lift on. You've got to give them the boots.''
   Mayor Carl Officer, criticized by some for running a
``reckless'' administration, is defiant in the face of bankruptcy
rumors.
   The city's predicament is ``not without pain,'' Officer said.
``But it's not something that you roll up the red flag and say, `I
give.' I don't think that you should panic over it.''
   Officer blames council members for excessive spending. ``That's
not bad financial condition,'' he said. ``That's poor financial
planning.''
   Political squabbles are frequent. The city's twice-monthly
paychecks were finally issued three days late last Monday after
money was borrowed from other accounts. The treasurer argued the
city didn't have the money; the mayor said it did.
   East St. Louis was once a vibrant town with chemical, metal and
glass works until crime, corruption and labor troubles, beginning
about 1960, led to white flight and job losses. This virtually
all-black city has shrunk to 55,000 people from 82,000 in 1960.
   Today, most of the major industries operate outside city limits
and provide no tax base. Residents are poor; recent estimates
indicate 60 percent receive goverment aid.
   East St. Louis has some assets: land, a large labor force and a
prime location. Officer, a third-generation funeral director, hopes
to breathe new life into his city with a $500 million riverfront
development plan that includes housing, a recycling facility and an
inland port.
   But the riverfront now is a dismal jumble of weeds and garbage,
a sharp contrast to St. Louis' gleaming high-rises and soaring
Gateway Arch just across the Mississippi. And away from the water,
signs of decay are everywhere: gutted buildings, boarded-up
businesses and trash on the streets.
   Crime has become so routine it's a sight gag in the movie
``National Lampoon's Vacation,'' when the family's hubcaps are
stolen as they drive through East St. Louis.
   The city's finances, however, are its greatest burden; it is
already $2 million in debt, and projected annual revenues fall
$200,000 short of this year's $6.8 million budget.
   Comptroller LaMar Gentry says up to 90-100 city employees _ a
third of the workforce _ may have to be laid off. Officials say 25
workers were laid off recently and 25 more are expected to be cut
soon.
   Gentry cited other drains on city coffers, including:
   _ $1.3 million in lost federal revenue sharing funds.
   _ about $400,000 that could be due this year in an arbitration
judgment awarded to firefighters involving back pay and raises.
   _ $262,000 owed to a refuse service that halted collection last
fall and sued; it's only one among scores of unpaid vendors. A
$350,000 contract has been signed with a new service, but Officer
contends the city can't afford regular garbage pickup. Gentry
already has strict priorities: payroll, then gas for fire and
police vehicles. Then, he said, ``You pay off who raises the most
hell.''
   _ $4.1 million owed to Walter DeBow, an electrician who suffered
brain damage and needs perpetual nursing care after a jail beating,
said his attorney, Clyde Kuehn.
   Police checking DeBow's car after a 1984 accident said they
found an open bottle of malt liquor. Although he should have been
able to post his driver's license and leave, he was jailed in lieu
of $100 cash bond.

<HEAD>Victoria Principal Has Mother's Day Message on Arthritis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Victoria Principal has a Mother's Day
message for millions of American women: pay attention to aches and
pains that could be early signs of arthritis.
   ``You don't have to live the last years of your life with the
degree of discomfort that elderly people have lived with for
years,'' she said in a recent interview.
   One in seven Americans _ some 37 million people _ have been
diagnosed with arthritis. The disease affects twice as many women
than men.
   The key, Miss Principal said, is to take a few minutes to learn
the basic symptoms of the 100 various forms arthritis and then seek
medical attention, if it seems warranted.
   ``If you're more aware of your body, if you seriously listen to
the indications of your body that something is wrong and go to a
doctor you aren't being an alarmist,'' she said. ``You are simply
listening to your body and taking good care of yourself.''
   Miss Principal, head of the Arthritis Foundation's national
campaign since 1983, emphasizes early detection _ not because there
is a cure for the disease _ but because research advances of the
past few years have developed more and better ways to alleviate
suffering.
   ``Crippling pain is no longer something that is inevitable,''
she said. ``We don't have all the answers yet, but we have more
answers than we've had before. By an early diagnosis you can
perhaps prevent the kind of crippling that we have seen in
generations of Americans in older age.''
   Miss Principal's mother and father have lived with arthritis for
years.
   Arthritis sufferers can find help at Arthritis Foundation
chapters in all 50 states, which provide referral to free, local
self-help programs.
   For those not yet aware of problems, the warning signs of
arthritis are soreness or redness or swelling of the joints and
morning fatigue that persist for two weeks or more.
   ``The inflamation is a tip-off,'' she said. ``If you have that,
then something is definitely wrong. Even if you don't think you
have arthritis, that indicates you should go see a doctor.''
   A major problem, she said, is that most people eventually
diagnosed with arthritis didn't see a doctor until three years
after their first symptoms appeared.
   ``If you suspected you might have cancer or heart disease, you
would probably go out and see your doctor right away,'' she said.
``We're asking people to take it seriously in a medical sense
because things can be done, particularly the sooner you get it
diagnosed.''
   Generally, those things are a combination of medication and
exercise.
   ``The range of medication ranges from the very mild such as
aspirin to some very, very, very powerful drugs if you have a real
severe form or arthritis that is not responding to other types of
medication,'' said Peter G. Mathon, a vice president of the
Atlanta-based Arthritis Foundation.
   In the most extreme cases, surgical joint replacement can be an
option _ as it has been for Mathon, who has had seven hip joint
replacements.
   While medication would to be taken under the guidance of a
physician, exercise, too, should be carefully monitored.
   ``There is a fine line,'' said Mathon. ``You want to keep the
joint moving enough so it doesn't freeze up, yet you don't want to
overwork to the point where you do more damage to the joint. Each
person is going to be a little different.''
   In addition to medication and exercise, researchers are working
hard to link certain diets with the onset of arthritis.
   ``I think we're starting to see some preliminary results in that
area and I think that eventually we will have better answers and
there will probably some links between some types of arthritis and
some foods,'' said Mathon.
   Miss Principal, who has written books on diet and exercise, said
she is convinced the links will be found.
   ``It's that old thing your mother used to say, `You are what you
eat,''' she said. ``I really believe that. I think we're going to
discover that certain foods can perhaps trigger more profound
reactions.''
   Scientists have discovered there are genetic patterns, but Miss
Principal said ``the reason something fires that genetic marker, no
one really understands yet.''
   The actress said she became involved with the Arthritis
Foundation, at first as a high-profile fund-raiser, to try to do
something for her parents ``on a larger scale,'' something more
than just helping with their own treatment.
   ``After I got involved, it escalated to an even larger scale and
I discovered how many people I know who have arthritis and had
never told me,'' she said.
   Miss Principal and Mathon were in Washington for a
government-backed general health care forum.
   One of the ``new and different'' programs sponsored by the
Arthritis Foundation is self-help classes around the nation, Mathon
said.
   In addition to learning more about the disease, the programs
sometimes involve exercise programs run in conjunction with local
YMCA's and similar organizations.
   ``We also offer support groups.'' he said. ``They get together
to talk about their experiences and share little tips and tricks
with each other. One of the main things is they realize they're not
the only ones going through these feelings of up and down because
arthritis does tend to be a roller coaster disease. You can feel
better some days and worse some days. You can got into remission,
in effect. You can be lulled into a false sense of security.''
   Locations of state Arthritis Foundation offices can be obtained
through local telephone directories or by writing the national
headquarters at 1314 Spring St., N.W., Atlanta, Ga., 30309.
   The foundation also works through the American Association of
Retired Persons, or AARP, to get out information about its programs.

<HEAD>Old Saying: If You Can't Forecast Well, Forecast Often</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the last century or thereabouts it was
pretty easy to forecast the weather by how the sky looked or how
birds, caterpillars and other creatures behaved. Anybody could do
it, and many did.
   Everybody talked about the weather, especially farmers and their
neighbors. There was talk about hard times, too, and how it seemed
nobody was doing anything about it.
   If times were good, farmers kept their mouths shut, knowing that
another drought or something bad was right around the corner.
   Not much was heard about economic forecasts, though. Somebody in
the government or a big-shot financier occasionally said something,
but scientifically developed projections did not abound.
   Today's economic forecasting, once as primitive as predicting
the weather from the loops in chicken entrails, has come a long
way, to be sure. But agricultural economists still have their
problems with weather, the greatest single variable confronting
farmers.
   And the agricultural economist's weather map is a lot bigger
these days, global, in fact. Hundreds of people in the Agriculture
Department, for example, look at and analyze world weather
conditions.
   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service says
weather isn't the only guidepost. Domestic and foreign polices of
other countries, demand trends, population growth and economic
growth are all part of the package.
   Farmers have little defense against ``uncertain events'' that
occur because of government actions or as a result of major
variations in world weaher patterns, he said. That was evident
during the agricultural boom of the 1970s and the bust of the 1980s.
   ``Who could have foretold the devastatingly late and poor
monsoon in Asia and its effect on the 1987 crop and on world
prices?'' Edwards said. ``What farmer could have said in the early
1980s, `I choose to farm in an economy with a larger money supply
and therefore with lower interest rates'?''
   Edwards added: ``Because of the unpredictability of major events
that affect the national and international agricultural economies,
it is getting harder to know how to use economic forecasts.''
   One solution would be to simply accept a forecast and act
accordingly. Farmers often do that when dealing about events and
processes with which they are familiar, he said. The likely
response of corn yields to fertilizer applications, or milk yields
in response to feeding rates are examples.
   And some economic forecasts are hedged by giving users a set of
possible outcomes that illustrate the uncertainties. For example,
the agency's forecast of net cash farm income this year is in a
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   ``A farm equipment manufacturer for whom this forecast is
important might determine then consequences if the actual outcome
is at one end of the range or the other, and then attach a degree
of confidence to each of the two outcomes,'' Edwards said. ``Using
this information, a manager can work out the best position to take.
This is one way to allow for known risks.''
   But Edwards acknowledged in an article published in the May
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine that it is getting harder
for farmers to make decisions when they are increasingly faced by
uncertainties caused by events which they can neither predict nor
control.
   ``Greater exposure to these uncertainties has come along with
U.S. farmers' increasing dependence on world markets,'' he said.
``Two major sources of risk ... are climatic events in other
hemispheres and the policies and actions of governments.''
   A classic example of a global influence on American farmers is
the Soviet Union. Since 1972, when Moscow secretly bought the
equivalent of one-fourth of that year's U.S. wheat crop, weather in
the Soviet Union has been watched almost as intently as it is in
Kansas and Iowa.
   The huge 1972 purchases led to a bilateral agreement several
years later, pledging the Soviet Union to buy U.S. wheat and corn
on a sustained annual basis. That was one attempt to soften some of
the variables connected with the export trade.
   ``United States and Soviet government policy changes can
exacerbate the effect that Russian weather patterns have on U.S.
wheat producers,'' Edwards said. ``There was a time when the
U.S.S.R. tended to tighten its collective belt after a short crop.
Now the Soviets are more likely to seek imports to stabilize their
livestock economy, with larger needs in some years and smaller
needs in others.''
   The Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, is a more recent example
of the U.S. government trying to soften some of the variables for
American farmers by providing subsidies of taxpayer-owned surplus
grain to exporters so they can sell wheat and other designated
commodities to selected foreign buyers, including the Soviet Union,
at bargain prices.
   Other USDA activities, such as the Targeted Export Asssistance
program, or TEA, help promote U.S. commodities in foreign markets.
   It's all part of the forecasting business and must be taken into
consideration when department economists make predictions.
   ``Still, farmers' plans based on forecasts can receive as great
a shock from, say, the weather affecting the soybean crop in South
America this May and June as from the weather on their own farm,''
Edwards said.

   The United Auto Workers union and
Chrysler Corp. have reached a tentative agreement on a two-year
national labor contract, following about 40 hours of non-stop
bargaining.
   ``We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve,
and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today at
GM and Ford,'' the union said Wednesday in a statement attributed
to UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice President Marc Stepp.
   The proposed contract, which would replace a three-year pact
covering 66,000 UAW workers in 15 states that expires in September,
still must be approved by Chrysler's national labor council and the
rank and file.

   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,
said the turmoil surrounding Eastern Airlines ``continues to
ravage'' the financial performance of the air carrier, with losses
expected through the first half of this year.
   Lorenzo in remarks Wednesday to the International Aviation Club
said Texas Air's Eastern subsidiary will post continuing losses
during the second quarter.
   He blamed it partly on what he called the airline unions'
campaign against Eastern, the Machinists union's refusal to agree
to contract concessions and the series of government investigations
of the Miami-based airline.

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>

   Lower car sales at General Motors Corp. during late April helped
depress total national sales of domestically-made cars, which fell
6.7 percent during the period.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. posted sales gains in the
April 21-30 period, but GM reported a decline, the automakers
reported Wednesday.
   In other economic news, the stock market, the dollar and the
credit markets declined.
   GM said its car sales for the April 21-30 period trailed 19.7
percent behind unusually strong sales in the same period last year.
Chrysler posted a 10.3 percent gain for the period and Ford's car
sales were up 8.7 percent.
   Domestic truck sales rose by 6.5 percent, but combined car and
truck sales were 2.6 percent less than in the year-ago late April
period.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average _ up about 26
points in the two previous sessions _ fell 22.05 to finish at
2,036.31.
   Analysts said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's
comments that an anticipated improvement in the nation's trade
deficit could lead to increased inflation unless domestic spending
was restrained summed up investors' mixed feelings about the
economy.
   Many investors are looking toward the Labor Department's report
on unemployment, scheduled to be released Friday, for the next clue
to the nation's overall economic health.
   Bond yields edged higher, as prices eased. The Treasury's
bellwether 30-year issue fell $2.50 per $1,000 in face value to
yield about 9.1 percent. Investors avoid fixed-income instruments
during periods of inflation, which erodes fixed yields.
   In the currency markets, the dollar was narrowly mixed in dull
trading.
   Oil futures prices slipped, pressured by a report that showed
larger-than-expected domestic inventories in gasoline and crude.

   Oil futures prices have tumbled in the wake of a
report showing domestic inventories of gasoline and crude were at
higher-than-expected levels.
   In Wednesday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, June
contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude,
fell 17 cents to close at $17.20 per barrel.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline lost 0.56 cent per gallon, settling at 49.72 cents, and
wholesale heating oil dropped 0.57 cent to 46.20 cents per gallon.
   The American Petroleum Institute, a Washington-based trade
organization, reported late Tuesday that domestic gasoline supplies
grew by 5.9 million barrels in the week ended April 29, while crude
stocks shrunk by 700,000 barrels.
   Those figures in particular sent prices lower in London and New
York, because they left more inventory than was expected, said Mary
L. Haskins, an analyst at the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   When inventories rise faster than demand, prices tend to fall.
   Wednesday's declines also reflected continuing market
perceptions that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would be unable to agree on a way tighten up its production, even
when it meets next month in Vienna, Ms. Haskins said.
   Technical factors also contributed to the day's declines, she
said.

<HEAD>US to Borrow $26 Billion to Boost Public Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department has set plans to
borrow $26 billion to replenish government coffers next week, down
3.7 percent from the borrowing needs in the first three months of
the year.
   The lower borrowing resulted in part from efforts by foreign
governments to prop up the value of the dollar by making heavy
purchases of U.S. securities in recent months.
   Treasury has been able to reduce its public borrowing demands
because of the large volume of securities sold to foreign central
banks, which have been selling their Japanese yen, German marks and
other foreign currencies to buy dollars as a way of stabilizing the
dollar's value.
   The foreign governments then used their newly-purchased dollars
to buy U.S. treasury securities.
   At a briefing Wednesday, William Bremner, deputy assistant
secretary for federal finance, told reporters that the purchases by
foreign central banks totaled $12 billion from October through
December last year and $16.5 billion from January through March
this year.
   The heavy purchases of U.S. debt by foreign governments have
raised concerns about the growing influence U.S. allies have over
the U.S. economy. If they suddenly curb their purchases of U.S.
debt, it could send interest rates up sharply in this country.
   The announcement that $26 billion in new debt would be sold next
week was in line with market expectations. The auctions, known as
quarterly refundings, provide the main source by which the
government finances the $2.5 trillion national debt.
   The auctions next week call for:
   _$8.75 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned on Tuesday.
   _$8.75 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday.
   _$8.50 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Thursday.
   The $26 billion to be raised includes $9.5 billion in new cash
and $16.5 billion to pay off maturing securities.
   A total of $1.5 billion of the new cash will be used to retire
existing debt, something the government has not done since the
first year of President Reagan's first term in office.
   But Bremner said that did not mean the total national debt would
be reduced by $1.5 billion during the quarter because the
government also borrows money from such non-public sources as the
Social Security trust fund.
   A reduction of the public debt during the spring quarter was
commonplace before Reagan took office because the government always
benefited from the April tax deadline.
   However, this debt reduction has not occurred since 1981 because
the level of the government's borrowing needs has grown
dramatically with the string of huge federal deficits.
   The $26 billion to be borrowed next week is down from $27
billion raised at the last quarterly refunding in February.

   Coleco Industries Inc. will have to
intensify its cost-cutting and streamlining efforts to bounce back
from a string of financial losses, according to the outgoing chief
of the toymaker.
   Arnold C. Greenberg, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, resigned his posts Wednesday, but will remain a consultant
and director of the company.
   Coleco's board of directors named Morton E. Handel to succeed
Greenberg as chairman and chief executive, and promoted Handel to
the board, Coleco said in a statement. J. Brian Clarke will
continue as president and chief operating officer.
   In the statement announcing his resignation, Greenberg said:
``It is necessary to intensify and accelerate cost cutting actions
already begun and to further contract the size of the company'' to
help it recover from a string of financial losses.
   Greenberg said ``financially directed leadership is desirable
during this period, and I believe Morton Handel, working together
with...Clarke can accomplish these critical objectives.''
   Coleco, which once rode high on the success of its Cabbage Patch
Kids dolls, has suffered declining sales in recent years along with
other major toy manufacturers. The toymaker posted losses of $105.4
million in 1987 and $111.2 million in 1986, following record
profits of $64.2 million in 1985.
   Coleco has slashed its work force by more than 50 percent since
last November, including layoffs of about 475 workers announced
Tuesday.
   The company also is attempting to stave off having to file for
bankruptcy protection from creditors by seeking to restructure $335
million in debt.
   Coleco paid $59.6 million in interest during 1987 _ or nearly 12
percent of the year's sales _ compared with $42.7 million in 1986.
It failed to make a $19 million interest payment due on debentures
on April 1.
   However, Coleco debt holders have been cool to its proposal to
exchange their debt securities for a combination of new debt and
common stock, and Coleco has been forced to extend the deadline for
the offer twice. The new deadline is Friday, May 13.
   Coleco also announced Wednesday that it had hired Hallwood Group
Inc. to help it restructure its balance sheet and provide working
capital. Hallwood is an international merchant banking group
specializing in financial restructurings.
   Greenberg has said the company planned to pare its 1988
operating costs by about $70 million, or 25 percent.
   After a series of spotty financial performances in the late
1970s and early 1980s, Coleco began moving toward prosperity in
1982 with the introduction of its ColecoVision home video game
system. But the $600 Adam home computer it unveiled in 1983 proved
a flopm, sales of ColecoVision cooled, and in 1984 Coleco lost
$79.8 million.
   Coleco's fortunes soared on the phenomenal strength of its
Cabbage Patch Kids.
   The dolls accounted for sales of $67 million when introduced
quietly in 1983 but skyrocketed during a national craze that
boosted sales to $540 million in 1984 and a peak of $600 million in
1985.
   Coleco boasted total sales of $776 million in 1985, but by 1986
was on a downward trend, led by Cabbage Patch sales that plummeted
to $230 million.

<HEAD>Automakers Report April Monthly Sales Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late April domestic car sales sagged below
year-earlier levels, while for the full month import car makers
showed signs of rebounding despite pricing disadvantages stemming
from the weaker U.S. dollar.
   Combined domestic car and truck sales fell 2.6 percent to
420,626 in the sales period of April 21-30, the automakers reported
Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp. car sales for the late April period fell
19.7 percent from a stronger-than-usual sales period a year
earlier, leading a 6.7 percent decline in domestic car sales.
   Chrysler Corp. car sales rose 10.3 percent from the year earlier
and Ford Motor Co. sales were up 8.7 percent.
   Domestic truck sales for all makers rose by 6.5 percent.
   Industry analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
New York, said the figures were skewed because GM sales surged last
April due to sales incentives.
   ``They were 55 percent of the market, so the comparison will be
kind of distorted. GM will look poor,'' Healy said.
   For the month, GM car sales were down 14.2 percent to a total of
314,671, Ford's were down 1.4 percent to 186,175 and Chrysler's
sales rose 8.8 percent to 95,170.
   GM held a 47.2 percent makret share during the late April
period, compared with 27.9 percent for Ford and 13.9 percent for
Chrysler. GM's share in the year-earlier period was 54.9 percent,
due largely to the special sales incentives.
   Imported car sales totaled 236,451, up 0.7 percent, for April,
though imported light truck sales plunged 37.4 percent to a 50,318
monthly total. Importers report their sales monthly.
   The decline of the dollar over the past three years has forced
Japanese and European automakers to raise their prices, to reflect
the strengthening of their own currencies.
   As a result, the Japanese imports have begun using the tactic of
sales incentives that domestic manufacturers have focused on for
the past couple of years, said Chris Cedergren, analyst at J.D.
Power & Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   Nissan, with aggressive incentive programs, sold 31,197 imported
cars for the month, up 7.3 percent, and 6,545 U.S.-produced cars,
up 2.8 percent.
   Toyota sold 43,605 imports, up slightly from 43,339, and 2,200
U.S.-made cars, up from 2,187.
   Honda import sales dropped 3.6 percent to 19,702, but sales of
domestically made Hondas rose 7.5 percent to 17,512.
   Volkswagen import sales dropped 25 percent to 11,922 and
domestic sales sank 7.5 percent to 2,712.

   United Airlines said Wednesday it would ban
smoking on all its flights of 1,000 miles or less within the United
States or Canada as of June 1, in an attempt to remedy confusion
over a new federal rule banning smoking on short-duration flights.
   Federal regulations that took effect April 22 prohibit smoking
on flights scheduled to take two hours or less.
   But because of headwinds or air traffic, flights between the
same cities can take different amounts of time when travel is in
different directions, United spokesman Rob Doughty said Wednesday.
   That has caused some confusion among United passengers and crew,
he said.
   The new rule will add 53 pairs of cities to the list of
non-smoking United flights, said John R. Zeeman, a United vice
president.
   Doughty said the two-hour rule affects 57 percent of all United
flights, and the new 1,000-mile rule would affect 77 percent of the
airline's flights.
   ``We certainly think it works better for the customers and for
United Airlines to make the criterion mileage instead of time,''
Doughty said.

<HEAD>Chrysler, UAW Reach Early Tentative Agreement on Job-Protecting
Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative two-year labor agreement
completed in marathon negotiations between Chrysler Corp. and the
United Auto Workers now faces the scrutiny of the union's national
Chrysler council and the rank and file.
   Union and Chrysler negotiators finished two-and-a-half weeks of
bargaining _capped by nearly 40 hours of non-stop negotiations _
Wednesday over a contract covering 66,000 hourly and salaried
workers in 15 states.
   The pact, which largely mirrors the job-protecting contracts
already in force at Chrysler rivals Ford Motor Co. and General
Motors Corp., will go before the UAW's 140-member national Chrysler
council on Friday before it can be put to a ratification vote next
week.
   Chrysler's chief negotiator, Vice President Anthony St. John,
called the agreement ``equitable and affordable'' and said the
settlement cleared the way for improved labor relations after
months of bitter conflict.
   Unlike the Ford and GM contracts, it also prevents Chrysler
executives from receiving cash or stock bonuses in years when
workers receive no profit-sharing.
   The clause is important to Chrysler workers, who were angered at
the generosity of 1987 executive compensation that included $17.9
million in earningsy by Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca.
   ``We think it's a breakthrough. We think it's time in America
that this disparity come to an end,'' said UAW Vice President Marc
Stepp, the union's chief negotiator.
   The contract includes the same profit-sharing formula contained
in the Ford and GM contracts and will produce its first payout in
March 1989 out of 1988 profits.
   Also unlike the Ford and GM pacts, the Chrysler contract
includes a $1,000 bonus for signing the pact, which replaces a
three-year contract set to expire Sept. 14. Chrysler workers
received a $2,120 signing bonus in 1985 for agreeing to a
three-year contract.
   The new contract, if ratified, would expire with the GM and Ford
contracts on Sept. 14, 1990, allowing the UAW to bargain with the
Big Three simultaneously for the first time since 1979.
   Under the pattern contract, workers will receive lump sum
bonuses of 3 percent of wages in 1989 and 1990.
   The contract prevents plant closings not already announced when
negotiations began and requires purchasers of any Chrysler plants
to accept the contract.
   It forbids layoffs for any reasons except slow sales, halves the
rate of attrition and makes it more difficult for the company to
move work to outside companies or foreign countries. Chrysler
agreed to spend up to $230 million on the Base Employment Levels
program, which will continue paying workers the automaker must
place in a job bank if it eliminates their jobs for reasons other
than production cuts.
   UAW leaders agreed to encourage local unions to consider
adopting Japanese-style work agreements that organize workers into
teams, increasing efficiency and product quality.
   Chrysler agreed to UAW representation of salaried workers at
three new locations and the UAW agreed to allow Chrysler
flexibility in using those workers.
   Chrysler and the UAW began bargaining on April 18 in an effort
to heal a series of wounds that inflicted beginning with Chrysler's
announcement in January that it planned to close a 5,500-worker
Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant that had been scheduled to run five
more years.
   That was followed by plans to sell Chrysler's 28,000-worker
Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary, which sparked company-wide protests
and plans for crippling plant-by-plant strikes.
   In early March, Chrysler backed down from the sale and agreed to
early talks.
   But negotiations were nearly derailed at the start by by
disclosure of Iacocca's 1987 earnings, the company's demand to
severely restrict when workers could retire with full benefits and
confirmation that Chrysler planned to move its K-car production to
Mexico in the summer.
   Iacocca mended those blunders last week by announcing K-car
production would stay in Detroit until year's end and that the
Kenosha plant would stay open until year's end.

<HEAD>Taiwan Lifts Ban On New Securities Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Thursday approved proposals
that would allow the setting up of new securities firms, ending a
15-year-old ban on the issuing of such licenses, a government
official reported.
   The new rules, proposed by the Finance Ministry, also allow
foreigners to invest in local brokerage houses, said Lu Daung-yen,
vice chairman of the Securities and Excahnge Commission.
   Lu told reporters the new rules were part of government measures
to expand access to the local securities market for Taiwan's
cash-rich investors.
   Taiwan now has 28 licensed securities firms, including 14 banks
acting as brokerage firms.
   Under the new rules, each foreign investor will be allowed to
invest up to 10 percent of the total shares of a local securities
firm, while total foreign shares should not exceed 40 percent, Lu
said.
   Lu said the new rules would become effective in two weeks when
details are worked out.
   The government suspended the licensing of new securities
companies in 1973, saying new firms were not needed because of the
small size of the local stock market.
   Trading on the local stock market has, however increased
recently. Daily trading volume of the market last year averaged 9.3
billion Taiwan dollars, or $325.3 million, about four times the
1986 average.

<HEAD>Officials Said to Have Doctored Financial Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officers of Integrity Insurance Co.
illegally drained the company of cash and committed corporate
racketeering that caused its $300 million collapse last year, the
state says in a lawsuit.
   The lawsuit, filed here Wednesday by the state Department of
Insurance, accuses former company President Christian Yegen of
Tenafly and others of doctoring financial records to convince
regulators and customers alike that the company was sound and able
to pay its claims.
   The lawsuit describes the Paramus company's deficit at more than
$300 million, one of the largest insurance failures ever, according
to state officials. The deficit may eventually exceed $1 billion
once all claims are settled several years from now, the state
alleged.
   ``We are trying to get the money back,'' said state Insurance
Commissioner Kenneth D. Merin. ``The collapse has had a major
impact, not only on people who bought insurance, but on the
industry, because it has raised questions about its ability to
carry out its mission.''
   In its lawsuit, the state charged that Integrity was insolvent
as early as 1981, six years before the state ousted its owners and
took control of the company.
   Yegen denied that the company filed false financial reports.
   ``We stated the numbers as they appeared at the time,'' Yegen
told The Record of Hackensack.
   To hide its deepening financial woes, the state charged, the
company periodically transferred cash among related corporations
and fraudulently inflated its worth by claiming uncollectable debts
as assets.
   Company officials, including Yegen, also authorized up to $13
million in illegal dividends to shareholders and furnished
falsified reports to the state Department of Insurance, the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission, and other regulatory agencies,
the state alleged in the Superior Court suit.
   The company is also under investigation by the state attorney
general's office, which could file criminal charges.

<HEAD>Pilots Make Renewed Offer for United Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group led by United Airlines' pilots is making
a new $4 billion bid to take over the airline, saying the takeover
would benefit shareholders and energize workers.
   The pilots' offer _ their third in a year to propose an employee
takeover or restructuring of the carrier _ includes payment of $110
cash per outstanding share of Allegis Corp., the airline's parent
company, the refinancing of certain Allegis debts, and wage cuts
and other concessions to trim labor costs, said William R. Howard,
chairman of Airline Acquisition Corp.
   The corporation was formed by the United Air Lines Pilots Master
Executive Council to oversee a proposed takeover of the airline.
   ``We are excited about our proposal,'' Howard wrote in a letter
to Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of Allegis, which is based in suburban
Elk Grove Village.
   ``It offers Allegis' stockholders a significant premium over
current market for their shares,'' Howard said. ``It also offers
United ... an opportunity to be the premier airline in the United
States and employees an incentive to achieve that result by
allowing them to reap directly the fruits of their own labors.''
   Wolf said Wednesday he would have no immediate comment on the
offer.
   Allegis stock closed at $90 a share Wednesday, up $5.25 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The takeover would be financed through $3.1 billion in bank
loans provided by a syndicate of banks led by Chemical Bank, a $600
million bank credit facility, and the sale of $800 million in
subordinated notes, Howard said.
   Chemical and the investment firm Salomon Brothers have indicated
they were highly confident they could raise the needed financing,
the pilots group said.
   In a statement read by Allegis spokesman Dan Sheehy, Wolf said,
``The board of directors has indicated it will do what is in the
best interest of our shareholders and our employees, and we will
respond as soon as we have had a chance to understand whether this
is a valid offer.''
   The pilots' group made two offers last year to buy or
restructure the airline, and company officials rejected both.
   In his letter, Howard proposed a 25 percent pay cut for some
pilots, a reduction in company contributions to a pilots' benefit
plan, and changes in compensation and work-rules of non-contract
employees. Those moves, he said, would save as much as $350 million
a year.
   But the proposed takeover hinges on the union's success in a
lawsuit challenging the company's takeover provisions.
   Last week, the United pilots group sued the airline, along with
Allegis and the Machinists union, to strike down Machinists'
contract provisions that the lawsuit claimed could block an
employee takeover of United.
   Hank Krakowski, a pilots union spokesman, said at the time the
contract prohibited the pilots union from participating in an
employee ownership plan unless the Machinists agree to the terms.
   Unless parts of the Machinists' contract are declared
unenforceable by the U.S. District Court in Chicago, the
``protective covenants'' in them would be a ``significant
obstacle'' to Wednesday's proposed takeover, Howard said.
   Howard, former chairman of Piedmont Aviation, proposed in his
letter that he be chairman and chief executive officer of the new
company formed by the employee takeover.
   The proposal also states that all employees would participate
``on a fair and equitable basis, in the ownership of the company.''
   Howard also indicated that the group might seek to have its
proposal put to a vote of United shareholders once it resolved the
Machinists issue.

<HEAD>USG Announces Financing For Recapitalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. said it has received commitments to
finance a $2.2 billion recapitalization plan designed to thwart a
hostile takeover bid from Desert Partners L.P.
   In making the announcement Wednesday, USG Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert J. Day said, ``Let's make it clear. USG is
not for sale.''
   Earlier in the day Desert Partners, a partnership headed by two
Texas oilmen, offered to acquire the Chicago-based building
materials company in a negotiated deal that Wall Street analysts
estimated would be worth about $50 a share, or about $2.6 billion.
   Under one of two proposals, Desert Partners would pay $39 in
cash and $9 in bonds for each outstanding share of USG stock.
Shareholders also would receive stock representing 15 percent of a
new company.
   Under a variation, Desert Partners offered to pay $50 a share in
cash for 37.1 million, or 72 percent of USG's outstanding shares.
The remaining shares would be exchanged for bonds and stock in the
new company valued at ``the same aggregate amount,'' Desert
Partners said in a statement.
   Day said the ``proposals are not credible. Desert Partners'
financing commitments prohibit it from offering more than $45 per
share ''
   After jumping $1.62{ a share on Wednesday, USG declined 75 cents
a share to $45.87{ in early trading today on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Texas oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown, who head the
partnership, have been trying to negotiate a deal for some time. In
a letter to USG's board of directors on Wednesday, Wagner stressed
that ``the time has come for you to stop spending time and money in
an effort to avoid discussing an acquisition of USG with us.''
   Desert Partners also has a $42-a-share tender offer outstanding.
That bid, including cash for up to 39 million shares and debt
securities and warrants valued at $42 each for the remainder, has a
value of about $2.2 billion.
   USG has been fighting off Desert Partners for months.
   Under its recapitalization plan, USG would borrow $2.2 billion
to pay its shareholders $37 in cash, debentures with a face value
of $5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized company for each
common share. It said it would have to sell off its Masonite and
Kinkead businesses to finance the restructuring.
   Desert Partners owns about 9.9 percent of USG's shares and said
that as of Friday about 19.3 million shares, or 37.5 percent, had
been tendered under its $42-a-share offer.
   In addition to Masonite and Kinkead, USG owns United States
Gypsum, USG Interiors and several other operating subsidiaries.

   Brazil, the world's third largest sugar exporter,
has decided to join the new International Sugar Agreement, the
pact's spokesman said Thursday.
   Constantin Politoff said he hoped the necessary legal procedures
could be completed by May 18 when leading sugar-trading nations who
signed the agreement meet in London.
   Brazil had refused to join the new accord when it came into
force March 24 because it provides for the cost of running the
London-based International Sugar Organization to be borne most
heavily by producer nations.
   The agreement, reached at a London meeting called by the United
Nations, is set to run until the end of 1990.
   It has no provisions for controlling world sugar supplies and
prices but Politoff said he expects the May 18 meeting to discuss a
clause allowing members to negotiate a new pact with regulatory
powers.

   Four of the nation's biggest cable television
companies announced today the formation of a research and
development consortium that will focus on developing high
definition TV and other new technologies for the cable industry.
   Cable Television Laboratories Inc. is expected to have an annual
operating budget of $7.5 million, the companies said.
   Their announcement followed the National Cable Television
Association's three-day annual convention that ended here Tuesday
and an association board meeting Thursday.
   ``This will allow us to develop our own technology more
effectively and fully, and that will be good for consumers,'' who
can benefit from research to improve reliability, capacity and
picture quality of cable systems, said Trygve Myhren, chairman of
American Television and Communications Corp., the nation's
second-largest cable company.
   ``We want to make sure we're doing the best job for consumers
and be competitive with others,'' he said.
   Joining ATC in making an initial three-year financial commitment
to participate are Tele-Communications Inc., the largest U.S. cable
company, No. 3 Continental Cablevision and Comcast Cable
Communications, the seventh largest.
   Combined, these companies operate cable systems with more than
11 million subscribers, about a quarter of all the country's cable
subscribers.
   Other cable companies are expected to join the effort, said
Myhren. Monthly dues will be 2 cents per subscriber.
   The projected annual operating budget of $7.5 million is based
on anticipated contributions from cable systems serving a total of
about 31 million subscribers, he said.
   Cable Labs' early research will include how best to use high
definition TV technologies and fiber optics, he said.
   High definition TV, still in a development phase, is considered
the next generation in television. HDTV delivers a clearer picture
with more brilliant color on a wider screen.
   Fiber optics could significantly increase capacity of cable
systems and would help the cable industry compete with telephone
companies if laws restricting phone company participation in the
cable TV business were relaxed, as many in the cable industry fear
they might be.
   Unlike most of the wire now used by phone and cable companies,
fiber optic cable has capacity sufficient to bring voice, data and
video into the home through a single wire.
   ``Why can't that wire be our wire'' rather than the phone
company's, Myhren said.

   Some smokers will be able to purchase a virtually
smokeless cigarette during the last three months of this year as
the new product is test-marketed by one of the nation's largest
cigarette makers.
   Whether sales will make the enterprise worthwhile is open to
speculation, according to tobacco company analysts.
   ``I think it's a possibility, somewhere greater than zero, it
could be a major thing. It could be enough of an impact to slow
down some of the anti-smoking campaign,'' said Neal Kaplan, an
analyst with Interstate Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
   F. Ross Johnson, president and chief executive offer of RJR
Nabisco Inc., told company stockholders Wednesday the cigarette
would be available in ``lead markets'' sometime during the fourth
quarter.
   ``We are very positive about the prospects for this new
cigarette and believe it will provide consumers with another
alternative in their selection of cigarette brands and styles,''
Johnson said.
   The company remains secretive about its plans for the product,
developed in a three-year project code-named ``Operation Black
Hole,'' for competitive reasons.
   There will be no information on the test markets, the product's
brand name, projected sales or inventory until just before the
product is available, according to David Fishel, spokesman for RJR
subsidiary R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The product will be manufactured at one of R.J. Reynolds' plants
in the Winston-Salem area, Fishel said.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco manufactures about one-third of the almost
600 billion cigarettes sold domestically each year. Its brand names
include Winston, Salem, Camel and Vantage.
   The new cigarette will emit almost no smoke from the lit end,
and smoke exhaled will dissipate more rapidly that normal
cigarettes, R.J. Reynolds said.
   The cigarette does give off nicotine and carbon monoxide, and
medical groups including the American Medical Association and
American Heart Association have asked the federal Food and Drug
Administration to regulate the cigarette. A decision on that
request will take several months.
   Financial analysts are unsure of the impact the smokeless
cigarette will have on the cigarette market. RJR's stock fell 87{
cents to $49 in slow trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Kaplan, of Interstate Securities, said brand loyalty is high
among smokers, who might not be inclined to try the new cigarette.
   But smokers who find their habit restricted at work and in
public might turn to the product as an alternative, ``but keep
their pack of Winstons to smoke in their car,'' he said.
   Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
New York, said the product's development was a correct and
``aggressive'' response to the cigarette smoking controversy and
anti-smoking campaigns.
   But he said it was to early to tell whether the product will be
a success. No other tobacco companies have announced plans to
produce a similar cigarette, although they are figured to be
working on the technology. Adelman speculated competitors were
letting RJR Nabisco ``pave the way and go forward and have all the
initial headaches.''

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, with soybeans and oats moving higher
and corn and wheat posting early losses.
   The National Weather Service issued an extended forecast
Wednesday calling for normal rainfall in the Midwest, which
prompted some selling of corn futures, analysts said.
   Selling interest in the soybean pit evaporated quickly in the
wake of Wednesday's big losses. Soybean traders, worried that a
small crop this year could result in tight supplies, lately have
seemed as fickle as the weather forecasts they so closely monitor.
   ``One moment, they're optimistic about no rain, the next minute
they're optimisitic about more rain,'' said Jerry Gidel, a grain
analyst with G.H. Miller & Co. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures continued to feel pressure from the approaching
winter wheat harvest, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3 a bushel; corn was { cent to 1\
cents lower with May at $2.04\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent
higher with May at $1.60{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1}
cents higher with May at $6.85{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .58 cent higher with June at 72.05
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent higher with
May at 79.77 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .58 cent higher
with June at 51.02 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent
to .78 cent higher with May at 51.95 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday; pork futures were
mostly higher.

<HEAD>Two Utilities Settle In Washington Public Power Supply System Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more public utility districts that are
defendants in the securities fraud case brought against the
Washington Public Power Supply System have announced out-of-court
settlements.
   The two, Kittitas County and Ferry County, will not have to
raise rates to cover the $1.75 million they agreed to pay to be let
out of the case, said Malcolm Harris, a Seattle attorney
representing the utilities.
   The case was filed in 1983 after WPPSS defaulted on bond
payments for two scrapped nuclear plants.
   The settlements and defense costs, if approved by a federal
court judge, will be paid by the utilities' insurance companies,
Harris said.
   Neither utility was among the 88 participants in the two nuclear
plants, Nos. 4 and 5, but both are members of WPPSS and were named
as defendants in a federal suit brought by holders of the bonds
that financed the two plants. The plants were terminated in early
1982.
   The settlement, reached on April 27, was not made public until
Wednesday.
   The lawsuit is scheduled for trial Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.
   The Ferry-Kittitas settlement was the ninth to be announced
since the suit was filed and brings total settlement amounts to
about $242 million. Among others that were settled were the bond
underwriters (for $92 million) and Seattle ($50 million). Three
other public utility districts that were participants in the
projects settled for $20 million.
   WPPSS terminated the two plants, No. 4 at Hanford and No. 5 at
Satsop, in 1982, after $2.25 billion had been invested. No. 4 was
24 percent complete and No. 5 was 16 percent finished.
   Termination of the plants eventually resulted in default on the
$2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance the construction of Nos. 4
and 5. It was the biggest default in the history of the municipal
bond market. Most of the litigation has been consolidated into the
case set for trial in Tucson.

   Mike Halstead mopped his face with a
towel as he walked away from an exhausting session that had nothing
to do with making cars at the local Mazda Motor Corp. plant.
   Halstead headed for the shower while other Mazda employees
continued grunting through repetitions on weight machines, pedaled
away on manual exercise bikes and worked on balance and agility on
a simulated cross-country ski unit in one corner of the Flat Rock
plant's fitness center.
   ``Job One'' _ the first Mazda car made at Flat Rock _ rolled off
the assembly line in September. In November, the company opened the
$1 million fitness center in a 90,000-square-foot section of one of
the plant buildings.
   Fitness programs, once the reserve of management, are moving
from the front office to the plant floor at many companies, said
Thomas Merry, Midwest region vice president for Fitness Systems.
``That's where we see the direction of this thing going.''
   ``It's been an administrative headquarters, white-collar kind of
phenomenon,'' said Merry, whose Los Angeles-based company designs,
sets up and operates fitness programs. Now, he said, ``We do see
more plant sites getting involved.''
   Reasons range from simple economics _ an unhealthy worker costs
more to keep on the job _ to companies' desire to be involved with
employees as a way of keeping them involved in their work.
   At Flat Rock, the matter was never in question, said Don R.
Kricho, personnel safety and health director.
   Japanese corporations routinely provide extras for improving the
health and lifestyle of their employees. Single workers may even
live in company dormitories there.
   ``It was always pretty much taken for granted that we were going
to do something in terms of a fitness center,'' Kricho said. ``In
Japan, it's something they do.''
   A study conducted last year on the StayWell program Control Data
Corp. of Minneapolis implemented for its employees linked higher
health insurance claims with various risk factors, including lack
of exercise, smoking, excess weight and high cholesterol.
   For example, sedentary employees have 30 percent more hospital
days than those who get adequate exercise and employees who smoke a
pack or more of cigarettes a day have 18 percent higher medical
claims costs than nonsmokers.
   ``There are some very solid, practical business reasons for
wanting to do this,'' Mazda's Kricho said. ``Fit, happy workers
produce more. They are less likely to be absent, they are less
likely to be injured.''
   Before and after work at Flat Rock, as early as 5:30 a.m. and as
late as 9 p.m., the sounds of weight machines, dribbling
basketballs and squeaking sneakers, footfalls on the one-fifth mile
track, volleys on the tennis courts, golf balls driven into a net,
ping-pong games, and players' shouts echo under the high plant
ceiling.
   ``Some nights I call over here and it's so loud you can't even
talk on the phone,'' said Cynthia T. Nemon, plant medical services
coordinator and fitness center director.
   Domestic companies get the message. General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co. plants offer a scattering of exercise rooms and
aerobics classes. Chrysler Corp. is surveying some assembly plant
orkers to see if they want aerobics classes.
   Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek, Mich., offers a ``healthy
lifestyle'' program for employees that includes newsletters and
reimbursement for participation in fitness activities, said Dick
Lovell, company communications manager.
   Kellogg opened a fitness center at its corporate headquarters in
1986 and followed in January with a center at its Battle Creek
cereal plant, where the exercise bikes, rowing machines,
weight-lifting equipment, jogging track and aerobics room are in
such demand among the 3,200 employees that hours have been extended
to midnight, Lovell said.
   At Flat Rock, Mazda's center is part of an involvement with
employees similar to that in its Japanese plants.
   The number of Japanese employees at Flat Rock _ 600 of the
plant's 3,500 _ eventually will fall to about 100. But the company
wants U.S. employees to be instilled with Japanese-style team
spirit.
   ``We were not so much interested in building a recreation center
for employees. It's great if they want to use it for that. But we
wanted to emphasize the team concept,'' Kricho said. ``We were
interested in building a facility that would cater to team
activity.''
   Team activity caught on immediately. Nemon said intensely
involved employees formed committees for baseball, volleyball,
weight training, running, martial arts, aerobics and golf.
   ``All the committees have established classes and leagues,'' she
said. ``The employees themselves completely run those activities.
They have 20 different teams in the basketball league.''
   ``I worked at Jeep before. They never had anything like this,''
said Halstead, just out of training as an assembly worker at Mazda.
   He compared the center favorably with outside programs,
explaining that he and his wife had spent $400 at the Y, which
didn't have a place to run.
   ``I can't wait till they get that heavy bag up,'' he said.
   Kricho said he envisions annual physicals for employees, with
prescriptions for good health habits _ quitting smoking, weight
control, cholesterol reduction and hypertension control.
   Center activities already go far beyond traditional gymnasium
fare, Nemon said, including a diet support group and available
literature on subjects ranging from smoking to personal
relationships.
   Kricho said Japanese companies view corporate responsibility as
going beyond a paycheck.
   And he said, ``If we are responsible for human beings _
spiritual and mental well being and everything else _ a fitness
center becomes a very central ingredient, a focal point.''

<HEAD>Brewers Look to Light Beers for Growth</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are heady days for light beer.
   While overall growth in the beer business has flattened out,
light beer sales remain effervescent. They have nearly doubled in
the past seven years and now account for more than 24 percent of
the overall beer market.
   The major brewers are encouraging the growth by spending nearly
$220 million a year on advertising light beers, about a third of
their total ad budgets, according to Leading National Advertisers,
which tracks such spending.
   In the latest indication of the importance brewers attach to the
segment, Miller Brewing Co. recently began testing a light version
of its Miller High Life Genuine Draft beer, which has been on the
market less than two years.
   Industry executives and analysts say the nation's weight- and
health-consciousness continues to propel the segment's growth.
   ``You can drink the same amount of beer and take in less
calories. What more can one ask out of life?'' said Emanuel
Goldman, who follows the beer industry for Montgomery Securities in
San Francisco.
   The light beers typically have a third fewer calories than the
140-150 calories in regular beers and slightly less alcohol.
   Beverage industry analysts say another important ingredient in
the success of light beers has been the ability of brewers to make
and market a drink that traditional beer drinkers aren't ashamed to
order.
   In the 1960s, industry watchers said light beers had been
pitched mainly as diet drinks for women.
   Michael Bellas, president of the research firm Beverage
Marketing Corp. in New York, said the country wasn't ready for a
low-calorie approach then.
   Pitching the drink to women may also have alienated some men,
which is something brewers normally try to avoid since men
reportedly consume about 80 percent of all the beer sold.
   Robert S. Weinberg, a brewing industry consultant and professor
of marketing at the John M. Olin School of Business at Washington
University in St. Louis, said another flaw in the light beers of
the 1960s was taste.
   ``They were horrible, and usually died a fast death. They didn't
taste like beer and were poorly marketed,'' he said.
   Milwaukee-based Miller began to turn that around in 1973 when it
started testing a new light beer under the Lite name it bought from
another brewer.
   ``Everything you always wanted in a beer ... and less,'' was the
original theme. The brewer used former athletes and celebrities to
sell its beer, an approach that it continues to use 15 years later.
   The approach infuriated critics who said it encouraged young
people to drink, but it helped Miller convince customers that it
was acceptable for tough guys to drink light beer.
   Others brewers were skeptical about Lite's chances and stayed
out of that end of the market for a few years.
   ``It was the only significant consumer packaged good industry
where a company could bring out imaginative new products and not
have competitors follow suit immediately,'' Weinberg said.
   By the time others woke up, Miller had a grip on the market that
it has been slow to yield.
   ``We will never enjoy that kind of competitive advantage
again,'' admitted Miller spokesman Bob Bertini.
   Beverage Marketing said 45.1 million barrels of light beer were
sold last year, up 7.1 percent from the previous year, while sales
of all kinds of beer slipped 0.2 percent to 187.2 million barrels.
There are about 70 light brands.
   Sales of Miller Lite were flat at about 19.3 million barrels,
but it is the second-best selling beer overall (Budweiser is No. 1
at about 50 million barrels) and holds a 2-to-1 lead in share of
the light beer segment.
   Its main competition comes from Bud Light from Anheuser-Busch
Inc. of St. Louis, which sold an estimated 8.6 million barrels last
year, and from Coors Light from Adolph Coors Co. of Golden, Colo.,
which sold 7.9 million barrels.
   Beverage Marketing estimates Lite held 42.8 percent of the light
segment in 1987 compared with 19.1 percent for Bud Light and 17.5
percent for Coors Light.
   Bud Light has grown at a furious pace since its introduction in
1982, scoring well in consumer surveys with ads that show quirky
responses to customers who ask for a ``light'' without specifying
the brand and with commercials featuring party animal Spuds
MacKenzie.
   Coors Light, introduced in 1977, has been advertised as the
silver bullet that ``won't slow you down'' and ``the right beer
now.'' Last year, its sales surpassed those of Coors premium beer
for the first time.
   Other leading light beers include Michelob Light at 5.8 percent
of the market and Natural Light at 5.1 percent from Anheuser-Busch.
   Stroh Brewery Co. of Detroit has captured about 6.2 percent of
the market with two brands, Old Milwaukee Light and Stroh Light.
   Light beer accounted for 24.1 percent of overall beer sales in
1987, up from 13.1 percent in 1980. Can its share growth continue?
   Weinberg said the increasing incidence of brewers attaching
their regular brands' names to light beers show brewers are taking
the segment seriously even if they are doing so partly just to get
more shelf space.
   Others say as the median age of the population moves higher,
even more people will find themselves worrying about their weight.
   ``Thirty percent of the market doesn't seem to be
unattainable,'' said Eric Shepard, executive editor of the industry
newsletter Beer Marketers Insights. ``But can it get to 40 percent,
I just don't know.''

   The stock market showed a broad loss today as
traders warily awaited the latest monthly report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 18.74 to
2,017.57 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 350 up, 939

   The Labor Department is scheduled to report Friday on the
employment situation for April. Economists generally expect the
data to show continuing job gains.
   But analysts say they expect investors to respond negatively to
any evidence of increasing strength in the economy, interpreting it
as a portent of mounting inflationary pressures and an upward
influence on interest rates.
   Wall Streeters reason that the Federal Reserve is likely to give
the employment figures considerable weight in deciding whether and
when to tighten its credit policy.
   Yields on long-term Treasury bonds have lately been hovering
around 9 percent. If they were to go much higher, brokers say, they
would pose a formidable competitive threat to stocks.
   General Motors led the active list, down ] at 75| on volume of

   Kraft Inc. has agreed to sell its Duracell
battery unit for $1.8 billion in cash to a new company formed by a
New York investment firm and Duracell's management, the companies
said today.
   The New York investment firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.,
specializes in finding, financing and investing in management
buyouts.
   Kraft had said it planned to sell its profitable Duracell
division, the world's leading maker of alkaline consumer batteries,
to concentrate on its food business.
   ``The sale price is fair and adequately compensates Kraft for
this fine business,'' Kraft Chairman John M. Richman said in a
statement.
   Henry R. Kravis, a partner in Kohlberg Kravis, called the
definitive agreement ``the first step in the creation of a great
new independent consumer products company.''
   ``We are very excited about the future growth prospects of the
company and our future association with the management and
employees of Duracell,'' he said.
   Duracell, headquartered in Bethel, Conn., earned $53.9 million
on sales of $1.1 billion last year.
   Kraft had 1987 sales, excluding Duracell, of $9.9 billion.
   Kraft said it would use the proceeds from the sale to purchase
up to 12 milion shares of its own stock, to reduce its debt and to
``be prepared'' for food-related acquisition opportunities.

<NOTE>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with Fletcher remarks. Picks up 2nd graf pvs,

<TEXT>
   NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said
today that space budget levels being discussed in Congress will
cripple America's space program and bring 30 years of progress to a
halt.
   ``It is not a pretty prospect to imagine the United States as a
second-rate or even a third-rate power in space,'' Fletcher said in
remarks for a symposium on science education. ``That is what this
country will quickly become if Congress doesn't act responsibly and
give NASA the resources it needs to do its job.''
   The Reagan administdration asked Congress to give NASA $11.5
billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But key lawmakers have
said that the agency can expect no more than $10.7 billion and a
House budget resolution would slash the amount to $10.2 billion.
   ``The civil space program will be stopped in its tracks'' at
those levels, Fletcher said, and it ``would spell death to the
space station, the key to our future in space.'' He said the space
shuttle would be able to operate only at a reduced flight rate in
the years ahead.
   At an authorization hearing Wednesday, the House space science
subcommittee turned its back on a Reagan administration plan to
sign a contract this year to lease a robot space factory from a
private company.
   ``The probabilities are that there is going to be only one lousy
bidder on it and that's a group of guys who couldn't sell to the
private market,'' said Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa.
   That fear and a suspicion that building the factory might drain
funds and future support for the planned large U.S. space station
prompted the House space science subcommittee to vote Wednesday to
prohibit contracts for the Commercially Developed Space Facility.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will be required
to obtain express permission from Congress first.
   Nagle said the proposed lease was ``a project to benefit a group
of people in Houston.''
   Space Industries Inc. of Houston has proposed leasing 70 percent
of a robot space factory to the government for five years at $140
million a year and leasing the rest to private industry. The
facility would be carried into orbit aboard the space shuttle and
be serviced periodically by astronauts.
   ``A vote for this is a vote to cripple the space station,''
Nagle said. ``A vote for this is a vote to intimidate the efforts
to build a space station. A vote for this is to reward an
incompetent presentation by the space agency that this committee
should not tolerate.''
   His reference was to complaints by members of both the House and
Senate that NASA, which once said it had no use for such a
facility, reversed itself but failed to make a case for why the
space factory was needed.
   ``NASA was obviously told to change its position,'' said Rep.
Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of the House space science
subcommittee.
   The panel voted against a Nagle amendment that NASA should not
even be allowed to issue a request for industry proposals for the
facility. But it expressly forbade the agency to sign any contracts
for it.
   The instructions are included in a bill approved by the
subcommittee Wednesday to authorize $11.5 billion for NASA in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. That amount, an increase of $2.5
billion over the current spending, was asked for by President
Reagan and includes $967 million for the proposed U.S. space
station.
   The space factory prohibition decision is a rebuff to Reagan
whose space policy, announced in February, included the intention
to sign a contract in midsummer for such a facility to be available
by late 1993.
   Reagan's overall funding request for NASA also could be in
trouble. The House and Senate appropriations committees, which
actually allocate funds, have said they will not approve more than
$10.7 billion for the agency.
   The committee's bill also authorizes funds for the Advanced
Communications Technology Satellite, which the administration
opposes; it would grant arrest powers to private security guards on
NASA facilities; and it would require NASA contractors to maintain
a drug-free workplace.

   It was noontime in front of a bank of elevators,
and takeover artist Carl C. Icahn, Texaco Inc.'s largest
stockholder, was cornered.
   Yes or no? the reporters asked. Would he vote his shares in
favor of the company's bankruptcy reorganization plan or not?
   Icahn, who had all but said yes at a press conference, continued
to hedge, lunging for the elevator as the ``down'' bell rang.
   But each time the doors opened, the car was full. Packed. No
room for the tall, gangly Icahn. The doors closed, and the
questions resumed.
   Two edgy advisers pulled their boss aside. After a brief,
animated discussion, Icahn flicked the back of his hand, walked
back to the reporters and fired off his answer: ``Yes. I'm voting
for the plan.''
   Always his own boss, the brassy corporate bearhunter is at once
a book that's open and shut, a master strategist who knows the
value of a well-kept secret, but who's not afraid to make a quick
decision.
   Icahn _ who recently described himself in Fortune Magazine as
``obsessive in everything I do'' _ draws attention easily, in
manner and presence.
   He stands over 6 feet tall, and his face bears a startling
resemblance to comedian Mel Brooks. Often reluctant to speak to the
press, he is actually quite loquacious in person, people who know
him say.
   ``I talk to him all the time. I mean, I listen to him all the
time. There's a difference,'' joked Texaco President James W.
Kinnear recently.
   Icahn's involvement with Texaco has been no laughing matter to
Texaco's managers _ especially Kinnear.
   They believe he wants to gain control of Texaco in order to milk
its assets dry _ a process that would leave the company in
shambles. Holding 14.8 percent of Texaco's stock, Icahn has
demanded that Texaco put itself up for sale, and has nominated his
own slate of candidates _ including himself _ for the company's
board of directors.
   Not long ago, more than a few industry analysts were betting
privately that Icahn would win, saying disgruntled shareholders
were itching to get back at Texaco's management for its
multibillion-dollar Pennzoil debacle.
   Now, they say, the tide may have shifted in Texaco's favor,
especially since the company reinstated its annual dividend to
shareholders.
   Texaco on Tuesday asked a federal court to block all of Icahn's
maneuverings against the company, charging him with a long list of
securities laws violations.
   Icahn denies the allegations and says he's not through with
Texaco yet.
   ``I've learned one thing: What counts is which way the tide is
going _ on the last day,'' he said.
   Whatever happens, it is generally agreed that if anyone could
dislodge the status quo at Texaco, it's Icahn, the man whose very
name can send shivers through boardrooms across the land.
   The 52-year-old financier has made his reputation by buying up
shares in companies with assets worth more than their stock price,
then selling the companies off later, in whole or in pieces, at a
higher price.
   Sometimes companies agree to buy the stock back at a premium to
get him to leave them alone, a practice known as greenmail. Other
times, as with Trans World Airlines Inc. and ACF Industries Inc.,
Icahn has retained a management role, but always with the intent of
using the company as a vehicle for later takeover attempts.
   Recently, for example, he offered to buy the 23 percent of TWA
stock he does not already own. TWA holds nearly 60 percent of his
Texaco stake. By taking the company private, Icahn would be freer
to sell TWA or use it as an investment vehicle.
   One way or another, Icahn almost always walks away millions of
dollars richer. Some of his more than 20 takeover targets have
included: Chesebrough-Ponds Inc.; Marshall Field & Co.; Hammermill
Paper Co.; Phillips Petroleum Co.; Unocal Corp. and USX Corp., in
which he still holds a sizable stake.
   To his critics, Icahn is little more than a pirate in a coat and
tie.
   Icahn says the real villains are corporate chieftans who are
wasteful, inefficient and more interested in protecting their
high-salaried jobs than looking out for the interests of their real
bosses _ the stockholders.
   That, more than the money _ which he does not need _ is what
keeps him in the takeover game, Icahn told The Associated Press.
   ``I think there's no question there's a competitive force in me.
But it's also a sense of outrage about the way companies are run,''
he said.
   In the case of Texaco, Icahn has said he would withdraw his
slate of board candidates if the company were put up for sale at a
minimum $55 a share. Selling his stake at that level would net
Icahn about $757 million before costs, compared with roughly $540
million, if he sold out now.
   But Icahn's holding is too big to unload on the open market
quickly without diluting its value. Unless he wants to stay in the
oil business, Icahn's only other choice may be to sell to another
big entity, such as an oil company.
   Some were watching hungrily as Texaco emerged from a year of
bankruptcy court protection, paying $3 billion to Pennzoil Co. _ to
settle the lawsuit Texaco lost over its 1984 acquisition of Getty
Oil Co. _ and promising to unload billions of dollars in assets.
   Analysts say those potential buyers could provide a way for
Icahn to make his profit _ without having to worry about running
the company.
   Actually, Icahn's management has been paying off at both TWA,
which he took over in January 1986, and ACF, a conglomerate he
bought in 1984 and stripped down to its core railroad-car business.
   Airline industry analysts acknowledge that TWA has recovered
remarkably under Icahn, reporting its best earnings ever in 1987
after a string of big losses. But they also say he was lucky,
particularly in winning labor concessions from unions eager to
escape Texas Air's Frank Lorenzo, whom they perceived as anti-union.
   In the end, Icahn is ``in it for himself primarily,'' said Louis
A. Marckesano of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``I don't think he
really cares what happens to TWA in the future ... He's a financier
who happens to own an airline.''
   Icahn argues, in response, that TWA would have been bankrupt, if
he hadn't come along: ``Sure, we used a lot of leverage to do this
thing, but what's wrong with that? Basically, we saved the
airline.''
   Indeed, regardless of his intentions, Icahn's financial wizardry
often evokes praise.
   ``The guy is a deal man ... one of the toughest negotiators
you'll ever see,'' said John Pincavage of PaineWebber Inc. ``We
ought to use him against the Russians. I mean, this guy is good.''

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange dropped
Thursday as the market fell victim to declining prices on Wall
Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
5.2 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,789.5.
   Share prices had opened slightly lower but picked up some steam
at midmorning following reports of favorable company earnings.
   But by midafternoon, London stocks began to feel some of the
pressure from Wall Street's soggy opening and drifted lower.
   Some London dealers said computer-generated program-selling on
Wall Street, which accounted for a sharp loss Wednesday, lingered
in the market Thursday. By the close of London trading, Wall
Street's most widely watched index, the Dow Jones industrial
average, was down 17.91 points at 2,018.40.
   Pervasive nervousness also contributed to the London selloff,
dealers said, after Wednesday's news that the British Department of
Trade and Industry would refer the Kuwait Investment Office
purchase of British Petroleum Co. shares to the Mergers and
Monopolies Commission.

   The stock market lost more ground today as
traders warily awaited the latest monthly report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.25 to
2,019.06 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 9 to 5 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 500 up, 946
down and 473 unchanged.
   The Labor Department is scheduled to report Friday on the
employment situation for April. Economists generally expect the
data to show continuing job gains.
   But analysts say they expect investors to respond negatively to
any evidence of increasing strength in the economy, interpreting it
as a portent of mounting inflationary pressures and an upward
influence on interest rates.
   Wall Streeters reason that the Federal Reserve is likely to give
the employment figures considerable weight in deciding whether and
when to tighten its credit policy.
   Yields on long-term Treasury bonds have lately been hovering
around 9 percent. If they were to go much higher, brokers say, they
would pose a formidable competitive threat to stocks.
   General Motors led the active list, down ] at 75| on volume of
more than 26 million shares. Analysts said much of the activity in
the stock involved short-term trading strategies keyed to the
company's impending quarterly dividend.
   Bethlehem Steel dropped ] to 19\. The company announced an
offering of 10 million new shares at $19 apiece.
   Among other blue chips, International Business Machines lost ~

\ to 26[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.81 to 146.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.04 at 301.50.

<HEAD>Hawaii Still Top Vacation Choice, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii remains the most popular choice of
Americans for summer vacation travel, according to a survey
released Thursday by American Express Co.
   The forecast, based on a mail survey of 350 American Express
travel agencies nationwide, showed 27 percent of the agents polled
named Hawaii as the top choice for vacation travel this summer. The
other leading vacation destinations were Europe with 21 percent,
and Florida and the Caribbean with 18 percent.
   Despite the fall of the dollar against major foreign currencies,
the agents said most of their clients planning European vacations
this summer are not changing their plans.
   Florida ranked as the leading family vacation spot, according to
72.5 percent of the agents surveyed, largely because of Walt Disney
World in Orlando.
   Mexico is the summer destination growing fastest in popularity,
according to the survey. It found some regional differences,
however: Mexico is the fastest growing for travelers from the
Northeast and the South, while the majority of agents in the
Midwest named Europe as gaining quickest in popularity.
   For vacationers from the West Coast, the South Pacific _
including Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti _ is growing the
fastest.
   Within the United States, the 10 most popular cities for
vacations this summer, in order of preference, are: Honolulu, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans, Washington, Miami,
Denver, Boston and Chicago.
   The survey also found that price and quality of service are the
key factors determining the choice of a vacation. Cruises are the
most popular type of vacation planned for this summer, followed by
all-inclusive resort vacations, escorted tour packages and weekend
fly-drive packages, the survey showed.
   Single men most often choose all-inclusive resort packages for
summer vacations, while cruises are the top choice of single women,
according to the survey.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures closed lower Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade while soybean prices advanced due to
worsening crop weather forecasts, analysts said.
   Private forecasts suggested the amounts of rain this weekend in
the western Corn Belt could be lighter than anticipated. With
soybean planting just getting under way, the market is especially
sensitive to any indications of dry weather.
   Soybeans for May delivery traded as high as $6.92{ a bushel at
mid-session but profit-taking later in the day brought prices down
three to four cents, analysts said.
   Wheat continued to slump in anticipation of a plentiful
winter-wheat harvest.
   Memphis-based Sparks Commodities predicted a winter-wheat
harvest of nearly 1.64 billion bushels, up about 70 million bushels
from last year despite lower plantings. Other estimates ranged as
low as 1.55 billion bushels.
   ``There may be some people evening up ahead of Tuesday's
Agriculture Report on wheat production estimates,'' said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   Corn prices drifted lower amid sluggish export demand, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 4} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.96} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 2\ cents lower with May at $2.02} a bushel; oats were \ cent to

   Assets of the nation's 426 money market mutual
funds edged up $611.7 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The increase to $273.61 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.47 billion decline in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous week's decline had originally been reported as
$1.62 billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 212 general purpose funds rose $85.2 million to $82.69
billion and assets of 117 institutional funds rose $1.94 billion to
$76.04 billion.
   But the trade group said assets 97 broker-dealer funds fell
$1.41 billion to $114.88 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds slipped
in the week ended Tuesday to 6.13 percent from 6.14 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.11 percent from 6.09 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, down from 42 days the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.68 percent as of Wednesday from 5.67 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super

   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.86

   A.H. Belo Corp. shareholders have approved a
board-backed anti-takeover plan that allows the media company to
issue a new class of stock that enhances voting rights of existing
stockowners.
   Under the plan, approved at Belo's annual meeting Wednesday, the

common stock for each common share outstanding to shareholders of
record May 13. Each share of that special series carries 10 votes.
   Distribution of the Series B stock is expected May 19, the
company said.
   The plan, though, has been the subject of a lawsuit by New York
shareholder William Steiner. He filed suit Tuesday to block the
issue in Delaware, where Belo is incorporated.
   By providing more votes per share Belo will make itself a more
difficult target for future hostile takeover attempts.
   Belo is the parent of the Dallas Morning News. In addition, it

Norfolk, Va., and Tulsa, Okla. It also operates Dallas-Fort Worth

   Kraft Inc. said Thursday it was selling its
fast-growing Duracell battery division to a group led by management
and the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in a cash
deal worth $1.8 billion.
   Kraft said it agreed to sell Duracell Inc., the world's leading
maker of alkaline consumer batteries, to concentrate on its core
food business.
   Proceeds from the sale would be used to buy back up to 12
million Kraft shares, to reduce debt and for possible food-related
acquisition, the company said.
   ``... We are excited about the many opportunities available to
Kraft in the food industry, and the sale of Duracell will enable us
to focus our total management and financial resources on those
opportunities,'' said Kraft Chairman John M. Richman.
   Kraft informed its shareholders of the definitive agreement at
its annual meeting Thursday in Chicago. Kraft, which acquired
Bethel, Conn.-based Duracell in 1980, had announced in December
that it planned to sell the unit.
   Henry R. Kravis, a partner in New York-based Kohlberg Kravis,
called the agreement ``the first step in the creation of a great
new independent consumer-products company.''
   ``We are very excited about the future growth prospects of the
company and our future association with the management and
employees of Duracell,'' he said.
   Some analysts expressed surprise at the price Kohlberg Kravis
agreed to pay for Duracell, which had been widely expected to fetch
between $1 billion and $1.2 billion.
   ``It never ceases to amaze me what a good brand is worth in
today's marketplace,'' said John W. McMillin of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``This was pleasant news for Kraft shareholders.''
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kraft rose
$1.50 a share to close at $53.50.
   McMillin said Kohlberg Kravis probably was attracted by
Duracell's strong growth potential.
   Duracell, which has about 9,000 employees, had an operating
income of $140 million and sales of $1.1 billion last year. Kraft's
1987 sales, excluding Duracell, were $9.9 billion.
   Duracell's copper-top alkaline batteries account for about 28
percent of all U.S. consumer battery sales.
   The company is tied with Ralston Purina Co.'s Eveready unit for
the lead in domestic sales of alkaline batteries, the
fastest-growing segment of the battery market.
   Together, Eveready and Duracell have more than 80 percent of the
domestic alkaline-battery market, McMillin said. Duracell does not
compete in the carbon-zinc battery market, which is dominated by
Eveready.
   ``With all these Walkmans and portable tape recorders that have
to use batteries, the alkaline segment has been exhibiting strong
volume growth and that is what had to attract these investors,''
McMillin said.
   Analysts said they did not expect Duracell to diversify as a
stand-alone company.
   ``It could happen in time, but certainly not immediately,'' said
Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York.
   ``When you do a leveraged buyout you've got to use the cash
generated internally to reduce debt, so you've got to pretty much
stick to your own business.''
   Duracell is being sold to Duracell Holdings Corp., the new
company formed by Kohlberg Kravis and Duracell's management.
Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a
company is acquired mainly through borrowed funds repaid from the
target company's profits or asset sales.

   Prices fell the second straight session in the
stock market Thursday as traders warily awaited the latest monthly
report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 22.05 on
Wednesday, fell another 16.08 to 2,020.23.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in New
York Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 559 up, 925 down and 509
unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 171.84 million shares, against 141.32
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index dropped
.78 to 146.51.
   The Labor Department is scheduled to report Friday on the
employment situation for April. Economists generally expect the
data to show continuing job gains.
   But analysts say investors may well respond negatively to any
evidence of increasing strength in the economy, interpreting it as
a portent of mounting inflationary pressures and an upward
influence on interest rates.
   Wall Streeters reason that the Federal Reserve is likely to give
the employment figures considerable weight in deciding whether or
when to tighten its credit policy.
   Yields on long-term Treasury bonds have lately been hovering
around 9 percent. If they were to go much higher, brokers say, they
would stand to pose a formidable competitive threat to stocks.
   General Motors led the active list, down \ at 75} on volume of
more than 26 million shares. Analysts said much of the activity in
the stock involved short-term trading strategies keyed to the
company's impending quarterly dividend.
   Bethlehem Steel dropped { to 19[. The company announced an
offering of 10 million new shares at $19 apiece.
   Among other blue chips, International Business Machines lost ~
to 111\; Sears Roebuck { to 35\; Merck 1~ to 155\; DuPont 1\ to 84,
and American Telephone & Telegraph \ to 26[.
   Kraft rose 1{ to 53{. The company said it would sell its
Duracell battery business, use the proceeds to buy back as many as
12 million of its shares, and increase its dividend.
   Kaisertech Ltd., which said its directors appointed a committee
to consider a sale or buyout, jumped 2~ to 18.
   Cooper Cos. gained 2[ to 14}. The company said it would put each
of its principal businesses up for sale after the government
opposed its plans to sell its contact lens operations to
Schering-Plough Corp.
   On the downside, Learonal dropped 4{ to 16] on word that Asarco
ended talks about acquiring the company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $13.84 billion, or 0.53
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 199.05 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.87 to 301.66, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.53 at 258.79.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
2.11 to 379.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.39, down .15.

   Loews Corp., a diversified holding company, said
Thursday its first-quarter profit nearly tripled on strong results
from insurance operations and gains on investments.
   Loews, which also has interests in hotels, tobacco, broadcasting
and watches, said its earnings rose to $231.4 million, or $3.03 a
share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with $87.1
million, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first quarter rose 19 percent to $2.5 billion
from $2.1 billion a year earlier.
   The company said its income from continuing operations rose to
$213.4 million compared with $79.1 million a year earlier.
   It said it realized $90.4 million in investment gains on
securities in the latest quarter in contrast with investment losses
of $9.8 million a year earlier. Income from continuing operations
in insurance rose to $147.3 million from $74.8 million a year
earlier.
   The latest results also included an $18.1 million gain in the
latest quarter from its 24.9 percent stake in the broadcast giant
CBS Inc. that resulted from CBS' sale of its records group.
   Loews has an 82 percent stake in the insurance concern CNA
Financial Corp., a 94 percent stake in the Bulova Watch Co., owns
the tobacco concern that markets Newport, True and Kent cigarettes
and operates Loews hotels.
   Loews' chairman, Laurence A. Tisch, is chief executive of CBS.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Agree Not to Block Stevens Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorneys general of North Carolina,
South Carolina and New York said Thursday they would not block the
takeover of J.P. Stevens & Co. in exchange for commitments to keep
the textile giant's plants open for two years.
   Stevens is being acquired for $1.22 billion by rival fabric
maker West Point-Pepperell Inc., which plans to split Stevens's
assets with two other companies.
   ``While these commitments do not guarantee absolute protection
of all plants and jobs, these commitments do provide significant
protections to Stevens workers,'' North Carolina Attorney General
Lacy Thornburg said at a news conference.
   The states reserved the right to go to court later ``if it is
necessary to protect competition in the textile industry,''
Thornburg said.
   The attorneys general had threatened to file a suit on Friday
over the takeover, which will see Pepperell acquire Stevens' sheet
and towel operations. Pepperell plans sell some operations to
another textile producer, Bibb Co. of Macon, Ga., to satisfy
federal antitrust concerns.
   Odyssey Partners, a Wall Street investment firm that had been
vying with Pepperell for Stevens, will get the company's other
operations, including its carpet and industrial fabrics plants.
   In return for the states agreeing not to file suit Friday, West
Point-Pepperell and Bibb agreed not to close plants for two years
and make good-faith efforts not to reduce current employment
levels; to provide preferential consideration to former Stevens
managers, and to continue to use and maintain present contracts
with local vendors.
   Odyssey Partners said in writing it does not anticipate plant
closings and will not engage in significant plant closings for two
years.
   Stevens employs about 34,000 in its 54 plants.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp., citing
declines in government defense contracts, announced Thursday that
it will halt production at its airplane plant here, idling about
1,000 employees.
   Dent Williams, a spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based Rockwell,
said production would be phased out over the next 15 months.
   ``There's just not enough defense business out there to support
all the aircraft facilities,'' Williams said.
   Rockwell produced major structural components for the B-1B
bomber for six years at the government-owned plant here. The last
of the B-1Bs was delivered to the Air Force last week, Rockwell
said.
   The company said the plant's current employment of 1,000 is down
from a peak of 7,200 at the height of B-1B production.
   Rockwell said it will continue aircraft activities at plants in
California and Tulsa, Okla.
   There was no immediate response from the Rockwell union to the
company announcement.
   The Columbus plant was built in 1942 for the Navy and was
operated for eight years by the Curtiss-Wright Corp. A predecessor
of Rockwell, North American Aviation Inc., began operating the
plant in 1950 and continued to do so after the plant's ownership
switched to the Air Force.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Surge On Strong Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices climbed sharply Thursday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as cash markets reflected strong demand for
pork products and chart signals indicated the market was ripe for a
rally.
   Most cattle futures also advanced.
   On other markets, energy futures were higher; grains and
soybeans were mixed; gold gained slightly; and stock-index futures
retreated.
   The movement of hogs to market this week has been running about
equal to a year ago but slaughters are up and so are prices, said
Tom O'Hare, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
& Co.
   ``Today, more than anythying, I think the cash markets did a
little better than most people had thought,'' he said. ``And with
beef as high as it is, I think retailers are probably going to be
featuring more pork, so the demand is there, too.''
   Technical factors also played a role in Thursday's rally,
especially in the pork belly pit, where prices have been trending
lower due to a glut of frozen bellies.
   Cattle futures advaned on follow-through buying from Wednesday's
strong close. Steady cash markets and gave the cattle market
additional support, O'Hare said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .55 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in June at 72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .08 cent lower to .30 cent higher with May at 79.75 cents a
pound; hogs were .15 cent to 1.20 cents higher with June at 51.65
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent lower to 1.20
cents higher with May at 52.37 cents a pound.
   News reports of a fiery explosion at a Shell Oil Co. refinery in
Norco, La., boosted energy futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``That set the tone right off the bat with people buying
gasoline outright as a supply hedge and, as a speculative trade,
buying gasoline and selling crude against it,'' said John Azarow,
an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The positive technical implications of Thursday's higher opening
and the June crude oil contract's close above $17.37 a barrel
``should bode for higher prices,'' Azarow said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 19
cents higher with June at $17.39 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent
to 1.68 cents higher with June at 46.57 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .40 cent to .89 cent higher with June at 50.61 cents a
gallon.
   Grain futures settled lower on the Chicago Board of Trade while
soybean prices advanced in response to new crop weather forecasts,
analysts said.
   Private forecasts suggested the amounts of rain this weekend in
the western Corn Belt could be lighter than anticipated. With
soybean planting just getting under way, the market is especially
sensitive to any indications of dry weather.
   Wheat continued to slump in anticipation of a plentiful
winter-wheat harvest, analysts said, while corn drifted lower amid
sluggish export demand, he said.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 4} cents lower with May at $2.96} a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with May at $2.03 a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.60 a
bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 6 cents higher with May at $6.89{
a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures prices rose slightly on New York's
Commodity Exchange in sluggish trading marked by a lack of
influential news, analysts said.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.40 higher with June at $447 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 3.7 cents higher with May at $6.364
a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .50 point lower at 259.35.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's money supply grew sharply in the
week ended April 25, the government reported Thursday, but the
increase had no impact on financial markets and economists regarded
it as largely inconsequential.
   They attributed the rise to an unexpectedly higher rate of
federal tax refunds as well as government sluggishness in cashing
taxpayer checks, which inflated the categories of money included in
the supply figures.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, known as M1, rose
$11.7 billion to a seasonally adusted average of $778 billion, from
a revised $766.3 billion the previous week, the Federal Reserve
said.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks.
   A broader measure of money known as M2 averaged a
seasonally-adjusted $2.996 trillion, up $5.1 billion from a week
earlier. M2 equals M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and
money-market mutual funds.
   The broadest measure of the money supply, called M3, averaged a
seasonally adjusted $3.7635 trillion, up $3.5 billion from the
previous week. M3 equals M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as
certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York banks rose $331 million in the
week ended April 27, compared with a gain of $234 million the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $575 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $300 million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $277.1 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $276.2 billion two weeks earlier.

   The dollar staged a turnaround in domestic
trading Thursday, as technical factors pushed the currency higher
after it lost ground earlier overseas.
   Gold prices rose. In New York, Republic National Bank quoted
bullion at $445.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $444.40
on Wednesday.
   The dollar fell fractionally against most major currencies in
sluggish European trading, but investors' appetite for the U.S.
currency was revived when activity shifted to U.S. markets.
   ``Initially people tried to push the dollar down (in domestic
trading), but then we saw a big correction up,'' said David Godwin,
chief foreign-exchange dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland in New
York.
   He attributed the move in part to comments by Federal Reserve
Governor Manuel Johnson that the nation's trade deficit would
improve. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release its
merchandise trade report for April on May 17.
   Despite the dollar's move upward, the currency remained within
the relatively tight range it has been trading in for several
weeks. ``People have the feeling that the central banks will be
there if (investors) drive the dollar too low, but there's not a
big willingness to buy because of fear of inflation and the trade
number,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Dealers are hoping Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data
for April will stimulate the market.
   A trader at a Japanese bank in London noted that while the
market typically does not react to employment data, Friday's
announcement ``will have a novelty value in the sense that we have
been so starved of things to do this last week.''
   In London, the yen was quoted at 124.32 yen, compared with
124.95 late Wednesday. Banks and other financial institutions were
closed in Japan because of a national holiday. In New York the
dollar closed at 124.905 yen, up from 124.68 yen on Wednesday.
   One British pound cost $1.8665 in London late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.8650. In New York it
cost $1.8625 to buy one pound, less expensive than $1.86525 on
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.68405 West German marks, up from 1.67785;
1.4035 Swiss francs, up from 1.39725; 5.7275 French francs, up from
5.7020; 1.23365 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23555, and 1,258.00
Italian lire, up from 1,249.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.6780 West German marks, down from 1.6796; 1.3955 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4000; 5.7052 French francs, down from 5.7075; 1.8790
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8840; 1,253.25 Italian lire, up from
1,250.50, and 1.2333 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2353.
   Meanwhile, on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at
$445.40 a troy ounce, up from $444.80 on Wednesday.
   Traders in Europe said bullion will remain in a narrow range
barring news from the Persian Gulf or the U.S. economy.
   In London gold rose to a bid price of $445.25 a troy ounce, from
late Wednesday's $444. In Zurich, the bid price was $445.50, up
from $443.50 late Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.36
to close at a bid $447.07.
   On New York's Comex, silver finished at $6.327 a troy ounce,
down from $6.35 on Wednesday. In London late Thursday the metal was
quoted at a bid price of $6.37 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's
$6.35.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Embattled Teamsters President Jackie Presser
is taking a leave of absence from the job just as a jury's verdict
in the trial of a New York mob boss has set back federal efforts to
oust him and other leaders of the nation's largest union.
   John R. Climaco, the union's chief attorney, said Thursday that
Presser had advised the other 20 members of the Teamsters'
executive board over the previous 24 hours that he ``will be
temporarily unavailable for the next 120 days'' because of his
health.
   Climaco said Presser is hospitalized at the Cleveland Clinic in
Ohio, where he is undergoing a new round of radiation treatments.
   Presser, 61, underwent surgery in January 1987 for lung cancer
and has not returned to work full-time since then while undergoing
a series of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.
   However, he has made several appearances at various union
functions, including the AFL-CIO's convention last October at which
he gave an often rambling speech on the occasion of the Teamsters
reaffiliation with the labor federation after a 30-year period.
   In Presser's absence, the 1.6 million-member union will be
directed by Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. Mathis, Teamsters
officials said. Presser was expected to keep receiving his salary,
now about $600,000 annually, they said.
   Meanwhile, federal law enforcement officials acknowledged their
efforts to wrest control of the Teamsters from Presser through a
civil takeover suit was faltering under a jury's verdict Wednesday
in the trial of New York mob boss Anthony Salerno.
   Salerno was convicted of racketeering in the construction
industry but was acquitted with two other reputed mob figures on
charges of rigging the elections of Roy Williams and Presser to the
Teamsters' presidency in 1981 and 1983.
   A federal law enforcement source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Salerno's acquittal on the Teamster-related counts
was ``a serious setback.''
   Because of the verdict, the source said the government will have
to conduct a ``major re-evaluation'' of the prospects for bringing
a civil suit to put a court-appointed trustee in charge of the
union.
   Climaco said Presser made the decision to step asie temporarily
after he was told by his physicians ``to avoid stress, conserve his
health and undergo additional therapy.''
   However, Climaco answered ``not necessarily'' when asked if
Presser would seek another delay of his trial on federal charges of
racketeering in connection with an alleged payroll-padding scheme
at a Teamsters local in Cleveland that he also heads.
   The trial, already postponed several times because of Presser's
health, is now scheduled to open in U.S. District Court in
Cleveland on July 12.
   ``Mr. Presser is looking forward to his July trial and hopes he
will be physically able to stand trial so that he can once and for
all vindicate himself,'' Climaco said.
   Presser is accused of participating in a scheme in which two men
with alleged organized crime ties were placed on the Cleveland
local's payroll at a cost of $700,000 over several years while
performing no work for the union.
   He has pleaded innocent to the charges and his attorneys have
contended the FBI acquiesced in and even encouraged the employment
of the two men in their use of Presser as a government informant.
   The Justice and Labor departments a year ago began preparing the
Teamsters takeover suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO) Act.
   But federal prosecutors had delayed filing it out of concern the
suit might prejudice Salerno's trial and the belief that his
conviction would enhance their case for seizing control of the
union.
   John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to
comment on the outcome of the Salerno case.
   Climaco, however, said the Salerno verdict ``shatters once and
forever the myth'' that the elections of Presser and Williams ``had
been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements.''
   ``The FBI and the Department of Justice know that at this time
no such influence exists,'' he said. ``It's a fiction, pure
fiction.''
   Some Teamsters officials, nonetheless, said they still feared
Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, would pursue a
civil takeover attempt of their union.

<TEXT>
   KaiserTech Ltd., hampered by uncertainty
over its control and a legal dispute with chairman Alan Clore, said
Thursday its board of directors is considering selling the company.
   The world's fifth-largest aluminum producer said the board
appointed a special committee of independent directors to consider
proposals to acquire all of KaiserTech after being informed that
``one or more'' such offers are expected.
   KaiserTech's stock jumped more than $2 in the first hour of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange and closed up $2.87{ at $18.
   At least one of the acquisition proposals is expected to involve
a leveraged buyout of the company in which its current management
would be offered participation, KaiserTech said.
   The Oakland-based Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., also said
its board has adopted what it called a ``very limited''
stockholders' rights plan designed to permit the directors and
shareholders to consider a possible sale.
   ``The board of directors believed that given the possibility as
to the future direction of the company ... and given the
possibility of protracted litigation, it makes sense to explore the
possibility of a transaction which would offer all of the company's
stockholders a fair price for their stock,'' said James Pasman,
president and chief executive officer.
   KaiserTech filed suit last month against Clore and the Maxxam
Group investment group to resolve a dispute over rights to nominate
directors. The suit is part of an effort to block the financially
troubled Clore from passing on control of KaiserTech's board to
Houston investor Charles Hurwitz, who has agreed to buy Clore's 27
percent voting stake for about $200 million.
   KaiserTech's management also has sued Clore for alleged
securities-law violations, and a group of directors have sued him
for alleged breach of contract. Both deal with his handling of
company stock.
   Robert Irelan, a KaiserTech spokesman, cautioned that the board
``has not yet decided to sell the company'' despite forming the
special committee.

   Government lawyers are investigating possible
perjury by officials during sworn testimony about a firm's charge
it was driven into bankruptcy by the Justice Department.
   Sources who spoke only on condition they not be identified said
the Justice Department's public integrity section is examining
conflicting testimony by two former federal bankruptcy trustees and
Justice Department officials during a U.S. Bankruptcy Court
proceeding last year involving INSLAW Inc.
   Public integrity investigators also have allegations in the
INSLAW case against Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Those
allegations were relayed to the public integrity lawyers by
independent counsel James C. McKay, who has been investigating
Meese for almost a year.
   ``We are not conducting an investigation with respect to the
INSLAW matter,'' said Carol Bruce, McKay's deputy. ``Any
information we have received relating to it we have referred to the
Justice Department's public integrity section.''
   INSLAW alleges that Meese arranged to have their attorney, Leigh
Ratiner, dismissed from his Washington law firm in 1986 after Meese
discussed the case with one of Ratiner's partners, Leonard Garment.
   Garment, who described the allegation as ``pure baloney,'' said
he was interviewed by public integrity lawyers about the allegation
two months ago.
   If the public integrity section finds the allegations about
Meese are serious enough to warrant further investigation, it would
send them back to McKay, according to a source close to the
independent counsel.
   The perjury investigation is the latest twist in a complicated
case in which INSLAW Inc. charged _ and a bankruptcy judge, George
F. Bason Jr., found _ that the Justice Department stole computer
software the company had provided under a $10 million contract with
the department.
   Bason ruled that the villain was a fired INSLAW employee who
went to work for the Justice Department with a consuming desire for
revenge.
   Bason ordered the government to pay INSLAW $6.8 million for use
of the software. He ruled last June that the Justice Department had
engaged in ``trickery, fraud and deceit' to steal the software. The
case has been appealed.
   Lawyers for INSLAW have alleged that Cornelius Blackshear, a
former U.S. trustee, lied in sworn depositions when questioned
about an attempt to force INSLAW's liquidation, sources said.
   But the inquiry is focused on all the conflicting testimony in
the case.
   Blackshear, a bankruptcy judge in New York City, changed his
testimony about events that occurred when he was a U.S. trustee, in
an affidavit and a second sworn deposition.
   INSLAW, Inc., which filed for reorganization under bankruptcy
law in early 1985, charged in another action before Bason that the
Justice Department had deliberately withheld $1.77 million in
payments on the contract to computerize 94 U.S. attorneys' offices.
   Last year, Bason accepted INSLAW's contention that Thomas J.
Stanton, head of the Executive Office of U.S. Trustees, also tried
to pressure Blackshear into helping liquidate INSLAW's assets _ a
move that would have put the company out of business.
   When he announced his decision, Bason rejected Stanton's sworn
denial of INSLAW's allegation that he had asked Blackshear to send
his chief deputy to Washington to convert INSLAW's bankruptcy
reorganization into a liquidation proceeing.
   ``I found Mr. Stanton's testimony in crucial respects to be
evasive and unbelievable ... the court simply finds that testimony
to be utterly incredible and unworthy of belief,'' said Bason, who
left the bench earlier this year when his court appointment was not
extended.
   On March 25, 1987, Blackshear testified in the deposition that
he refused Stanton's request because it was improper. The next day,
Blackshear signed an affidavit to retract the testimony, stating
that he was confusing INSLAW with another bankruptcy matter.
   Blackshear gave a subsequent sworn deposition consistent with
the affidavit. Both of the judge's depositions were given in
Blackshear's chambers. He did not return a reporter's repeated
telephone calls.
   Bason noted that Blackshear changed his testimony after
receiving two telephone calls from William C. White, then the U.S.
bankruptcy trustee in Alexandria, Va., who allegedly refused
Stanton's initial request to liquidate INSLAW.
   ``The inference is rather strong that Mr. White was trying to
persuade Judge Blackshear that Mr. White's recollection was correct
and Judge Blackshear's recollection was incorrect,'' Bason said in
his June 12, 1987 ruling from the bench.
   ``I believe that Judge Blackshear's original testimony is
accurate and his recanted testimony is inaccurate,'' Bason said,
calling the judge's recantation ``an honest mistake.''
   Bason also found that White may have mistakenly remembered
events when he denied that Stanton pressured White to liquidate
INSLAW. Bason ruled that ``people do have a capacity to forget
things when it is painful for them to remember _ or maybe even
inconvenient for them to remember.''
   The judge found there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence that
Stanton retaliated by White's refusal by refusing to expand White's
staff in Alexandria.
   Anthony Pasciuto, a former Justice Department official who also
testified in the INSLAW case, meanwhile, has provided a fresh
allegation that Blackshear lied when he retracted his first story.
   Pasciuto, who had been Stanton's deputy director for
administration, charged that Blackshear told him last summer, ``I
felt the easiest thing I could do was recant.''
   ``I felt less people would be hurt if I just bailed out,''
Blackshear was quoted as saying in a letter by Pasciuto's attorney,
Gary Simpson, to the Justice Department.
   ``I thought that by changing my story I would hurt less
people,'' Simpson quoted Blackshear as telling Pasciuto.
   Pasciuto has since joined a New York financial firm. He left the
government after the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility tried to dismiss him for violating department rules
by talking about the INSLAW case with William Hamilton, the
company's president, and Hamilton's wife, Nancy.
   Pasciuto told the Hamiltons last year that he had information
from Blackshear about pressure to liquidate the firm. But he
retreated from this story during his courtroom testimony.
   On the verge of tears in Bason's courtroom, Pasciuto had
testified that he made up the story because he was angry with
Stanton about delaying his long-awaited promotion.
   Simpson included the charge about Blackshear in a March 17
letter he wrote to then-Assistant Attorney General Arnold I. Burns
to protest plans to fire Pasciuto, who was allowed to resign.
   The conflicting testimony of Blackshear, White, Stanton and
Pasciuto is the subject of the public integrity inquiry, according
to sources.
   Bason ruled that Stanton sought to liquidate INSLAW to ``curry
favor'' with higher Justice Department officials after he spoke
with C. Madison Brewer, who administered the INSLAW contract. His
conduct has been the subject of a long-standing investigation by
the department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
   In a subsequent ruling last year, Bason concluded that Brewer
was ``consumed by hatred and an intense desire for revenge''
because he had been fired by INSLAW before going to work for the
Justice Department.
   Bason ruled that Brewer and others in the department stole
enhancements to INSLAW's case-tracking computer program known as
PROMIS and engaged in ``an outrageous, deceitful, fraudulent game
of cat and mouse'' designed to destroy INSLAW.

<HEAD>Allegis Chairman Says United Pilots' Takeover Offer ``Illusory''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of United Airlines' parent Allegis Corp.
dismissed as ``illusory'' Thursday a new $4 billion buyout offer
for the airline by a group led by its pilots.
   Stephen M. Wolf, Allegis chairman and chief executive officer,
said the buyout proposal was not in the best interest of the
company's stockholders or employees, and ``...has no real prospect
of being successful.''
   ``Thus the price stated in the proposal is illusory'' and does
not reflect the value of the airline, Wolf said.
   Wolf commented in a statement to all United employees from
company headquarters in suburban Elk Grove Village one day after
the pilots made their third offer in a year proposing an employee
takeover or restructuring of the carrier. The company rejected the
two previous offers.
   The pilots' offered to pay $110 cash per outstanding Allegis
share, refinance certain Allegis debts, and accept wage cuts and
other concessions to trim labor costs up to $350 million a year.
   Allegis stock fell $2.62{ to $87.37{ a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The pilots' group said the takeover would benefit stockholders
and energize workers.
   But Wolf said that even if the takeover could be accomplished,
he did not see how employee ownership ``of a debt-laden United
benefits our pilots or other employees.''
   He said Allegis had reacted to concerns raised by the pilots by
selling its hotel and car-rental businesses in order to concentrate
on running the airline. Wolf also said it was time for employees to
``start working together'' with management rather than engage in
rhetoric and divisiveness.
   No one answered the telephone after business hours Thursday at
the suburban office of the pilots' union, the Air Lines Pilot
Association. Only recordings answered the telephones at the home of
an ALPA spokesman, James Damron, and at the union's national
headquarters in Washington.
   William R. Howard, who heads the corporation the pilots formed
as a vehicle for the buyout, had stated in a letter to Wolf that
the pilots' bid offered Allegis' stockholders a significant premium
over their shares' current market value and would give employees an
incentive to make United the nation's leading airline.
   But Wolf said he believed most employees would not be interested
in the buyout once they realized it would include substantial wage
cuts and other multiyear concessions.
   The wage cuts would impair United's ability to keep qualified
workers at all levels, he said.
   Wolf also said the heavy borrowing needed to finance the buyout
would leave the airline unable to finance aircraft and other
capital expenditures.
   He said the airline's available credit and employee concessions
should be used to expand the fleet, provide new service and make
the airline more competitive.
   The proposed takeover would be financed through $3.1 billion in
bank loans provided by a syndicate of banks led by Chemical Bank, a
$600 million bank credit facility, and the sale of $800 million in
subordinated notes, said Howard, the former chairman of Piedmont
Aviation.
   Under the deal, some pilots would take a 25 percent pay cut.
There also would be a reduction in company contributions to a
pilots' benefit plan, and changes in compensation and work-rules of
non-contract employees.

<HEAD>Company Sells Government Securities Unit For $40 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp said Thursday it
had agreed to sell its government securities trading business for
more than $40 million cash.
   The business involved in the pending transaction represents
about a third of the assets involved in a $6 billion corporate
restructuring that the bank holding company announced last October.
   The company said its First Interstate Limited subsidiary had
agreed to sell its First Interstate Capital Markets Inc. unit to
Printon, Kane Government Securities. The capital markets unit
conducts First Interstate's institutional securities business.
   First Interstate said that as a result of the pending sale and
other actions taken since October, it would decrease its total
trading securities by about $2.2 billion and its work force by
about 100.

<HEAD>BNY Says It Has Deal With Two-Thirds Of Irving Preferred
Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. said late Thursday it had
reached agreement with more than two-thirds of the holders of a
class of Irving Bank Corp. preferred stock to modify anti-takeover
provisions contained in the issue.
   Bank of New York, which has made a hostile $1.08 billion offer
for Irving, stated that more than two-thirds of the 15 shareholders
had agreed to waive a provision that would prohibit Irving from
merging for three years with any company if the merged corporation
did not meet certain restrictive requirements.
   A two-thirds majority was necessary to change the provisions.
   The agreement would become effective only upon the election of
Bank of New York's nominees to the Irving board, the statement
said. Irving shareholders meet Friday to vote on rival slates of
board nominees proposed by Irving and Bank of New York.
   Irving issued the $100.1 million of cumulative convertible
preferred stock in an effort to bolster its takeover defenses and
place a block of stock in friendly hands.
   The owners of the new shares were given more voting rights than
common stockholders, with each of the preferred shares carrying
1.471 votes. The new shares also contain convenants, which, Irving
said at the time of the issue, ``could adversely affect the ability
to accomplish any acquisition'' should they be breached.
   Among other things, the covenants would require the merged bank
to maintain relatively high levels of capital, according to Irving,
and they would restrict the company's ability to issue new stock.
   A telephone call late Thursday to Irving's offices was not
answered, although the company in the past has indicated it
believed Bank of New York's announcements on the matter were
calculated to influence Friday's proxy vote.
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its
stock for each of Irving's 18.5 million outstanding shares.
   Irving supports a rival bid by Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA,
which is offering $75 a share bid for 9.5 million of the bank
company's outstanding common shares.
   Irving fell 50 cents to $60.37{ a share Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange. Bank of New York stock fell 12{ cents to $30.12{ a
share.
   Bank of New York stated that the pact with the preferred
shareholders increased the likelihood that Irving shareholders
would not have to pay tax on the stock portion of its buyout offer.
   The company said that under the agreement, the preferred would
pay a 9.5 percent annual dividend through Feb. 24, 1993. After
then, the dividend would be determined by an auction mechanism.

<HEAD>Playboy Profit Up Sharply In Latest Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Playboy Enterprises Inc. said Thursday its profit
more than doubled in the latest quarter, due primarily to the
favorable outcome of a casino bankruptcy case and an income-tax
audit.
   The publisher of Playboy magazine reported net income of $2.7
million, or 29 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31,
compared with $1.1 million, or 12 cents a share, for the same
period a year ago.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $38 million from $36.2 million.
   The results were for the third quarter of Playboy's fiscal year,
which ends June 30.
   Revenues from Playboy's publishing and
licensing-and-merchandising groups were up, but its video group
reported a loss for the quarter, due to a decrease in subscribers
to its Playboy Channel cable television service, the company said
in a statement.
   Quarterly results included a gain of $1 million from the
approval last month of a reorganization plan for the Atlantis
Hotel-Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Playboy sold its interest in
the hotel in 1984 and had sued to recover its assets.
   Playboy also posted one-time gains totaling $1.8 million from
various tax-related items.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Playboy netted
$7.8 million, or 83 cents per share, compared with $4.1 million, or
43 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to
$122 million from $118.1 million.

<HEAD>Employers' Group Head Says Swiss Takeover Bid Should Be Blocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the employers' organization the
Confederation of British Industry said Thursday that the government
should block an attempted Swiss takeover of British confectioner
Rowntree PLC.
   Swiss food manufacturers Nestle SA and Jacobs Suchard SA said
separately Thursday that each had increased its respective stake in
York-based Rowntree, maker of the Kit Kat candy bar.
   CBI director general John Banham stated that Swiss regulations
stopped British companies from easily bidding for Swiss companies
and that a Swiss takeover of Rowntree therefore should be blocked.
   ``We can't safely continue to play football against teams which
have built brick walls across their own goals and expect to win,''
said Banham.
   Nestle last week launched a hostile $3.9 billion bid to acquire
Rowntree. Suchard at the same time said it also had acquired a
stake in Rowntree.
   Nestle stated Thursday it had hiked its stake in Rowntree to 7.1
percent from 6.7 percent to 7.1 percent.
   Suchard said it had hiked its stake to 25.4 percent from 23.5
percent, but it has not indicated whether it plans to launch a full
takeover bid for Rowntree.
   Another British company, Cadbury Schweppes PLC, is the target of
a possible bid from the U.S. leisure group General Cinema Corp. in
what has been dubbed by London newspapers as the candy ``bar wars.''
   General Cinema said last week it would raise its 17.7 percent
stake in Cadbury, whose products include Peter Paul candy bars such
as Mounds and Almond Joy.
   Cadbury Chairman Sir Adrian Cadbury has called on the government
to intervene against a hostile takeover.
   The raids on Cadbury and Rowntree, which are Britain's two top
confectioners and are major players in the world market, have
sparked controversy in Britain.
   Press reports said the government's decision to investigate the
Kuwaiti government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake in oil giant
British Petroleum Co. PLC had led to speculation that it might take
similar action over Rowntree.
   The government's Department of Trade and Industry said Wednesday
it would refer the acquisition by the Kuwait Investment Office to
the Monopolies and Merger Commission. The commission will rule
within four months whether or not the Kuwaiti stake in BP,
Britain's biggest company, is in the public interest.

<HEAD>Desert Partners Challenges USG Recap Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert Partners L.P. said Thursday it had filed a
supplemental court complaint seeking to invalidate USG Corp.'s main
takeover defense, claiming USG's defensive recapitalization
proposal effectively opened the company up to a bidding contest.
   Desert Partners already had sued in U.S. District Court in
Chicago to invalidate USG's ``poison-pill'' takeover defense. The
partnership, which has an outstanding $2.6 billion offer to acquire
USG, is appealing U.S. District Judge James Holderman's refusal
last month to grant a temporary injunction against use of the
defense.
   In its new complaint, Desert Partners asserted the $2.2 billion
USG recapitalization proposal effectively would give control of the
company to management and employees by boosting the amount of USG
stock held by an employee benefit plan and by issuing up to 11
million new shares to management under a performance incentive plan.
   As such, the partnership contended, USG had put the company up
for sale and must conduct a fair auction in which Desert Partners
would be able to join the bidding, according to a statement.
   Such an auction could not be conducted unless the court
invalidated the poison pill, forced USG to provide Desert Partners
with the same financial information given to the company's advisers
and bankers, and ordered the company to amend proxy materials for
its May 11 shareholders meeting to disclose information about the
recapitalization, the partnership stated.
   In trading Thursday, USG stock fell 50 cents to $45.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   USG has been fighting the takeover for months, and has rejected
Desert Partners' $42-a-share hostile tender offer for 39 million
shares of outstanding USG common stock, about 76 percent.
   Desert Partners offered Wednesday to pay about $50 in cash and
securities for all of USG's 51.6 million outstanding common shares
if the company agreed to negotiate a merger.
   ``We are disappointed that USG has once again arbitrarily
rejected a very attractive proposal for stockholders. We remain, as
we have been since last fall, determined to acquire USG,'' said
Joel L. Reed, chief financial officer for Desert Partners.
   The partnership, led by Texas oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack
E. Brown, also announced Thursday that it was again extending its
tender offer until May 13, and that about 11 million common shares
were tendered under the offer through Thursday.
