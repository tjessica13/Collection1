   The actors Yves Montand likes are the kind of
actor he is himself.
   ``I admire Sean Connery very much,'' he said. ``I like Columbo _
Peter Falk. I like this kind of actors who become older but they
don't lose their youth, really. They go on with some charm and are
human beings. They don't destroy themselves with face lifts, which
are terrible.''
   Montand was recently in New York to receive this year's tribute
from the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the 17th person to be
honored and the first Frenchman. His two most recent films are
``Jean de Florette,'' which won the British Film Academy's prize
for best picture, and ``Manon of the Spring.'' In both, he portrays
a farming village patriarch, Cesar Soubeyran.
   ``The reason I didn't want to make the movies was not because I
look 20 years older,'' said the 66-year-old Montand. ``I said, `Let
the years do their job.' It was because I wanted to go on tour.''
   Montand started as a singer, was discovered by the legendary
Edith Piaf, made his first movie with her in 1945 and sang on stage
and made movies until 1968 when he decided to concentrate on film
acting. In 1982, he made a world singing tour which was a smash
success, and planned to repeat in 1984 but made the two movies
instead.
   ``I think it is a very good story, based on a wonderful book
(Marcel Pagnol's `L'Eau des Colines'). But it was courageous to
make this kind of part, contrary to what people wait for from you.
He is a nasty man. He could be very cruel in some ways,'' he said.
   Montand and actress Simone Signoret, who were married from 1950
until her death in 1985, used to read each other's movie scripts.
   ``Sometimes she would say, `You're going to shoot this thing? It
is awful.' I would say, `You're right but I promised this young
director.' Of course the movie is a flop,'' he recalled.
   ``Sometimes you fall in love with a story you're reading. If a
director has good taste, he puts you in his pocket.''
   Montand has advice about getting older: ``Humor, tenderness and
lucidity cannot change and are important in life as you become
older. You need to laugh, have a sense of humor, first of all
against yourself. Everybody needs tenderness. Tenderness cannot
become old. Never. And if you are clear _ this is right, this is
not right _ you stay a young man or woman.
   ``I'm going to look a little pompous now but I say, never, never
stop working with your memory. You remember a girl. What is her
name? You say it isn't important, forget it. No, no. Make the
effort to discover again the name of this girl, even if it is not
important. This is exercise, like for the muscles.''
   For physical exercise, Montand walks four or five miles every
day when he can. ``Sometimes I make a seven or 10-minute dance in
the morning. Then I take a shower and that's it.''
   At the tribute, French filmmaker Louis Malle called Montand
``one of the most romantic figures the French cinema has ever
known.''
   Montand, however, still hasn't figured out romance. ``I
remembered this morning, lying in bed, the first time a girl kissed
me or I kissed her. I didn't like it. Two months later, someone
else comes, you collapse. Both are very nice looking. It's very
peculiar.
   ``When you are an adult, it is a mystery. You love me. I love
you. It's the only thing you can say. You are mad. It's
unbelievable. It's a volcano inside. What does it mean? We can
understand nothing. Death, love, we don't know anything about.
Maybe it's better, I don't know. It's a wonderful mystery anyway,
thank God.''
   During the interview in Montand's suite in Hotel Maxim's, the
telephone rang several times and a Film Society representative
spoke to women who wished to stop by. ``I'm sure it is only for
autographs,'' the actor said with a charming smile.
   Since ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the Spring,'' Montand
has done a few TV appearances. He plans a TV version about Alfred
Dreyfus, the French army officer who was convicted for treason but
later found to be the victim of anti-Semitism. He also plans to do
a movie about terrorists.
   Montand's next movie, though, will be a musical, ``Three Seats
for the 26th,'' directed by Jacques Demy with music by Michel
Legrand, who collaborated on ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.''
   ``I don't want to tell you the story; I want it to be a
surprise,'' he said. ``It will not be a beautiful masterpiece as
made by Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire.''

   A year after a military coup ended democratic
government in Fiji, the South Pacific nation is still reeling in
the aftermath of a conflict that arose over Fijian fears of
domination by the Indian population.
   The economy is shaky, and skilled professionals and civil
servants, mostly Indians, are leaving for Canada, Australia and New
Zealand at a rate of 500 a month, double the precoup figure.
   Sugar production, the country's major cash crop is down 20.3
percent; tourism has dropped 26.9 percent, the currency has been
devalued 33 percent, inflation has tripled to 6 percent,
unemployment has reached 7.5 percent and the gross domestic product
is down 11 percent.
   The coup of May 14, 1987, was led by Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka
who claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated by
the decendants of immigrants from India threatened the future of
ethnic Fijians.
   The Indians outnumbered Fijians 348,704 to 329,305 at the time
and controlled trade and commerce.
   The election of an Indian-controlled government led to the army
coup. Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, a Fijian, and his Cabinet were
arrested. The Constitution was suspended and rule by decree was put
in force.
   Since then ethnic Fijian fears of Indian political supremacy
have eased.
   But the coup virtually ended organized political activities, but
the country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among Fijian
chiefs in a feud over a Fijian king.
   It was to solve just such rivalries that King Seru Cakobau
handed over the islands, then known as the Cannibal Isles, to Queen
Victoria of Britain in 1874, after first having tried to interest
the United States.
   Ratu Sir George Cakobau, grndson of the king and a former prime
minister, now claims the royal title, which had been vacant since
the British took control.
   But other chiefs and clans are disputing Cakobau's claim to the
title.
   Bavadra, the ousted prime minister, said he feared squabbling
among the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from Fijians
feeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup.
   Watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39-year-old
Rabuka, who is a commoner.
   He has become a cult figure to many ethnic Fijians who regard
him as the savior of their culture.
   He is the minister for home affairs in the interim government he
appointed to run the country until a new constitution is drafted
and elections held.
   A new book, ``Rabuka _ No Other Way,'' giving Rabuka's account
of the coup, became an instant best seller.
   Also in demand is an autographed color poster of Rabuka in an
army T-shirt and bearing the slogan, ``Fiji. In God's Hands.''
   A documentary film titled ``Operation Surprise,'' the code name
for the coup, has been showing to packed houses. Fiji has has no
television.
   One of the first acts by Rabuka, a Methodist lay preacher,
former rugby star and veteran of the United Nations Middle East
peace force was to make the religious observance of Sundays
compulsory.
   No shops are allowed to open, no sports can be played, public
transport halts and the populace is expected, but not yet
compelled, to go to church.
   But the Sunday observance law has become so unpopular that even
the Fiji Council of Churches has called for its repeal.
   In the best-selling book, written by a Fijian and an Australian,
Rabuka says the majority of Fiji's Indians are heathens and should
be converted to Christianity. Most of the Indians are Hindus.
   ``I don't think they will resent it,'' Rabuka is quoted as
saying, ``because all we are trying to do is the same thing that
missionaries did here in Fiji when we were cannibals and heathens.''
   In the year since the coup, Indian leaders have fled or taken a
low profile.
   But one Indian who remains prominent is Irene Narayan, 56,
Rabuka's minister for Indian affairs.
   She said in an interview the Indian community is now without a
political leader, but added she saw little likelihood of communal
violence between Fijians and Indians,.
   She expressed the view that while some Indians have left, the
majority will remain and probably accept their loss of political
rights.
   ``If Fijians want dominance and they are happy with it, perhaps
that's not high a price for Indians to pay,'' Mrs. Narayan said.
   Meanwhile, Fiji's relations with traditonal friends and
neighbors are taking time to mend. Australia, New Zealand and the
United States condemned Rabuka's coup. They called their
ambassadors home and suspended aid, but the envoys of all three
have since returned.
   Australia and New Zealand have resumed non-military aid, but
relations remain chilly.

   A scientist is planning to use Nazi studies
of concentration camp prisoners deliberately frozen to death to
further his research about hypothermia.
   But some scientists and Jewish leaders have sharply criticized
his intention to use data obtained during the Holocaust.
   Dr. Robert Pozos, director of the hypothermia research
laboratory at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, says he plans to
analyze and republish ``The Treatment of Shock from Prolonged
Exposure to Cold,'' a study by doctors at Dachau. It includes
observation and physiological measurements of people placed in vats
of freezing liquid, often to the point of death, according to those
familiar with the study.
   ``We should under no circumstances use the information. It was
gained in an immoral way,'' said Dr. Daniel Callahan, director of
the Hastings Center, a medical ethics think tank in Briarcliff
Manor, N.Y.
   ``I think it goes to legitimizing the evil done. I think the
findings are tainted by the horror and misery,'' said Abraham H.
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League.
   Because mammals differ widely in their physiological response to
cold, hypothermia research is uniquely dependent on human test
subjects, says Pozos, a specialist in the field for 12 years.
   ``It could advance my work in that it takes human subjects
farther than we're willing,'' he said.
   Several medical ethicists contend study of the Nazi research
could save lives and, if published with a condemnation of the
methods, call attention to the plight of the Jews, Poles and
Gypsies killed in the experiments.
   Because the Egyptians used slave labor, ``does that mean we
should never gaze at the pyramids?'' asked Dr. Thomas Murray,
director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland.
   ``It sends a chill down every normal human being's spine to
think of the horrible things the Nazis did there, but I'm
separating the results and the circumstances,'' said Ephraim
Zuroff, Israeli representative to the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles. ``Actually, if the U.S. doctor dedicated his study to
the memory of those victims of the Nazis, it would serve as a nice
way of reminding people about the horrible experiments.''
   Use of Nazi science by post-World War II researchers is rare but
not unprecedented. After facing a similar quandary this year, the
federal Environmental Protection Agency deleted references to Nazi
research in its own draft report on a toxic gas.
   Pozos, 45, says he decided to use the Nazi hypothermia data
after seeing a resurgence of public and scientific curiosity about
it. He says copies of a 1945 English translation of the Dachau
study have been available in about a dozen libraries around the
country.
   Motivated in part by the loss of pilots in the frigid North Sea,
the Germans used 100 to 300 prisoners to test the body's response
to extreme cold, Pozos said; how many died is unclear. Besides
testing the phenomenon of freezing, the doctors experimented with
warming techniques ranging from body-to-body contact to alcohol
ingestion, Pozos said.
   Word of Pozos' plans for the old Nazi experiments spread after
he contacted University of Minnesota medical ethicist Arthur Caplan
for advice. Caplan wrote a newspaper column about the issue.
   Pozos said he has had a generally positive response, including
calls from about a half-dozen Holocaust survivors. ``They said I
should get something out of this so these people would not have
died in vain,'' said Pozos.
   Within two months, Pozos said, he hopes to republish the German
study in a scientific journal with his own analysis of its quality
and application to modern hypothermia research.
   While calling the study ``a record of unimaginable horror and
cruelty,'' Caplan said he believes Pozos should be allowed to
republish it under strict guidelines. Among other stipulations,
Caplan urges omission of the Nazi doctors' names to ensure no
credit is conferred.
   ``If the data can prevent a single death, then it is worth
tolerating the stench of past deaths that will cling to each
page,'' Caplan wrote.
   Caplan has organized an international symposium on Nazi science,
tentatively scheduled for May 1989 at the University of Minnesota.

   The United Auto Workers on Wednesday ratified a
contract giving 66,000 Chrysler Corp. employees in 15 states
greater job protection, the union said.
   The two-year contract was approved by about 54 percent of those
voting, according to union officials who spoke on condition they
not be identified.
   Two former American Motors Corp. locals in Wisconsin also voted
Wednesday, approving separate pacts reached during the national
contract talks at Chrysler's Highland Park headquarters. Chrysler
bought AMC in August.
   The UAW and the No. 3 automaker reached the agreement May 4
after 2{ weeks of early negotiations aimed at mending a series of
conflicts. Talks normally would have begun in July or August.
   The contract, which replaces a three-year agreement that would
have have expired Sept. 14, mirrors that signed last fall at Ford
Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
   The Big Three contract prevents layoffs except when production
is cut because of slow sales, forbids plant closings not announced
before talks began and makes it harder for companies to transfer
work to outside companies or foreign countries.
   The Chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lump-sum bonuses
in 1989 and 1990, a $1,000 signing bonus and, for the first time,
profit-sharing according to the formula that has generated
thousands of dollars for Ford workers.
   But the Chrysler pact also prevents the company from paying cash
or stock bonuses to executives in years when a profit-sharing
formula included in the contract generates no payout for workers.
   The UAW was angered in the past two years when GM workers
received no profit-sharing while executives were awarded generous
bonuses.
   Union leaders, including Vice President Marc Stepp, have said
they expected the pact, approved last week by local union leaders
on the UAW's 140-member Chrysler bargaining council, to be ratified
by a comfortable margin.
   However, the contract was rejected at several large locals,
including Detroit's Jefferson Avenue assembly plant and Mound Road
engine plant and a stamping plant in Sterling Heights, union
officials said.
   Chrysler's 3,500-worker Warren Truck plant approved the contract
with 65 percent in favor, said Local 140 President Gil Wojcik.
   ``I'm surprised. I'm flabbergasted. I thought it would pass by a
wider margin,'' said Wojcik, chairman of the elected 10-member
bargaining committee.
   Unlike the GM and Ford pacts, the Chrysler contract also
protects 2,200 workers at four closing Acustar Inc. parts plants
from layoff. When any of the plants are closed, workers will be
paid their regular wages and placed in a job bank.
   If any of the four plants _ one in Van Wert, Ohio, and three in
the Detroit area _ are sold instead, workers can choose whether to
go into the job bank and wait for a Chrysler opening or go with the
new employer.

   From Frank Sinatra to Isaac Stern, show business
put on the Ritz for Irving Berlin and raised a classy, schmaltzy
salute to the songwriter Wednesday on his 100th birthday.
   The creator of thousands of tunes was not in Carnegie Hall for
the three-hour concert, but family members filled a row.
   The event started big and ended bigger, with the Army Chorus and
soldiers from Ft. Dix, N.J., filling the stage in front of a
30-piece orchestra, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts standing in the
aisles and Marilyn Horne's mezzo-soprano voice soaring above them
in Berlin's ``God Bless America.''
   Then the evening's performers filed in the audience stood, and
everybody sang a lusty ``There's No Business Like Show Business,''
still another Berlin classic.
   The artists included Ray Charles and Leonard Bernstein on piano.
It was Bernstein's Carnegie Hall singing debut with Berlin's
``Russian Lullaby.''
   Director-choreographer Tommy Tune tapdanced to ``Puttin' on the
Ritz,'' and Willie Nelson, in formal black with a black cowboy hat,
brought his band for ``Blue Skies.''
   ``We wouldn't think of doing a show without including it,''
Nelson said.
   Sinatra sang ``Always'' and ``When I Lost You,'' Nell Carter did
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' Jerry Orbach and Maureen McGovern
``Easter Parade,'' and Rosemary Clooney ``Count Your Blessings
Instead of Sheep'' and ``White Christmas.''
   Isaac Stern narrated a film of highlights of Berlin's life. The
evening, a benefit for the American Society of Composers, Authors
and Publishers Foundation and Carnegie Hall Society, was taped by
CBS for broadcast May 27.
   ``Irving Berlin took common American talk and made it into
poetry. He gave it back to us as beautiful treasures of how we
feel, not fancy, not too highbrow, simple and graceful,'' said
Garrison Keillor, formerly of the musical radio program ``A Prairie
Home Companion.''
   At midday, 14 cast members of the Broadway show, ``A Chorus
Line,'' warmed up the festivities with an enthusiastic songfest at
the Central Park Arsenal, a 140-year-old landmark.
   ``There's no business like show business!'' proclaimed the
youthful Broadway talents. Their sprightly medley ranged from love
songs such as ``They Say That Falling in Love is Wonderful,'' to
the torch song ``What'll I Do,'' to the humorous ``You Can't Get a
Man With a Gun.''
   In the latter, from the 1946 musical ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' the
hungry-for-love sharpshooter laments, ``You can't shoot a man in
the tail like a quail.''
   After rallying around a grand piano played by ``Chorus Line''
conductor Jerry Goldberg, the cast members moved outside to offer
an a cappella chorus of ``God Bless America'' and ``Happy
Birthday,'' then cut loose green helium balloons.
   People from all walks of life got into the act around the city _
and the nation.
   On Staten Island, 15 handicapped Boy Scouts sang ``Happy
Birthday'' and ``God Bless America'' during the dedication of a new
log cabin named for Berlin. He had donated the residuals from the
patriotic tune to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
   Patients in 100 Veterans Administration hospitals and nursing
homes around the nation geared up to sing ``God Bless America''
simultaneously, at 5 p.m. Eastern time.
   The composer, meanwhile, was spending the day ``quietly at
home'' and did not plan to be at Carnegie Hall, said Berlin's
secretary, Hilda Schneider.
   ``He's never made a big thing about his birthdays,'' she said.
``Let's face it, he's not 22 years old.''
   That didn't discourage the 75 New Yorkers who gathered outside
Berlin's Manhattan home to usher in his special day with a midnight
serenade.
   ``Even if he didn't write a thing, to reach 100 is to be part of
American history,'' said John Wiessman, 21, a junior at New York
University. ``But this guy wrote a lot. I love `God Bless America.'
Every American has got to love it.''
   The reclusive Berlin, who lives on exclusive Beekman Place with
his second wife, Ellin, did not appear at his window when Wiessman
and the others crooned ``We'll be loving you, always.'' But he knew
they were there.
   ``When they were there singing, of course he heard them. He was
very thrilled by that,'' said his secretary.

<TEXT>
   A top Department of Energy official conceded
Wednesday that two whistleblowers from Washington state may have
been harassed by their superiors after testifying last year before
a House subcommittee about safety problems at the Hanford nuclear
reservation.
   Under Secretary of Energy Joseph Salgado, who has responsibility
for the Department of Energy's safety programs at facilities such
as the Hanford reservation, said that both he and the department
had ``failed'' to protect Casey Ruud and James Simkin from any
retaliation by their employer.
   ``It was negligent on my part,'' Salgado told the oversight and
investigations subcommittee of the House Energy Committee.
   Salgado said the handling of Ruud and Simpkin ``called into
question'' the department's efforts to improve its safety programs
and that the two should have been praised rather than harassed.
   ``We failed to acknowledge what they had done,'' said Salgado.
``It was the wrong thing to do.''
   Salgado also said that DOE had ``sent the wrong message'' to
employees who are concerned about safety at federal nuclear
facilities.
   During an October hearing before the same subcommittee, Ruud and
Simkin had outlined a series of safety problems at the central
Washington nuclear facility and Salgado had pledged they they would
not suffer because of their testimony.
   Ruud and Simpkin said Wednesday they had been ``harassed and
intimidated'' since their last appearance before the subcommittee
and that other workers at the Hanford reservation are afraid to
report safety problems for fear of reprisals.
   Ruud, laid off in February by the Westinghouse Hanford Co., said
he was told by his superiors there was an ``unwritten
understanding'' that he would never be promoted.
   In addition, Ruud said one supervisor, Roger Johnson, who now
heads one of Westinghouse's employee concerns committee, told him
if his testimony before the subcommittee prevented him from getting
anotherjob ``that's just too bad.''
   William Jacobi, president of Westinghouse Hanford, admitted that
Johnson heads the employee concerns committee, but said he was not
aware of Ruud's allegation prior to Wednesday and promised to
investigate Ruud's claims.
   There are ``many other people (at Hanford) who are afraid to
come forward with serious problems because they fear reprisals,''
Ruud testified.
   Simpkin still works at the Hanford reservation, but said he has
been transferred to a department where he cannot ``contribute ...
to correcting the safety problems at Hanford.''
   Less than a month after last fall's hearing, Simpkin said he
received a letter of reprimand from his supervisor. The letter was
withdrawn after an Energy Department investigation found it was
``unfair and unjustified.''
   Some Republican members of the committee suggested that perhaps
Simpkin and Ruud were not qualified for the transfers they had
sought.
   Others suggested the two hadn't been singled out but had been
caught up in the massive layoffs and employee reshuffling resulting
from the closing of the reactor and the decision not to locate the
nation's first high-level nuclear waste dump at Hanford.
   ``No congressional committee can function if witnesses have
apprehensions about what will happen if they tell the truth,'' said
Rep. John Dingel, D-Mich., subcomittee chairman. ``The matter will
not end with this meeting today.''
   But ``the function of this hearing was not to demean you or your
department,'' Dingell told Salgado.

   A Navy technician accused of having sex
with his fiancee without telling her he was infected with the AIDS
virus was acquitted of assault Wednesday by a military jury.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class John E. Crawford, 27, of Magnolia, Ark.,
stood at attention in the packed courtroom as the seven-member jury
delivered the verdict after 4{ hours of deliberation.
   The sailor was convicted of a minor charge of having a visitor
in his room after hours and was given 15 days in the brig and
reduced in rank one grade. He could have received up to two years
in the brig for the offense.
   ``It was what I felt was right,'' Crawford, accompanied by his
present fiancee, Karen Skavdahl, said of the verdict.
   Crawford could have been stripped of his rank, dishonorably
discharged and sentenced to a decade behind bars had he been
convicted of assault.
   The jury also acquitted him of adultery and of exposing his
former fiancee, Jeannie Elmer, to the AIDS virus. Elmer is a
civilian.
   The case was unprecedented in the Navy, although there have been
similar cases in other branches of the military.
   Crawford was accused of having unprotected sex with Elmer in
1987 without warning her he had tested positive for the AIDS virus.
He was charged with adultery because Elmer was separated, but not
divorced, from her third husband.
   Crawford, an avionics technician, testified he told Elmer about
his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love in his
barracks room.
   But Elmer said that she didn't learn Crawford had been exposed
to the virus until the next day, when her housemate _ who also had
been Crawford's lover _ told her about the sailor's test. Elmer has
tested negative for the AIDS virus.
   Five of the seven members of the jury had to agree to reach
verdicts.
   ``The government is attempting to explore how far the Uniform
Code of Military Justice can be applied against an individual ...
with the AIDS virus,'' defense attorney Lt. Ron Richman charged as
the case went to the jury. ``The government seeks to hold out Petty
Officer Crawford as a guinea pig to see how far it can go on the
AIDS issue.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Jane Gilliland, prosecutor in the case, said in her
closing statement that Crawford, depicted as caring and concerned
by the defense, simply didn't care enough about Elmer to tell her
about the tests.
   ``She had no idea that the act of sex which she engaged in with
Petty Officer Crawford was potentially fatal to her,'' Gilliland
said.
   Crawford has said Elmer was bitter that he had broken off their
brief engagement and filed charges for revenge.
   Meanwhile, in Arizona, the AIDS-related court-martial of Adrian
G. Morris Jr. resumed for the hearing of motions after a nine-month
delay.
   Morris, a 28-year-old Army private from Caseyville, Ill., is
accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not
using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus.
   Judge Raymond D. Cole set a July trial date after denying
motions for dismissal of charges. Cole will hear the case without a
jury at Morris' request.
   He is charged with aggravated assault, conduct prejudicial to
the good order and discipline of the Army and sodomy.
   The proceedings were adjourned Aug. 5 by Cole to allow the Army
to appeal his ruling barring the Army from introducing Morris' AIDS
blood test as evidence. Cole's ruling was later reversed.
   The national Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20
percent to 30 percent of those who show antibodies to the AIDS
virus will develop the fatal disease within five years.

   More than 100 descendants of colonial
planter John Drayton are expected at his plantation this weekend to
celebrate the 250th anniversary of the family homestead.
   Drayton Hall, a two-story brick Georgian structure northwest of
Charleston, has passed through seven generations of the Drayton
family.
   Now it is one of 13 sites maintained by the National Trust for
Historic Preservation that is open to the public. It attracts more
than 52,000 visitors a year.
   The Thomas Drayton family settled in South Carolina in 1679 _
nine years after the founding of Charleston. The youngest son,
John, began construction of Drayton Hall in 1738. It was completed
four years later.
   His father lived at nearby Magnolia Plantation, which also is a
popular tourist attraction.
   There are an estimated 4,000 descendants of Thomas Drayton
scattered around the world, and at least 100 are expected for the
celebration, which will include dancing under the stars and
workshops on archaeology, said Meg Lavin, curator at Drayton Hall.
   Drayton Hall is the only Ashley River plantation to survive the
Civil War intact. Two small flanking buildings _ one used as a
kitchen and one as a utility building _ were destroyed in the 1886
Charleston earthquake and a hurricane seven years later.
   George Neil, assistant director of Drayton Hall, said that
according to family legend, the house emerged from the Civil War
unscathed because of the quick thinking of its occupant, Dr. John
Drayton.
   As Union troops marched through toward the end of the war,
Drayton had the house posted with flags signifying it was being
used to treat smallpox patients. However, it's not known whether it
actually was used as a hospital.
   ``The story comes down both through the owners and slave
descendants. Whether it was a ruse or not is unclear,'' said Ms.
Lavin.
   The builder of the house was a successful planter who owned up
to 125 slaves and acquired 30 other properties including townhouses
in Charleston.
   The cost of building the manor, located on a 125-acre tract, is
not known, said Neil. However, in the later part of the 18th
Century the house was referred to as ``Mr. Drayton's Palace.''

   They don't look much like Jane Fonda, but
hefty Sharlyne Powell and Sharon McConnell are making a splash in
the exercise video market with a tape for large women.
   The former housewives, who founded the Yakima-based Women At
Large exercise studios, star in a slick new video designed for
people whose bodies have more curves than angles.
   ``It's been on the market almost a month and we've sold 11,000
copies,'' Mrs. Powell said Tuesday.
   The $160,000 production was financed by the women and television
host Robb Weller, of ``Entertainment Tonight'' and the ``Home''
show. They are splitting the profits 50-50.
   Weller and his wife, Barbara, who runs Weller Productions, met
Mrs. Powell and Mrs. McConnell when they appeared on the pilot for
ABC's ``Home'' show several months ago.
   ``They were terrific people and they wanted to do some other
projects with us,'' Mrs. Powell said.
   The video, which sells for $29.95, is just the latest success
for Women At Large, a chain of exercise studios founded by two,
self-described bored housewives in 1983.
   The clubs cater to the 30 million women in the nation who wear
clothes size 16 or above. Instructors average 175 pounds, and the
goal is to build fitness and self-esteem, not lose pounds.
   In their determination that pounds do not matter, both women
refuse to disclose their ample weight.
   Women At Large has sold 24 franchises around the country since
1986 and is negotiating with franchises in Japan, Mrs. Powell said.
   ``I'm ready to really bust out with it now,'' she said. ``I have
all the systems in place.''
   The two have become media darlings in the last year.
   They filmed a segment of the ``Today'' show on Wednesday
morning, then were scheduled to depart for Los Angeles on Monday
for national and local television and newspaper interviews.
   Shortly after, they depart for a cross-country tour to promote
the exercise tape.
   ``I'm flying around so much I have little time to exercise any
more,'' Mrs. Powell said. ``I've got to make a concerted effort to
get back on the regimen.''
   The tape features the women's program of low-impact aerobics
that does not include the running, jumping and jogging they feel
can damage a heavier body.

<HEAD>Donald Regan Calls For Steps to Quell Market Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald T. Regan took time off from discussing
his book on the inner workings of President Reagan's White House to
tell Congress that financial markets and the government must act
quickly to reassure the nation's investors.
   The former Treasury secretary said Wednesday that ``there should
have been more prompt action'' after last October's stock market
crash. ``This thing happened over seven months ago,'' he said.
   Regan told the Senate Banking Committee that a form of
computerized trading called index arbitrage should be prohibited,
and that all transactions involving stock index futures should be
temporarily halted. Both practices, he said, make the markets
excessively volatile and have scared worried individual investors
off.
   ``A stock market whose main participants are speculators and
their programs cannot be a healthy market, and an unhealthy Wall
Street will sooner or later drag down the real economy,'' said
Regan, the former chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch & Co.
   The banking panel has been holding hearings on the dramatic
price swings that have dominated the markets since Oct. 19, when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a record 508 points.
   Regan, who was White House chief of staff for two years after
being treasury secretary, has spent most of his time recently
talking about his new book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington.'' In it, he says first lady Nancy Reagan often consults
astrologers when planning the president's schedule and making other
decisions.
   Regan declined to discuss his book Wednesday with reporters.
   But he did blame computer-driven trading, especially index
arbitrage, for the market's problems.
   Traders conducting index arbitrage use computers to profit from
price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by
simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other.
   ``In my mind, we should start by banning index option arbitrage,
and then proceed with other reforms which will restore public
confidence in the financial markets,'' Regan said.
   He said problems also have been caused by stock futures, which
are traded in Chicago. In a stock index futures transaction, an
amount of cash equal to the value of a collection of stocks changes
hands, with an agreement that the portfolio will be bought back at
whatever those stocks' values are at a specific future date.
   Opponents of the practice say the massive amounts of money
involved add unpredictability to the stock market when traders buy
or sell equities to protect their futures transactions.
   ``I think there should be a pause'' in index futures trading,
Regan told reporters after his testimony. ``It won't hurt very much
for a three-month or six-month pause here while we take a look at
the instrument itself and how it's used to see whether or not it
should be permitted to continue.''
   Regan told the senators the nation's financial markets, or the
federal agencies that regulate them, should initiate the steps he
recommended. If not, Congress should act, he said.
   At the same hearing, George L. Ball, chairman and chief
executive officer of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the
abolition of stock index futures should be considered.
   ``Most knowledgeable professionals agree that if it were not for
index futures, stock market moves would be far less wild, sudden or
irrationally large,'' he said.
   Charles R. Schwab, who owns the discount brokerage firm that
bears his name, also told the lawmakers that program trading should
be abolished if other steps to restore market confidence don't work.
   ``In surveys we have conducted, we hear over and over again the
theme that individual investors fear they cannot compete in markets
that are so dominated by the volatility introduced by program
trading and index arbitrage,'' he said.
   Earlier, Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee of the
board of governors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, told
reporters that index arbitrage helps stabilize the markets by
ensuring that stock and futures prices closely track each other.
   ``I'm not going to defend perception,'' he said. ``The reality
is it is not a factor'' in the volatility.

Plant-Closing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a creaky plank in the platform
President Reagan stands on when he sounds off against legislation
aimed at protecting workers against sudden plant closings.
   Reagan, speaking against the provision recently, said that ``as
an old labor union president, I suggest that's a matter that
belongs in the management-labor contracts between the unions and
the people.''
   But that suggests organized labor plays a larger-than-life role
in today's economy. Many government statisticians, unionists and
even business executives know better.
   Reagan headed the Screen Actors Guild in Hollywood in the late
1940s, when unions were far more powerful than they are today,
representing roughly a third of all workers.
   Because unions now represent only about 15 percent of all
workers, and about 20 percent in manufacturing, it doesn't
necessarily follow that plant notification protections can be left
for employers and unions to settle.
   Doing that would leave open the question of who takes care of
the interests of the other 80 percent of blue-collar workers.
   What's happened is that the administration has essentially
accepted the boardroom argument that executives must be free to
make their own decisions, Reagan's shopworn argument
notwithstanding.
   And Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin conceded to a manfacturer's
audience Tuesday that this may prove politically costly, especially
if Reagan's expected veto of the bill is sustained.
   ``The polls have indicated that, from the people I've talked to,
62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right
way to go,'' she said. ``This issue is going to drive us kicking
and screaming for the next five months.''
   The plant-closing provision in the 1,000-page trade bill was the
product of heavy lobbying by the AFL-CIO, and many Democrats were
unwilling to see it pulled from the bill.
   ``The workers who do not have the benefit of a union are treated
like dogs,'' said Brian Turner, assistant to Howard Samuel,
president of the AFL-CIO's Industrial Union Department.
   ``The fact is that, although a lot of companies talk a good game
and a lot of them do a good game, the overwhelming fact is that
many workers do not get sufficient notice,'' Turner said.
   He cited a Government Accounting Office study which found that
workers hit by plant closings but not represented by unions had an
average of only two days warning.
   Mark de Bernardo, special counsel for domestic policy at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Reagan is correct in opposing any
move by Congress to legislate worker notification protections.
   ``Eighty-eight percent of the employers do give some notice and
more and more employers are giving more, whether they have unions
or not,'' he said. ``But it's not always possible for businesses in
financial turmoil.''
   Plant closing legislation, he said, ``would handcuff employers
at a time which is particularly troubled and turbulent.''
   Audrey Freeman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a
business research organization in New York, challenged arguments
used by government, business and labor on this issue.
   Referring to Reagan's statement about leaving plant-closing
protection to companies and unions, she said, ``I think that's a
cynical response that you're getting from the White House.''
   ``The strength of unions tends to be more and more in government
and government-affected employment,'' rather than in manufacturing,
she said.
   ``The whole plant-closing thing is kind of artificial,'' she
said. ``I have the impression that they're (the opponents and
proponents) just acting in front of a painted scenery.''
   Ms. Freeman said she thinks business overstates its concern
about governmental interference and that organized labor merely is
trying to get back a greater say in the decision-making process.

   Kim Young-sam regained control of the
opposition Reunification Democratic Party on Thursday when he was
elected its president at a special party convention in Seoul.
   Kim's re-emergence at the helm of the party comes only three
months after he resigned from the top party post in an attempt to
forge a merger with the breakaway opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, led by rival Kim Dae-jung.
   In his acceptance speech, Kim Young-sam said he would reform the
party and lead it to victory in the general elections four years
from now. His party fell from first to second place in the
opposition lineup after the Party for Peace and Democracy gained
more seats in last month's parliamentary elections.
   The two Kims came under public pressure to retire from politics
in the wake of the Dec. 16 presidential elections. The two
opposition leaders both ran on separate tickets, despite widespread
calls for a single opposition candidacy, and lost out to governing
party candidate Roh Tae-woo.
   Kim Dae-jung resigned from his party's leadership post in March,
following the party's poor showing in the presidential election.

   Lawmakers who like to boast about how they
brought their district a new dam, deeper harbor or irrigation
system will find no cause to brag in a spending bill approved by
the House Appropriations Committee.
   The committee on Wednesday approved its first fiscal 1989
spending bill _ a $17.8 billion proposal for the Department of
Energy, Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.
   And for the first time in the memory of panel members and
veteran staffers, there's no money for the corps or the bureau to
begin construction of any new water projects in fiscal 1989, which
begins Oct. 1.
   ``You can't have just one new construction start,'' said Rep.
Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the Appropriations energy and water
development subcommittee. ``If we do one, we have to do all the
requests.''
   Bevill said the unusual austerity was necessitated by last
year's budget summit at which the White House and congressional
leaders agreed on a two-year blueprint designed to cut mounting
federal deficits.
   ``This has been the most difficult appropriations bill we've
ever put together,'' Bevill said as the full committee approved the
spending bill, the first of 13 it will handle this year.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said the no-new-starts decree could
spell an end to an old Capitol Hill juggling act: satisfy as many
member project requests as possible by putting up enough money to
get the shovel in the ground, with the big bucks coming in later
years.
   ``Those days are over,'' Fazio said. ``Maybe the ``T'' word _
taxes _ needs to be mentioned. We've run out of room.''
   Bevill said that Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., his Senate
counterpart in the appropriations process, has informally agreed to
try to keep money for new starts for the corps and the bureau out
of the Senate spending bill.
   Another major casualty in the House bill is the administration's
request for $363 million in fiscal 1989 to start construction of
the Super Collider, the mega-bucks physics project that would
explore exotic theories of matter.
   The committee voted $100 million to keep the planning process
alive but said the next president should decide whether to proceed
and how to pay for the huge experiment, which has construction cost
estimates ranging from $4.4 billion to $9 billion.
   Bevill said the committee's hands were tied by the budget
summit's targets for his spending area and an agreement that there
would be no reductions for defense-related nuclear activities by
the Department of Energy.
   He said that because these total about $8.1 billion, there was
little discretionary money for new projects after financing other
activities like continued work on some 400 water projects already
under construction and paying for operation and maintenance of
hundreds more.
   ``There just isn't a dollar left,'' added Rep. John Myers of
Indiana, the ranking Republican on Bevill's subcommittee. ``This is
by far the toughest year we've had.''
   Missing from the bill that goes to the House floor next Tuesday
are six new corps flood control projects requested by the
administration. They are Nonconnah Creek in Tennessee and
Mississippi; Cache Creek and Santa Ana River in California;
Sheyenne River, West Fargo and Riverside in North Dakota; Ramapo
and Mahway rivers in New Jersey; and Lock Haven in Pennsylvania.
   Had past practice prevailed, the administration's wish list
would have risen to 20 or more new construction starts as
influential lawmakers got their pet projects added as the spending
legislation progressed through Congress.
   The no-new-starts posture would have less of an impact on the
Bureau of Reclamation, the Interior Department agency that operates
west of the Mississippi.
   For the second straight year, the administration sought no new
construction for the bureau, which has announced it is phasing down
its building activities in favor of water conservation and
environmental restoration. Congress added no bureau starts last
year.

<HEAD>Federal Study Shows Viet Vets Have More Depression, Alcohol Abuse</HEAD>

   American soldiers who served in Vietnam suffer
from more depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse than do other GIs,
but medical examinations reveal no physical indications of exposure
to Agent Orange, a herbicide used widely during the Vietnam War.
   Those are among the findings of the Vietnam Experience Study, a
federal report prepared for release today at a hearing before a
Senate committee.
   The study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
released for publication in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, also showed that Vietnam veterans have a greater
hearing loss and a measurably lower sperm count.
   CDC based its findings on telephone interviews with 7,924 GIs
who served in Vietnam and 7,364 veterans who served elsewhere.
Those interviewed were selected randomly from enlisted men who
entered the Army from 1965 to 1971. A subsample of 2,490 Vietnam
veterans and 1,972 other soldiers also underwent extensive physical
examinations as part of the study.
   Vietnam veterans were almost twice as likely (19.6 percent to
11.1 percent) to report that they had health problems. Yet, when
physicians who did not know the military history of the two groups
examined the former soldiers, they could detect few medical
differences between the Vietnam veterans and the others.
   The study said the difference between what the Vietnam veterans
reported and what was found in examination may be the result of
increased stress.
   ``Vietnam veterans may have reported more symptoms and past
medical conditions because they experienced more stress than did
non-Vietnam veterans,'' said the study. Vietnam veterans also
showed more anxiety and depression in a battery of psychological
tests.
   ``Stress can produce anxiety, depression and a variety of
somatic (physical) symptoms,'' the study said.
   The Vietnam veterans are more likely to experience psychological
problems, the study said. About 14 percent of the Viet vets are
abusing alcohol, compared to 9 percent of the other group. For
anxiety, the difference is 5 percent to 3 percent, and for
depression, the difference is 5 percent to 2 percent.
   Drug use was about the same between the groups, but the study
said data suggest that more Vietnam veterans suffered drug-related
deaths.
   Fifteen percent of the Vietnam veterans also suffered some
symptoms of combat-related post traumatic stress disorder, and 2
percent reported such symptoms the month of the interviews.
   The study also said that the ``perceived exposure to herbicides
(a perception that in itself may lead to additional stress) is
associated both with psychological problems and with self-reported
adverse health conditions, but is not associated with objective
measures of exposure.''
   Many in the Vietnam Veterans of America organization have blamed
health problems on exposure during the war in Southeast Asia to
Agent Orange, a herbicide used to thin vegetation in dense jungle
combat areas. Use of Agent Orange was discontinued after it was
determined that it contained dioxin, a potent cancer-causing
chemical.
   The CDC study, however, said it found no difference in the rate
of cancers between the two groups of soldiers.
   Soldiers who served in Vietnam, particularly those in combat,
suffered more hearing loss than those who served elsewhere, the
study said.
   ``Vietnam veterans were 40 percent more likely to have
high-frequency hearing loss'' than GIs not in Vietnam, the study
said. It added that this ``is consistent with results of several
studies of army troops that show that exposure to military noise
results in irreversible hearing impairment.''
   A study of semen samples taken from 571 members of the two
groups showed that the Vietnam veteran is twice as likely to have a
low sperm concentration and 1.5 times as likely to have low levels
of normal sperm cells. And, yet, the study said, the two groups
fathered about the same number of children _ 1.4 each for the
Vietnam vets, and 1.5 for the non-Vietnam soldiers _ and reported
about the same rate of birth defects in their children.
   ``We were not able to determine the reasons for the differences
in sperm characteristics between Vietnam and non-Vietnam
veterans,'' the report said.
   The Vietnam Experience Study was ordered by Congress as part of
a veterans benefit bills passed in 1979 and 1981.

   They're all old men now, but the soldiers of
the multinational ``Jedburgh'' unit today are remembering the days
in World War II when they parachuted behind enemy lines with a
radio and a small fortune.
   ``We're getting a bit thinner every year,'' said Ivor Hooker of
Haverhill, England, after some of the old soldiers chanted a
raunchy put-down of superior officers in the Dulles International
Airport waiting area on Wednesday.
   The American and British veterans welcomed their French
comrades, along with widows and family members of some who have
died.
   In what is billed as probably their last full reunion, the 51
American, 26 French and 18 British ``Jeds'' _ some have not seen
each other for 44 years _ were beginning activities today that
would include wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National
Cemetery, honors at the British and French embassies and a visit
with President Reagan on Friday.
   Some are bragging a little. Others speak softly of lost comrades
in one of the most heroic and secretive exploits of the war. The
``top secret'' classification for hundreds of boxes of government
documents on the unit was only lifted in 1985.
   In teams of three, 279 Jeds were dropped across France, Belgium
and The Netherlands, to help lead the resistance against German
occupation. Their name comes from a town in Scotland where
``Jedburgh justice'' for sheep rustlers meant ``hang them first and
question them afterwards.''
   Douglas Bazata, who said he is still involved in government work
and accepts the description ``red-headed soldier of fortune'' even
though his hair is now pure white, asked another Jed at the airport
if he'd ever lost any of the money they were given to aid the
resistance around the time of the June 6, 1944, Normandy landings.
   Bazata, of Bethesda, Md., said he parachuted in with $300,000 in
cash.
   ``I loved it. You were totally your own boss, responsible for
everything. When you sent messages back to headquarters, they
listened. And you had unlimited money,'' said Bazata.
   The Jeds sabotaged German troops, blew up bridges and helped
organize and arm resistance forces. Most spoke French and blended
into cities and villages taken over by the Germans.
   Some of the Americans went on to similar missions in China,
organizing popular resistance against Japanese forces.
   Because they could pick their targets, few were killed during
the mission, said retired Col. Frank Mills of Fairfax, Va., who is
writing a book about Allied efforts behind enemy lines. Mills
worked in the Jedburgh operation and supervised some of the forces
in China but was not a Jed himself.
   ``They were guerrillas. They had to design operations that would
keep them alive,'' he said.
   Daphne Friele, who has helped organize the reunion, was so taken
by the American Jeds when she was an 18-year-old secretary to their
British commander that she later married two of them. Her first
husband, Col. Robert C. Mundinger, died in the Korean War. Two
years ago, she married Berent E. Friele, Jr., of Redding, Conn.,
after they met again at a Jed reunion in France.
   ``It took some of them this long to find each other, and they
won't let go,'' said Mrs. Friele, 62, who is still trying to find
out what happened to the only two Americans in the unit she hasn't
accounted for: Arthur Gruen and Ian Forbes.
   American members include former CIA Director William Colby;
retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who has organized a
controversial worldwide effort to support resistance groups against
communism, and internationally known yachtsman Hod Fuller, a
retired Marine general.
   The late columnist Stewart Alsop also was a Jed.

   Bernama said most of the 200 residents of Kuala Gum Gum village
fled into the jungle when the men arrived by speedboat on Wednesday
and began shooting.
   One woman who stayed behind was injured by the intruders, but
the extent and exact cause of her injury was not known.
   The men made off with about $1,000 in cash and property from the
village, located more than 1,000 miles east of Kuala Lumpur.

<HEAD>$3.1 Million Fine for Requiring Employees to Do Dangerous,
Repetitive Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration says serious health problems among workers required
to do repetitive physical labor on assembly lines prompted the
agency's second-largest fine ever against a single company.
   IBP Inc. says OSHA is trying to impose ``Alice in Wonderland
theories'' on industry, but the union representing workers at IBP's
Dakota City, Neb., meatpacking plant hailed Wednesday's decision to
get tough with the company.
   OSHA said it was imposing a $3.1 million fine against IBP for
willfully ignoring the hazards of repetitive motion. The agency
maintains that IBP could have taken numerous steps to reduce the
risk of injury, but did not.
   The affected employees work on production lines, doing such work
as cutting, trimming, hide removal and lifting meat with hooks,
said OSHA spokesman Terry Mikelson. All the work is done while the
meat moves at high speed through work stations in a cold, damp
environment.
   Mikelson said safety inspectors from the agency first ``noticed
a pattern of repetitive motion injuries'' during a preliminary
review of safety records in November 1987. Such injuries can be
crippling and are caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motion.
   OSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Frank White said repetitive
motion injuries are ``a major health hazard in one of the most
dangerous occupations in the country, and we want the meatpacking
industry, in general, and IBP, in particular, to eliminate the
problem.''
   OSHA says IBP refused to slow its production lines, change
equipment designs or educate workers about the need to change
positions periodically.
   ``IBP has known about the high toll that these disorders have
had on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it,'' White
said.
   ``We're most pleased about the recommendations the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration made in their lengthy complaint
against IBP _ recommendations for some very simple ways of
preventing injuries,'' said Al Zack, a spokesman for the United
Food and Commercial Workers Union.
   IBP, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Co., has 15 working
days to contest the fine. The company already is contesting a $2.6
million fine levied by OSHA last July for safety and record
violations at the Dakota City plant.
   In a statement issued late Wednesday, IBP officials indicated
they will fight the case in court.
   The citation, the company statement said, ``represents a
misguided attempt by OSHA to force the meatpacking industry to
blindly accept untested theories about the prevention of repetitive
motion disorders.''
   ``OSHA's goal,'' the statement continued, ``is to intimidate
companies by threatening enormous penalties unless they accept
Alice in Wonderland theories.''
   The company said it has urged OSHA to develop a special program
for the meatpacking industry, but that OSHA has not done that.
   Zack said the union is disappointed that IBP continues to ``deny
there is a problem. It would be far preferable if IBP would start
working on solutions.''
   After the preliminary study revelaed a pattern of injuries, OSHA
hired an expert in ergonomics, David Cochran, of the University of
Nebraska at Lincoln, to do more extensive studies, Mikelson said.
   The studies found that 620 workers at 45 work stations at the
Dakota City plant were ``at grave risk'' of developing repetitive
motion illnesses, he said. Of those, 377 workers actually had
developed injuries, Mikelson said. Some required surgery, some are
on restricted work schedules and some are on permanent disability
leave, he said.
   The $3.1 million fine represents a $5,000 penalty for each of
the 620 workers.
   Mikelson estimated that a total of 3,000 people work at the
Dakota City plant, one of 15 IBP plants.
   Workers at the Dakota City plant went on strike in the winter of
1987, following a bitter lockout by IBP. The strike ended last July.
   The fine is the second largest OSHA has ever imposed against an
individual company. The largest was $4.2 million against Bath Iron
Works in Bath, Maine, in November 1987 for health and safety
violations.
   The largest fine against multiple companies came in March of
this year _ $5.11 million against five contractors that worked on a
Brideport, Conn., apartment building that collapsed in April 1987.

   The London Zoo will receive an $18.8 million
government grant to modernize and attract more visitors, a zoo
spokeswoman said.
   London Zoo in central London's Regent's Park, and Whipsnade Wild
Animal Park in suburban Bedfordshire, have regularly lost money
despite government subsidies and attempts to boost attendance in
the past, said Sue Copsey.
   The two zoos, with the Institute of Zoology, form the Zoological
Society of England which has been losing up to $3.76 million
annually, Ms. Copsey said.
   She said on Wednesday that the losses were due to a large drop
in annual attendance, which fell from an average of 3 million in
the 1950s to less than 1 million in 1982. She said there had been a
slight increase in recent years.
   The grant will help the zoo draw more visitors by funding new
amusement-park type attractions and new animal housing and
displays, she said.

<HEAD>Three Southern Governors Seek Aid For Depressed Delta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES SAGGUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROSEDALE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governors of Mississippi, Arkansas
and Louisiana will join forces aboard a Mississippi River barge
Friday for a fight against the Delta region's depressed economy.
   Govs. Ray Mabus of Mississippi, Bill Clinton of Arkansas and
Louisiana's Buddy Roemer will sign an agreement to address chronic
problems of unemployment, illiteracy and poverty in the fertile
farmlands along the river.
   ``We decided to use a barge for the signing so we could get to
the point where the three states come together,'' Mabus said. ``We
thought the coming together was symbolic.''
   Mabus said he hoped the ceremony would mark ``the start of a
regional economic development effort, one that will signal a new
focus on our region of the country and attract international
investments and national attention to the three-state region.''
   The governors will sign two agreements.
   One will seek support for a congressional bill requesting
federal assistance for the region. ``We are going to try to present
a united front to Washington,'' Roemer said.
   He said the states could share administration of some programs
to help the area and he cited as an example the possibility of
schools in which children and their parents could be taught.
   ``I can see a mother bringing her child to a first-grade class
to read and write and go down to a hallway where she would learn to
read and write,'' Roemer said.
   The other agreement involves coordination of international trade
efforts and attempts to attract foreign investment, with the first
target country being Japan.
   Clinton said the region has been devastated by national farm
problems that had dried up markets for Delta-grown soybeans, rice,
milo and cotton. Industries that once offered jobs to displaced
farmhands have moved overseas in quest of cheaper labor.
   Statistics show the Arkansas and Mississippi counties and
Louisiana parishes in the Delta region _ the flatlands on both
sides of the river from Memphis to Natchez _ are among the nation's
poorest, many with poverty levels of above 50 percent.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a sponsor of legislation to authorize
federal aid, said the Delta should be the target of an anti-poverty
crusade similar to President Kennedy's effort to improve conditions
in Appalachia.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said he hoped a federal study would
produce a report ``that will almost shame Congress into taking
action.''
   Reps. Jamie Whitten and Mike Espy, D-Miss., have filed similar
legislation in the House.

   Two of West Germany's largest
department store chains have stopped buying South African produce
for their supermarkets.
   The Hertie and Kaufhof chains said on Wednesday the policy was
implemented recently and that little South African produce remained
in their supermarkets.
   For more than 10 years, anti-apartheid, religious and other
groups in West Germany have called on the nation's businesses to
boycott South African goods.
   But Elmar Kratz, a Hertie spokesman, said the decision was based
on business considerations. ``When we find our customers are not
buying a certain line or type (of goods) then we stop purchasing
them,'' he told reporters. He said sales of South African produce
dropped drastically in recent years.
   West Germany, one of South Africa's largest trading partners,
has refused to consider economic sanctions against the white-led
Pretoria government.

<HEAD>Democratic Group to Push for National Service Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teams of elected officials from a Democratic
Party group plan to campaign in coming months for a voluntary
program that would link federal education, housing and job training
aid to participation in civilian or military service.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the plan proposed by the Democratic
Leadership Council would say essentially ``that if you're going to
get assistance from society for your education, then you're going
to serve society.''
   The group released its 66-page proposal on Wednesday. It calls
for creation of a ``Citizens Corps'' made up of young volunteers
who would work one or two years at subsistence wages in civilian or
military service.
   For each year of service in the corps a volunteers would earn a
$10,000 voucher that could be used for college, vocational training
or a home down payment.
   Nunn said the vouchers would eventually replace existing federal
grant and loan programs as the primary source of federal aid to
students.
   The proposal also calls for enlistment of volunteers over the
age of 65, who would earn modest wages instead of vouchers and
would perform primarily administrative and supervisory tasks within
the corps.
   Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, past chairman of the DLC,
said the proposal is ``an attempt to move away from the politics of
pure entitlement to some sort of system that involves mutual civic
obligation.''
   The DLC is composed primarily of moderate and conservative
Democrats, many from the South, and was a prime mover behind the
creation of this year's ``Super Tuesday'' multi-state primary day.

<BYLINE>Doctors Failing to Recognize Side Effects of Psychiatric Drugs,
Study Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors often fail to recognize serious side
effects of psychiatric drugs, leaving patients with unnecessary
anxiety and lethargy and at risk of giving up the medication,
according to a study.
   ``The side effects are being missed in epidemic proportions,''
said Peter Weiden, assistant professor of psychiatry at Cornell
University Medical Center in New York.
   While the study dealt with hospitalized patients, the side
effects are so unpleasant that they could make patients stop taking
the medications once they are discharged, he said.
   Doctors must be better trained to spot and treat side effects,
while patients and their families must be taught to recognize the
problems and point them out to doctors, Weiden said.
   Weiden presented his study Wednesday at the annual meeting of
the American Psychiatric Association. Similar findings have emerged
from studies at several psychiatric hospitals, he said.
   ``It's cause for concern. It's a good reason for education'' of
doctors, patients, families and health systems, said John Talbott,
chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine and a former president of the association.
   The study dealt with side effects of drugs called neuroleptics,
which are used to treat hospitalized patients for schizophrenia,
manic-depression and severe depression.
   The same drugs are used in lower doses for outpatients with
schizophrenia and related conditions, and some other illnesses.
   Serious side effects are fairly common. One recent study found
them in about 62 percent of patients on the drugs.
   If recognized, the side effects can be treated with other
medications or by reducing dosages of the neuroleptic.
   Weiden and colleagues looked for side effects in 48 patients
admitted to a private psychiatric hospital. They then compared
their assessments with those of the doctors treating the patients.
   They found that the doctors overlooked side effects in:
   _ 20 of 27 patients with akathisia, a physical or mental
restlessness that can include pacing, leg motion, agitation and the
urge to move or flee.
   _ 12 of 29 patients with parkinsonism, which includes tremor,
rigidity and slowing of movements.
   _ two of three patients with acute dystonia, an often
frightening attack of muscle contraction that can last several
seconds.
   _ nine of 23 patients with akinesia, a decrease in spontaneous
movements and gestures or a zombie-like feeling.
   Some unrecognized cases of akinesia were so severe that ``the
patients could hardly move,'' Weiden said.
   In rare cases, side effects can be fatal, he said in an
interview.
   Doctors overlook side effects for several reasons, Weiden said.
   They are not extensively trained in spotting side effects, some
of which mimic symptoms of a patient's illness. Working in a
psychiatric hospital ward, they also tend to get used to seeing the
side effects, he said, and ``you kind of forget how distressing it
is.''
   In addition, the acutely psychotic patients often cannot
communicate about the problem effectively, he said.
   To improve diagnosis of the side effects, doctors in psychiatric
wards should ask specifically about the symptoms, carefully record
the patient's physical and pharmacological history, and do physical
exminations apart from therapy sessions, Weiden said.
   Nurses and doctors should get early training in spotting the
problem, he said.
   Jeffrey Lieberman of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in
Glen Oaks, N.Y., said part of the discrepancy Weiden's study found
might result from different opinions on when symptoms are serious
enough for a diagnosis.
   But he agreed that many physicians are not adequately trained on
spotting side effects.

   Sportscaster Howard Cosell is ``one of the
unhappiest human beings on this planet'' and repeatedly alienated
his ABC Sports colleagues with his heavy drinking and overbearing
behavior, says a former network executive.
   In ``Up Close & Personal: The Inside Story of Network Television
Sports,'' Jim Spence says Cosell drank ``before, during and after
telecasts'' and once threw up on Don Meredith's cowboy boots during
``Monday Night Football.''
   Spence, who worked at ABC for 26 years, was senior vice
president of ABC Sports from 1978 until he left the network in
1986. He is now president of a sports production and marketing
company.
   In his book, co-written with Dave Diles, Spence describes
Cosell, 70, as an insecure, argumentative man who had become
impossible to work with by the time he left the network in 1985.
The book will be in bookstores next month.
   ``He had made millions of dollars, traveled the world, been
applauded and honored time and time again. Yet, today, I think he
is one of the unhappiest human beings on this planet,'' Spence
wrote.
   A woman answering the phone at Cosell's home Wednesday said he
was visiting his wife at a New York hospital, where she is
recovering from surgery.

   British pop singer George Michael is the
first white solo artist to hit the top of the black album chart
with his LP ``Faith,'' in what one Billboard columnist called ``an
amazing achievement.''
   The Bee Gees were the last music group to reach No. 1 on the
black charts with the soundtrack from the disco movie ``Saturday
Night Fever'' in 1976.
   But no white had done so since the charts began in 1965,
although Madonna, Phil Collins, Michael McDonald and Herb Alpert
have come close, Billboard columnist Paul Grein said Wednesday.
   ``It's an amazing achievement because it means he is accepted
(by black audiences) and is credible,'' Grein said.
   Michael's representatives were informed by Billboard on Monday
that ``Faith,'' which has sold 12.5 million copies and produced
three hit singles since its release late last year, will take the
No. 1 spot on the black charts in next week's issue, said Michael's
spokesman, Phil Lobel.
   ``Faith'' currently is No. 1 on Billboard's pop chart, which

   In fact, she'll appear as part of a campaign for the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society this month in an ad that reads, ``Even

   The actress, who is one of 250,000 Americans who suffer from the
disease that attacks the muscular system, says she resisted the
campaign at first, thinking it would only inspire pity.
   ``I didn't want to do any of that look-how-I've-been victimized
jazz,'' she said recently.
   But when the society showed her a proposed ad campaign that
showed people with multiple sclerosis doing such activities as
scuba diving and sky diving, she changed her mind.
   ``It says to the world, OK, I'm in a wheelchair,'' Miss Rhue
said, ``but look at what I can do.''
   Miss Rhue's most visible role is the wheelchair-bound ballistics
expert on CBS-TV's ``Houston Knights.''

   A congresswoman is accusing a Justice
Department official of harassing one of his senior attorneys who is
seeking to extend her maternity leave to seven months instead of
the usual three to four months.
   ``Has war on maternity leave replaced the war on drugs?'' Rep.
Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., wrote Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The
letter was directed against Assistant Attorney General John Bolton,
head of the department's criminal division.
   Bolton has ordered Joan Bernott to return to work May 31 or
submit additional medical information from her doctor giving a
reason why her leave should be extended to mid-August.
   On May 4, Bolton rejected Ms. Bernott's request, which is
supported by a note from her medical doctor, to extend her leave
without pay to Aug. 15. Asked whether she would report to work May
31, Ms. Bernott, who went on maternity leave Jan. 25, said that she
would defer to the advice of her doctor.
   In an interview Wednesday, Bolton responded that ``there was no
intent whatsoever to harass'' Ms. Bernott and that ``the idea that
there is discrimination here is absolutely untrue.''
   He referred to an April 21 comment in which he told Ms.
Bernott's lawyer that ``nobody is going to ask Ms. Bernott to do
anything which would in any way jeopardize her health'' and said he
simply wanted more information from her doctor regarding the
medical basis for the additional leave time.
   Bolton said the civil division faces an enormous workload and
that it was vital that its 25 senior attorney positions _ one of
which is held by Ms. Bernott _ be staffed fully.
   Ms. Bernott obtained a letter from her physician, Dr. Sandra M.
Chase, on March 28 saying that an additional four months of
recuperation from a difficult pregnancy was required.
   ``Return to work now, in my opinion, represents health risk to
this patient,'' the doctor said in a follow-up April 26 letter
submitted as a result of Bolton's request for more information.
   Bolton said Ms. Bernott had told Mary Ann Beck, director of the
office of administration, on March 25 that she didn't want to
return to work before mid-August because she wanted to attend a
wedding of her husband's brother in Geneva, Switzerland, the week
before Aug. 15.
   Ms. Bernott said she did not want to come back earlier in August
and then simply have to ask for another week off to go to the
wedding, he said.
   Ms. Bernott hired a lawyer to represent her after Bolton told
her in a letter April 13 that there was ``evidence that you may
have willfully submitted a fraudulently based claim for excessive
leave.''
   Ms. Bernott, 42, who has three children, was the Justice
Department's lead attorney in successfully defending the government
against litigation surrounding the use of the defoliant Agent
Orange during the Vietnam war.

   The following are biographical sketches of the
four British traitors recruited at Cambridge University in the
1930s by a Soviet agent who is still unidentified.
   _ Harold Adrian Russell ``Kim'' Philby was regarded as the most
damaging spy to Western intelligence. The only one of the Cambridge
spy ring who was not a homosexual, he is believed to have become a
Soviet agent in 1933, the year in which he saw fascists fighting
communists and labor unionists in Austria. When entrusted with the
Russian desk of MI6, the British intelligence unit that controls
agents abroad, he told the Soviets who was spying on them. He
served in Washington as liaison officer with the CIA. He betrayed a
British-U.S. plan to land guerrillas in communist Albania in 1946
and 300 were killed. He fled to Moscow in 1963 while working as
journalist in Beirut.
   _ Anthony Frederick Blunt, an art historian, recruited spies for
Moscow during the 1930s. He spied for the Soviets during World War
II while working for the British MI5 counter-espionage service. He
was unmasked in 1964 but was granted immunity in return for telling
all he knew about Soviet intelligence. He was publicly exposed in
1979 and stripped of the knighthood conferred for his services as
royal art adviser. He died in London of a heart attack in 1983.
   _ Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess became a Soviet agent in the
1930s because he believed only Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin could
stop Adolf Hitler. He worked as a British diplomat in Washington
and looked after Far East affairs during the Korean War. He lived
in Washington with Philby, who was also working for the British
Foreign Office. He died in Moscow in 1963 at age 52.
   _ Donald Duart Maclean worked for the Foreign Office and was
posted to Washington in 1944, but recalled because of heavy
drinking. He worked with Americans and Canadians on the Combined
Policy Committee for Joint Atomic Development and gave the Soviets
documents on nuclear planning. It is believed he and Philby gave
atomic bomb secrets to Stalin. Maclean fled to Moscow with Burgess
in May 1951, where he was given the KGB rank of colonel. He died in
Moscow in 1983 at age 69.

   Jeremiah Denton, the former Alabama U.S.
senator and Vietnam prisoner of war, is furnishing a museum room in
his honor with souvenirs and mementos of his life _ including
letters from four presidents.
   The upstairs room at the Museum of the City of Mobile was
dedicated last month to commemorate its native son's POW years, his
joyous return from the war prison in Hanoi, his service in the
Senate and his continuing career of public service with the
National Forum Foundation.
   Some of the pieces are gifts to the museum. Others were placed
on loan, including presidential letters from Lyndon Johnson,
Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.
   Some of the letters were written to Denton's wife, Jane, during
her husband's 7{-year captivity. The most recent, from Reagan, was
dated April 12 and congratulated the 63-year-old Denton on his
``hometown tribute.''

<HEAD>Army Says It Foiled Uprising; Two Officers Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Troops foiled a rebellion against
President Vinicio Cerezo's civilian government and arrested two
army officers who were halted leading soldiers toward the capital,
the defense minister said.
   The minister, Gen. Hector Alejandro Gramajo Morales, gave no
details of Wednesday's rebellion and would not confirm an earlier
Defense Ministry statement that a coup attempt had taken place.
   He did not say how many soldiers were involved, what kind of
arms they used or if there was any violence.
   Gramajo Morales said the two officers arrested, whom he refused
to identify by name or rank, had staged short-lived ``acts of
indiscipline.''
   Reading a prepared statement, he told a news conference the two
ringleaders met with officers and soldiers at bases in Jutiapa, 75
miles south of the capital, and Retalhuleu, 115 miles southwest of
Guatememala City, and led them toward the capital Wednesday morning.
   ``They were immediately neutralized and the officers involved
immediately changed their attitude,'' Gramajo Morales said, adding
that the rest of the army's 74 bases and installations were not
involved.
   The defense minister said one of the ringleaders temporarily
blocked the road leading from Guatemala City to El Salvador,
prompting the army to deploy extra troops around the capital.
   Guatemala City remained calm throughout the day. Local radio and
television broadcasts said troops involved in the uprising had
returned to their barracks.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
preliminary reports indicated some military units were involved in
a coup attempt, but she had no details. She reaffirmed U.S. support
for civilian government.
   Cerezo, who with his Cabinet were briefed on the uprising by
Gramajo Morales, did not issue any public statement.
   A lawyer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, Cerezo
was elected in November 1985 in the first election in 16 years in
which the military did not field a candidate.
   Nearly halfway through his term, Cerezo faces discontent over
economic measures and a powerful military.
   While his government has wanted the world to see Guatemala as
safe for the return of exiles, including leftist leaders, the
military has made known it does not welcome them.
   Both the Cerezo administration and military leaders have opposed
a prompt resumption of peace talks with leftist guerrillas, who
have been fighting the civilian government and a succession of
military or military-dominated governments for 27 years.
   Cerezo succeeded Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who seized
power in August 1983 from another military ruler, Gen. Efrain Rios
Montt.
   Rios Montt came to power after young army officers staged a coup
in March 1982 that overthrew the rightist government of Gen.
Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis was holding meetings today with congressional leaders
before heading for Oregon, the scene of the next primary contest.
   The Massachusetts governor had a morning meeting set with
Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa. Tutu told members of
Congress on Wednesday he favors new and harsher economic sanctions
against South Africa to pressure the country to end its policy of
official racism.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was introducing a measure today
that would require U.S. companies to shed their investments in
South Africa within a year and ban trade in everything but
strategic minerals and agricultural products. A similar bill is
pending in the House.
   Dukakis was also meeting congressional leaders including House
Majority Leader Tom Foley; House Speaker Jim Wright; Rep. William
Gray, D-Pa., the chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senate
Majority leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
   The Massachusetts governor was attending a luncheon with Latin
American ambassadors before leaving for a series of appearances in
Oregon, which holds its primary Tuesday. Dukakis was traveling
tonight to California, which has 314 delegates at stake in its June
7 contest.
   Dukakis widened his delegate lead over Jesse Jackson this week
with wins in Tuesday's Nebraska and West Virginia primaries. He is
more than 600 delegates ahead of his only remaining Democratic
rival, but is still several hundred shy of the 2,081 delegates
needed to nominate.
   As his prospects for being the nominee have steadily improved in
recent weeks, Dukakis has been more aggressive in criticizing his
likely rival, George Bush. The vice president, who has a
mathematical lock on the GOP nomination, received President
Reagan's formal endorsement on Wednesday night.
   That drew a gibe from the Dukakis camp.
   ``We figured it's because Aquarii get along better with Geminis
than Scorpios,'' said Dukakis campaign spokesman Steve Akey,
referring to Nancy Reagan's consultations with an astrologer, as
reported by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan in his
new book.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis rode high-speed trains being tested for
use between Boston and New York and accused the Reagan
administration of failing to promote such service and ``spending
the last eight years without a national transportation policy.''
   He also attended a fund-raiser in New Jersey, whose primary is
the same day as California's.

   Jesse Jackson, telling supporters ``I earn
my votes every day'' was campaigning hard for Oregon's primary next
Tuesday, leading an anti-drug march through a crime-ridden city
neighborhood and visiting an Indian reservation.
   Jackson was winding up a three-day campaign swing through the
state today. He dismissed polls showing him behind Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts.
   ``Let the polls catch up to leadership,'' he said, also brushing
aside defeats in Tuesday's West Virginia and Nebraska primaries.
   On Wednesday, Jackson made his trademark anti-drug appeal at a
Portland high school.
   ``You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of
your life and you can make a difference,'' he told about 1,300
students at predominantly black Jefferson High School.
   ``Dope pushers are killers of the dream,'' he said. ``They're
terrorists.''
   Jackson was greeted with thunderous applause on his arrival in
the school's gymnasium and received several standing ovations from
the students. After the rally, he led a 13-block anti-drug march
from the school through one of Portland's highest-crime areas.
   Jackson also traveled to Redmond, where he told leaders of
Oregon Indian tribes he would see that Indian concerns are included
in the Democratic Party platform.
   ``In our government, there will be a secretary of Interior who
is sensitive to your humanity, sensitive to our treaty
obligations,'' Jackson said.
   At Redmond High School, Jackson stopped to embrace Robin Tovey,
13, a seventh-grader born with no arms or legs. Asked what Jackson
said to her when he gave her his Redmond High School cap, she
replied, ``That he loved me.''
   Jackson also went to a hospital to see a teen-aged volunteer
worker in his campaign who was hurt in a riding accident this week.
   In Salem, Jackson told a crowd of 2,500 cheering supporters that
his quest for the presidency is ``winning every day.'' He said he
is ``setting the moral tone for the campaign.''
   ``I earn my votes every day, I'm not inheriting any votes,''
Jackson said. ``When I win, you win.''

   A feisty, 3-year-old girl who made medical
history with a five-organ transplant died after a six-month
struggle that doctors say will help advance research into the
experimental surgery.
   Tabatha Foster of Madisonville, Ky., who spent most of her life
in hospitals, died Wednesday afternoon, a month shy of her fourth
birthday, in the intensive care unit at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh.
   The 36-pound, pigtailed child was the world's longest survivor
of a five-organ transplant. She received a new liver, small
intestines, pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon during a
15-hour experimental operation that ended Nov. 1.
   Similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the
world, and both patients died within a few days.
   An infection in Tabatha's bloodstream caused her heart, kidneys
and liver to fail, said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   ``It was system failure, everything. It was like a chain
reaction,'' she said.
   Among those expressing sympathy was President Reagan, who had
mentioned Tabatha's plight in a national radio address in January
and contributed $1,000 toward her medical expenses.
   ``Many Americans were drawn to her because of her courageous
battle against birth defects. We extend our deepest sympathies to
her family,'' the president said in a statement.
   Tabatha's parents, Roy and Sandra Foster, were at her side and
had told doctors not to try to revive her if her heart stopped, Ms.
Cardillo said.
   ``I was a little surprised that it ended as suddenly as this,''
said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of transplant surgery at
Children's Hospital. ``Even though she was a child of enormous
physical and enormous emotional strength, it was just slowly ebbing
away.''
   As Starzl described the devotion of Tabatha's parents at a news
conference, he stopped speaking in the middle of a sentence and sat
down, fighting back tears.
   Tabatha won the hearts of hospital staff with good-natured
teasing, playing peek-a-boo, giggling each day at ``Sesame Street''
and singing ``The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.''
   ``Bless her little heart,'' said Deborah B. Morrow, a family
friend in Madisonville. ``A lot of times you see a child who has
been sick and they're kind of moody. But Tabatha was an outgoing
girl. She wasn't afraid of anything.''
   Well-wishers from around the country, including Frank Sinatra,
donated more than $350,000 to help cover her medical expenses. Much
of the money came from black churches. Tabatha, who was black, also
received boxloads of toys, cards and notes from schoolchildren.
   Starzl said a study of Tabatha's case in coming weeks will help
determine the feasibility of future multiple-organ transplants.
   ``This is not the loss meaninglessly of a life,'' the surgeon
said. ``Along with death came the accrual of something really
worthwhile.''
   Tabatha's parents decided they did not want an autopsy
performed, but Starzl said he hoped they would allow doctors to
study some tissues from the transplanted organs.
   Because of an intestinal deformity, doctors had been forced to
remove 95 percent of Tabatha's small bowel three days after she was
born. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet, which
damaged her liver.
   Doctors had said Tabatha would soon die without undergoing the
transplant. They determined it would be easier to replace the
entire five-organ group rather than just her liver and small
intestine.
   Another multiple transplant has since been done at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. The
10-month-old patient was reported in good condition Wednesday after
receiving a new liver, small intestine, pancreas and part of a
stomach Feb. 9.
   Tabatha's condition began deteriorating Monday when she
developed trouble breathing. Her blood pressure fell after surgeons
changed drainage tubes inserted last month to relieve a buildup of
bile in her transplanted liver, Ms. Cardillo said.
   Doctors had ruled out the possibility of another transplant for
Tabatha because she was too weak to withstand the operation, Ms.
Cardillo said.

   A South Carolina legislator had a
suggestion to end discussion on bills designating ``official''
state animals, vegetables and minerals: Designate an official
everything.
   ``We ought ... to have everyone fill out the darn list with
everything they can think of and we would never have this come
before us again,'' said Rep. Woody Aydlette. ``We could have a
state cat, a state snake, even a state disease. After that, we
would be finished with it. Why do them one at a time? Just go ahead
and get them on a list and let's go.''
   The reaction of fellow House members to Aydlette's proposal was
less than enthusiastic.
   They ignored it.
   The Republican lawmaker was trying to block a bill to make the
loggerhead sea turtle the state reptile, but the measure raced
through the House anyway Wednesday. The Senate recently approved
the bill, along with a measure to make the praying mantis South
Carolina's state insect.
   The state already has a state fish, deer, bird, wild game bird
and dog, not the mention a state flower, tree, flag, stone, shell,
fruit, beverage, stone, two state songs and a dance.
   Aydlette says its a waste of time and money to pass legislation
adding state symbols. But, he said, ``it's beginning to take up too
much time to even fight the thing now.''

   Bethlehem Township is putting up road
signs to remind motorists to be kind to their web-footed friends.
   The state Department of Transportation has fashioned its first
official ``Duck Crossing'' sign to protect a flock of mallards that
have found a home along a stream running under Willow Park Road.
The diamond-shaped sign features a duck's silhouette in black
against a yellow background.
   The sign was proposed by a young woman concerned about rising
fatalities among her feathered friends.
   ``I was seeing a lot of them hit,'' said Jennifer Boerstler, 22.
``Neighbors would pick up the ducks that got hit and hide them,
because they know it upsets me so much.''

   Supporters of a constitutional amendment to
make English the country's official language fear that Hispanics
are ``taking over,'' says a congressman who opposes the idea.
   ``If it is a symbolic measure with no impact whatsoever on our
rights, then it is a frivolous exercise,'' Rep. Albert Bustamante,
D-Texas, told the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and
criminal rights Wednesday.
   ``If it restricts civil rights on the basis of one's proficiency
in English, then it is divisive and a dangerous amendment,'' said
Bustamante, a former migrant worker who is the son and grandson of
Mexican-American migrant workers.
   Supporters testified Wednesday that the amendment was not
intended to stifle freedom, but rather to clarify public policy and
give legal protection to English, the glue that holds the country
together.
   Rep. Norman D. Shumway, R-Calif., said he does not want to see
the nation drift unwittingly into a bilingual country.
   ``We cannot afford to wait a decade, or a generation, until our
government is conducting its affairs in languages other than
English,'' said Shumway, who has proposed one of the English
amendments.
   And Rep. William S. Broomfield, R-Mich., said: ``English is our
nation's language only by tradition, and if action is not taken
soon, we could face a future of uncertainty in our basic
communication, as well as ethnic and racial polarization.''
   Rep. Gerald D. Kleczka, D-Wis., an opponent, said: ``It is in
fact a direct attack on Hispanics. No doubt about it.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., a member of the panel conducting
the hearing, said he questioned the motives behind the movement.
``What are we trying to get at here?'' he asked.
   After the hearing, Bustamante said advocates of official English
``have this fear they (Hispanics) are taking over. They're saying
... there's too many of them.''
   Bustamante testified the amendment could alienate non-English
speakers from vital services such as health care and deprive them
of public translators for courts, hospitals, emergency services and
police departments.
   According to testimony, 14 states have enacted official-English
laws.
   Linda Chavez, president of a group called U.S. English and
former staff director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
appointed by President Reagan, said the amendment would shift
educational emphasis for bilingual children.
   The children would work more on acquiring English-language
proficiency than on learning in their native language, she said.

   By naming a little-known Khomeini
loyalist as armed forces chief of staff, Iran's leaders appear to
be trying to end friction between the regular army and
Revolutionary Guards, Western anaylsts say.
   Brig. Gen. Ali Shahbazi was sworn in Monday, three weeks after
Iraq recaptured the Faw Peninsula in a lightning assault April
16-18 that caught the Iranians by surprise.
   In addition, U.S. warships sank or crippled two Iranian frigates
and four other armed vessels April 18 after knocking out two
Iranian oil platforms.
   Shahbazi's appointment by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ``is a
direct consequence'' of those defeats, said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a
Middle East specialist with the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies.
   Western analysts have speculated that more heads will roll among
military and naval commanders.
   Shahbazi, 42, replaced Brig. Gen. Ismael Sohrabi, who had been
the armed forces' chief of staff since 1984. Promoted from colonel,
Shahbazi had been Sohrabi's deputy for four years. ``It's like this
fellow came out of nowhere,'' Kopietz said in a telephone interview.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Shahbazi has
``an outstanding record in the guerrilla warfare headquarters'' at
Ahvaz in the oil-rich southwestern Khuzistan province, and it
stressed his ``revolutionary and religious commitment.''
   Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East specialist at Georgetown
University, said in a telephone interview that Shahbazi is ``a
Khomeini loyalist, a Khomeini professional, who has close links
with the Revolutionary Guards.''
   That indicated that the Tehran leadership is making a new effort
to end friction _ and often outright hostility _ between the
regular army and the increasingly powerful Revolutionary Guards
Corps.
   The 350,000-strong Revolutionary Guards, made up of Islamic
zealots who outnumber the army, have their own air and naval wings
and get the pick of new hardware.
   When he swore in Shahbazi on Monday, President Ali Khamenei
declared, ``The Revolutionary Guards and the army must work more
closely together and coordinate their operations in every area.''
   Iran had held Faw, a dusty strip of land in the northern gulf,
since capturing it in February 1986, but Iran apparently had
reduced its force in the enclave to about 20,000 men, half the size
of a year ago.
   Faw was the only significant chunk of Iraq that Iran had seized
in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   While Iran's loss of Faw does not significantly change the
military equation, Iraq's victory was a major psychological blow to
the Iranians.
   The Iranian navy's drubbing by the Americans doubled Tehran's
discomfiture.
   Unconfirmed reports from Tehran said the Revolutionary Guards
commander, Mohsen Rezai, and other hardliners pressed for
retaliation against the U.S. Navy, despite its superior firepower,
after the Americans pounded the two oil platforms April 18.
   The platforms were destroyed to avenge the mining of the missile
frigate Samuel B. Roberts in the Persian Gulf on April 14 during
which 10 sailors were injured.

<HEAD>Robertson Turning Attention To Training And Funding Christian

   Pat Robertson says he will end his run for
the 1988 Republican presidential nomination but will form a
political action committee to fund and train conservative Christian
political candidates.
   Robertson announced Wednesday in Washington that he had offered
his endorsement to Vice President George Bush, who has
mathematically clinched the GOP nomination, and indicated he would
withdraw from the race on Monday.
   However, after Robertson's announcement, an aide, Richard
Pinsky, said Robertson would suspend his campaign rather than
withdraw outright, and would release his delegates, but at a later
date.
   After his meeting with Bush, Robertson was asked by reporters at
the White House whether he was withdrawing. ``I will be making that
official on Monday,'' he replied. And asked whether he would be
releasing his delegates, he answered, ``Of course, I will be
releasing them.''
   The Robertson campaign later put out a press release saying
Robertson had spoken with reporters about the meeting with Bush and
told them ``he is not withdrawing from the race nor is he releasing
his delegates.'' The campaign did say Robertson would make a
statement about his campaign status on Monday.
   Calls to Robertson headquarters requesting a clarification were
not returned Wednesday night.
   The new political action committee _ Americans for the Republic
_ will actively support Christian candidates, according to Barbara
Gattullo, a spokesman for Americans for Robertson, Robertson's
campaign organization. She said the staff of Americans for
Robertson would switch to the new organization, keeping the same
office in Virginia, after the papers are filed with the Federal
Election Commission.
   In an interview with The Virginian-Pilot & The Ledger-Star of
Norfolk, Robertson said he likely would return to his job as the
Christian Broadcasting Network's chief executive officer, a job his
son has held since Robertson announced his candidacy.
   That came as a surprise to CBN officials.
   ``I don't have a comment to make,'' CBN spokesman Benton Miller
said Wednesday. ``None of the staff or I ... have been provided any
information by him at this point concerning what his future plans
are.''
   Robertson had appeared since 1967 on the ``700 Club'' program
that is the flagship of the network. He left the program in 1986 to
organize his presidential campaign and in September 1987 resigned
both as the network's chief executive officer and as a pastor in
the Southern Baptist church to run for office.
   The network immediately reported a dramatic drop in revenues and
began laying off personnel. At the time, spokesmen refused to blame
Robertson's political ambitions for the shortfall.
   Robertson, who has spent more than $22 million on his campaign,
has 46 delegates to the national convention. Of the March 8 Super
Tuesday primaries, Robertson failed to win any. He placed third

   A Trans World Airlines DC-9 with 41 passengers
made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff because of smoke in
the cockpit, officials said.
   Flight 643 for Madison, Wis., had just taken off Wednesday night
when the pilot reported the smoke and returned to Lambert
International Airport.
   After the landing, the passengers were evacuated by emergency
chutes as crash crews stood by, the airport manager's office said.
The only injury reported was a scraped elbow.
   There was no fire and the source of the smoke was being
investigated, airport officials said.

<HEAD>Former Ohio Plumber Indicted In Fraud Schemes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former plumber from Ohio was charged in a
federal indictment with money laundering and fraud after a company
he ran in Florida bounced a $500,000 check and failed to deliver a
promised $4 million loan, authorities say.
   Prosecutors contend Walter E. Johnson defrauded unsuspecting
business executives by claiming to control a $3 trillion gold
bullion hoard from World War II. The company, European Arabian
Trust Inc., was shut down by Florida banking authorities in 1986.
   Johnson, the firm's president, and four other people including
its former managing director, Stewart A. Koral, were named in a
federal indictment made public Wednesday.
   Johnson, a former plumber from Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and Koral
have said in newspaper interviews that they were entrusted in 1981
with an Indonesian admiral's $3 trillion fortune in gold bullion.
But they have not produced evidence that they actually have the
gold.
   According to the five-count indictment made public in U.S.
District Court here, Johnson, Koral and their co-defendants were
charged with conspiring to launder ``vast amounts of U.S. currency
derived from illicit activities.''
   The indictment described a complicated transaction in which
$100,000 provided by an undercover Internal Revenue Service agent
was transmitted to a Florida bank through a brokerage account in
New Hampshire without complying with U.S. currency transaction
reporting rules.
   The transaction was completed with the unwitting help of an
unidentified stockbroker at the Manchester, N.H., office of
Prudential-Bache Securities who was told that one of the
defendants, James J. Smith, was a CIA agent, according to the
indictment.
   The transaction was made through a Prudential-Bache account
purportedly set up to receive money from an Asian trust set up by
the Indonesian admiral, Seita Darma, the indictment charged.
   Johnson, Koral and two other defendants were also charged with
defrauding Systems Computer Technology Corp. out of $100,000 in
fees they charged to help the Malvern, Pa., company obtain a
subcontract for a fictitious Treasury Department project to create
a multinational currency to stabilize the world economy.
   The company, also known as SCT, paid the monthly retainer to
Kelgre Investment Group Inc., a Gaithersburg, Md. company headed by
Smith, the indictment said.
   SCT officials were led to believe that European Arabian had been
selected as a prime contractor for the fictitious top-secret
project that was aimed at disrupting the underground economy and
recapturing U.S. currency in foreign hands, according to the
indictment.
   Johnson is charged with telling the company it would be hired to
conduct a $1.1 million feasibility study. Johnson allegedly told
SCT that the subcontract award was being delayed while Treasury
Department officials tried to find a way to hide financing for the
secret project in the federal budget.
   The company was also told the project included an effort to help
Third World nations refinance their debt by bartering natural
resources for loans, the indictment says. Company officials were
told this phase of the contract was backed by the Seita Foundation,
according to the indictment.
   To lend credibility to the scheme, SCT officials were shown a
Jan. 14, 1986 letter to European Arabian about the project from
Carrye Elizabeth Maxwell, identified as a special consultant to the
Treasury Department.
   Maxwell, of Arlington, Va., was charged separately with bilking
two investors out of a total of $55,000 for applications for
multi-million loans she falsely represented were guaranteed by the
fictitious ``Project Recycle.'' She was also charged with
impersonating a Treasury Department official in other transactions.
   Also charged were Billy Hugh Blankenship of Gaithersburg Md.,
and Phillip Nicely of Great Falls, Va.
   Blankenship is charged with participating in both the SCT fraud
and money laundering schemes. Nicely, identified in court papers as
an associate of Kelgre Investment, is charged with participating in
the money-laundering conspiracy.
   The indictment follows a nearly two-year investigation.

   Here is a transcript of pertinent
communications between Aloha Airlines Flight 243 last April 28 as
the plane made an emergency landing at the Maui airport in Hawaii
after suffering an in-flight breakup. The exchanges are between the
co-pilot, Madeline ``Mimi'' Tompkins, and the controller at the
Maui airport tower:
   23:48:33 _ Flight 243: Maui tower, Aloha two forty three, we're
inbound for landing. ... We're just ah to the east of Makena, 10
(miles) east of Makena descending out of 13 (thousand feet) and we
have rapid decompression. Ah we are unpressurized declaring an
emergency.
   (A series of exchanges follow over confusion about the planes
flight number.)
   23:49:03 _ Tower: Aloha two-forty-three, say your position.
   23:49:05 _ Flight 243: We're just ah to the east of Makena Point
descending out of 11 thousand (feet). Request clearance into Maui
for landing. Request the equipment.
   23:49:16 _ Tower: Okay. The equipment is ... on the way.
   (The controller gives Flight 243 a transponder signal code so
that the plane may be fully identified on his radar screen. Further
confusion develops over the flight number because of poor radio
transmission quality.)
   23:49:58 _ Tower: two-forty-three, the equipment is on the roll.
Plan straight in runway two and I'll keep you advised on any wind
change.
   (The controller turns to other traffic and redirects one plane
to another runway so as not to interfere with Flight 243's landing.)
   23:52:11 _ Aloha two-forty-three, you still up (on the radio
frequency) ... Aloha two-forty-three, Maui. ... Aloha two -- (The
controller turns briefly to other traffic and resumes trying to
raise Flight 243.) Aloha two-forty, two-forty-three. If you hear,
ident.
   (Flight 243 then appears in a full data block on the
controller's radar screen, indicating that the pilot programmed his
transponder to the code given earlier.)
   23:53:40 _ Tower: Aloha two-forty-three. I hear you loud and
clear. Go ahead.
   23:53:42 _ Flight 243: Ah, we're gong to need assistance. We
cannot communicate with the flight attendants. Ah, will (there) be
assistance for passengers when we land?
   23:53:51 _ Tower: Okay. Understand you're going to need ah an
ambulance. Is that correct?
   23:53:55 _ Flight 243: Affirmative.
   (Controller turns to other traffic)
   23:54:39 _ Tower: Aloha two-forty-three, can you give me your
souls on board and your fuel on board?
   23:54:46 _ Flight 243: Eighty five, eighty six plus five crew
members.
   23:54:56 _ Tower: Roger, how many do you think are injured?
   23:54:58 _ Flight 243: We have no idea. We cannot communicate
with our flight attendants. (voice begins to show strain, but
control)
   23:55:00 _ Tower: Okay. We'll have ambulance on the way.
   23:55:05 _ Flight 243: (unintelligible) ah we won't have a nose
gear.
   23:56:00 _ Tower: Aloha two-forty-three, wind zero five-zero at
one-five. Equipment is in place.
   23:56:06 _ Flight 243: Okay. Be advised we have no nose gear. We
are landing without the nose gear.
   23:56:10 _ Tower: Okay. If you need assistance, keep me advised.
   23:56:14 _ Flight 243: We'll need all the equipment you got.
   (Controller provides wind information to two other planes.)
   23:58:11 _ Tower: Aloha two-forty-three, just for your
information the gear appears down. The gear appears down.
   (Seconds later Flight 243 touches down on the runway.)
   23:58:45 _ Tower: Aloha two-forty-three, just shut it down where
you are. Everything's fine. The gear _ the fire trucks are on the
way.
   (A Delta Airlines pilot asks the tower for the status of the
runway.)
   0001:41 _ Tower: Ah. I don't have an idea. It's shut down. We're
gonna close the airport now.
   0001:49 _ Delta pilot: Okay.

<HEAD>Big Writeoff By Texas S&L Could be Sign of Coming Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas savings association wrote off a loss
of nearly $1.2 billion in March, a portent of what could become the
largest bailout ever for the federal regulator of thrift
institutions.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in a report on the March
balance sheets of the 3,120 S&Ls it oversees, said Wednesday that
one institution in Texas accounted for roughly half of the
industry's decline in capital of $2.4 billion.
   Bank board spokesman William Fulwider said the agency had
decided not to identify the institution by name, explaining, ``It's
not a public institution and it has not filed its report yet for
the period.''
   Nearly all of the remaining capital declines were also in the
Southwest, where the economy is hard hit by depressed oil and real
estate prices, the bank board said.
   The biggest S&L bailout ever was the $1.3 billion rescue in
September of Vernon Savings and Loan Association in Dallas. If the
unidentified Texas institution has posted losses in months before
March, its bailout likely would top the Vernon rescue.
   The impending rescue of California-based Financial Corp. of
America, which owns the largest S&L in the nation, also is likely
to surpass the Vernon figure.
   The bank board said the industry's capital declined by $3.3
billion in the first quarter, compared with an increase of $548
million in the first quarter of 1987.
   The figures indicate that the industry, which suffered its worst
loss since the Great Depression last year at $6.8 billion, is in
for another bad year.
   ``Those are terrible numbers,'' said Bert Ely, an Alexandria,
Va., financial institutions analyst. ``What's really concerning is
... that annualizes out to a $12 billion to $13 billion loss for
the year, which is roughly double what the industry showed in
1987.''
   An institution's capital represents the amount of money left
over after its assets are sold and its deposits and debts are paid
off.
   As the number of insolvent S&Ls has soared during the 1980s, the
industry's capital-to-assets ratio _ a key measure of health _ has
dwindled from 4.51 percent at the end of 1986 to 4.12 percent at
the end of last year. It plummeted again in the first three months
of this year to 3.44 percent.
   ``You're seeing a rate of decline ... that would exhaust the
industry's capital in about 3{ years,'' Ely said. ``The losers in
the industry, the insolvent thrifts, are just sinking much faster
than the healthy thrifts can pull them out of it.''
   The report lends new credence to arguments that the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. does not have enough money to
resolve the problems of the more than 500 insolvent institutions
and that taxpayers' money may be needed.
   Congress, in passing legislation last August, pledged to stand
behind the insurance fund.
   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall said it is too soon to tell
whether the $20 billion available over the next three years will be
enough.
   However, bank board officials said last month that an audit of
the insurance fund, which backs deposits up to $100,000, showed
that its liabilities exceeded its assets by $11.6 billion at the
end of 1987, up from $6.3 billion at the end of 1986.
   An audit report due this month from the congressional General
Accounting Office is expected to show an even larger deficit at the
end of 1987 and some analysts say the insurance fund may eventually
be $30 billion to $60 billion in the hole.
   The March decline at the single Texas thrift alone accounts for
a fifth of the money _ $6 billion _ that the bank board is
allotting to clean up Southwest institutions.
   The industry's earnings prospects, at least in the next few
months, look dim, Ely said, because interest rates on what
institutions pay for funds are rising faster than the rate they
earn on their loan portfolios.
   One bright spot in the bank board report is the sixth
consecutive monthly increase in deposits in March. Deposits flowed
into savings institutions during the first three months of 1988 at
the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1984.
   The bank board said net deposits increased by $4.5 billion in
March, bringing net deposits for the first quarter of this year to
$15.2 billion.
   That compares with net withdrawals of $5 billion in March 1987
and $8.2 billion for the first three months of 1987.
   The industry, until the October stock market crash, had been
suffering a drain of deposits in what analysts labeled a
slow-motion run. However, that trend reversed as investors pulled
their money from the volatile stock market and sought the relative
safety of government-insured S&L accounts. Since then, an increase
in Americans' savings rate has helped keep the deposits coming.

<HEAD>Researchers Says Science On Brink Of Correcting Flawed Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A hormone that causes the body to produce
immune cells is in the final stages of clinical testing and may
provide a breakthrough in protecting the elderly against death from
influenza and pneumonia, two researchers say.
   ``This may well be a research breakthrough for the treatment of
disease among elderly people,'' Dr. William B. Ershler of the
University of Wisconsin told the Senate Committee on Aging.
   The committee is conducting a hearing on research into the
health problems of the elderly.
   Thymosin Alpha One, a form of the hormone thymosin, has now been
given to elderly patients in two early clinical trials, and in both
cases the level of immune action was increased, Ershler said
Wednesday.
   Flu vaccine generally is effective in only about 25 percent of
the elderly who receive it, he said. But in studies using Thymosin
Alpha One, the effectiveness was increased to 70 percent.
   Researchers have long known that the immune system becomes
increasingly weaker as people age, he said. As a result,
``infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
elderly people,'' he said.
   Ershler said a deficiency of one of the immune cells, called
T-cell lymphocyte, is caused by a decline in the function of the
thymus gland. This, in turn, has been traced to a shortage of
thymosin.
   An expanded study, using 400 patients at the U.S. Soldiers and
Airmen's Home here, was conducted last fall and winter. Results
have not been analyzed, said Ershler, but ``it may be a research
breakthrough.''
   Allan L. Goldstein, a professor at George Washington University
and a co-discoverer of thymosin, said the Washington study has
``great promise.''
   ``It is hoped that within two years we'll be able to apply this
new approach to lower the incidence of flu and pneumonia among the
elderly,'' Goldstein told the committee.
   He said influenza affects millions of elderly Americans
annually, costs hundreds of millions of dollars in medical care and
causes about 25,000 deaths among people over age 65.

   The government said Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega has made no deal with Washington about stepping
down and there will be none ``if U.S. aggression and violation of
Panamanian sovereignty continue.''
   The official news agency Panapress reported on Wednesday night
that President Reagan had ``entered in direct contact with Gen.
Noriega.''
   The report came shortly after an administration source in
Washington said the United States would drop drug charges against
Noriega if he agrees to step down as Defense Forces chief and leave
the country, at least temporarily.
   Boris Moreno, director of the government's National Information
System, or SNI, told The Associated Press he did not know if Reagan
had telephoned Noriega in an effort to find a way out of the crisis
between the two nations.
   Moreno also said he did not know if the offer to drop the
charges had been formally presented to the general.
   ``There has been no agreement about anything,'' said a statement
he read to the AP over the telephone. ``Upon being informed of the
existence of such reports, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told SNI
categorically, `The sovereignty of Panama is not negotiable.'
   ``Such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking
the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation. These
reports form part of the confusion and confrontation provoked by
certain elements of the Washington establishment.''
   Panapress said on Wednesday night: ``Gen. Noriega has said there
can be no deal if the U.S. aggression and the violation of
Panamanian sovereignty continue.''
   The source in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that under the proposed deal Noriega would step down, probably
in August, and would stay out of Panama until after its next
presidential elections.
   The Reagan administration began imposing economic sanctions on
Panama 2{ months ago. Washington hoped the measures would force
Noriega into exile, but he has resisted and appears entrenched.
   The general, as chief of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces, is
the country's de facto ruler. Last summer, he was accused by his
former second-in-command of involvement in political assassination
and electoral fraud.
   On Feb. 5, Noriega was indicted on federal drug-smuggling and
money-laundering charges in Florida. He denies the charges,
contending they are part of an attempt to replace him with a leader
amenable to a strong U.S. presence in Panama into the next century.
   The 1977 Panama Canal Treaty obliges Washington to cede control
of the waterway and U.S. military bases along it by the year 2000.
   Panapress said Reagan ``sent a special mission to Panama to
dialogue with the leader of the Panamanian Defense Forces.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone responded, ``no
comment,'' when asked if State Department envoy Michael Kozak, who
the Reagan administration has sent to Panama in recent weeks to
talk with Noriega, met in Panama on Wednesday with the general or
his representatives.

   Meeting with their leaders, more
than 4,000 Nicaraguan rebels sought to resolve a simmering dispute
over whether to continue peace talks with the leftist Sandinista
government.
   Also Wednesday, Nicaragua's vice president said at the United
Nations that the rift among the rebels threatened the peace
negotiations.
   Rebel sources said the U.S.-backed fighters, also known as
Contras, met with their civilian and military leaders at the jungle
town of Yamales, 185 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa and six miles
from the Nicaraguan border.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
dissident rebels accuse Contra military commander Enrique Bermudez
of corruption and inefficiency and want him replaced. Unlike the
civilian Contra leaders, Bermudez reportedly opposes forging a
lasting peace with the Sandinistas.
   Bermudez said in a telephone interview there was only
``minimal'' opposition to his command from ``a group of parasites''
within rebel ranks, whom he did not identify.
   Bermudez, 46, was Nicaragua's representative to the
Inter-American Defense Board in Washington, D.C., under President
Anastasio Somoza, the rightist dictator overthrown by the
Sandinistas in 1979.
   He is said to command a total of 8,000 rebels.
   Three civilian leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance _ Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, Azucena Ferrey and Bosco Matamoros _ were at the
jungle meeting, the sources said.
   Also present were eight dissident Contra military leaders who on
Sunday publicly accused Bermudez of opposing negotiations for a
more permanent truce with the Sandinistas, the sources said.
   Nicaragua's vice president, Sergio Ramirez Mercado, said on
Wednesday at the United Nations in New York that his government was
not sure if rebel fighters would honor any agreement reached by
their political leaders.
   Ramirez said the ``open rebellion'' against Bermudez
``represents a serious limitation'' to the talks.
   ``We don't know now if what the political leadership of the
Contras is going to discuss with us in the next round of
negotiations is going to be accepted by this military leadership
under the command of Col. Bermudez,'' Ramirez said. He spoke at a
news conference before the opening of a special U.N. session on
economic aid to Central America.
   Bermudez hinted he might use force to bring the dissidents back
into line but expressed hope that he and Adolfo Calero, the top
Contra civilian leader, will find a solution to the problem.
   ``I am sure that once the fighters understand the reality of the
situation, they will change their attitude,'' he said in the
telephone interview.
   On March 23, Sandinista and Contra leaders signed a preliminary
accord aimed at ending the 6{-year-old civil war. A 60-day truce
went into effect April 1, during which the two sides were supposed
to negotiate conditions for a lasting peace.
   Two rounds of high-level negotiations in Managua since have
failed to produce substantial progress. Foremost among issues
dividing the two sides is a Sandinista demand that the Contras lay
down their weapons.
   The date for the next round of talks has not been set.

   For Harriet Hope, years of congressional
wrangling over whether to compensate natives of the Aleutian
Islands who were forced into camps during World War II have taken
their toll.
   ``It's just too little, too late,'' she said. ``The old ones who
deserve it the most are gone.''
   Hope and her family were among 110 Aleuts from Unalaska Island
villages ordered from their homes in July 1942 after the Japanese
bombed and strafed the island's Dutch Harbor. They were herded
aboard a steamship that took them to a camp in southeast Alaska,
purportedly to protect them from harm.
   They were not alone. An estimated 880 Aleuts were evacuated from
the Aleutians. Many houses later were ransacked or destroyed by
soldiers and sailors. Photographs, diaries, icons and other
possessions left behind were damaged or stolen, residents say.
   About 10 percent of the Aleuts died in the camps. Some never
went home. It has been estimated that half the camps' survivors
have since died.
   The Japanese seized three of the western Aleutians _ Attu,
Agattu and Kiska _ and occupied them between 1942 and 1943.
   In Washington, conference committee staff members were scheduled
to meet today to work out differences in House and Senate versions
of a measure authorizing reparations to Japanese-Americans and
Aleuts forced from their homes in the opening months of the war.
   The Senate bill, considered likely to be adopted, would pay the
Aleut camp survivors $12,000 each, set up a $5 million trust fund
for the six villages where people were forced from their homes,
authorize $1.4 million to restore and rehabilitate churches damaged
or destroyed in the war and pay the Aleuts between $12 million and
$15 million for the loss of Attu Island, which has remained under
military control.
   Japanese-Americans forced into camps would receive $20,000 each,
and virtually nothing else.
   John C. Kirtland, a Washington lawyer hired in 1978 to represent
the Aleuts before Congress, thinks the legislation, re-introduced
each year since 1983, will make it to the president this year.
   Hope was 5 years old when the Japanese planes arrived. Her
father was English, her mother, Aleut. Her father, the village
postmaster, was allowed to remain behind because of his nationality.
   ``We had 48 hours to get ready. We were told to take nothing but
a very, very few belongings,'' she recalled.
   Hope, her mother, two brothers and a sister joined other Aleuts
from the island's three villages for the voyage. Eventually they
were deposited at a burned-out cannery at Burnett Inlet on the
Alaska Panhandle.
   ``It was nothing but a ghost gown. There was no plumbing, no
heat, just an abandoned old cannery. There was no running water.
You could see through the ceiling.''
   Medical facilities were virtually non-existent. Tuberculosis was
a threat. Village hunters and fishermen used to the treeless
mountains of Unalaska were thrown into a strange environment.
   ``It was like trying to live a subsistence lifestyle in a
foreign country,'' Hope said.
   For the three years the family was held at the camp, Hope's
father was allowed only one 10-day visit, Hope said. Her mother
worked at canneries to earn money, and provided medical care to
camp residents. Her brother left to work on a fishing boat.
   ``I just don't understand why they did what they did,'' Hope
said.
   The Aleut Corp., a regional native corporation, and the
Aleutian-Pribilof Islands Association led the drive for Aleut
reparations.
   Kirtland's firm searched archives and put together reams of
evidence about camp conditions and the wrongs committed during and
after the evacuation.
   At about the same time, a nine-member federal Commission On
Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians was appointed by the
president and congressional leaders. ``Nine volumes of documentary
evidence were given to commission,'' Kirtland said.
   The panel held hearings around Alaska, and recommended
compensation for the Aleuts in June 1983.
   Just as the compensation is pending, the scars of war remain on
Unalaska.
   Trench lines cut the mountains. Bunkers, pillboxes and
machine-gun nests dot the landscape. The past is never far away.
   Hope works as a receptionist at Unalaska City Hall, near the
house where she was born.
   ``I don't feel like I deserve anything; it's my mother and
father _ they went through the anguish. They're the ones who really
deserve it.''
   Her father died in 1956; her mother, 10 years later.

<HEAD>Study Says Beef Fat Not As Bad As Experts Once Believed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beef, which for years has been cast as the villain
in the fight against heart disease, may not be so bad after all,
say researchers who found that a major form of saturated fat lowers
cholesterol.
   While too much fatty beef such as hamburger and prime rib will
clearly raise cholesterol levels, most people can eat moderate
helpings of lean meat without fear, the researchers said.
   The researchers cautioned that only men were enrolled in the
study, so the findings might not apply to women.
   But other experts said the study of 11 men is too small and
preliminary to reach a conclusion. All 11 were healthy volunteers,
ranging from their late 50s to early 70s.
   Beef got a bad name because it is high in saturated fat. Until
now, it was assumed that all saturated fats endangered the heart by
increasing cholesterol, which clogs arteries.
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
suggests that the situation may be more complicated. Beef contains
two major forms of saturated fat, and the researchers found that
one raises cholesterol while the other lowers it.
   This means that meat is probably not as bad as health experts
have long believed, said Dr. Scott Grundy, the study's senior
author and a researcher at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas.
   Grundy, who also is a past chairman of the American Heart
Association's Nutrition Committee, said people should still follow
the widely adopted dietary guidelines for avoiding all kinds of
fat, including saturated fat. But he believes beef can be a regular
part of a sensible diet, as long people eat small portions of about
3 ounces and stick to lean cuts, especially select-grade meat.
   ``You don't really have to cut meat out of the diet in order to
keep a low cholesterol (level),'' he said in an interview
Wednesday. ``That's an important message, because beef is rich in
protein and iron.''
   Fats from plants and animals differ in their proportions of
various fatty acids. Safflower oil, for instance, is high in oleic
acid, which lowers the body's cholesterol levels, while palm oil
contains high levels of palmitic acid, which raises cholesterol.
   Beef fat is high in both palmitic acid and stearic acid. Both
are saturated fatty acids. Unlike polyunsaturated fats such as corn
oil, they are solid when cool.
   In the study, the volunteers drank three liquid formula diets
for three weeks each. They were high in palmitic acid, stearic acid
or oleic acid.
   The researchers found that the volunteers' blood cholesterol
levels dropped 14 percent while they consumed stearic acid and 10
percent while on oleic acid, compared to when they used the
high-palmitic acid diet.
   Today's report was accompanied by an editorial by Drs. Irwin H.
Rosenberg and Ernst J. Schaefer of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts
University in Boston.
   They wrote that the study ``demonstrates convincingly'' that
stearic acid lowers cholesterol. However, they added, people should
still try to hold down fat consumption, and ``this study should not
change our chief dietary message to the American public.''
   Dr. John C. LaRosa of George Washington University, chairman of
the heart association's Nutrition Committee, agreed. ``It's a nice
little piece of work,'' La Rosa said, ``but it's not the basis for
dietary recommendations.''
   Guidelines adopted by the association and other groups urge
people to limit total fat intake to about 30 percent of total
calories. Saturated fat should be less than 10 percent of the day's
calories.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Steel Industry Will Benefit from Canada Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has
told several steel-state senators the American steel industry will
be a clear winner under the proposed U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the U.S. steel industry will
be a net beneficiary of this agreement _ no doubt,'' Yeutter said
Wednesday during a joint meeting of the Senate Steel Caucus and the
Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.
   Yeutter said American steelmakers will benefit from the gradual
elimination of the two nations' tariffs because Canadian tariffs on
imported steel are about double the U.S. average.
   And he said they will also gain from the increased economic
activity the free trade agreement, or FTA, is expected to stimulate
between the two countries.
   ``To the degree that we have an expansion of economic activity
and demand, the steel industry wins generally in both countries,''
Yeutter said. ``In the absence of an FTA, that isn't going to
happen.''

<HEAD>Film Industry Wants More Controls on Cable TV `Monopoly'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Motion Picture
Association of America says cable television ``is no longer a babe
in swaddling clothes'' and Congress should rein in the industry's
power to control the entertainment marketplace.
   ``Consumers are held hostage to their cable system,'' MPAA
President Jack Valenti told a House subcommittee on Wednesday.
``They have no alternative. They can either commit suicide or go
bowling.''
   Valenti's testimony was part of a lively day of exchanges before
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications,
which is looking into the effects of cable deregulation.
   Valenti, who represents the major Hollywood studios and
independent producers, sparred with Ted Turner, president of Turner
Broadcasting System, and John Malone, president of
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company.
   ``Before cable, we had the three big networks and they dominated
what people saw. Now there are the three networks and more than 50
cable channels,'' said Malone.

<HEAD>Senate Panel OKs Nurse's Statue at Viet Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee wants a second statue added
to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and a supporter insists, ``This
will be the last one.''
   The Senate Energy and Resources Committee on Wednesday passed,
over one senator's objection, a bill that would place a statue of
an Army nurse at the memorial
   The lone dissenter, Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., protested what
he called a threat to the artistic integrity of the memorial. A
statue of three soldiers was added in 1984 by veterans groups who
objected to the starkness of the granite wall, unveiled in 1982,
that lists the names of American war dead.
   The bill, which has 63 cosponsors, contained an amendment that
strengthens a declaration that Congress would not allow any other
statues to be placed at the memorial if the bronze sculpture of an
Army women's sculpture is approved.
   ``This will be the last one,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., the committee chairman. ``But the last for how long?''
retorted Evans, who stressed that his opposition had nothing to do
with his respect for American women.

   Johnny Carson returned with a vengeance
to his late-night show, poking fun at revelations of White House
astrology in a monologue he wrote himself to end reruns forced by a
2-month-old writers' strike.
   ``I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are
going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' Carson
said Wednesday in his first new show since the strike began March 7.
   ``You know, we finally have a clue now as to what the hell (are)
the Looney Tunes things that have been coming out of Washington,''
he told viewers of ``The Tonight Show.''
   Carson referred to revelations by former White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan that Nancy Reagan regularly consulted an
astrologer to determine President Reagan's schedule.
   ``We apparently have a new cabinet officer in the government I
was not aware of _ the Secretary of Health, Education and
Soothsaying.
   ``I am not an expert on astrology, I know a little bit about it,
but I understand the horoscope with the chart as they call it, is
divided into the so-called 12 houses, and I just didn't know the
White House was one of them,'' Carson quipped.
   ``Apparently the astrologist says that Reagan's sign is the
rising house of Aquarius. Nancy's house is, I think, in the house
of Adolfo. I could be wrong, it could be Bill Blass, but I think
that's close,'' he joked, referring to the fashion designers.
   Carson also quoted an astrologist as saying that ``Reagan
performs at his best during a full moon.''
   ``Big deal,'' Carson said. ``So does the Wolfman.''
   Carson pointed out that Reagan said he never made a policy
decision based on astrology, then _ dropping into an imitation of
Reagan's voice _ Carson said, ``Well, because that little pointer
on my Ouija board moved to `No.'''
   The host of the NBC-TV show also found time to poke fun at his
marriage and California earthquake predictions involving 16th
century seer Nostradamus.
   ``Things were getting a little testy around the homestead,'' he
said. ``I really believe that one more week off and my marriage
would be resolved by small arms fire.''
   Carson mentioned the stir in Los Angeles because of persistent
rumors that Nostradamus forecast an earthquake for a city widely
believed to be Los Angeles.
   ``He was a flim-flam man of the 16th century,'' Carson said.
``If Nostradamus were alive today he would be Geraldo Rivera.''
Rivera entertained millions of television viewers with stunts such
as the opening of Al Capone's vault.
   Carson announced last week he would return to the air, writing
his own monologues.
   Carson, who is not a member of the striking Writers Guild of
America, said at that time there had been good-faith negotiations
and that all possibilities of reaching an agreement with the movie
and TV industry were exhausted.
   ``We're glad to be back. As far as the writers' strike, we're
not going to discuss it,'' he said. ``I have a lot of friends who
are writers. It is not fun to come to work when you see your
friends who you've known for many years standing out on a picket
line.
   ``And it's a weird picket line. The writers are out there
holding up these signs and there's nothing on them,'' he quipped.

<HEAD>Irving Berlin's Birthday Celebrated by the Celebrated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   America blessed Irving Berlin on his 100th
birthday, as such diverse celebrities as Leonard Bernstein, Walter
Cronkite and Garrison Keillor sang the legacies of the composer who
``set the world tapping.''
   The prolific songwriter, a longtime recluse, didn't attend the
three-hour celebration Wednesday night before a packed house at
Carnegie Hall, although he was believed to be listening via a
hookup from his New York mansion.
   The pageantry started big and ended bigger, with the Army Chorus
and soldiers from Fort Dix, N.J., filling the stage in front of a
30-piece orchestra, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts standing in the
aisles and Marilyn Horne's mezzo-soprano voice soaring above them
in Berlin's ``God Bless America.''
   Then, most of the evening's performers stood in front of the
audience of 4,000, joined hands and arms, and everybody sang a
lusty ``There's No Business Like Show Business,'' another Berlin
classic.
   ``When Irving Berlin began writing 83 years ago, American
popular music had no voice of its own,'' said the violinist Isaac
Stern. ``We were a hodge-podge of nationalities and noises. But he
heard nothing but melodies.
   ``American music was born at his piano. By 30, he was a legend.
Out of the fabric of our lives, Irving Berlin has given us a place
we call home. It was this love (of America) that gave him the
strength to write the music that now lasts forever,'' Stern said.
   Composer Morton Gould, president of the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, recounted the origin of the
birthday tribute, which is to be televised May 27 on CBS.
   ``A year ago, I received a call from Irving Berlin. During the
conversation, I said, `Next year is your 100th birthday. May ASCAP
present a tribute?' Without skipping a beat, he said, `What's the
hurry?' So we waited.'' Six months later, Gould said, Berlin
approved the celebration and suggested ticket sales benefit the
ASCAP Foundation and Carnegie Hall Society. Gould said that Berlin
has written 1,500 songs, 19 Broadway musicals and 18 Hollywood
musicals, beginning with the first talking picture, ``The Jazz
Singer.''
   The event was a finale to a full day of tributes that began with
a midnight serenade outside Berlin's Manhattan house. At midday, 14
cast members of the Broadway show ``A Chorus Line,'' offered an
enthusiastic songfest at the Central Park Arsenal.
   Their spirited medley ranged from love songs such as ``They Say
That Falling in Love is Wonderful,'' to the torch song ``What'll I
Do,'' to the humorous ``You Can't Get a Man With a Gun.''
   On Staten Island, 15 handicapped Boy Scouts sang ``Happy
Birthday'' and ``God Bless America'' during the dedication of a new
log cabin named for Berlin. He had donated the residuals from the
patriotic tune to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
   Meanwhile, patients in 100 Veterans Administration hospitals and
nursing homes around the nation geared up to sing ``God Bless
America'' simultaneously.
   Berlin was part of a pantheon of great musical comedy composers
that included George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Richard
Rodgers. Of his theater contemporaries, only director George
Abbott, who turns 101 in June, survives.
   ``No one could take your mind off your troubles like Irving
Berlin. His music set the world tapping. You just had to let
yourself go,'' said Joe Williams, who then sang ``Let Yourself Go.''
   Among the other celebrities who joined in the speeches and songs
were Bernstein, Cronkite, Keillor, Shirley MacLaine, Ray Charles,
Frank Sinatra and Rosemary Clooney.
   Born Israel Baline in Russia, Berlin came to the United States
at age 2. His family settled on New York's Lower East Side where,
as a young boy, Berlin got jobs singing on the Bowery. He worked as
song plugger and a singing waiter at a Chinatown cafe. It was there
he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking out tunes with
one finger. The self-taught musician writes the same way.
   Berlin spent the day ``quietly at home'' and did not plan to be
at Carnegie Hall, said his secretary, Hilda Schneider.
   ``He's never made a big thing about his birthdays,'' she said.
``Let's face it, he's not 22 years old.''

   The Republican National Committee has issued a
booklet on the Democratic presidential candidates that calls
Michael Dukakis ``the biggest spending governor in America'' and
says Jesse Jackson ``has a tendency to confuse public policy with
publicity.''
   The 20-page campaign salvo also attacks House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, alongside its criticism of the front-runner
Dukakis and Jackson.
   A section titled, ``The Dukakis Threat,'' accused the
Massachusetts governor of ``hypocrisy on the balanced budget,''
citing critical media comments about his role in his state's
booming economy.
   Jackson, meanwhile, is taken to task for a trip to Cuba and
another to the Middle East in 1979 to meet with Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   The section on Wright quoted media accounts of the House
speaker's actions on behalf of a troubled Texas bank, his dealings
with Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega, and Republican accusations of
abuse of power in House debates.

<HEAD>Study: Poor, Minorities Disenfranchised By Voting Barriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A private study says discriminatory voter
registration procedures are disenfranchising the poor, minority and
disabled citizens throughout the country.
   Among the practices are arbitrary registration hours,
inconvenient registration locations, ``mysterious purging of voters
without notice, denial of registration before an election,'' said a
statement from Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is the author of
legislation to correct such practices.
   The Citizens Commission on Civil Rights in hearings in New York,
Atlanta and Phoenix in 1984 and 1985 ``documented numerous examples
of discriminatory practices,'' the group said on Wednesday.
   Among the specific problems are refusal by local officials to
designate sites in black communities for mobile registration units;
requirement of excessive identification from black applicants;
``undue scrutiny'' of Hispanics and Asian-Americans to determine
their citizenship; sites ``that require extraordinarily long
trips'' and dual registration requirements for tribal and state
elections for Native Americans.
   The commission recommended legislation to permit registration by
mail, election-day registration, and a congressional investigation
into denial of the right to vote for homeless people.

   In a letter to Republican Party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf

<HEAD>Singapore Protests U.S. `Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singapore's second deputy prime minister said
American political leaders often do not know what their ``sneaky,
arrogant, confused and untrustworthy'' bureaucracy is doing.
   ``We are not anti-American,'' Ong Teng Cheong also told 2,000
trade union members at a rally protesting alleged U.S. interference
in local affairs.
   ``But we do not welcome any anti-Singapore foreign elements to
meddle in our domestic politics. Singapore politics is for
Singaporeans only. Similarly, American politics is for Americans
only,'' said Ong, third in the political line to Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew.
   E. Mason ``Hank'' Hendrickson, first secretary of the U.S.
Embassy's political section, left Singapore on Tuesday at the
government's request. He was accused of seeking out disaffected
Singaporeans and encouraging them by criticizing the government in
their presence.
   The government also asked that Hendrickson be reprimanded along
with two senior State Department officials, identified only as Mr.
X and Mr. Y, who it said sanctioned his activities.
   The Reagan administration retaliated by asking Singapore on
Tuesday to withdraw Robert Chua Hian Kong, first secretary of the
Singaporean Embassy's political section in Washington.
   In a statement Wednesday, Singapore said it agreed to Chua's
withdrawal with ``deep regret. The Singapore government wants to
get this issue over with ... for it shares with the U.S. government
the desire to put this unfortunate matter behind us.''
   Ong, also secretary-general of the National Trades Union
Congress, called the gathering at congress headquarters a union
rally, not a political demonstration. However, busloads of union
members chanted anti-American slogans as they were driven past the
U.S. Embassy after the rally. They carried signs saying ``USA Stop
Meddling'' and ``Singapore Politics For Singapore.''
   ``The Hendrickson affair confirms our assessment of U.S.
bureaucracy _ sneaky, arrogant, confused and untrustworthy,'' Ong
said.
   ``The political leaders in the U.S. often do not know what the
bureaucracy is doing. Sometimes one arm of the bureaucracy does not
know what the other arm is doing. They think they are always right.
They do not admit mistakes. They seldom apologize. They prefer
denials and sometimes resort to lies.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gong said he had not read Ong's
speech and declined comment. Gong denied the Singaporean
government's allegations against Hendrickson, saying:
   ``Mr. Hendrickson was doing what American diplomats are expected
to do in any country, namely to keep in touch with a broad spectrum
of individuals in order to report accurately developments in the
country in question.''
   A Home Affairs Ministry statement on May 7 said Hendrickson
urged Patrick Seong ``and other lawyers to contest the elections
against the government, and had involved himself in Singapore's
domestic politics.''
   The governing People's Action Party is heavily favored to retain
control of this island republic of 2.6 million people in elections
that must be held by December 1989. The party holds all but one of
79 seats in Parliament and there is no viable opposition capable of
dislodging it.
   Hendrickson ``was trying to manipulate and instigate
Singaporeans, in order to bring about a particular political
outcome,'' the government alleged.
   His ouster was a surprising jolt to normally warm U.S.-Singapore
relations. The diplomatic row is the latest in a complex chain of
events that began with the May-June 1987 arrests of 22 Singaporeans
accused of belonging to a ``clandestine communist network.'' They
were seized under the Internal Security Act which allows indefinate
detention without trial.
   All but one were freed by last Dec. 26, most of them with
restrictions on their movements.
   Seong was arrested April 19 with eight of the 22 former
detainees. That was less than 24 hours after the eight proclaimed
their innocence and said they had been abused and coerced into
making incriminating statements.
   On April 28, the Home Affairs Ministry said the eight had sworn
new declarations withdrawing their allegations and reconfirming
their original guilt. They are still behind bars and officials said
a probe continues.
   Besides Seong, 34, Hendrickson was linked by the government to
lawyer Francis Seow, 59. Seow was arrested on Friday, just hours
after he appeared in court seeking the release of two of the eight
who were rearrested.
   Seow, one of Singapore's more prominent attorneys, is a former
solicitor-general and ex-president of the Law Society. He is being
held without charge under the Internal Security Act ``for purposes
of investigation into foreign interferences in Singapore's internal
affairs.''

   A 22-ton propeller shaft fell on a group of
shipyard workers as they worked on a Navy destroyer, injuring nine,
including two seriously, officials said.
   Six workers were killed in an accident at the yard last July.
   Wednesday night's accident occurred as workers were installing
the intermediate propeller shaft into the USS Elliot, said Fred
Hallett, vice president of finance at the National Steel &
Shipbuilding Co.
   ``They were in the process of aligning the shaft when the
forward part fell approximately 20 to 25 feet to the deck of the
drydock,'' Hallett said.
   When the shaft fell, it dislodged scaffolding that had been
erected below, Hallett said.
   One worker told Hallett the crew was preparing to drive in the
bolts when the propeller shaft released and fell, Hallett said.
   The most seriously hurt employee received injuries to his head
and arm, Hallett said. The man, who was not identified, was listed
in critical condition at University of California-San Diego Medical
Center.
   One was listed in serious condition, three others in fair
condition, two were released after treatment and two were not
expected to be hospitalized, officials said.
   In the accident July 10, six people were killed and six injured
when a steel basket lifting workers fell 30 feet to the deck of a
Navy ship.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited
the company for 19 safety violations in that accident.
   In March, OSHA accused the company of 100 other violations,
which carried $72,300 in penalties. The company is appealing the
penalties.
   Hallett said 80 percent of the OSHA recommendations were
completed and the rest were in progress.
   The shipyard employs 2,500 workers, Hallett said. Between 150
and 200 were on duty at the time of Wednesday's accident.

<HEAD>Police: Gunmen Tried to Kidnap Cartoonist's Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two masked gunmen who invaded the home
of cartoonist Charles Schulz tried to kidnap his wife, officials
said.
   ``It was obviously an attempted kidnap _ ransom,'' Sonoma County
Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said Wednesday.
   ``This was a targeted criminal act. They knew exactly who the
victims were.''
   The incident took place on Sunday but did not become public
until Tuesday when neighbors of the cartoonist spoke to reporters
from the Santa Rosa Press Democrat and recounted that two armed men
had invaded the home.
   However, it was not until the sheriff's department issued a
statement Wednesday that it became clear that a kidnap attempt had
been made.
   ``There is a delicate balance between the rights of victims and
the need to know,'' the sheriff said in explaining why he did not
release the information earlier. ``Victims should always come
first.''
   Schulz, creator of the ``Peanuts'' comic strip, declined to
comment.
   The men were armed with revolvers when they entered the home but
were scared off when the cartoonist's daughter, Jill, pulled her
car into the driveway minutes later.
   Neither Schulz, 65, nor his wife, Jean, was hurt.
   The men told the Schulzes at gunpoint that they were going to
take the wife, according to the news release.
   ``They got in there and got started with the episode and were
interrupted I think before they could do everything they set up to
do,'' Detective Sgt. Mike Brown said.
   Michaelsen said the decision to keep the incident quiet was made
to protect the Schulz family.
   Press Democrat Editor Mike Parman said the sheriff's department
``apparently has a policy of releasing information at their
discretion.''
   ``The public has a right to know that there are two armed,
dangerous men at large in this community,'' he said.

state of New Jersey.
   The actress who won the supporting actress Oscar this year for

<HEAD>Van Gogh Painting Sells For $13.75 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vincent van Gogh painting sold for $13.75
million, the fourth highest price paid at an auction, but the sale
disappointed a standing-room-only crowd after a string of record
prices for the artist's paintings.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' which van Gogh finished shortly
before his suicide, sold at Christie's auction house Wednesday
night to an anonymous buyer who bid by telephone.
   Christie's had estimated van Gogh's 1890 portrait of his
innkeeper's 13-year-old daughter would bring $15 million, and the
reaction of the audience was subdued in contrast to the applause
that usually greets a record price.
   However, auctioneer Christopher Burge insisted afterward that
Christie's was not disappointed. ``It's a wonderful price for a
beautiful picture,'' he said.
   Daniel Varenne, an art dealer from Geneva, Switzerland, said he
was ``a little surprised'' that the painting fetched only $13.75
million. But he added the portrait was ``not an easy one to live
with'' and that may have affected the price.
   ``It's of a girl who's attractive but not that attractive. And
there's the possibility that the blue background is not that
appealing to a lot of people,'' he said.
   In the painting, Adeline, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a
chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is
serene, her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in
front of her. The background is a deep, midnight blue.
   The painting is the latest in a string of paintings by van Gogh,
who had trouble selling his art during his lifetime, to fetch a
record price.
   ``Irises'' last year brought $53.9 million, the highest price
ever paid at auction for a painting. The second and third highest
prices bid at an auction were also for van Gogh paintings.
   The portrait was one of 70 lots offered for sale at an auction
of impressionist and modern art that fetched $63,173,000. Eleven
works of art did not find buyers despite a packed house.
   The second highest bid Wednesday was $6.6 million paid by an
anonymous private collector for Pierre Renoir's ``L'Ombrelle,'' a
painting of a woman in a garden holding a parasol and bouquet of
violets.
   Mary Cassatt's, ``The Conversation,'' a pastel on paper of two
women talking to each other, sold for $4.51 million, a record for
the artist. Burge called it ``a beautiful picture'' and ``an
extreme leap forward by the artist.'' It was bought by an anonymous
private collector.
   The fourth highest bid was $4.4 million paid by an anonymous
private collector for Maurice de Vlaminck's ``Le Pont de Chatou,''
an oil on canvas in brilliant colors of a bridge across the Seine
River in France.
   Alberto Giacometti's 1940s sculpture of three skinny, walking
men, ``Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $3.85 million to an
anonymous buyer, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century
sculpture.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' was one of three van Gogh did of
his innkeeper's daughter. The most lifelike and detailed of the
trio is in a private collection in Switzerland. The other, which
shows only the girl's face, is owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art.
   The picture was made a month before van Gogh committed suicide
at age 37 in 1890 in the village of Auvers outside Paris. In a 1956
essay, Adeline Ravoux Carrie wrote that she didn't immediately
appreciate her portrait.
   ``It was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was
true to life,'' wrote Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of
88.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''

<HEAD>Milk Antibodies Effective Against Traveler's Diarrhea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they are encouraged by
experimental use of a derivative of cow's milk to prevent
traveler's diarrhea and hope to test their discovery on people
going to developing countries.
   In a report today, they said that powdered concentrations of
milk antibodies appeared to protect people from the effects of E.
coli bacteria, a common cause of diarrhea.
   ``These preliminary results are highly encouraging,'' they wrote
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The researchers, led by Dr. Carol O. Tacket of the University of
Maryland School of Medicine, found that the treatment may provide
an alternative to prescription antibiotics and over-the-counter
bismuth subsalicylate, which can keep people from getting diarrhea.
   The researchers said that about half of all travelers to
developing countries get diarrhea.
   ``We want to do a field study to see if it works among
travelers,'' said Tacket. ``Our study was a very artificial
situation.''
   To make the concentrate, cows were first vaccinated with
varieties of E. coli that cause diarrhea. The cows then produced
antibodies in their milk that protected them from these microbes.
The researchers removed these antibodies and prepared them in
powder form.
   Ten volunteers drank the powdered E. coli antibodies dissolved
in water three times a day for three days. Ten others got other
forms of antibodies.
   Then all were given diarrhea-causing E. coli. None of the 10 who
got the E. coli antibodies developed diarrhea. However, nine of the
10 in the comparison group got the illness.

<HEAD>Skylab Astronaut Says Russians Have Passed America In Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOYT HARWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist in the Skylab program of the
early 1970s says the ``plodding'' Soviets have since surpassed the
Americans in manned space missions.
   ``All our accomplishments of 15 years ago should be buried in
the dust by now. Unfortunately, there is some dust on them, but it
is not American dust,'' ex-astronaut Edward Gibson said Wednesday
at a reunion with eight other former Skylab crew members.
   ``The Russians are the people who have continuously manned space
stations up there. They are the turtles of the space race. They
kept plodding along.''
   The three Skylab flights, from May 1973 to February 1974, took
almost 183,000 pictures of the sun and more than 40,000 of the
earth.
   ``We learned a lot about solar physics, how the sun works,''
said Gibson, now a space consultant at Reston, Va. ``It is the
largest contribution ever made in that area.
   ``In earth observations, it led into what we currently are doing
_ better monitoring and understanding of our environment and how to
control part of it to some degree.
   ``Also, we learned a lot of the physiological aspects of man
going into space _ important information for future flights and
also for spinoffs for medicine on earth.''
   The United States could regain the lead in space technology,
Gibson said, if the government and nation understand what is
needed, establish long-range goals and make financial commitments
to match them.
   ``We need to find the best way to draw in all the good talent
that exists in our country and a way to retain them in the work
force for many years,'' he said. ``We need to streamline the
organization _ the whole military and NASA infrastructure _ in the
way in which we manage the combined effort, as well as in the
individual agencies themselves and the programs.
   ``There is enthusiasm, capability and knowledge ready to put us
out ahead again, not only for competitive reasons but for practical
benefits and human reasons.''
   At one of the reunion sessions, Jim Odom, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's associate administrator for
its proposed space station, noted that America has been without a
permanent manned orbiting facility for almost 10 years.
   Important research could have been accomplished during that
time, Odom said.
   ``Unlike Skylab, the space station will lend itself to ongoing
modifications,'' he said. ``We will be able to tailor it to meet
the changing requirements of experimenters over its projected
30-year lifespan.''
   Odom said that some parts of the Apollo program ``were scrapped
in the wake of the Apollo 1 fire,'' in which three astronauts died
on the launch pad.
   He added, ``It would be tragic if this should happen again as a
result of the Challenger accident,'' which killed seven astronauts
in 1986.

   The U.S. dollar gained ground on all other major
currencies in light European trading early today. Gold bullion
prices drifted lower.
   The closure of most European markets for the Ascension Day
holiday brought activity to a near standstill, traders said.
British and Italian markets were the only major centers operating
today.
   The dollar's higher rate reflected gains in New York late
Wednesday after major U.S. banks raised their prime lending rate
from 8.5 percent to 9 percent.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6839 West German marks, up from 1.6773
   _1.4015 Swiss francs, up from 1.3935
   _5.7100 French francs, up from 5.6912
   _1.8870 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8830
   _1,251.80 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50
   _1.2320 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2315
   The British pound fell to $1.8778 from $1.8870.
   The dollar firmed to 124.39 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up from
Wednesday's close of 124.24 yen. In later London trading today, the
dollar was quoted at 124.70 yen.
   London's main bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $448.65 a troy ounce, down from $449.30 late
Wednesday.
   Zurich markets were closed for Ascension Day.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $450.06, down
from $451.68.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.52 a troy ounce,
down from $6.55.

<HEAD>Report: Suspects May Have Been Involved In Past ANC Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four whites charged with
possession of an impressive arms cache may have been involved in
previous attacks carried out by the African National Congress, a
newspaper reported today.
   Police announced on Wednesday they had made their biggest arms
seizure ever in connection with the arrests of three men and one
woman who allegedly were acting on behalf of the ANC's military
wing.
   The four suspects also had a ``hit-list'' of top police
officials, according to police.
   Arms seized included a Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air missile,
limpet mines, hand grenades, assault rifles, pistols, machine guns,
mortars and explosives, police said.
   They said the four had planned to use the missile to shoot down
a police helicopter at a recent fair.
   Police have not released the suspects' names, but have said the
three men are South African citizens and the woman is a foreigner.
The four are college educated and in their 20s and 30s, police
said, adding that two are military draft dodgers and one is a
former journalist.
   The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said without citing sources
that at least one of the four was believed involved in ANC attacks
carried out in the early 1980s.
   The mostly black ANC was outlawed in South Africa in 1960 and
began a sabotage-and-bombing campaign the following year aimed at
toppling white-minority rule.
   Tom Lodge, a leading authority on the ANC and a lecturer at the
University of the Witwatersrand, said the arrests illustrate ``the
continuing trend of young, well-educated liberal and left-wing
whites (to) identify themselves with the ANC.''
   Lodge said white participation in the ANC's military wing
``obviously has a greater impact on the attitudes of white South
Africa than the involvement of blacks.''
   Few whites have been involved in the ANC's military operations,
although there have been several highly publicized cases in recent
years.
   Following a March 17 car bombing that killed three people,
police said the leading suspect was Heinrich Grosskopf, a white
South African and an alleged ANC member who remains at large.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok described the four suspects
as ``a highly specialized terror unit.'' He alleged that the
suspects had been trained in Moscow, Cuba and Angola, and had radio
transmitters which they used to communicate with ANC headquarters
in Lusaka, Zambia.
   He said they were captured Sunday at a farmhouse near Pretoria,
where they had been staying since early this year.
   The South African Press Association, citing unidentified police
sources, said a disenchanted ANC member apparently gave authorities
the tip that led them to the four suspects.
   Vlok said police still were investigating how the weapons were
brought into South Africa, but he said the arms came overland
through Zambia and Botswana.
   Police have announced numerous arrests of alleged ANC members in
recent months and say they have substantially weakened the group's
ability to operate inside South Africa.
   There have been more than 70 bombings in South Africa since a
nationwide state of emergency was imposed in June 1986, but the
frequency has fallen sharply in recent months.

   Death row inmate James Smith, bitter
over a reprieve from his scheduled execution, acknowledged killing
a Houston insurance office manager and said those trying to save
him were ``bleeding-heart jerks.''
   Smith, whose lethal injection was halted about six hours before
it would have been carried out, blamed death penalty opponents for
persuading his mother in Indiana to pursue a request to the U.S.
Supreme Court for a reprieve.
   ``This woman doesn't know me,'' Smith said of his mother,
Alexzene Hamilton of Indianapolis. ``She may understand some child
who was under her care, but she doesn't understand this mature
adult male.''
   Smith said he did not want the stay because he does not want to
waste away on death row.
   ``This was a decision I had made. It was the last act of freedom
I could make,'' he said. ``It's frightening, to tell you the
truth.''
   Smith, 37, was sentenced to die for the 1983 robbery-slaying of
Larry Rohus, manager of a Houston insurance office. He previously
insisted he was innocent, but in an interview Wednesday detailed
that murder and what he said were at least six other slayings,
including the mutilation deaths of three people in South Carolina
and one of a baby in New York City.
   But authorities in both areas said there was no evidence such
killings had occurred.
   He also told of a murder in Miami in 1978 and a second besides
the baby in New York City in 1979. He said the baby was purchased
in Spanish Harlem for $300, used in voodoo rituals and left on a
highway leading to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge where it likely
would be run over.
   ``Look what you're trying to save!'' he said, describing death
penalty opponents who want to keep him alive as ``just a bunch of
bleeding-heart jerks.''
   ``I'm still going to be executed,'' he insisted. ``It may take a
little longer.''
   Smith said Rohus was shot to death because of snide remarks the
insurance office manager made while Smith was robbing the place.
   ``I killed him the same as I would a fly in my soup bowl,'' he
said. ``I shot him through the heart _ almost at point-blank range
_ to get money. And then I ran out.''
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Roberto Gutierrez, who
prosecuted Smith, has described the former New Orleans tarot-card
reader as the most evil and dangerous man he's ever prosecuted.
   ``That guy's got a little bit of insight,'' Smith responded,
when told of Gutierrez's comment.
   Smith said his involvement in voodoo began in high school. The
South Carolina ritual slayings occurred in Orangeburg County the
spring of 1981, he said.
   Records there show five murders in 1981, four shooting victims
and one in a fire. County Sheriff C.R. Smith Jr. said Wednesday he
could recall no such incidents like those described by Smith in
1981, in the few years before that or since.
   If Smith committed such crimes in Orangeburg County, the bodies
were never found there, the sheriff said.
   In New York City, police spokeman Sgt. Peter Sweeney said he was
unaware of any homicide involving a mutilated infant whose body was
left on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
   Mrs. Hamilton's appeal questioned her son's mental competence.
He said the competency issue was linked to a 1978 Miami armed
robbery charge, to which he pleaded innocent due to temporary
insanity.
   ``The insanity issue is brought forth by lawyers to get people
off,'' Smith said. ``That's what my lawyer recognized.''

<HEAD>Paper: Weapons Supplies Stepped Up To Guerrillas On Eve Of Soviet
Pullout</HEAD>

   The military charged today that foreign sponsors
have stepped up weapons shipments to Afghan guerrillas and sent in
more military advisors, endangering Soviet troops who are about to
march out of Afghanistan.
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star reported in a front-page
dispatch from its military correspondents at Soviet headquarters in
Kabul that there is great anxiety about the withdrawal that begins
Sunday.
   ``They are facing 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) of mountainous,
war-torn roads,'' the newspaper said of Soviet soldiers who will be
among the first to pull out of the Soviet Union's southern
neighbor. ``And we know very well that roads in Afghanistan are on
the forward edge of the undeclared war. It is necessary to be
prepared for the possibility of armed provocations.''
   The newspaper said rebel activity had been stepped up in Kabul,
Kandahar, Ghazni, Paktia and other provinces.
   ``Taking advantage of the pullback of Soviet and Afghan troops
from border areas of those regions in the depth of the country, the
opposition and its foreign patrons have sharply increased the
number of caravans with weapons, delivering them _ not only at
night now but also in the daytime,'' the paper claimed.
   ``In the military formations there has been a noticeable growth
in the number of foreign military advisers, who organize joint
actions by groups from different Moslem parties,'' the newspaper
said.
   The United States has been the insurgents' chief arms supplier.
   Red Star said the preparations for withdrawal were nearly
complete at the Kabul headquarters of the ``limited military
contingent,'' as the 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan are
referred to in the state-run press.
   The dispatch did not make clear, however, how many would leave
in the first march north or when headquarters would be evacuated.
   It said the first troops to leave would be motorized rifle
regiments, paratroopers, scouts and pilots, but gave no other
details.
   Afghanistan has been in the throes of civil war since April
1978, when a Soviet-inspired revolution brought a Marxist
government to power.
   Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to install Babrak
Karmal as the Afghan leader and to help troops loyal to him put
down a widespread insurrection. Karmal was replaced by Najib in May
1986 and has since taken refuge in the Soviet Union.

   A survey of former major leaguers concludes that
baseball is a healthy way of life, and the infield is the best
place to be.
   Doctors from the University of Alabama at Birmingham poured over
baseball encyclopedias and death certificates to learn when and how
players died.
   ``The main thing we found was the overall protective effect of
being an athlete,'' said Dr. John Waterbor. ``The death rate we
found was 94 percent of that expected.''
   The researchers said the findings support the idea that getting
plenty of exercise and being in good physical shape early in life
help keep folks healthy as they age.
   The report found that infielders had the lowest death rate,
while catchers had the highest. Pitchers and outfielders were in
between. Waterbor said the men's body builds may help explain these
differences.
   ``The infielders tend to be average-looking to thin people who
can move quickly, compared to catchers, who are built more like
bricks,'' Waterbor said in an interview.
   The study also found that those who had lengthy playing careers
or good records lived the longest, although these differences were
small.
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
was based on 985 men who played major-league ball between 1911 and
1915. Their longevity and causes of death were compared to the U.S.
white male population of the same age.
   Among other findings:
   _By far the most common cause of death was heart disease. The
researchers were surprised to find that the death rate from the
disease was 10 percent higher for ball players than for average
American men.
   _Baseball players were also somewhat more likely than other
people to die from cancer. But they were substantially less apt to
die from infections, lung disease, diabetes and accidents, among
other things.
   _Catchers were more likely than usual to die from pancreatic
cancer, pitchers from Hodgkin's disease and outfielders from
digestive ulcers.
   _The researchers successfully followed up on 958 players, of
whom 16 were still alive in 1984. The average age of death was just
under 71.

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs Slightly Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar climbed marginally today against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo, while stock prices also posted a slight gain
after falling sharply in early trading.
   The dollar ended at 124.39 yen, up 0.15 yen from its finish on
Wednesday. After opening the day at 124.35, the dollar moved
little, remaining between the 124.35 and 124.46 yen.
   ``The market was motionless throughout the day,'' said an
exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Trading was quiet lacking incentives to direct the market, he
said, adding the impact on Wednesday's half-percentage point
increase in the prime lending rate of large American banks, which
boosted the dollar in U.S. trading, tapered off quite early.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost a big 251.20 points Wednesday, gained
back 51.53 points, or 0.18 percent, closing the day at 27,212.58.
   The Nikkei index, the main market barometer, lost as much as
194.95 points in the first 15 minutes of trading, dropping below
the 27,000-level for the first time since April 22. The fall,
prompted by the overnight plunge on Wall Street caused by prime
rate hikes and concern over inflation, turned investors to hunt for
bargains, traders said.
   ``There are several factors, such as the result of the upcoming
30-year bond sale in the quarterly U.S. Treasury refunding, and
U.S. trade figures for March, which investors are keeping eyes on
in making major moves,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities.
   The overall buying mood was strong, however, and unless
something really surprising happens, the market will maintain its
bullish trend, he said.
   Popular issues included shipbuildings and machineries.
Chemicals, non-ferrous metals, textiles and rubbers also gained
ground. Lower issues were steels and electricals.
   Volume of the first-section trade stood at an esimated 900
million shares, against 1.1 billion shares changed hands on
Wednesday.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry has informed The Associated
Press that its correspondents have been barred from traveling to
Afghanistan to cover the scheduled withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Foreign Ministry officials said on Wednesday the Afghan
government had objected to a question posed by an AP correspondent
during a recent news conference held by Afghan leader Najib in
Kabul.
   Yevgeny B. Isayenko, a ministry press official, said Afghan
authorities would refuse a visa to any AP correspondent, several of
whom had applied to cover the withdrawal scheduled to begin Sunday.
   Michael Putzel, AP chief of bureau in Moscow, had been given
oral assurances Tuesday that an Associated Press reporter and
photographer would be given seats on the official plane carrying
correspondents to Kabul.
   The Afghan government generally permits news coverage by Western
journalists only when they are invited as members of an officially
sanctioned press tour.
   Isayenko said that, during a news conference in Kabul last
month, Carol J. Williams, a veteran AP Moscow correspondent, asked
a question that ``was very insulting'' to Najib.
   Ms. Williams asked Najib whether, if rebel forces in Afghanistan
emerge victorious after the Soviet pullout, he would seek refuge in
the Soviet Union. The pro-Soviet Afghan leader replied he would
never allow such a victory.
   He did not object to the question at the time.
   Isayenko said refusal to grant visas was ``the sovereign right
of the Afghan Embassy in Moscow.''
   Andrei Silantiev, a Foreign Ministry official who serves as
government liaison with foreign news agencies, said the British
news agency Reuters would file pool reports to the AP and other
Western news services.

<TEXT>
   Harvard Law School will renew its
commitment to a diversified faculty under an agreement reached
between the dean and about 50 students, most of them black, who
staged an overnight ``study-in'' at his office.
   ``We feel we were very successful over the last 24 hours,'' said
Robert Wilkins, a second-year law student who is president of the
Black Law School Association, which staged the protest. ``This is a
great step forward.''
   But Dean James Vorenberg said Wednesday the administration had
only agreed ``to look into'' seven of the students' 12 demands.
   ``I don't think there's any major commitments on either side,''
he said. ``It's more of a sharing of understanding how issues
look.''
   However, Vorenberg said, a policy statement on diversity first
issued in 1982 would be ``updated and reissued'' and an effort to
interest minority students in teaching would be made.
   The students camped out at Vorenberg's office Tuesday night in
their protest for more black professors and for Vorenberg, who is
retiring, to be replaced by a tenured black professor.
   After a meeting Wednesday, the dean ``specifically agreed to
going ahead with commitments on seven'' demands, Wilkins said.
   He said the demands included establishing a fellowship to entice
black professors to teach at Harvard; issuing a policy statement
expressing a commitment to diversity as part of the school's hiring
policy; and allowing students a broader role in the hiring of
minority faculty.
   The students also failed to bring about a commitment to
``diversify the curriculum to reflect the experience of people of
color'' and a request that a black assistant professor receive
tenure.
   Harvard Law School has 61 tenured positions, two of them held by
blacks. There are three black assistant professors and no black
women on the staff.

<TEXT>
   A court today ordered a young Lebanese
held in custody for eight days after police said he was the owner
of a dynamite-packed car that blew up near the Israeli Embassy and
killed three people.
   The car exploded Wednesday about 200 yards from the embassy
after police prevented it from parking outside the building and the
car sped off.
   Police said they suspected the owner, Omar Ahmad Hawillo, 28, of
being involved in the bungled attack, which killed the driver and
two bystanders.
   Police said the car was rigged with 300 pounds of dynamite, and
Interior Minister Christodoulos Veniamin said the embassy was the
intended target.
   Witnesses reported seeing Hawillo running from the scene, police
said, adding that there was also evidence linking him to a
remote-control detonating device found nearby.
   There was speculation that the attempt to blow up the embassy
was to avenge the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's military
chief.
   But the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Nicosia
issued a statement denying involvement.
   Five of the 15 people hurt in the fiery blast remained
hospitalized today and were listed in serious but stable condition
with burns and cuts.
   Hawillo, who arrived from Lebanon on March 21, was brought to
court under heavy security. With the hand that wasn't handcuffed,
he covered his face so it could not be photographed.
   Detective Takis Komodikis said Hawillo was arrested four hours
after the explosion. Police earlier reported he was picked up
shortly after the blast.
   The judge remanded the suspect to police custody for eight days,
pending the investigation's completion.
   A detective who spoke on condition of anonymity said Hawillo had
admitted to owning the car but denied any involvement in the
attempt to bomb the embassy, claiming he had lent the vehicle to a
friend.
   Komodikis told the court that the driver, who was blown to
pieces, had not been identified yet.
   A police statement said the driver had tried to park outside the
Israeli Embassy building twice before the blast, but was told to
move on by police. When asked for his identification, he sped away
and rammed another car at an intersection.
   Adamos Markides, one of the injured Cypriots, said he saw the
car coming out of a side street near the embassy. ``He was driving
so fast he didn't even stop at the traffic lights and hit another
car,'' Markides said.
   He said his was the second car behind the one that exploded.
``Suddenly there was this flash and boom with a black cloud of
smoke enveloping everything and a terrible heat. I staggered out of
my car with my face and arms on fire.''
   An anonymous caller telephoned a Mideast bureau of the American
television network NBC to claim responsibility for the explosion in
the name of the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal. Abu Nidal, whose
real name is Sabri Banna, has been blamed for a series of terrorist
attacks around the world.
   Wazir, the PLO's deputy commander, was killed April 16 in Tunis.
Israeli sources have said he was killed by an Israeli squad of
agents. Palestinian groups have pledged to avenge the his death.
   Police said the two Cypriots killed in the blast were a woman
who was trapped in her burning car and a pedestrian, Andreas
Frangos, a retired diplomat. The woman was not identified.

   Army helicopters rescued hundreds of civilians
today from the reach of poisonous fumes after a tractor-trailer
carrying bromine overturned in southern Israel, killing the driver,
police said.
   Nine people were treated at hospitals for burns and breathing
difficulties after the accident on a main highway about 65 miles
south of Jerusalem, said Amos Dahari, a spokesman for southern
Israel's Negev district police.
   The driver, who was not identified, was pulled out of the cabin
dead after police and soldiers struggled for seven hours to reach
him, he said.
   Police closed a 72-mile stretch of road as clouds of the orange
smoke billowed above the spill, witnesses said.
   Bromine is a poisonous, reddish-brown chemical used in making
dyes and photographic solutions.
   ``There was a huge orange cloud of chemicals in the sky,'' one
of the injured, taxi driver Shlomo Azulai, told Army radio.
   Azulai said he tried to pull the driver from the truck for about
45 minutes before being overcome by the gas and flown by helicopter
to Soroka Hospital in nearby Beersheba.
   Rescue workers also evacuated hundreds of civilians from three
settlements, a school, and bedouin Arab encampments, Dahari said.
   Workers also sprayed the road with a solution of ammonia to
neutralize the corrosive liquid, he added.
   Dahari said it was unclear what caused the early morning
accident just south of the Dead Sea and near the Jordanian border.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Raided Ships Off Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today its warplanes raided two
ships off Iran during the night, bringing to eight the number of
attacks on commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf it claimed in
two weeks.
   Only one of the reported attacks has been confirmed by the
London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which monitors
maritime traffic around the world.
   Gulf-based shipping executives had no local independent
information for any of the attacks since April 29. Such attacks
normally would precipitate an Iranian retaliatory blow in the
so-called tanker war, an offshoot of the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Lloyd's said the Iraqis fired two French-made Exocet missiles at
an Iranian tanker on Tuesday, causing considerable fire damage to
the vessel.
   The vessel, whose name was not known according to Lloyd's, was
owned by the National Iranian Oil Tanker Co. and was sailing from
Iran's key oil loading terminal at Kharg en route to the Larak
terminal in the southern gulf.
   The attack took place about 40 miles off the northern Iranian
coast, according to the Lloyd's report.
   The Baghdad high command on Wednesday reported the sixth attack
and today, the seventh and eighth attacks in two weeks on ``large
maritime targets'' off Iran. The term usually means a tanker
sailing to or from Kharg.
   Kharg accounts for 90 percent of Iranian oil exports and Baghdad
has vowed to block the Iranian oil flow as long as the Tehran
rulers refuse to accept a negotiated end to their war.
   Ship attacks claimed by Iraq often are not confirmed until some
time later because they occur inside the maritime war zone. Some
ships maintain radio silence to avoid being targeted again. Some of
the raids are never confirmed.
   The Lloyd's report would be the first confirmed ship attack in
the gulf since the U.S. Navy was empowered to defend any vessel
attacked by either belligerent outside exclusion zones off enemy
coastlines, if a U.S. warship happened to be in the area at the
time of the attack.
   Iran retaliates for the Iraqi raids by striking at neutral
commercial shipping. The Iranians have not hit any vessel since
April 24 and before the U.S. Navy rules in the gulf were broadened.

   A Navy avionics technician acquitted of
assault for having sex with his former fiancee despite knowing he
carried the AIDS virus said he was not surprised by the verdict.
   ``It was what I felt was right,'' Petty Officer 2nd Class John
E. Crawford said after the verdict was announced Wednesday.
Crawford, 27, was accompanied by his present fiancee, Karen
Skavdahl.
   Crawford's family and friends applauded after the seven-member
jury announced their verdict before Military Judge Richard Mollison
at the Treasure Island Navy Station.
   Jeannie Elmer, Crawford's former fiancee and accuser, said she
was upset by the verdict and fears it will encourage others not to
reveal to sex partners that they are infected with the deadly virus.
   ``That's why AIDS is probably going to be carried on and on and
on, because people will not tell their partner,'' said Elmer. ``And
now this will prove they can probably get away with it.''
   Elmer has tested negative for the AIDS virus three times.
   Crawford stood at attention in a packed courtroom as the jury,
which deliberated 4{ hours, also acquitted him of charges of
adultery and of exposing his former girlfriend to the AIDS virus
wrongfully and in wanton disregard for human life.
   He was convicted of the minor charge of having a visitor in his
room after hours, for which the jury gave him 15 days in the brig
and reduced his rank by one grade, from E5 to E4.
   If convicted of the primary charges, Crawford could have been
stripped of his rank, dishonorably discharged and sentenced to a 10
years behind bars.
   The charges stemmed from a sexual encounter Crawford and Elmer
had on April 15, 1987.
   Crawford, a native of Magnolia, Ark., testified he told Elmer
about his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love
in his barracks room. He said Elmer, 28, was bitter that he had
broken off their brief engagement and filed the charges for revenge.
   Lt. Cmdr. Jane Gilliland, the prosecutor, countered in her
closing statement that Crawford simply didn't care enough about
Elmer to tell her about the tests.
   The case was unprecedented in the Navy, although there have been
similar cases in other military branches.
   In Arizona on Wednesday, the AIDS-related court-martial of
Adrian G. Morris Jr. resumed after a nine-month delay.
   Morris, a 28-year-old Army private from Caseyville, Ill., is
accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not
using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus.
   The national Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20
percent to 30 percent of those who test positive for exposure to
the virus will develop AIDS within five years. It is not known
whether everyone with the virus will eventually develop the
incurable disease.

<TEXT>
   Two Port Authority police officers were the
proud owners of a slightly damaged $150,000 Rolls Royce _ at least
until their boss found out.
   The windfall began when heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson and
his new wife, actress Robin Given, were involved in a fender-bender
Sunday near the Manhattan entrance to the Holland Tunnel.
   When the officers, whose names have not been released, went to
see if they could help, Tyson _ according to police reports quoted
in today's New York Post _ told them: ``I've had nothing but bad
luck and accidents with this car. You guys take this car and keep
it.''
   Port Authority police said the officers at first resisted, but
the nearly 6-foot, 216-pound Tyson, whose ring record stands at
34-0, insisted.
   The officers drove the gift to a private garage in Jersey City,
N.J., where it stayed until Monday morning when the commander of
the Holland Tunnel police detail heard about the incident.
   The Port Authority's Internal Affairs unit sent detectives to
retrieve the car and return it to the company that handles Tyson's
business interests.
   ``I've got real problems with this behavior,'' said Port
Authority Police Superintendent Henry DeGeneste. ``The main
difficulty is that we had to ask. They should have told us about
the situation first and faster.''
   DeGeneste said the two would be disciplined.
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates the
bridges and tunnels between New York City and New Jersey.

   Scientists who were once smuggled into
this town from all over the country as part of the Manhattan
Project's secret attempt to build an atomic bomb in the 1940s
returned openly for a reunion this week.
   ``We were put on trains with the shades pulled down. ... We
arrived in Oak Ridge at 5 a.m.,'' recalled Jeptha A. Wade Jr., a
mechanical engineer who was one of about 60 members of the Special
Engineer Detachment at the reunion.
   ``It was raining, everything was muddy. We were told, `This is
going to be your new home.' It was a couple of days before we knew
we were in Tennessee,'' said a chuckling Wade, who returned for the
first time in 42 years Sunday from Hillsborough, Calif.
   Glynn Clark met his future wife, Evelyn, shortly after arriving
at what became known as the ``Atomic City'' in January 1944.
   ``We were all working with a dedication. ... There was no night
or day,'' said Clark, a chemical engineer.
   The work went on around the clock. After a night shift, Clark
said, some might go to a midnight dance, others to a 2 a.m. movie.
   ``I have a great affection for the town _ it was a pioneer
effort,'' Clark said.
   The effort was an arm of the Manhattan Project, the code name
for America's effort to build atomic weapons before Nazi Germany
did during World War II. Its members came from all over, and most
did not know where they were going or why.
   ``It wasn't scary, it was secret. They put the fear of God in us
about telling anyone what we were doing,'' said Wade, who was
assigned to work on the electromagnetic separation project
enriching uranium.
   The project, based in Oak Ridge and Hanford, Wash., eventually
yielded the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945.
   Oak Ridge was chosen because the government could get land for a
reasonable price, there was a good labor supply, the climate
allowed year-round construction and the inland location made the
project safe from foreign attack.
   Gordon Lindner and Mary Jane, his wife, were married in May 1944
and got to Oak Ridge that August. He said recreation consisted
largely of playing pool, listening to the radio and telling stories
at the PX.
   ``We had fun. ... We were all relieved we helped bring World War
II to an end, and we were all ready to go home,'' he said.
   Lindner, a mechanical engineer, said he and his wife went back
to Montana after the war, only to return to Oak Ridge two years
later to live.
   ``It's exciting to reminisce and see everyone again,'' he said.
   Howard Hite, who was a design engineer, said he didn't recognize
anything when he returned to Oak Ridge for the first time in 1975.
   ``I thought it would all shut down when the war was over,'' he
said. ``We don't need to make war anymore.''

   Here are some of the jokes involving the
reports of astrology in the White House that host Johnny Carson
featured in his return to the ``Tonight Show.''
   _I am not an expert on astrology, I know a little bit about it,
but I understand the horoscope with the chart as they call it is
divided into the so-called 12 houses, and I just didn't know the
White House was one of them.
   _We apparently have a new cabinet officer in the government I
was not aware of _ the Secretary of Health, Education and
Soothsaying.
   _Apparently the astrologist says that Reagan's sign is the
rising house of Aquarius. Nancy's house is, I think, in the house
of (dress designer) Adolfo. I could be wrong, it could be Bill
Blass, but I think that's close.
   _Do you get the feeling if this gets out of hand the National
Security Council will be sitting around a table with a pack of
tarot cards planning the nation's defense? `Gee, a black queen,
Frank, launch the missiles.'
   _Reagan performs at his best during a full moon. ... Big deal,
so does the Wolfman.
   Carson also noted that Reagan has said he never made a policy
decision based on astrology. Why? ``Well (imitating the president's
voice), because that little pointer on my Ouija board moved to
`No.'''

   Reece Sloan and Cindy McClellan had a lot
in common, but they'd been dating for about five months before they
discovered the most important thing _ their father.
   Last January, when Sloan, 31, was looking through an inch-thick
book of single women published by The Date Connection of Wichita,
he stopped on the page featuring Ms. McClellan, 38.
   ``I liked what I saw,'' Sloan said. ``She had a lot of the same
interests, like traveling, dancing and going to movies.''
   Sloan called Ms. McClellan, and they discovered they were both
adopted.
   They began dating regularly, and did so until last week, when a
private investigator hired by Ms. McClellan to find her parents
called.
   ``About two weeks ago he (the detective) called me and said my
biological father's name is Cecil Deardorf,'' Ms. McClellan said.
   Sloan's biological father was also named Cecil Deardorf. He said
he had mentioned his father's name to Ms. McClellan before the
private investigator called.
   ``It didn't strike me until a few days after the detective
called that I had heard that name before,'' Ms. McClellan said.
``But I still couldn't put my finger on it.''
   When she realized Sloan was her half-brother, Ms. McClellan said
she was first stunned, then saddened.
   ``I have to be very honest,'' she said. ``I didn't want to
believe it all. I just cried and cried and thought this just can't
be true. I mean, I had fallen in love with this man.
   ``But then I knew I had to tell him.''
   She said shifting from a romantic relationship to a Platonic one
has not been easy.
   ``I still love him,'' she said. ``And, he loves me. But, we have
to keep telling ourselves that we're brother and sister. And that
takes a lot of, well, strength.''
   Sloan said he too has found the transition difficult. But, he
says, they've managed.
   ``I'm slowly getting over the shock,'' he said. ``Everyday I'm
working through it. Anyway, I'd rather have a sister than a
girlfriend. It's a different feeling knowing that she's already a
part of me.''

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Names Former President As Involved In Bloody
Revolt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY M.H. AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung today
said ex-President Chun Doo-hwan was involved in crushing the bloody
1980 revolt in the southern city of Kwangju.
   Kim demanded that Chun be investigated in connection with the
nine-day Kwangju uprising, but said he opposes bringing him to
trial.
   ``Mr. Chun Doo-hwan was one of those deeply involved in the
Kwangju incident,'' Kim told reporters. ``There should be no
sanctuary in our efforts to disclose all truth.''
   At least 191 people were killed and more than 800 injured in the
uprising, by official count. Dissidents say the toll was much
higher.
   Kim, whose Party for Peace and Democracy emerged as the largest
opposition force in the April 26 elections for a National Assembly,
previously has called for an investigation of the revolt. But tis
was the first time that he named Chun as a central figure.
   President Roh Tae-woo's governing Democratic Justice Party has
said it would object to any parliamentary investigation of Chun and
his family.
   At the time of the uprising, Chun was a general leading other
military officers who seized power after a coup. Most of them later
retired to take on key political posts, and Chun became president.
   Roh, then an army general, helped Chun seize power with military
backing in 1980. Kim did not name Roh in the Kwangju case.
   Kim, 62, said he was arrested one day before the uprising began
on May 18, 1980. A military court found Kim guilty and sentenced
him to death on what he called doctored sedition charges.
   Kim's sentence was later reduced to life and then to a 20-year
term. Under pressure from Washington, Kim was later allowed to go
to the United States for medical treatment.
   Kim said a parliamentary investigative team should look into all
aspects of the Kwangju uprising, including the exact number of
casualties, who ordered troops to open fire and any U.S. role in it.
   Kim took the political offensive as Roh's government was being
reorganized after last month's elections, which left the nation's
governing party without a parliamentary majority for the first time
in South Korea's 40-year history.
   Roh said he ``humbly'' accepted the election setback, promised
to work with the opposition and reshuffled the top security-related
government posts.

   A U.S. prosecutor surprised an audience of
mystery writers with an impersonation of Marlon Brando in ``The
Godfather,'' then urged the authors to devote less ink to murders
and more to white collar crime.
   ``We have to pay more attention to white collar crime,'' U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Guiliani told the International Congress of Crime
Writers as he catalogued some of the criminals he has prosecuted,
including Wall Street insider traders, income tax evaders, corrupt
government officials.
   He then shifted gears, offering his opinion of fictional
prosecutors.
   ``A lot of my collegues are not portrayed fairly,'' he said
Wednesday. ``And the same could be said about the police. But then,
even journalists complain that they're not portrayed accurately.''
   The writers asked for a little help in the accuracy department.
   What common characteristic did white-collar criminals have?
   Aside from basic greed, ``When they get caught, they all find
God at or about the time they go to prison,'' he responded.

<HEAD>Phones Still Out in Chicago Suburbs Five Days After Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The telephone outage in Chicago's western suburbs
dragged into a fifth day today as Illinois Bell officials tried to
find out why an hour went by before firefighters arrived to fight a
blaze at a switching station.
   Sunday's fire at the unmanned Hinsdale station left 35,000
customers without telephone service in Du Page County, west of
Chicago, and there was no indication when they would get normal
service back.
   Adjusting to life without telephones has been difficult, say
those affected.
   ``You don't miss it until you don't have it,'' said Bill Saad,
one of more than 100 people waiting in line Wednesday for 17 phones
provided free of charge outside the fire-damaged switching station.
   Bell learned of the fire at 3:59 p.m., when alarms at a
monitoring station reported a fire and power failure, said Bell
spokeswoman Pat Montgomery. The alarm is not designed to sound at
the Hinsdale Fire Department, which arrived at the fire at 4:58 p.m.
   She said an Illinois Bell worker arrived at the station at 4:20
p.m., and flagged down a car and asked the driver to alert
firefighters.
   ``We're still trying to find out why there was the big
difference in the time (the Bell worker) came and when the fire
department came,'' Ms. Montgomery said.
   She had little encouragement for customers.
   ``We don't know when we will be able to bring back local
service,'' she said Wednesday. ``And when we do, it will be a slow
process of a few thousand customers a day. We can't estimate when.
We just don't know.''
   Between 150 and 200 Illinois Bell employees have been working to
restore operations, and some local calls between suburbs and some
long-distance calls that normally run through the Hinsdale station
were finally ringing phones, Ms. Montgomery said.
   Cable and high-tech equipment were badly damaged by flames and
the water sprayed by firefighters. The cause of the fire has not
been determined, Ms. Montgomery said.
   Saad, a resident of Downers Grove, was standing in line for the
second time to make the same business call to Kansas City. The
operator had cut off Saad's first call, but under rules set up at
the center, that still forced to go him back at the end of the line
before another try.
   ``It has definitely been a headache,'' said Gloria Telander,
president of Print Media Services Ltd. in Elk Grove Village, whose
business publishes campground guides for travelers around the
country.
   She said her customers calling from outside Illinois get a
recorded message: ``Due to mechanical difficulties, we cannot
complete your call. Please try again.''
   ``Well, they've been trying now for three days and they're
hysterical. ... Why doesn't the phone company just say what's going
on?''

   Four of the Golden Temple's five top
priests and about 30 followers were arrested today when police
blocked their attempted march on the Sikh shrine which was ringed
by government security forces.
   Among those arrested was head Sikh priest Jasbir Singh Rode. His
talks Wednesday with government officials to try to end the
four-day confrontation at the 400-year-old temple were inconclusive.
   Two Sikh militants were killed this afternoon in a heavy
exchange of fire with security forces on the temple's perimeter,
police said. A third was seriously injured.
   The deaths raised to at least 14 the number of people killed
since shooting broke out Monday at the temple, Sikhism's holiest
shrine. Eleven others have been injured.
   Rode has called for the estimated 100 Sikh extremists inside the
temple complex to dismantle their bunkers and for the 2,500 police
and paramilitary forces ringing the shrine to withdraw.
   The priest and his followers were arrested at another Sikh
shrine about a third of a mile north of the Golden Temple as they
were about to start marching in defiance of a police ban.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Sarbjeet Singh asked the group to
call off the march because two bursts of gunfire inside the temple
were reported this morning after an overnight lull.
   Punjab Police Chief K.P.S. Gill told a news conference that
there were no plans to end the siege. Asked where it was leading,
Gill said: ``We are waiting to see how the situation develops.''
   ``We want the militants to stop firing so that normalcy can be
restored,'' he added.
   ``We take responsibility for any firing from inside the
temple,'' Rode responded. ``You take responsibility for firing from
outside.''
   Sikh militants placed a medium-sized machine gun atop a tower
inside the complex and were in a position to fire down on anyone in
the area.
   The Sikhs have also built fortifications on the northern edge of
the complex, from which police Tuesday evacuated 800 pilgrims to
keep them out of the crossfire.
   All shops and businesses in the old, walled sector of Amritsar
which surrounds the temple remained shuttered today and people
stayed off the streets as a police-imposed curfew entered its
fourth day.
   State-run All India Radio said the government was trying to
ensure that milk and other supplies reach civilians in curfew-bound
areas.
   Police had hoped to lift the curfew Wednesday, but the effort
failed.
   The temple complex covers an area equivalent to more than five
city blocks, and includes offices, hostels and dining halls.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983
for more autonomy for an independent homeland in Punjab state.
Sikhs make up less than two percent of India's 800 million people
and Punjab is the only state where they are a majority.
   More than 940 people have been killed this year in Punjab in
attacks blamed on the extremists. Most have been Hindus or moderate
Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign.
   The Indian army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June
1984 to drive Sikh extremists from the shrine. More than 1,200
people were killed in the attack, including Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale, a militant Sikh preacher.
   Later that year, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated
by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge.

<TEXT>
   A search was continuing today for three Marines
missing and feared dead after their helicopter crashed into the
Pacific Ocean during a flight to check maintenance work on its
rotor blades, officials said.
   The CH-46 Sea Knight from Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station
crashed Wednesday into water about 30 feet deep a mile off the
island of Oahu, said Chief Warrant Officer Eric R. Carlson, a
Marine spokesman.
   Three helicopters searched unsuccessfully for the crew until
sunset, with the search continuing at night with a Coast Guard
cutter. An air search was scheduled to resume again at dawn, he
said.
   Marine divers located wreckage on the sea bed, but were unable
to find the helicopter's crew, Carlson said.
   Carlson said repair crews had removed the helicopter's rotor
blades and reinstalled them during routine maintenance. He said the
crew had taken the chopper out for a test flight to make sure the
blades were in balance.
   ``It started falling and I saw something fall off of it _ maybe
it was the tail part that fell,'' said Carolyn Kam, who saw the
crash through a window.
   Kam, a newscaster at radio station KRTR, said the craft was
smoking as it fell to the water.
   The helicopter was attached to the Marine Medium Helicopter
Squadron 262, one of five squadrons based at Kaneohe.
   The CH-46 has been out of production since 1971, after orders
declined with the end of the Vietnam War, said Robert Torgerson,
spokesman for Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia.
   It has been used by the Marines since the early 1960s as a troop
transport aircraft, and the Navy has also used it to airlift
supplies, Torgerson said.
   Since discontinuing production, Boeing has made kits to maintain
the reliability of the helicopter and extend its life into the
1990s, he said.
   Torgerson said there has been no history of mechanical problems
with the CH-46, although ``all aircraft that operate for that long
have had some incidents.''

   Not once in the 13 harrowing minutes it took
the crew of Aloha Airlines flight 243 to land the severly damaged
plane did co-pilot Madeline ``Mimi'' Tompkins doubt she and pilot
Robert Schornstheimer would keep control of the craft, she said
today.
   ``I didn't feel nervous,'' even though the crew saw sky through
the cockpit doorway, had one engine out and communicated with hand
signals because of the noise, Ms. Tompkins said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Schornstheimer said he struggled to fly the plane by ``feel,''
unaware that a 20-foot chunk of cabin ceiling had been shorn off
the Boeing 737, sweeping a stewardess to her death.
   ``Our whole emphasis was focused on feeling it, that it was
flyable, and being able to land it safely,'' he said in the
interview.
   The dramatic tape of the conversation between the crew and the
air traffic control tower at Maui, released Wednesday, shows Ms.
Tompkins' voice was strained but under control as the troubles
began on April 28.
   ``We have rapid decompression. We are unpressurized _ declaring
an emergency,'' she told the tower.
   Schornstheimer described the moment the roof was ripped away:
``All of a sudden there was this loud thump sound and debris was
flying everywhere in the cockpit. I turned around and looked out
the door and everything above shoulder level was blue sky.
   ``The cockpit door was blown off,'' he said. ``I didn't really
know how far the damage went, all I could see was blue sky.''
   Ms. Tompkins said ``training and experience'' took over as the
plane shook in the air and debris flew through the cockpit.
   ``We just immediately started into the things we're trained for,
getting on our oxygen masks and started down and making a decision
about where we wanted to land,'' said Schornstheimer.
   ``Mimi and I are both experienced even though we haven't flown
that much together. We just pointed and we both knew where we were
going and what we were doing and continued on with our normal
procedures,'' he said.
   The plane shook violently when the pilot dipped below a certain
speed, and the problems multiplied as the plane descended.
   ``Somewhere along that line we lost an engine, and we started
our auxiliary power unit and used the generator on it for part of
the electrical power on the airplane,'' said Schornstheimer.
   Adding to his concerns, Schornstheimer said in an interview
published in today's editions of USA Today, was the fact that, when
he looked through the open doorway into the main cabin, enough
pieces of flooring had been ripped up that the craft's control
cables were exposed.
   Ms. Tompkins, meanwhile, spoke coolly with the controllers as
the plane dipped below 11,000 feet and was cleared for a head-on
approach to the runway.
   ``We're going to need assistance. We cannot communicate with the
flight attendants. Ah, will (there) be assistance for the
passengers when we land?'' Ms. Tompkins asked the air traffic
control tower.
   Schornstheimer said after their initial shock on seeing the
plane after landing, he and Ms. Tompkins went on helping passengers
in the rescue operation.
   ``It did (fly). We were glad it hung together,'' he said. ``It
was just amazing to walk around the airplane after we landed and
look at it.''
   Hours before a tape of the radio transmissions was made public
Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration, the two pilots
received an award from the Air Line Pilots Association for landing
the crippled plane with all passengers and all but the one
stewardess safe.
   Earlier in the week, Ms. Tompkins and Schornstheimer had met
with Vice President George Bush and made the rounds at offices in
Congress. They declined to discuss the incident with reporters.
   ``What seemed like a short time to Mimi and me because of our
busy cockpit duties must have seemed like an eternity to our
passengers and flight attendants,'' Schornstheimer told fellow
pilots Wednesday while accepting the ALPA award.
   His co-pilot, Ms. Tompkins, praised the captain: ``Bob analyzed
the situation confronting us and he reacted. All of his decisions
were the right ones.''
   The two pilots said their ability to work as a team under
adverse conditions was key to bringing the Boeing 737 to a safe
landing.
   As bad as Flight 243's situation was, the tape showed that the
two pilots thought _ erroneously, it turned out _ that it was even
worse.
   According to the tape, the pilots were certain that for some
reason the nose landing gear was not deploying. This would have
made landing the already severely damaged aircraft especially
dangerous, according to aviation experts.
   ``Be advised we have no nose gear we are landing without a nose
gear,'' Ms. Tompkins told the Maui airport tower in a strained but
controlled voice as the plane headed toward the airport. ``We'll
need all the (emergency) equipment you got.''
   It is believed that a malfunctioning indicator light misled the
pilots into thinking the nose gear had not deployed.
   Only seconds before the plane set down on the runway did the
controller see that the nose gear actually had deployed and advised
the flight crew. Then the Boeing 737 landed, ambulances and fire
trucks waiting.
   Despite the experience, Ms. Tompkins told the ALPA gathering
Wednesday that she is ready to get back to the cockpit. ``I`m
looking forward to going back to Hawaii and flying again,'' she
said.

   A painting of the late mayor Harold Washington
wearing women's lingerie was impounded by police after the City
Council condemned the work and aldermen stormed the prestigious art
school where it was displayed.
   Students yelled ``Fascists!'' and ``Chicago is a communist
state!'' after nine alderman removed the caricature of the city's
first black mayor, who died of a heart attack in November, from the
School of the Art Institute.
   ``Half the city is still mourning,'' said Alderman Bill Henry.
``You're going to tell me it's art?''
   The City Council contingent charged the work was racist and an
insult to the Washington family.
   ``The painting has been arrested,'' Alderman Ernest Jones said.
The portrait, wrapped in brown paper, was carried off in a squad
car that left the school with sirens wailing.
   Students at the school, a four-year college affiliated with the
Art Institute of Chicago, argued that the work was artistic
self-expression and protected by the First Amendment.
   ``This has nothing to do with race, it has to do with art,''
said student Kevin Landers. ``Don't tell us what to draw.''
   The painting depicted Washington clad in a frilly white bra,
panties and stockings, holding a pencil and frowning at viewers. It
was displayed in a school hallway with dozens of others in a
student competition closed to the public.
   The students repeatedly restored the painting to the wall after
aldermen took it down. The aldermen eventually took the work to
school president Tony Jones, who agreed to allow police to impound
the work.
   ``We got complaints about the painting. We came down here and
... found it insulting, inciting and causing unrest,'' Ernest Jones
said.
   Tony Jones, who signed a statement at the aldermen's request
indicating the work would not be displayed again at the school,
later said police were concerned the painting ``would lead to
riots.''
   ```Incitement to riot' was the phrase they actually used,'' he
said.
   Artist David Nelson left the school hours before the
confrontation, Jones said, adding he had tried unsuccessfully to
reach the student to seek voluntary removal of the painting before
the City Hall delegation arrived.
   A school statement said the artist ``chose this work himself''
and noted, ``Students bear the sole responsibility for selection of
their work in this exhibition.''
   Nelson could not be reached to explain what the painting was
intended to represent. School spokesman Kevin Frech would not
provide his telephone number, and calls placed to listed telephone
numbers for that name went unanswered or were answered by people
who denied any knowledge of the painting.
   The exhibit also included a self-portrait of Nelson, showing a
young white man embracing people of various races and titled, ``I'm
sensitive and I love all humanity.''
   The City Council passed a resolution Wednesday calling for
withdrawal of city subsidies to the school unless the painting was
removed, and demanding a public apology.

<HEAD>Opposition Parties To Call Non-Confidence Vote Against Minister</HEAD>

   Opposition parties today agreed to call a
no-confidence vote in Parliament against a Cabinet minister who
claimed Japan was not an aggressor in World War II.
   A resolution condemning National Land Agency chief Seisuke Okuno
was expected to be submitted to the Lower House of the Diet on
Friday, said an official of the opposition Komeito (Clean
Government Party).
   But the measure was almost certain to fail because the governing
Liberal Democratic Party has a 302-seat majority in the 512-seat
Lower House.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Okuno's comments and previous
lapses by other officials have ``severely damaged'' relations with
Asian nations.
   Okuno came under fire from China, South Korea and North Korea
for an April 22 statement that Japan was not an aggressor in World
War II and ``fought to protect itself at a time when the white race
had turned Asia into a colony.''
   He made the remark after visiting Yasukuni Shrine, where war
heroes and convicted war criminals are enshrined. Other countries,
including China, have protested official visits to the monument in
central Tokyo.
   Okuno said the objections were ``unfortunate.''
   In separate policy committee meetings, the Japan Socialist Party
and the Komeito agreed to call a no-confidence vote against the
75-year-old minister, said the Komeito official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Japan's two largest opposition groupings were supported by the
Democratic Socialists and the Communist Party.
   News reports said the opposition was privately pressing Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita to dismiss Okuno, widely regarded as the
third-highest ranking official after Takeshita and Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa.
   Okuno's comments and his refusal to apologize have embarrassed
the government. Spokesmen have stressed that his views do not
reflect official policy.
   Takeshita, fielding questions from opposition Diet members
Wednesday, said: ``Our country feels deep responsibility for the
grave damage Japan inflicted on the Chinese people during the past
war. We believe the government should fully recognize that our
country's actions during the war have been criticized severely as
aggression.''
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, who tried to soothe China's anger
on a trip to Beijing last week, said today he had telephoned Okuno
and urged him to withdraw his comments.
   Today, North Korea termed the comments ``an expression of a
sinister intention to open a chapter of a new history of militarist
aggression.''
   Beginning in 1937, China and Japan fought an eight-year war that
killed 571,000 Japanese and 1.3 million Chinese soldiers and an
untold number of civilians.
   The dead included an estimated 42,000 Chinese civilians and
captured soldiers killed by the Japanese in the Nanking massacre in
the winter of 1937-38.
   China and Japan signed a treaty in 1972 that says in part, ``The
Japanese side is keenly aware of Japan's responsibility for causing
enormous damages in the past to the Chinese people through war and
deeply reproaches itself.''

   Seven members of a leftist terrorist group
linked to two bloody Brink's armored truck robberies in 1981 face
new charges of setting off bombs at the U.S. Capitol and three
military facilities.
   The charges were made public here Wednesday just hours after one
of the defendants, Marilyn Buck, was convicted in New York of
murder and armed robbery in two 1981 Brink's truck holdups that
left four dead.
   Ms. Buck, Linda Sue Evans, and Laura Whitehorn were charged with
conspiring to wage a campaign of ``armed propaganda'' against
``imperialist rule'' by setting off bombs in the Capitol and seven
other locations in Washington and New York City.
   Susan Rosenberg, Timothy Blunk, Dr. Alan Berkman and Elizabeth
Duke were named as participants but not charged with conspiracy.
   All seven were charged with malicious damage of government
property by placing bombs in the Capitol and at three military
buildings here.
   The midnight explosion in a corridor outside the U.S. Senate
chambers on Nov. 7, 1983, blasted a large hole in a wall and
shattered four windows. It damaged several paintings and knocked
doors off the hinges outside the office of Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., then the minority leader.
   Bombs were also detonated at the National War College at Ft.
McNair on April 26, 1983, the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center
on Aug. 18, 1983, and the Navy Yard Officer's Club on April 20,
1984.
   The bombings injured no one but caused considerable property
damage.
   All the defendants except Ms. Duke _ a fugitive _ are serving
time for various federal weapons convictions stemming from alleged
terrorist activity.
   The group variously called itself the Armed Resistance Unit, the
Revolutionary Fighting Group and the Red Guerrilla Resistance in
communiques issued to claim credit for the blasts, the indictment
said.
   After the Capitol bombing, the Armed Resistance Unit sent a
communique to National Public Radio saying it set off the bomb to
protest the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the deployment of Marines
in Lebanon.
   ``We purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of
imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling
class and government,'' the communique said. ``We did not choose to
kill any of them at this time. But their lives are not sacred.''
   The various groups also claimed responsibility for bombs set off
at four buildings in New York City at:
   _The Federal Building in Staten Island on Jan. 18, 1983.
   _The Israeli Aircraft Industries Building on April 5, 1984.
   _The South African Consulate on Sept. 26, 1984.
   _The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association on Feb. 23, 1985.
   Documents seized by federal agents indicated that the group also
targeted the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House,
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., and Aberdeen Proving
Ground, Md., for surveillance.
   Other potential targets were the Washington offices of a law
firm, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Cuban
American National Foundation and Summit Aviation in Middletown,
Del., the indictment charged.
   The group amassed an arsenal of dynamite, explosive gels,
blasting caps and firearms that was kept in a garage in Doylestown,
Pa. and a rented storage bin in Cherry Hill, N.J.
   The indictment charged that members of the group obtained
aliases from death certificates to obtain passports, driver's
licenses and to get jobs. Berkman and Blunk staged a Sept. 2, 1984,
armed robbery at a supermarket in Cromwell, Conn., the indictment
said.
   Ms. Buck and Mutulu Shakur were convicted Wednesday in New York
of murder and armed robbery in connection with the Oct. 20, 1981,
attempted robbery of a Brink's truck carrying $1.6 million in
Nanuet, N.Y.
   A Brink's guard and two Nyack, N.Y., policemen were killed in a
shootout.
   They were also convicted of the June 1981 robbery of a Brink's
truck in the Bronx, N.Y., in which a guard was killed.
   Both face life sentences.
   Federal authorities here said they waited until after Ms. Buck's
trial was over to unseal the indictment, which was returned last
month by a grand jury.
   Ms. Evans, 41, was convicted of harboring Ms. Buck when she was
a fugitive wanted on charges stemming from the attempted Brink's
holdup.
   Ms. Evans is also serving a five-year term for illegal weapons
possession plus a 40-year sentence for illegally buying weapons in
New Orleans in 1983.
   Rosenberg, 32, and Blunk, 30, are serving 58-year sentences for
possession of 600 pounds of explosives found when they were
arrested in Cherry Hill, N.J., almost three years ago.
   Berkman, a physician, and Ms. Duke were arrested in 1985 outside
Pittsburgh. At the time, both were linked by law enforcement
officials to M-19, a radical leftist group.
   Berkman is serving a 10-year prison term for possession of
explosives and weapons that were stored in the Doylestown, Pa.,
garage allegedly rented by Ms. Duke. She fled while awaiting trial
on similar charges.
   Whitehorn is already serving time for possession of weapons and
false identification cards.
   Ms. Rosenberg has been linked to the attempted holdup of the
Brink's truck as well as the 1979 prison escape of Joanne Chesimard.
   Ms. Chesimard, a leader of the Black Liberation Army, was
serving a life sentence for murdering a New Jersey state trooper.
   The federal court jury also convicted Shakur and Ms. Buck of
helping Ms. Chesimard escape from state prison at Clinton, N.J.

   After six days of fighting, guns fell
silent in south Beirut's slums today as rival Shiite Moslem
militias observed a cease-fire arranged by the presidents of Syria
and Iran.
   Police said the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
controlled 70 percent of the 16-square-mile slums before the
cease-fire went into effect at 11 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT) Wednesday.
   Tension remained high in the slums as both sides, armed in their
positions, exchanged occasional sniper and machine-gun fire. One
woman was killed by a sniper's bullet in the Ghobeiri district
today.
   Police said 33 people were killed and 160 wounded Wednesday
before the truce began. The overall toll from nearly a week of
violence was 188 killed and 532 wounded.
   A police spokesman said the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for hope,
had lost most of its positions in south Beirut's narrow alleys and
redeployed its militiamen along the disputed terrain's southern,
western and northern edges.
   ``Amal controls all the gateways to south Beirut and Hezbollah
controls most of the area from inside,'' said the spokesman, who by
regulation cannot be identified.
   Reporters who toured the embattled slums saw Amal militiamen at
those positions in south Beirut.
   Hezbollah fighters, in light green fatigues and green headbands,
controlled most of the area from inside.
   Bullet scars appeared on nearly every building in the area.
Smoke billowed from several shell-pocked apartment blocks and shops
that were hit during Wednesday's battles.
   Several Amal jeeps were seen destroyed along the side roads of
districts under Hezbollah's control.
   Dozens of cars were damaged. Several others were burned beyond
recognition. Glass shards and rubble littered the dusty streets and
alleys of the embattled slums.
   Iranian flags rose from at least 15 Amal positions overrun by
Hezbollah.
   The ``final cease-fire'' was ordered by President Hafez Assad of
Syria and his Iranian counterpart, Ali Khamenei, after telephone
consultations late Wednesday evening. The two presidents also set
up a four-man committee to supervise implementation of the accord.
   The committee groups Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hussein
Sheikholeslam; the head of Syrian military intelligence in west
Beirut, Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud; Ayoub Homeyed of Amal; and Hassan
Khalil of Hezbollah.
   Four observer teams formed by the committee entered south Beirut
early today to supervise evacuation of the wounded from both rival
factions, the police spokesman said.
   He said a convoy of about 10 ambulances from the Lebanese Red
Cross also drove across Amal lines into the bomb-scarred slums to
evacuate the wounded.
   However, the evacuation was delayed because ``at the last minute
Hezbollah demanded guarantees that its wounded will be safe in
hospitals of west Beirut outside its area of influence,'' the
spokesman said.
   He said ``the Syrians agreed to guarantee safety of wounded
Hezbollahis.''
   At the height of the fighting, doctors said militiamen forced
surgeons at a hospital to operate at gunpoint, and that there were
gunbattles inside the hospital.
   Syria deployed 7,500 troops in west Beirut 14 months ago after a
month of bloody clashes between Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Amal
and the militia of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party.
   The Syrians, however, did not deploy in south Beirut, a
traditional stronghold for Iranian-backed underground factions
holding most of the 18 foreign hostages.
   The truce was reached after Amal lost most of south Beirut to
the pro-Iranian radicals.
   The truce calls for withdrawal of all militiamen from the
streets of the southern suburbs this afternoon. ``The withdrawal
will be the big test,'' the police spokesman said.
   Four previous cease-fire accords have collapsed due to
Hezbollah's refusal to withdraw to positions it held before the
confrontation broke out Friday.
   An Amal official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his
militia ``insists on returning to the districts we controlled
before the clashes started.'' He refused to say whether Amal would
try to regain its lost positions by force if Hezbollah refuses to
withdraw.

   Jesse Jackson's call to white Democratic
legislators who benefited from black votes to back him for the
presidential nomination has failed to attract much support from
those who count at the national convention.
   Since the days leading up to the Super Tuesday primaries on
March 8, Jackson ha said that white Democratic legislators,
especially those in the South who were elected with a major share
of the black vote, should be willing to support him based on that
basis.
   He recently renewed that call and added a new twist _ Jackson
named names.
   ``It's reasonable to expect that Sen. (Terry) Sanford will
endorse my campaign. That's a reasonable expectation,'' Jackson
said during an appearance in Greensboro, N.C.
   Sanford, who was elected to the Senate in 1986, is one of the
unpledged public officeholders who will attend the Democratic
National Convention as a ``super delegate.''
   Earlier in the campaign, Sanford backed Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr., who captured North Carolina on Super Tuesday. In the wake
of Gore's decision to suspend his campaign, Sanford moved into the
uncommitted ranks.
   ``He wants to enjoy his uncommitted status for a little bit,''
said Sanford's spokesman, Tom Lawton. Sanford chose not to comment
on Jackson's call for his support, Lawton said.
   Back in 1986, when Sanford sought the Democratic nomination for
the Senate seat, he did not have the backing of Jackson. Ted
Kinney, a black candidate seeking the Democratic nod, picked up
Jackson's endorsement instead.
   Kinney ``was not a serious candidate by any stretch of the
imagination,'' said Merle Black, a political science professor at
the University of North Carolina.
   In the general election, Sanford edged James T. Broyhill, 52
percent to 48 percent, with a major share of the black vote and
nearly half of the white vote _ about 45 percent.
   ``By the early '70s, the late '60s, the percentage of white
votes began dropping precipitously,'' said Larry Sabato, a
political science professor at the University of Virginia.
``Democrats don't need a majority (to win the election) thanks to
the black vote, but they need a healthy slice of the white vote.''
   Black says that in the South the white vote has become the swing
vote.
   ``The Achilles heel for Republicans is they get little support
from blacks so they have to get a landslide of whites. The
Republicans need a landslide to make it close,'' he said.
   The ability to capture a large share of the white swing vote,
combined with strong black support, made the difference for a
number of Southern senators elected in 1986.
   Wyche Fowler of Georgia has been elected for nine years to
represent the black majority fifth congressional district in his
state. In the general election, Fowler won his old district by
nearly a 2-to-1 margin but he also won the support of 4-out-of-10
white voters.
   Fowler, who also is a super delegate, remains uncommitted.
   Louisiana Senator John Breaux did well in the Cajun parishes but
also carried or finished even in the white Baptist parishes for his
1986 victory. Breaux also remains uncommitted.
   Not only did these candidates target the white swing vote, but
they had to battle the staunch white voters who refuse to support a
candidate who has the backing of black voters, according to
pollster Natalie Davis.
   ``It's hard to document but about one-fifth of the typically
Democratic voters will not back a candidate with black voters,''
Ms. Davis said. ``Democrats are caught perenially between a rock
and a hard place.''
   Some of these Southern senators who managed to capture both the
black vote and a large enough share of the white vote have decided
not to endorse a presidential candidate before the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, July 18-21.
   In fact, 11 of the 12 Southern senators who will be attending
the convention as super delegates have chosen the uncommitted
ranks. Only Bennett Johnston of Louisiana remains steadfast in his
support of Gore.
   Jackson has also hinted that his supporters might stay away from
the polls in November if they perceived that he was being treated
unfairly.
   ``We define our friends by their willingness to be fair and to
be just,'' Jackson said. ``One thing about politics, it does not go
up and down. It goes round and round. Anything that goes around
comes around.''
   Jackson's indication of possible party problems in the general
election presents a real dilemma for Democrats, who are treading
carefully on the issue.
   ``If Jackson is not treated well, there could be a low turnout
for the ticket,'' Black said. ``If it's not as high, they need a
larger share of the white vote.''

   Big Bird and scads of preschoolers are delighted
and Oscar the grouch is predictably unimpressed. Perhaps the only
ones nervous about Friday's ``wedding'' of Maria and Luis are the
creators of ``Sesame Street.''
   The marriage of two of the show's longtime characters represents
the first attempt by the public television program, now in its 19th
season, to show how romantic love works.
   Valeria Lovelace, the show's director of research, said the
staff found ``no books for preschoolers on love and marriage, only
death and divorce.''
   When interviews with 90 Manhattan preschoolers showed that young
children did not make the connection between love and marriage, the
general outline of the theme was born.
   ``We wanted the wedding to make that connection for them,'' said
Ms. Lovelace.
   The message has been carefully cultivated since last December,
when Maria and Luis, longtime friends and partners in the show's
Fix-It Shop, realized that their feelings were changing as they
cared for a sick kitten together.
   ``I saw them kiss,'' said Vicky Velasquez, a 4-year-old on a
Brooklyn playground full of chatter about the impending match. ``So
I know they're happy.''
   ``We thought, `What could we say to 3-year-olds about love?'''
said Sonia Manzano, who plays Maria and writes for the show. ``And
since kids see love in terms of physical things like kissing,
hugging, giving flowers, we showed Maria and Luis doing a lot of
that.''
   Dulcy Singer, executive producer, said Ms. Manzano, who was
married two years ago, inspired the wedding when she told her she
was thinking about having a baby. The show was actually taped last
January.
   Ms. Singer declined to say whether Maria and Luis, who is played
by Emilio Delgado, would have a child after the wedding.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Claim They Forced Vietnamese Into Interior</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrillas say they have
broken Vietnam's control of thousands of villages in Cambodia,
forcing Vietnam to send soldiers to defend the villages.
   The claim came in a Khmer Rouge radio broadcast in which
guerrilla Commander-in-Chief Son Sen reported on fighting from
October 1987 to April 1988, the region's dry season. A text of the
broadcast was obtained today.
   The communist Khmer Rouge, with about 30,000 guerrillas, is the
strongest of three groups opposing Vietnam's 9-year-old occupation
of Cambodia. Khmer Rouge claims are widely regarded as exaggerated.
   In the broadcast, a text of which was obtained today, the
guerrillas claimed they killed 11,200 Vietnamese soldiers and
``repeatedly attacked and dismantled or dispersed the Vietnamese
administrative networks in 4,033 villages and 236 communes and
attacked 23 townships and seven district towns.''
   Vietnam responded by transferring an important part of its
troops from the western battlefields bordering Thailand _ the
traditional area of fighting _ to the interior for village defense,
the broadcast said.
   That allowed the Khmer Rouge, who are based along the Thai
border, to infiltrate more men into the interior, it said.
   ``Therefore, the Vietnamese enemy's strategy to seal off the
western border of Cambodia and prevent the (Khmer Rouge) from
attacking it inside Cambodia suffered a total setback,'' the
broadcast said.
   A coalition of three Cambodian groups is fighting to drive out
the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1979 to drive out the Khmer
Rouge. The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people
during their 1975-79 reign of terror.
   The United States had assisted the republican side against the
Khmer Rouge during the 1973-75 civil war.

<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France today detonated its first
underground nuclear bomb this year in the South Pacific. New
Zealand protested the explosion and said it could not have happened
at a worse time.
   The 50-kiloton device, equivalent to 50,000 tons of dynamite,
went off at 5 a.m. at a nuclear test site on the French-controlled
Mururua Atoll, about one-third of the way between New Zealand and
the Central American coast.
   The explosion was the 92nd underground test there since France
abandoned atmospheric testing in 1975, said to Warwick Smith,
director of the New Zealand Seismological Observatory in Wellington.
   ``The New Zealand government will keep expressing its strong
concern about French nuclear testing whenever it occurs,'' said New
Zealand Foreign Mnister Russell Marshall. ``The timing could not be
worse.''
   The testing has strained France's relations with countries of
the South Pacific, which have declared the region a nuclear-free
zone.
   The French government in 1985 ordered the bombing of the
Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior to prevent the vessel from
leading a protest flotilla from the New Zealand harbor of Auckland
to the Mururua nuclear test site.
   French relations with New Zealand were severely strained by the
bombing, in which one crew member died. The two French agents
responsible for the attack were sentenced to exile on the Hao Atoll
in the South Pacific, but since have returned to France despite of
strong objections from New Zealand.

   The Soviet Embassy in London disclosed the death but gave no

   Philby, whose unmasking as a Soviet agent in 1963 rocked the
British establishment, was the notorious ``Third Man'' who tipped
off fellow spies Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess that they were
under investigation by British authorities. Philby fled to Moscow
that year and was later reported to be a highly regarded adviser to

survivor of a five-organ transplant, died Wednesday after an
infection caused her heart, kidneys and liver to fail.
   Tabatha received a new liver, small intestines, pancreas and
parts of a stomach and colon during a 15-hour experimental
operation that ended Nov. 1.
   The feisty little girl won the hearts of hospital staff with
good-natured teasing, playing peek-a-boo, giggling each day at
``Sesame Street'' and singing ``The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.''

   Pete Homer Sr., former chairman of the
Colorado River Indian Tribes and a movie actor, died Tuesday. He
was 83.
   Homer, a Mohave Indian, during his 1955-1964 chairmanship led
moves to solve land title problems, gained the tribes leasing
authority and water rights, and saw the annual family income rise
to $5,000 from $164.
   He worked for the Bureau of Reclamation for 21 years and for the
Bureau of Indian Affairs for eight years. After retiring, he served
on the Senate Indian Policy Committee, the National Indian Safety
Council, the National Congress of American Indians, the governor's
advisory council on vocational rehabilitation and the Committee on
Indian Affairs in Arizona.
   His movie career began at Paramount Pictures, where he was known
as Chief Lightfoot and appeared in ``Annie Oakley'' with Barbara
Stanwyck. He appeared with stars like Tony Curtis, Jeanette
MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.

<HEAD>Panel Finds Safety Lacking in Biological Weapons Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has ``serious deficiencies'' in
the way it manages the safety of its research programs into
chemical and biological warfare, a Senate subcommittee's staff
report maintains.
   The review found ``inadequate regulations, lax safety
enforcement and documented safety lapses,'' said the report by the
majority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs oversight
subcommittee.
   The study, released Wednesday, noted that it did not examine
``the current safety practices of particular facilities conducting
... research. Nor does it reach final conclusions as to whether ...
research is being conducted in a safe manner.''
   Air Force Maj. Randy Morger, a Pentagon spokesman, said today
that Defense Department officials hadn't seen the report. ``We need
to look at it carefully, but we're greatly concerned when there are
questions from any corner about possible safety issues in programs
overseen by the Department of Defense.''
   The United States recently began building new chemical weapons,
after halting the program in 1969. The nation produces no germ
weapons and has unilaterally renounced the use of biological
weapons, but does conduct research into chemical weapons that might
be used against American troops.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, said he
plans to hold hearings later this year to discuss the Pentagon's
safety practices in the two research fields.
   The study noted that U.S. spending on the programs has increased
sharply during President Reagan's two terms, from about $63 million
in 1980 to $348 million in 1986.
   The number of laboratories involved in research has also
increased, the study found. There are about 150 labs doing
Pentagon-sponsored research in chemical and germ weapons.
   The subcommittee staff said it was ``unable to locate a
comprehensive safety program ... , that is, a readily identifiable
set of safety regulations and an office with overall safety
responsibilities.
   In the biological weapons area, the review found that ``there is
no comprehensive set of safety regulations for research'' with
biological warfare agents and toxins, ``no emphasis on safety in
the contractor program and no office that monitors contractor
safety.''
   For chemical weapons, the approach is better, although it also
``appears to have major shortcomings,'' the study said. The
military has a wide number of safety steps, but many are violated,
the study said.

<TEXT>
   A women's bowling league has sued a country club
for sex discrimination over cancellation of its bowling night by a
bowling alley manager who allegedly said women don't drink enough
alcohol.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in Macomb County Circuit Court by the
American Civil Liberties Union, asks that the Clinton Township
league of 60 bowlers be allowed to retain the Wednesday night time
slot it has held for four years.
   Officials of Fern Hill Country Club booted the women from the
slot in March, saying the women don't drink enough alcohol,
reducing revenues for the club, according to the suit. The time
slot has been filled by a men's league.
   Bowling alley Manager Jimmy Walker said Wednesday he doesn't
remember making the remark about the cancellation at a league
banquet.
   Fern Hill co-owner Fred Severini Jr. denied that less drinking
was the reason for the change and said the women had refused a
bowling alley offer to return next fall to the same time slot.
   However, state ACLU executive director Howard Simon called
Severini's statement ``an outright falsehood.''

   A rare spotted redshank that drew bird
watchers to Lake Perry last week apparently has flown the coop. But
the news is not all bad for ornithologists.
   A olivaceous cormorant, a Gulf bird seen in Louisiana and Texas
but uncommon to Kansas, was recently spotted in the area, said
Richard Rucker, a ranger for the Army Corps of Engineers at Lake
Perry.
   The big one got away, however. The spotted redshank, a
Euro-Asian bird that is one of the few black sandpipers, was first
spotted at the lake May 1.
   Rucker, who last saw the bird Saturday, believes it may have
left the area that night. ``We did get a change of birds between
Saturday night and Sunday morning,'' he said Wednesday.
   One experienced bird watcher spent four hours at the lake Sunday
hoping for a glimpse of the rare bird and left disappointed, Rucker
said.

<HEAD>Moscow News Paints Sympathetic Portrait of the Sakharovs at Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly
sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner,
countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as
traitors by the state-run media.
   But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the
nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for
criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that
topic is still too sensitive.
   In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page to
describing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel Peace
Prize winner, and said the words most often heard in his
seventh-floor Moscow apartment are ``help me.''
   Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca
for Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to
return from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.
   Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of his
nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberation
of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of
human rights.
   Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Soviet
leader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and said
the couple lived in ``oriental luxury'' amid ``scandals between
spouses.''
   Moscow News depicted the couple as living peacefully and
frugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes, and other simple
fare, and marveled that Sakharov, a member of the prestigious
Academy of Sciences, always does the dishes himself.
   While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the
author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and
scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News
said.
   ``Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed
that he write an apology for all the lies that were published,''
the paper said.
   It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharov
said, ``It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times,'' and
slapped him.
   Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since
his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the
longest devoted to him so far.
   But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign
tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see
the Sakharov article. As well as appearing in Russian, Moscow News
also prints editions in English, French and other languages.

   A 15-year-old student was arrested for putting
ammonia into a glass of iced tea his teacher left in a classroom,
police said.
   Jerome Felton, a ninth-grader at Booker T. Washington Junior
High School, was arrested Wednesday at school and charged with
poisoning and aggravated assault, both felonies, said detective
Julio Moreiras.
   Sue Niles, 40, whose mouth, throat and esophagus were burned,
was hospitalized but received no serious injury.
   Ms. Niles said she left the classroom April 22 where Felton was
with two other students to go to the bathroom and returned five
minutes later. She said she had a glass of iced tea near her desk
that was about a quarter full.
   ``I just took a big gulp,'' she said. ``I realized it was
bitter. It felt like my mouth was on fire. I knew something was
wrong.''
   Niles, who is in charge of the school's detention program, said
Felton was upset at being put on indoor suspension for cutting
classes.
   Moreiras said the teen denies he poured the ammonia in the tea.
He is in the custody of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   If tried as an adult, the youth could get a maximum sentence of
45 years in prison, Moreiras said.

<TEXT>
   Train crewmen involved in a fiery Conrail crash
suffered from lack of sleep and could have unwittingly dozed off
while still performing basic duties, an expert on work schedules
said today.
   Donald I. Tepas, an industrial psychologist from the University
of Connecticut, reviewed the six men's hours for the National
Transportation Safety Board investigation into the Jan. 14 accident.
   Two Conrail trains, one hauling coal and the other hauling
trailer-vans, smashed head-on at Thompsontown, killing the engineer
and the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives.
Damage was estimated at $5 million.
   ``After examining the work schedules of the crew members
involved in the Thompsontown accident, I'm quite comfortable in
concluding that many or all of the crew members involved were
suffering from chronic sleep deprivation,'' Tepas said in remarks
prepared for an NTSB hearing today.
   ``A normal manifestation of this state is brief or extended
periods of sleep, some of which workers themselves may not be aware
of.''
   During such periods, he said, people can react to signals
presented to them.
   The industrial psychologist blamed erratic work schedules;
harsh, monotonous work environments, and a failure to instruct
workers in dealing with fatigue.
   ``Given current approaches to rail operations and the use of
human resources, there is little doubt in my mind that rail crews
often fall asleep on the job,'' he said.
   During the opening day of testimony Wednesday, neither of the
two survivors said they received any warning before the head-on
collision or saw or heard the other train approaching.
   Donald L. Hull, conductor on the train carrying the
trailer-vans, testified the accident occurred when a dispatcher
switched his train to another track before receiving a signal that
the coal train had stopped.
   Hull, a 35-year Conrail veteran, said there are no strict rules
for the dispatcher to go by.
   James Nearhoof, the dispatcher, testified that he had perceived
no indication that one of the trains had gone through a stop signal.
   Jerry L. Haselbarth, 33, the conductor of the coal train, said
he received a report from Rockville Police on the day of the wreck
that the train's rear brakes were sticking. He then stopped the
train and corrected the situation.
   Shortly before the accident, Hull said he felt the train
decelerate rapidly, but he does not remember anyone applying the
emergency brakes.
   Hull said he then saw the brakeman on his train, Charles S.
DeSantis, fall from the lead locomotive.
   ``I knew something was wrong,'' he said. ``It all happened so
fast, it didn't register that we were hitting anyone. I thought
everything was caving in. I was just holding on.''
   Toxicology tests showed a small amount of marijuana present in
Haselbarth's urine, but he testified he was not under the influence
of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash.
   Throughout the hearing, questions arose on the amount of sleep
rail workers get before they must report for duty.
   Hull reported that he had had about 4{ hours of sleep before
beginning his shift on the day of the accident.
   Haselbarth said he thought he had slept for just one or two
hours the night before he reported to work for the fatal run, but
added he felt rested from the previous night's sleep.
   ``The railroad has complete, 100 percent control of your life.
You don't,'' he said.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say Just One-Quarter of Immigrants Appealing Amnesty
Denials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of public interest lawyers say they
are alarmed that only one-quarter of the illegal aliens whose
amnesty applications have been denied are filing appeals.
   Many of the rejected applicants may be confused by the letters
of denial from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, attorney
Susan Alva said Wednesday.
   ``These denial letters are three pages, all in English,'' said
Ms. Alva, an attorney with the Public Counsel, an organization
financed by the Los Angeles County and Beverly Hills bar
associations. ``For many immigrants, they're just about impossible
to understand.''
   But Joe Thomas, director of the INS regional processing facility
in Laguna Niguel, said many of those denied amnesty under the 1986
immigration reform act may be choosing not to appeal because they
realize they will not succeed. The deadline for seeking amnesty was
midnight May 4.
   Many denials were issued because applicants were ineligible,
disqualified by criminal records or because of fraudulent
applications, he said. To qualify, illegal aliens had to prove that
they had lived in the United States continuously beginning Jan. 1,
1982.
   As of May 7, 4,047 denials had been sent to amnesty applicants
in the agency's Western region, which includes California, Nevada,
Hawaii, Arizona and Guam. Of those, 1,001 have appealed.
   Those rejected have just 30 days to appeal, a process that costs
$50.
   Federal officials argued the applicants were able to fill out
English applications and should be able to deal with denial letters
in English.
   ``They've been treated fairly,'' said William S. King Jr.,
director of immigration reform for the Western region.
   ``If they (amnesty applicants) have a problem with
interpretation of their denials, they can get help from the same
people who helped them file their applications,'' he said.

   Police said today
American actor George Rose was clubbed to death by his 18-year-old
adopted son and three other men this month and that cocaine was
found on his body.
   Police spokesman Col. Aquiles Pimentel Cruz said at a news
conference that the four men were charged with murder in the
68-year-old Rose's death. He presented three of them to reporters
and said the fourth had not been arrested.
   Pimentel Cruz did not say how much of the drug was found on
Rose's body.
   The three suspects told reporters they had killed Rose, who was
found dead in his car May 5.
   A pathologists' report released Monday said Rose had died
accidentally of head injuries suffered when his speeding car ran
off a road near the Caribbean resort of Sosua and fell into a
ditch, flipping over several times.
   Rose, a British-born U.S. citizen who won two Tony awards, owned
a beach home just outside Sosua, about 15 miles east of Puerto
Plata.
   There was no immediate comment on the discrepancy between the
autopsy finding and the police report, but the pathologists
scheduled a news conference for later in the day.
   Pimentel Cruz identified Rose's adopted son as Domingo Antonio
Ralfe Vazquez, nicknamed ``Juan.'' Also charged was the young man's
natural father, Juan Antonio Vazquez Padilla, and another relative,
Maximo Padilla Vazquez. He did not identify the fourth man.
   The autopsy was conducted after Juan asked police to investigate
the actor's death.
   Rose won Tony awards for his Broadway roles in ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' and ``My Fair Lady.''
   He was a versatile actor who was as much at home playing
Shakespeare as he was in a comedy or a musical. He preferred the
stage, but also appeared in scores of film and television
productions.
   Rose had lived in New York City since 1961.

   Five people trying to cash in on gold
fever were arrested today on charges of running a treasure-hunting
scam that fleeced $1.7 million from 700 investors, state officials
said.
   ``This was a treasure salvage company, but the only treasure
found was the money that was taken from the pockets of investors,''
said state Comptroller Gerald Lewis.
   He announced the arrests at a joint news conference with
Statewide Proscutor Peter Antonacci and Commissioner Tim Moore of
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, whose offices helped in
the probe.
   Lewis said the three agencies also are investigating as many as
15 other treasure-hunting operations seeking investors with
``treasure fever.'' Most of the operations are in Florida, but a
few are out of state.
   Most of those under investigation have been trading on the
success of treasure hunter Mel Fisher, whose find of the Spanish
galleon Nuestra Senora de Atocha was worth hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   ``In this case, the people bought a ship from Mel Fisher and
they bought apparently a small amount of treasure so they could
show this and use it and use Mel Fisher's name,'' Lewis said.
   Arrested and charged with multiple counts of fraud, securities
fraud, sale of unregistered securities and racketeering were Jack
R. Donovan, 43, of Deltona; Donald R. Durant, 69, of New Orleans;
Allen C. Jones, 41, and his wife, Elizabeth Jones, 39, of Orlando,
and Ernest Rice, 64, also of Orlando.
   They were indicted May 5 by a grand jury. The indictment states
the alleged scam involved Donovan's Tesoro USA, Jones' Tesoro Ltd.
and World Treasure Finders Inc.
   Lewis said the operators claimed they found three wrecks and
that treasure would be sold to a museum in Orlando, none of which
was true.
   At its very best, treasure-hunting is a risky business, Lewis
said. He pointed out that it took Fisher years to find his fortune,
and his son and daughter-in-law were killed during the effort.
   ``Frankly, in my opinion, if a person wants to do this they'd be
better off getting a boat, going out in the water, taking their
money (and) throwing it overboard,'' Lewis said.
   ``They're as likely to have that turn into treasure, pop back up
to the surface, as they are investing in one of these bogus
operations,'' he said. ``And they'll come out actually a little bit
better because they would have had a nice boat ride in the
process.''

   A geology professor demonstrating an
instrument for measuring radioactivity to a high school class
accidentally found a long-abandoned canister containing radium,
officials said.
   The canister posed little danger, and no injuries were reported,
said Al Warlick, director of public affairs for the state Division
of Crime Control and Public Safety.
   The canister was discovered Tuesday when geologist John
Callahan, who had shown a science class how a Geiger counter
reacted to uranium rocks and put the instrument against the
classroom wall to show normal readings. Instead of remaining
silent, the device went off.
   Behind the wall was a storeroom where officials found a canister
marked ``Army Corps of Engineers'' and dated 1944.
   The canister had apparently been on a shelf since the school
opened in 1965, Watauga High School principal Jim Day said. It was
bought along with three boxes of other scientific instruments more
than 20 years ago by a teacher, he said.
   The device, which contained a small amount of radium, was used
for checking the moisture in soil; state radiation experts said it
was probably used before building roads.
   A team of physicists from the state examined the device, Warlick
said. It was to be analyzed later this week to determine how to
dispose of it.
   Warlick said his office received numerous telephone calls
Wednesday from news media representatives who heard rumors that a
nuclear accident had occurred.

   Americans have become more casual about
cholesterol and good nutrition in general, according to a
Prevention magazine survey issued today that shows a decline in
health practices for the first time in five years.
   ``We don't know whether this year's score represents a temporary
setback on the way to further progress or whether it is an early
warning sign,'' said Thomas Dybdahl, director of the private
publication's so-called prevention index.
   The 1988 score is 64.8 out of a possible 100 _ down from 65.2
last year, but still 3.3 points above 1984, when the first index
was compiled.
   The latest sampling found that more Americans are using smoke
detectors and getting strenuous exercise, but falling behind in the
area of good nutrition.
   For example, the number saying they are making efforts to limit
high-cholesterol foods fell from 46 percent in the 1987 report to
42 percent and there also was a four-point decline in the number
who said they make an effort to get adequate vitamins and minerals
_ from 63 percent to 59 percent.
   ``One clear message from this year's survey is that the spread
of good health habits is not automatic,'' Dybdahl said at a news
conference.
   ``People may know more than ever about good health, but they may
not be acting on what they know. In key areas such as diet,
exercise and weight control, there is still much room for
improvement.''
   Dr. James Michael McGinnis, director of the federal government's
Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, said the survey
is the only one to track the same data over a five-year period.
   The sharpest gains from the 1984 report were the 57 percent who
reported wearing seat belts now compared with 19 percent then and
the 82 percent who say they have a smoke detector in their home
compared with 67 percent then.
   The biggest drop was in those who said they obey the speed limit
_ from 61 percent in 1984 to 55 percent.
   The Emmaus, Pa.-based magazine has retained Louis Harris &
Associates for the past five years to poll Americans on their
practices in 21 health-related areas ranging from not smoking to
exercising to using a smoke detector in the home and wearing auto
seat belts.
   The same questions have been asked each year to give an accurate
year-to-year comparison and relative weights assigned to each of
the 21 areas. For example, not smoking is assigned the highest
ranking _ a 9.78 on a scale of one-to-10.
   The current year's report was based on telephone interviews
conducted with 1,250 randomly selected adults Nov. 11-25. Humphrey
Taylor, president of Louis Harris and Associates, acknowledged the
survey's 3 percent margin of error could call into question
year-to-year changes that are within that margin.
   Taylor said, however, that the theoretical chance for error is
largely overriden because consistent trends tracked over the
five-year sampling period give added credence to the figures
reported in any one year.

   A fire that gutted the top floor of the
building where the Louisiana Purchase was signed in 1803 was
apparently touched off by workers doing repair work, a fire
official said today.
   Wednesday's fire, which raged out of control for two hours,
destroyed or damaged priceless artifacts and threatened the
nation's oldest Roman Catholic cathedral next door.
   The blaze destroyed 18th century French furniture stored in the
upper floor and consumed the cupola atop the three-story Cabildo, a
Spanish-style gray stucco building with a slate roof, officials
said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Fire Chief William McCrossen said today that workers repairing
the roof and waterproofing the stucco walls apparently touched off
the fire. ``We think it's tied up to the restoration,'' he said.
   There was speculation that a soldering iron, used in repairing
metal flashing, touched off timbers that originally came down the
Mississippi River as flatboats. The mansard roof and the top floor
were added in 1847 using timbers salvaged from the river barges.
   ``There's all the cultural heritage of Louisiana in that
building. It makes me want to cry,'' said James F. Sefcik, museum
director of the 193-year-old landmark in New Orleans' French
Quarter.
   Smoke and water stained and soaked contents of the first and
second floors, where paintings, tapestries, doll and fan
collections, Mardi Gras memorabilia, pottery and other items were
on display, officials said.
   ``Next to Independence Hall in Philadelphia, this is the most
historic building in America,'' said Sam Wilson, a New Orleans
architect who renovated the Cabildo's interior 20 years ago.
   The cause of the fire remained uncertain, but Wilson said the
building remained structurally sound and could be repaired.
   An estimate of damages was not immediately available. The
building alone was assessed at $50 million and is insured, said
Sefcik.
   ``Every painting, every artifact suffered some water or smoke
damage,'' Sefcik said.
   France and the United States signed the Louisiana Purchase
inside the three-story building in 1803. It also was the repository
for a death mask of Napoleon and other priceless antiques and
artifacts. The bronze death mask was saved.
   The Marquis de Lafayette stayed at the Cabildo as a guest, and
Pierre Lafitte, brother of the notorious buccaneer Jean Lafitte,
was jailed there for smuggling.
   Firefighters managed to keep the flames from spreading to the
adjacent St. Louis Cathedral, which remained undamaged except for
some melted copper on the outside.
   Built in 1794, St. Louis Cathedral is the oldest active Roman
Catholic cathedral in the United States. Pope John Paul II
celebrated Mass there when he visited New Orleans last September.
   The Cabildo was built a year later and served as the seat of
Louisiana territorial government for France, Spain, the Confederacy
and the United States. The building, which has been used as a
museum since World War I, was closed recently to tourists because
of exterior renovations.

   The Vatican today said it was shocked at
what Paraguay's decision to cancel a meeting between Pope John Paul
II and an opposition political group next week.
   The chief Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, said the action
announced Wednesday by Paraguayan President Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner, Latin America's longest-ruling military chief, hindered
``the exercise of the pastoral mission of the Holy Father.''
   Stroessner cited grounds of security for canceling the meeting,
scheduled for Tuesday in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion. He
also charged the group would use a religious encounter for
political ends.
   The group, called Constructors of Society, has about 350 members
and includes politicians, peasant farmers, Catholic laymen and
lawyers.
   It was the first time in John Paul's 37 trips abroad that a
foreign statesman interfered with his schedule. But the church in
Paraguay said it would try to switch the meeting site from a
government-controlled site to one under direct church control.
   This morning, John Paul traveled from Cochabamba in central
Bolivia, to Sucre, another centrally located city, known for its
Spanish-colonial architecture and its many churches.
   Crowds lined five deep to welcome the pope along a 2{-mile
motorcade on a clear, mild day. Greeting John Paul in this
university city 9,150 feet above sea level was 88-year-old
German-born Cardinal Jose Clemente Maurer, the retired archbishop
of Sucre and this country's only cleric of cardinal rank.
   In his homily at an open-air Mass, the pope praised European
missionaries who have worked in Bolivia for nearly 500 years,
saying they have strived to maintain the cultural identity of the
Bolivian people, who are mostly of native Indian descent.
   On Wednesday night, John Paul addressed 22,000 young people
gathered in a soccer stadium in Cochabamba, gateway to a large
cocaine-producing region.
   Bolivia is a major source of the refined cocaine that reaches
the United States and Bolivians themselves are becoming addicts in
increasing numbers.
   The pope, dressed in a red cape and white scullcap, first warned
against Marxism, then told his audience to avoid the temptation of
easy riches through drug trafficking.
   ``Be alert not to be seduced by doctrines that try to justify
violence and hate, that reduce members of the human family to
simple factors of historical evolution and that place them in a
class struggle,'' he said.
   He went on, ``Do not fall either into that selfish and false
flight of seeking irrational satisfaction of appetites: abuse of
alcohol, drugs, the absence of all moral norms in sexual conduct
and the temptation of easy riches through drug trafficking.''
   The youths cheered and applauded and waved Vatican and Bolivian
flags.
   The pope clearly enjoyed the youth rally, where he was greeted
by native folk dances and songs. The young people lighted candles
in the gathering darkness and sang ``Happy Birthday to You.'' John
Paul will be 68 on May 18.
   ``Muchas gracias,'' the beaming pontiff said. ``This was one of
the most beautiful ceremonies I've ever seen.''
   Paraguay, whose military regime has been in office since 1954,
is the last country the pontiff is to visit on his 12-day,
four-country tour.
   Paraguay and Chile have the only remaining military regimes in
South America. An open-air Mass in Chile, which the pope visited in
1987, flared into a riot between police and foes of President
Augusto Pinochet.

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators today reached
agreement on all the technical issues that caused the Senate to
postpone debate on a nuclear missile treaty before the Moscow
summit, a senior U.S. official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Reagan Administration would report the results of Secretary of
State George P. Shultz's meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze to the Senate on Friday.
   The negotiators had disagreed over monitoring compliance with
the treaty to scrap all American and Soviet medium- and
shorter-range missiles. President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev signed the accord last Dec. 8.
   It was not known whether the Senate would accept the agreement
worked out over two days in Geneva. Shultz already has predicted
further problems might arise in carrying out an unprecedented
arrangement for on-site inspection of U.S. and Soviet missile
plants and bases.
   He refused to criticize the Soviets, as some senators had done,
and suggested the difficulties were the logical outcome of
grappling with new verification procedures.
   Shultz flies to Brussels on Friday to report to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization on his talks.
   The dispute over how far American inspectors may go and what
they may look at caused the U.S. Senate on Monday to postpone
consideration of the treaty. The Moscow summit is scheduled for May
29-June 2.
   While Shultz and Shevardnadze discussed the Middle East, the
Iran-Iraq war and other regional issues, their senior arms control
advisers worked on the technical issues.
   Maynard Glitman, who negotiated the Intermediate Nuclear Forces,
or INF treaty, led the U.S. team. Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, an
arms control expert of the Soviet armed forces, headed the Soviet
delegation.
   The arms-control specialists reportedly reached a tentative
agreement on the verification issues Wednesday night.
   On Wednesday, the two ministers held ``very businesslike and
constructive talks'' and made progress ``in some areas,'' State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said. The two met twice, in the
afternoon and evening.
   One of their first tasks was to instruct their arms control
negotiators to conduct separate talks to try to resolve outstanding
issues.
   The Senate had been due to begin debate on the treaty this week,
but postponed it indefinitely after the disputes arose.
   Two principal stumbling blocks reportedly were among the issues
settled Wednesday. One deals with U.S. demands to inspect Soviet
missile containers big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket. The
other involves how much access U.S. inspectors will have to Soviet
missile plants and bases.
   In another sign of progress, the two sides agreed on Wednesday
to exchange notes on futuristic weapons. The aim is to persuade
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and other critics that the ban would apply to
intermediate-range weapons that have not been developed yet.
   The two sides also discussed prospects for a treaty reducing
intercontinental nuclear forces, in a group headed by presidential
arms control adviser Paul Nitze and chief Soviet arms control
negotiatior Alexei Obukhov.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze centered their talks Wednesday on
scheduling and logistical arrangements for the summit. The two men
also discussed human rights on Wednesday, Redman said, but he did
not provide details.
   The pact on intermediate-range missiles is unprecedented in its
provisions for on-site inspection to guard against infractions. It
also is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entire
category of nuclear weapons.
   Under its provisions, the Soviets would destroy 683 missiles and
the Americans 364 _ all their rockets with ranges of 315 to 3,125
miles.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
has appointed Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan to coordinate the
international relief effort for the return of Afghan refugees under
an accord signed in Geneva.
   Sadruddin, appointed Tuesday, is the son of the late Aga Kahn
III and uncle of the current Aga Khan IV. The Aga Khan is spiritual
leader of the world's 15 million Ismaili Moslems.
   Sadruddin, 55, was U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees from 1965
to 1977. He will hold the rank of under secretary-general.
   The United Nations has not divulged details of the massive
program which he will oversee. His salary was not reported.
   The United Nations mediated an agreement between Afghanistan and
Pakistan providing for the nine-month withdrawal of 115,000 Soviet
troops from Afghanistan beginning Sunday. It also provides for the
return of 5 million Afghan refugees, 3 million of them in Pakistan
and 2 million in Iran.
   Sadruddin was born in Paris to a family known for formidable
wealth and philanthropy. He is of Iranian origin and lives in
Switzerland.
   Sadruddin Khan was graduated from Harvard University in 1954 and
did postgraduate work at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at
Harvard until 1957.
   In 1958 he was a special consultant to the United Nations
Educational, Social and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He was
active in the preservation of Nubian monuments.
   As commissioner for refugees, Sadruddin oversaw operations to
help displaced persons in Bangladesh, Uganda, Sudan, Chile and
Cyprus.
   Since 1983 he has been co-chairman of the Independent Commission
on International Humanitarian Issues.

   An American Airlines Boeing 727 lost
cabin pressure and had to make an unscheduled landing because of a
15-inch crack in the fuselage, an airline spokesman said today.
   The cause of the crack, near the right wheel well, could take
several weeks of study to determine, said American spokesman Steve
McGregor. The incident occurred Monday, and Federal investigators
examined the plane Wednesday.
   A Boeing 737 lost the top of its fuselage less than two weeks
ago over Hawaii, but McGregor said the incidents were not related.
   American Flight 984, with 105 passengers and seven crew members,
was en route Monday from Chicago to Philadelphia when it suddenly
lost cabin pressure.
   Cabin oxygen masks were deployed automatically before the
landing. There were no injuries and no apparent disruption at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, Mich., after the landing,
officials said. No emergency was declared during the landing,
McGregor said.
   The aircraft was flown to American's maintenance center in
Tulsa, Okla., and investigators from the Federal Aviation
Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were
called in.
   ``An investigator has obtained the portion of the aircraft with
a crack in it and has sent it to our metallurgical lab here in
Washington, and it is being examined by our lab people,'' NTSB
spokesman Alan Pollock said today in Washington.
   He said investigators would try to determine whether the crack
was due by metal fatigue or some other cause, such as an impact on
the fuselage.
   He declined to say whether the crack could have been hazardous
to the aircraft and its passengers.
   After the federal inspection, American replaced the cracked
fuselage section and was testing the repaired jet today, McGregor
said.
   McGregor said the plane had made 39,983 takeoffs and landings,
and ``for a 727, that's not a high number of cycles.''
   The problem occurred less than two weeks after a 19-year-old
Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 lost part of its upper fuselage while
flying over Hawaii, killing a flight attendant and injuring 61
passengers and crew members. The cause was suspected to be
structural failure.
   But McGregor discounted the similarity between the two incidents.
   ``What happened to our jet was in no way related to what
happened in Hawaii,'' he said.

   The Senate today voted down an effort to ban
most U.S. underground nuclear testing, rejecting claims by
supporters of the ban that it would help stem the atomic arms race.
   The chamber voted 57-39 to kill the proposed ban as it worked
through a Pentagon budget bill.
   ``We must maintain unquestionable confidence in our nuclear
deterrent and our experts tell us that this requires continued
testing,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-N.C., a chief opponent.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., the sponsor of the ban, said, ``no
other issue addresses so clearly the runaway technology which is
the lifeblood of the arms race.''
   The House has approved an underground test ban in its version of
the defense bill, meaning the issue will have to be resolved by a
House-Senate conference committee that will resolve differences
between the two measures.
   The House passed its defense bill Wednesday and the chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee said the U.S. military is
``stronger and more capable'' now than when President Reagan took
office, despite Reagan's recurring complaints about not getting
enough money for the Pentagon.
   ``By almost any measure, our armed services are better than they
were in 1981,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis. ``The most dramatic
increase is the quality of people, which is much, much better.''
   Aspin commented shortly after the House voted 252-172 for a
Pentagon budget, which will be the last defense budget of Reagan's
eight-year presidency.
   House approval split along party lines, with majority Democrats
supporting the bill and Republicans opposing it. Reagan didn't like
it either, joining complaints by House Republicans that the bill
unfairly restricts his arms control policies and Star Wars program.
   The House measure bans Star Wars tests that violate the
so-called ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty, and bars the purchase of any nuclear weapons that
violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear
arms treaty.
   The Senate, by a 51-45 margin, rejected an attempt Wednesday to
add the SALT II restriction to its defense bill.
   Reagan opposes both restrictions and is also unhappy with the
$3.5 billion approved by the House for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The Senate voted
Wednesday for $4.6 billion.
   Reagan wanted $4.8 billion for Star Wars next year, compared
with the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion.
   Aspin said he couldn't understand the presidential complaints.
``I don't believe the president has any reason to be upset. I think
it's a good bill. We gave the president a lot of what he wanted.''
   Both the House and Senate bills authorize $299.5 billion worth
of defense spending in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a slight
reduction from the current $300 billion Pentagon budget.
   The measures would essentially freeze defense spending for a
fourth straight year, following four large annual increases in
Reagan's first term.
   No increases are likely in the future, Aspin predicted. ``I
would guess that you're looking at perhaps a freeze, or maybe a
decline of 1 or 2 percent, for the foreseeable future, which is the
next three or four years, no matter who is elected president.''
   Several factors will contribute to the reluctance to increase
defense budgets, said Aspin. ``First, there are the worries about
the federal budget deficit. Then second, you have the fact that the
Soviets appear to the American public to be less threatening under
Mikhail Gorbachev, so there's less a push because of fear.
   ``You also have the fact that there are other fears, like
drugs,'' he said, noting that the House bill orders Reagan to use
the U.S. military in the fight against illegal drug smuggling.
   ``In addition, there is a growing perception that national
security depends on other things than simply military might, that
it needs to include economic strength,'' he said.
   While the House measure restricts Reagan's arms control policies
and Star Wars, it granted his proposals for a vast variety of
weapons.
   That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets,
42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new Navy destroyers, two
more attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the first
of the new ``Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks.
   The Senate decision on Star Wars came as the chamber voted 50-48
against a deep reduction in the 5-year-old program.
   That vote defeated a proposal by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
to reduce the SDI budget to about $3.8 billion and devote the extra
$750 million to the space shuttle and a space station.

   Bank customers with loans pegged to the prime
rate are about to feel the impact of the rising cost of money, but
economists say a big increase in interest rates is unlikely this
year.
   The first spike in the prime rate since the October stock market
crash was announced Wednesday by major banks. The rise from 8.5
percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans for
purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars.
   The prime rate reflects the banks' costs of borrowing money and
trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rate
is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for
calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of
fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular
home-equity loans.
   Stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise, partly because it
renewed memories of the higher interest rates that preceded the
stock market crash. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.80
points to a three-month low of 1,965.85.
   The widely watched index partly recovered by late this morning,
up nearly 10 points to the 1,976 level. In the bond market, a
sensitive barometer of interest rates, prices were little changed.
   Many economists said they didn't believe interest rates would
rise much further, largely because the economy could stumble badly
if borrowing costs increased substantially.
   These economists argue that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, a Reagan administration appointee who has wide power to
influence interest rates, doesn't want to make any sudden move to
tighten credit, especially in an election year.
   But the Fed also wants to heed inflationary warning signs that
have appeared, notably a 14-year low in the unemployment rate
reported last week by the Labor Department.
   ``It wants to tap the brakes a little bit rather than slam them
on in a great fury,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko
Securities International Inc. in New York.
   John Wilson, chief economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco, said ``clearly, we're on an upward move in interest
rates and they'll continue to move upward. But I think they'll
flatten out.''
   David Blitzer, chief economist for Standard & Poor's Corp., the
investment research and credit-rating concern, said he believed the
prime rate would stay at 9 percent, perhaps moving to 9.5 percent
by June.
   But Blitzer said he didn't believe the Fed would move to nudge
rates much higher than they are now.
   ``I think this year, the Fed wants to keep the economy
growing,'' he said. The Fed injected billions of dollars in
reserves into the banking system after the October crash to
forestall a possible recession. But in recent months, evidence of
surprisingly strong economic growth has shifted concern to rising
inflation.
   This concern has been most evident in the bond market, where
interest rates have been rising in anticipation that the Fed would
tighten its credit policies. Economists say it's clear the Fed has
moved recently to nudge interest rates higher by controlling the
amount of money in the banking system.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, a
Washington-based forecasting firm, said the prime rate increase
would have a broader impact on consumers now than in years past
because it no longer is simply a benchmark for loans to bank
corporate customers.
   ``Once upon a time, the impact would have been limited,'' she
said. ``But now, because of the increased use of home-equity loans
and other adjustable rates, even people who have current debt
outstanding, they feel the effects. Their financing costs rise. It
squeezes their discretionary spending in general.''

   Officials in two cities have opposed the
release of a former convict termed dangerous by state prison
officials and a Texas prosecutor.
   The reports about Robert E. Kleasen, 55, have produced an outcry
in Buffalo, his hometown, and in Rochester, where parole officials
first tried to place him.
xecutive Dennis Gorski said he will seek a court
order to have Kleasen removed from the county or put ``in a
c   Erie County Eontrolled atmosphere.''
   David Jay, Kleasen's lawyer, maintained his client should be
allowed to return to the community like any former convict who has
served his sentence.
   Kleasen was conditionally released for good behavior after
serving one-third of a 7{-year state prison term.
   In a California case, officials were unable to find a place to
parole a man who had raped and mutilated a teen-age girl; Lawrence
Singleton had to live on state prison grounds during his parole.
   Kleasen told reporters Wednesday at the non-denominational City
Mission here that he would leave Buffalo immediately if he can find
a job elsewhere and get the approval of parole officials.

averaged $7.57 per bushel, a record until 1983 when the price went
to $7.83.

   China, the world's leading hog producer, has
ended pork rationing, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   ``A Chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork
rationing in Beijing had stopped being enforced,'' the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service said Wednesday. ``Other officials said
that pork rationing had ended throughout the country, though no
official announcement has confirmed this.''
   China began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in
response to shortages. Pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent
of the total animal protein in the Chinese diet.
   ``The pork shortages that led to the rationing did not, however,
affect China's ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets
(primarily Hong Kong),'' the report said. ``In fact, the country
has had a surplus of hogs for export to Hong Kong, but increases in
hog trade between the two countries has been limited by a Chinese
export quota.''
   An end to rationing ``shows that Chinese agricultural officials
believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved'' as
producers respond to lower feed prices, higher pork prices and
government incentives to promote larger production, the report said.
   ``It also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing
to pay more for the higher-quality, free market pork instead of
enduring the cheaper, fattier meat that has been sold at lower
prices in state markets,'' the report said.
   A USDA study last year showed that China had a 1983 year-end
inventory of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million in the
United States.
   But with more than five times the number of hogs, China's pork
production was less than double the U.S. output _ 13.2 million
metric tons to 7.6 million tons, the USDA study said. A metric ton
is about 2,205 pounds.
   The reason: It took only six months for an American farmer to
raise a 243-pound hog ready for slaughter, while a newborn Chinese
pig can take from eight to 18 months to reach a comparable
slaughter weight.
   Also, the study said, the average U.S. hog will produce a
dressed-out carcass of about 173 pounds, compared with the Chinese
carcass of about 140 pounds.

<HEAD>Communist Leadership Offers Resignation Over Poor Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entire 11-member politburo of
Finland's Communist Party offered to resign after the party
treasury lost an estimated $2.25 million last year in poor
investments, the media reported Thursday.
   The politburo, led by party chairman Arvo Aalto, offered its
resignation at its meeting Wednesday. It will be considered at the
party's Central Committee meetng later this month.
   The Central Committee was not expected to accept all of the
resignations.
   The Independent Helsinki daily Helsingin Sanomat said in an
editorial that there was ``no reason to feel malicious pleasure
outside the party.''
   Aalto was not available for comment Wednesday or Thursday.
   The failed foray into the investment market meant a further loss
of face for the party after a steady loss of voter support over the
past 10 years. Internal quarrels led to a party split before last
year's parliamentary elections.
   In 1958, the party had 50 seats in the 200-seat parliament. In
the 1987 election, the two Communist factions won a total of 20
seats.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Launches Effort To Root Out Polio By Year 2000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization on Thursday endorsed
a massive immunization campaign to protect all children against
polio and eradicate the crippling disease by the year 2000.
   Only half the world's children are immunized, and 275,000 new
cases of polio occur each year, mainly in developing countries,
according to WHO.
   A committee of the 166-nation U.N. agency passed by consensus a
resolution calling for the eradication program. Approval by WHO's
full assembly is expected Friday at the final session of the
agency's annual meeting.
   Polio is the major disease with the best chance of being stamped
out, the resolution said. It asked WHO's director general to seek
funds needed for the campaign and urged all countries to step up
surveillance to permit quick identification of outbreaks.
   Eradication is expected to require doubling the $500 million the
organization spends each year on immunization programs against six
major childhood diseases in the Third World, including polio. The
others are measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and
tuberculosis.
   About 10 million people worldwide have been crippled by polio,
and one patient in 10 dies of the disease, WHO said.
   India has reported the most cases of polio in recent years _
14,629 in 1986. Afghanistan reported 1,843 cases, Vietnam 1,600,
China 1,537, Bangladesh 810 and Brazil 665.
   WHO estimates that only one case in 10 is reported to its
headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
   Eliminating polio will be ``an appropriate gift, together with
the eradication of smallpox'' to the next century, the resolution
said.
   WHO led a global drive that eradicated smallpox by the late
1970s.
   Polio became rare in developed countries after U.S. scientists
developed two vaccines in the 1950s. WHO expects to eliminate the
polio virus from the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific by
1990.
   The organization says it costs $10 to immunize a child against
polio and other major diseases, although the cost can be higher to
reach children in remote areas.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebels Claim They Destroyed Planes In Asmara Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopian rebels claimed Thursday that
they destroyed some aircraft when they shelled the airport at
Asmara, Ethiopia's second- largest city and a provincial northern
capital.
   ``The airport was heavily damaged by the accurate shelling,''
the Eritrean People's Liberation Front said over its clandestine
radio in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi. ``An as yet unknown
number of aircraft were destroyed.''
   Rebel spokesman Tesfai Ghermazien, in a telephone interview from
his Washington, D.C. office, said the planes probably were military
aircraft, but he had no further information.
   Asmara is an important military air base as well as a pickup
point for cargo planes ferrying relief food to Ethiopian drought
victims.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government rarely comments on
claims of the separatist rebels, who are waging wars in the
provinces of Tigre and Eritrea. There was no way to independently
confirm the rebel report.
   Western diplomats and relief officials in the Ethiopian capital,
Addis Ababa, said they had heard nothing about an attack. But they
said little information has come out of the region since the
government expelled foreign aid workers from Eritrea and Tigre on
April 6.
   Eritrea and Tigre, in the extreme north of Ethiopia, are the
hardest hit by the current drought. A massive Western-financed
relief operation has been crippled by the expulsion of relief
workers, but the government says the expulsions are for security
reasons.
   Asmara, Eritrea's capital, is 670 miles north of Addis Ababa.
The airport is about 1{ miles from the town and is guarded by
troops in trenches along its perimeter.
   In the past week, the rebels and the government have both
claimed victories in battles being fought within 60 miles of Asmara.
   Rebels have shelled Asmara airport periodically over the past
few years.

<TEXT>
   Upper-crust Englishman Harold ``Kim'' Philby, who
for nearly three decades spied for the Soviets from the heights of
British intelligence, died a decorated KGB officer in Moscow. He
was 76.
   The Foreign Office said it learned from the Soviet Embassy in
London that Philby had died Wednesday. The embassy gave no cause of
death. Four months ago, Philby said he was suffering from
arrhythmia, a heart irregularity.
   The most damaging double agent in modern British history, the
suave, handsome Philby sent many Western agents to their deaths.
   With three now-deceased colleagues he met at Cambridge
University in the 1930s _ Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony
Blunt _ Philby turned Britain's most precious secrets over to the
Kremlin.
   By extension, he betrayed the United States, too, since he was
privy to top-secret information exchanged by the two allies.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, today eulogized Philby as
an ``outstanding'' master spy who helped defend the Soviet Union
from Western intelligence. It did not say how or where he died.
   Tass said Philby waged ``a direct battle against the special
services of capitalist countries, whose activity was directed
against the Soviet Union, against the movement for peace and
progress.''
   Philby was on his way to becoming head of British intelligence
when he came under suspicion in 1951, when Maclean and Burgess _
who had been posted at the British Embassy in Washington _ fled to
Moscow.
   Philby was forced to resign from the service the following year,
but he continued to free-lance for MI6, the British intelligence
agency.
   By the time he was unmasked as the ``Third Man'' who tipped off
Burgess and Maclean in time for them to escape British punishment,
Philby was settling into Moscow as a senior KGB officer.
   The Maclean-Burgess-Philby spy scandals damaged the exchange of
intelligence information between Britain and the United States for
years. But of perhaps even more profound impact in Britain was that
the establishment's own could be traitors.
   In 1979, Blunt's treachery was exposed publicly. In exchange for
information, he had been allowed to escape disgrace, to receive a
knighthood and to serve as the queen's art adviser for years.
   Philby's death was front-page news in Britain today. The Times
and other papers referred to him as ``Traitor Philby.''
   There was no immediate comment from Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government. But legislator Ted Leadbitter of the
socialist opposition Labor Party said Philby's death ``brings an
end, I hope, to the unhappiest period of betrayal of this century.''
   Philby told Phillip Knightley of The Times of London in January,
in his first and only press interview with a Western reporter, that
he had no regrets, except for personal friends he lost.
   Asked ``Would you do it all again?'' Philby replied:
``Absolutely.''
   He said he had found peace, that he was happy in his fourth
marriage, to a Russian woman, and felt Moscow to be his home.
   Harold Adrian Russell Philby was born on New Year's Day 1912 in
India, where his father was a colonial official, and was nicknamed
Kim after the boy spy hero of a Rudyard Kipling story.
   His father was Harry St. John Bridger Philby, an eccentric
explorer of Arabia who converted to Islam and settled in Beirut,
the Lebanese capital.
   Later Philby would write that he never felt patriotism toward
any country.
   At Cambridge, he fell under communism's spell. In those days of
depression and early fascism, it was not unusual for idealistic
young Englishmen to look to Moscow.
   ``The Western democracies in the 1930s were too weak and corrupt
to fight Nazi Germany,'' Philby wrote in his autobiography, ``My
Silent War,'' published after he defected.
   Knightley said a secret Philby guarded to the last was who first
recruited him as a spy for the Soviets in 1934 not long after he
returned from Vienna, where he had been helping communists escape
from the Austrian authorities.
   In 1940, Philby joined British intelligence and rose to become
head of its anti-Soviet section. In 1949, he went to Washington as
Britain's liaison officer with the CIA and FBI.
   A decade after Burgess and Maclean fled to Moscow, evidence of
Philby's involvement in espionage with them continued to mount.
   On Jan. 23, 1963, while working as a journalist in Beirut,
Philby failed to pick up his third wife for a party. Six months
later, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia announced he was in Moscow.
   Later, Philby claimed MI6 deliberately engineered his defection,
fearing embarrassment if he stood trial in England.
   After an initial hero's welcome in Moscow, Philby sank into
obscurity and confessed to Knightley that he went through
depression and began heavy drinking when he believed the KGB no
longer had any use for him.
   Philby had several children. One, a son John, lives in London.
John's wife said the family had no comment on Philby's death.

   The National Institutes of Health will stop
funding artificial heart research and will focus instead on smaller
devices intended to assist rather than replace hearts, according to
a report published today.
   ``While the (artificial heart) device seemed to work well, the
biology didn't work,'' said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   ``The human body just couldn't seem to tolerate it. We were left
wondering whether the idea of a permanent replacement will ever
work,'' Lenfant said in an interview published in The Atlanta
Constitution and The Atlanta Journal.
   The decision means four institutions awarded contracts last year
for artificial heart research will receive only about $1 million of
the $5 million each was expecting over the next five years.
   ``This is a tremendous setback for scientific advancement in the
field,'' said Dr. Donald Olsen, head of artificial heart research
at the University of Utah, which had received one of the contracts.
He said the decision will set back development of a permanent
artificial heart for more than 10 years.
   ``This does not mean the end of the artificial heart program. It
means we are taking a different approach. It may take somewhat
longer, but it may also help us develop a device that works
better,'' Lenfant said.
   Barney Clark became the first recipient of an artificial heart
Dec. 2, 1982, in surgery performed at the University of Utah by Dr.
William DeVries. He died the following March.
   Four other patients have received permanent artificial hearts,
three at Humana-Audubon Hospital in Louisville, Ky., where DeVries
now works, and one in Stockholm, Sweden. William Schroeder was the
longest survivor, living almost two years with the Jarvik-7
artificial heart.
   All of the patients, however, suffered severe complications,
including strokes and major infections.
   Lenfant said reports about those problems were one reason the
government decided to withdraw support for continued development.
   Instead, the agency will focus its funding on smaller
ventricular assist devices as stopgap measures for patients
awaiting a transplanted human heart, he said.
   ``We believe it is time to try them in patients who need
long-term support,'' Lenfant said.
   So far such ``bridge'' devices have been been used only for a
few weeks. Lenfant said the government wants to see if they will
work for three or four years at a time.
   The newspapers said the NIH decision would be officially
announced next week.

<DATELINE>SEVERN, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who walked away from a South Carolina
prison work-release program 10{ years ago has been arrested in
Maryland, where she had become a successful businesswoman,
authorities said.
   Pamela A. Rogers, 36, who served three years of a 12-year
sentence for armed robbery, was arrested Tuesday at her home in
Severn, where she had lived under a different name with her husband
and two sons from an earlier marriage.
   ``Ten-and-a-half years, 10{ years, 10{ years, why now?'' the
woman, a successful real estate broker, asked as she was arrested,
according to Rodney Johnson, warrants supervisor with the U.S.
Marshal's Office in Baltimore.
   Johnson said Ms. Rogers had lived in Severn since shortly after
the escape and had assumed the name Kay Kathalena Smith and a
birthdate five years prior to her real birthdate.
   She worked as a waitress and about 18 months ago obtained her
real estate license. Johnson said the woman had more than $1
million in sales last year and apparently lived an honest life
since her escape.
   Ms. Rogers, convicted in the armed robbery of a Columbia, S.C.,
jewelry store, had been wanted since Jan. 7, 1978, when she failed
to return to Goodman Correctional Institution near Columbia from a
work-release job, said state Department of Corrections spokesman
Hal Leslie.
   An old phone number and information provided by her former
husband, who recently was arrested on a murder charge in Idaho,
helped authorities uncover Ms. Rogers' new identity, authorities
said. Officials in South Carolina forwarded a picture of her to
Maryland.
   Upon locating the woman, police placed her under surveillance to
check for a small scar on the left side of her face that they felt
would further substantiate her identity.
   ``She looked the same as the picture, only older,'' Johnson
said. Ms. Rogers, who was alone in her home, did not resist arrest.
   She appeared Wednesday in Annapolis District Court and was freed
on $25,000 bond, Johnson said. She declined to waive extradition
and a hearing was scheduled June 10.
   A co-worker praised Ms. Rogers as a good worker and mother.
   ``I wish I had 20 Kay Smiths,'' said Fred Fischer, office
manager at Gary Hart & Associates in Glen Burnie.
   ``Everyone liked and respected her, he said. ``She took an
active part in her children's schoolwork and athletics. When she
wasn't with her family, she was working in the office.''

<HEAD>Forest Service Asks Power to Pursue Growers Off Its Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest Service officials asked Congress today
for ``hot pursuit'' authority against heavily armed marijuana
growers who forced the closure of 886,000 acres of national forest
land last year as unsafe for tourists and timber interests.
   Deputy Forest Service chief William L. Rice told a Senate
hearing that his 150 law enforcement agents need statutory
authority to pursue fleeing marijuana farmers beyond the boundaries
of national forests and grasslands, especially in the Far West,
where the problem is most acute.
   His request was endorsed by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga., who said ``these marijuana gardens are protected by
a Marquis de Sade torture chamber of devices intended to maim,
cripple or kill intruders.''
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., testifying at a Senate agriculture
subcommittee hearing, said illicit marijuana cultivation ``is a
problem of staggering proportions'' in the West.
   Wyden is chief sponsor of a bill that would grant Forest Service
agents authority to conduct investigations, searches, seizures and
arrests outside the boundaries of national forests if drug crimes
originate there.
   He said the agents are ``hamstrung'' under current law because
``they are authorized to go after these criminals, but only as long
as they remain within the boundaries of the federal forests.''
   Wyden also proposed to stiffen federal penalties for
unauthorized use of chemical herbicides and fertilizers in national
forests, and to increase the maximum penalties for marijuana
cultivation on those lands, which total 191 million acres in 44
states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Frank G. Packwood, a special agent in the Trinity-Shasta
National Forest in California, blamed the lack of ``hot pursuit''
authority on the poor success rate in prosecuting marijuana
growers, who have an estimated $14 billion in annual profits.
   In 1986, Packwood said, 70 percent of California's 872 arrests
for illegal marijuana farming went unprosecuted because of hampered
investigations.
   ``Law enforcement has failed to establish a deterrent to
cultivation activity and has become in the eyes of the grower just
another business expense,'' Packwood said.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Harkins, heard testimony that
marijuana growers are using a wide variety of sophisticated weapons
to guard their farming plots in national forests, including attack
dogs who get their commands from radios mounted on their collars.
   Wyden said that during a raid on a drug lab near a national
forest in southern Oregon, the Josephine County sheriff ``seized a
cache of weapons that could outfit a small army,'' including 51
machine guns, semi-automatic rifles and other automatic weapons,
100,000 rounds of ammunition and 150 pounds of gunpower.

   Armed guerrillas today seized a seminary where
Pope John Paul II is scheduled to speak this weekend, news reports
said. Police said suspected rebels bombed a police bus and
seriously wounded seven officers.
   The violence followed a mortar attack late Wednesday on the
Interior Ministry and a car bombing near a Lima military
installation, according to police reports.
   The violence comes just two days before the pope is scheduled to
arrive in Peru. It was the heavist round of attacks in the capital
this year.
   Police did not provide details, but news reports said a soldier
guarding an officers' school was killed and two policemen wounded
in the attack on the Interior Ministry.
   Police said suspected guerrillas hurled a bomb at the bus, which
was carrying police troopers on a downtown avenue during morning
rush hour traffic.
   Eight armed members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
seized the Santo Toribio Seminary during a morning Mass and
demanded that seminarians, priests and others attending join their
insurgency, according to Radio Programas, Peru's leading news
station.
   The guerrillas fled when police arrived, and police launched a
search, the radio said. There were no injuries.
   The pope, on a 13-day tour of Latin America, is to arrive in
Lima Saturday from Bolivia. He is scheduled to meet cultural and
business leaders at the seminary Sunday. The pope is to leave for
Paraguay Monday.
   There was no indication which guerrilla band carried out the
other attacks. The Tupac Amaru group is smaller and considered less
violent that the Mao-inspired Shining Path.
   The Shining Path's eight-year insurgency against the government
of President Alan Garcia has claimed 10,000 lives.

   Girl Scout cookies bound for
sailors aboard the USS Midway were shipped off to Japan today after
a persistent Brownie troop squeezed their shipment past Japanese
tariffs through diplomatic means.
   The cookies, which had been sitting in an airline ticket office
since they were returned from an April 26 shipment to Tokyo, left
this morning, said Jean Titus, general manager for American
Airlines in Corpus Christi.
   Troop 807 in Beeville had sold 402 boxes of cookies to the crew
of the USS Midway, stationed in Atsugi, Japan, with free shipment
provided by the airline.
   But Japanese customs officials said they would have to levy a
duty on the cookies, and they were returned to Corpus Christi
International Airport. Japanese officials have denied that they
said the duty would be $2,000.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, went through diplomatic channels to
clear the matter up and sent a telegram to the Brownie troop on
Wednesday.
   ``An officer on the USS Midway tells me that he is ready to go
pick up your shipment of Girl Scout cookies when they arrive in
Japan this Friday,'' the telegram said.
   ``Everybody who was supposed to be getting the cookies was
really upset when they didn't get them,'' said Petty Officer 3rd
Class Sig Woolford, who was in Beeville on Wednesday while on leave
from the aircraft carrier.
   Woolford, son-in-law of Brownie troop leader Marchetta White,
said sailors have been waiting for the cookies from home for more
than two months.
   The cookies were scheduled to connect with a flight in Dallas,
then catch a flight to Narita Airport near Tokyo, where
representatives of the U.S. Navy will be allowed to take the
shipment duty-free.
   ``I think it's great and I'll tell the girls this afternoon at
our regular meeting,'' said Ms. White. ``I'm sure you'll hear a
cheer go up.''
   Japanese officials issued a statement Tuesday denying that the
tariff ever was as high as originally reported.
   The Japanese Consulate in Houston reported that the airline made
an inquiry in Tokyo about the cookies, but did not say that they
were intended for U.S. servicemen stationed on a ship.

<HEAD>Time-Consuming Paperwork Will Be Shaved From Forest Service
Appeals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the time-consuming paperwork will be
shaved from appeals resulting from Forest Service decisions
involving wildfires and other natural disasters, the Agriculture
Department said today.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said a newly adopted
interim rule primarily concerns future natural disasters in the
national forests.
   However, he said the agency also ``needs to speed up appeal
procedures for recovery and rehabilitation activities that resulted
from 1987's severe fire season in California and Oregon. It was
this natural disaster that brought to our attention the need for
special appeal procedures.''
   Under the interim rule adopted today, anyone may appeal
decisions on recovery and rehabilitation activities that result
from natural disasters, such as wildfires, flooding, earthquakes
and high winds, he said.
   Those who appeal will be entitled to a ``one-level appeal
process'' which must be completed within 90 days, Robertson said.
Previously, appeal processes could be reviewed at two
administrative levels.
   An estimated 2.2 billion board feet of national forest timber
were destroyed or damaged in California and Oregon in the 1987 fire
season, with about 40 percent of that volume offered for sale, he
said.
   ``A delay in fire-caused salvage sales and related
rehabilitation activities in California and Oregon could result in
unnecessary losses of valuable natural resources,'' Robertson said.
   The fires disrupted the timber sale programs of several national
forests, he said. As a result, the economies of timber-dependent
communities in the burned areas could suffer from delays in salvage
and rehabilitation work.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist guerrilla attack on a
hydroelectric dam north of the capital killed 16 soldiers, injured
15 and caused a nationwide power shortage.
   In San Salvador, a correspondent for the Soviet newspaper Pravda
was expelled from the country, and a military judge was fatally
shot outside his home.
   Rebels destroyed five transformers and a central control board
during their pre-dawn attack Wednesday at the November 5th Dam,
said Col. Carlos Eduardo Melendez of the government's Rio Lempa
Hydroelectric Power Authority.
   The dam, 50 miles north of San Salvador, supplies 22 percent of
El Salvador's electricity needs, Melendez said.
   ``The outage of the system of these five transformers
practically leaves the dam out of service for a while. How long we
cannot say,'' Melendez told a news conference.
   He said the attack would worsen an already severe electricity
shortage caused by a drought and sabotage by leftist guerrillas,
who have fought the U.S.-backed government for the last eight years.
   The power authority already had planned to start rationing
electricity with three-hour daily cuts nationwide beginning
Wednesday. The attack forced the authority to increase daily cuts
to four hours, Melendez said.
   Melendez said the guerrillas have mounted about 2,000 attacks on
electrical installations causing $51 million in damage since the
civil war began in October 1979. The guerrillas' last major attack
on the dam was in June 1984.
   The Soviet journalist, Yuri Stroev, was taken from the Hotel
Camino Real on Wednesday by several men who said they were
immigration officials, hotel employees said. He was the first
Soviet correspondent to visit the country, according to the Foreign
Correspondents Association here.
   The employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
gunmen asked Stroev to pack his luggage and accompany them. He was
taken away in a vehicle driven by several plainclothes individuals,
they said.
   An immigration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press today that Stroev was deported to
Guatemala. He said the journalist had been told he could stay only
if he received military accreditation.
   Stroev had told colleagues earlier that he had applied for
accreditation at the Press Committee of the Armed Forces general
staff, but officials there had told him they had run out of
credentials.
   Stroev had arrived in San Salvador on Sunday.
   Also Wednesday, a man jumped from a jeep in a San Salvador
neighborhood and shot Jorge Alberto Serrano, a military judge who
handles cases related to the civil war.
   The jeep pulled up outside Serrano's home and the gunman fired
four shots into the judge's car, witnesses said, speaking on
condition they not be identified for fear of reprisal. The attacker
escaped.
   Serrano, 45, died at the scene.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Serrano was one of three military judges in charge of national
security cases linked to the civil war. Some cases involved people
suspected of cooperating with the guerrillas and others involved
military officers.
   In January, Serrano ruled that three men accused in the June
1985 shooting deaths of 13 people, including six Americans, should
be freed under an amnesty program implemented in November.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte overruled Serrano's decision in
April.

<TEXT>
   A Swedish scientist won the $150,000 Tyler
Prize for Environmental Achievement for helping focus international
attention on how air pollutants are warming Earth's climate by
creating a ``greenhouse effect.''
   Bert Bolin, 62, director of Stockholm's International
Meteorological Institute, will receive the money and a gold
medallion Friday night in Los Angeles, the prize committee
announced Thursday.
   Committee spokesman Howard Stone said Bolin helped lay the
groundwork in the 1940s and 1950s for modern computerized weather
forecasting. But he was awarded the 1988 Tyler Prize for research
done since the mid-1950s on the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere and
the effects of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide produced by
the burning of fossil fuels, Stone said.
   Carbon dioxide, methane and certain other gases trap heat in
Earth's atmosphere, much like glass traps heat in a greenhouse.
Scientists say this ``greenhouse effect'' will warm Earth's
atmosphere significantly during the next century, possibly causing
sea levels to rise and triggering droughts, crop failures and other
environmental damage.
   Research by Bolin, who also is a meteorology professor at the
University of Stockholm and science adviser to Sweden's prime
minister, ``is of fundamental scientific importance,'' the prize
committee said.
   ``He has been instrumental in determining how man's activities
... have drastically increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.''
   In a statement released by the committee, Bolin urged
reassessment of energy policies, asking, ``How much coal, oil and
gas can we continue to burn in light of the mounting evidence of
negative atmospheric effects?''
   The annual Tyler Prize, administered by the University of
Southern California, was established in 1973 by outdoor enthusiasts
Alice C. Tyler and her husband, the late John C. Tyler, founder of
Farmers Insurance Group.
   Tyler Prizes worth nearly $2 million have been awarded to 23
scientists. On several occasions, the committee named more than one
annual winner.

   Huge statues of Paul Bunyan and his ox,
Babe, have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``It's about time Paul got the recognition he deserves,'' said
Doug Peterson, mayor of this northwestern Minnesota city.
``Everyone has had their pictures taken with them,'' he said
Wednesday.
   The statues of 18-foot-tall Paul and 23-foot-long Babe became
eligible for the National Register after passing their 50th
birthday last year, according to National Park Service guidelines.
   Inclusion is made for historic or aesthetic merit.
   According to Susan Roth of the state historical society, the
National Register listing was awarded to the steel and concrete
statues in March because of their long-time role in promoting
tourism in the area.
   Peterson said Bemidji is planning to celebrate the statues' new
significance with the unveiling of a plaque at the end of the month.

Says</HEAD>

   President Reagan ``is mortified'' that his
Wednesday night endorsement of George Bush's presidential candidacy
may have been seen by some as merely lukewarm, Reagan's spokesman
said today.
   ``He feels it was a very strong endorsement, very appropriate,
sets the stage for him to talk about the vice president throughout
the campaign,'' said Marlin Fitzwater.
   Reagan gave Bush a terse statement of support Wednesday night,
mispronouncing the name of his vice president at one point. But
Bush aides quickly expressed enthusiasm for the endorsement.
   At the White House today, Fitzwater said any reports that the
endorsement was merely lukewarm were ``most unfortunate.'' He said
of Reagan, ``He is mortified. He thought the speech was terrific.
He wrote it himself. He thought it was strong, a full endorsement
of his vice president who he thinks incredibly highly of.''
   Reagan delivered the long-awaited endorsement of his 1980 and
1984 running mate at a Republican fund-raising dinner Wednesday
night, telling his audience he would ``campaign as hard as I can''
for Bush.
   The president, bestowing his approval on Bush's campaign more
than two weeks after the vice president mathematically clinched the
GOP nomination in the Pennsylvania primary, came in a brief three
sentences at the conclusion of a 15-minute speech.
   While Reagan's backing was never in doubt, the president had
stuck to a promise to remain netural as long as there were other
challengers. Bush's remaining rival, Pat Robertson, announced
earlier Wednesday that he would support Bush.
   During his speech, Reagan mentioned Bush only three times,
mispronouncing his name on one of those occasions as ``George
Bosh.''
   But Bush aides immediately stressed that they were pleased with
Reagan's announcement, no matter how brief.
   ``It's a total endorsement,'' said Bush's chief of staff Craig
Fuller. ``I would not look for what wasn't said. I would look for
what was said. I'm fully satisfied. I don't think it gets any
better.''
   Bush's press secretary, Stephen Hart, said ``it looks like an
endorsement to me.''
   ``These guys love each other,'' he added.
   Speaking at a $1,500-a-plate banquet attended by more than 3,000
Republicans, Reagan concluded a speech about the accomplishments of
his administration with these words:
   ``I intend to campaign as hard as I can. My candidate is a
former member of Congress, ambassador to China, ambassador to the
United Nations, Director of the CIA and national chairman of the
Republican party. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make Vice
President George Bush the next president of the United States.''
   In endorsing Bush, Reagan said he was breaking ``a silence I've
maintained for some time with regard to the presidential
candidates.''
   Earlier in the speech, Reagan said: ``Eight years ago, George
Bush and I said to the American people, `the time is now.' It still
is. The story of America is one of people who have made their
dreams come true, by realizing that the time for action is always
now.''
   It was in that reference that Reagan mispronounced the name of
his vice president.
   Bush was traveling to New Mexico and California today for a
seven-day campaign trip to the West.
   Reagan's formal endorsement follows several weeks of jockeying
among White House and Bush campaign aides over a time and place for
the announcement.
   At the end of Reagan's speech, Bush and his wife Barbara worked
their way through the crowd on the floor to join the president and
First Lady Nancy Reagan at the podium. Reagan and Bush held clasped
hands aloft as hundreds of balloons were released from the ceiling.
   Bush, who spoke before Reagan, praised the president, saying:
``You began a great national renewal.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, whose own presidential bid
was stopped in Bush's march to the GOP nomination, displayed his
sometimes barbed wit.
   ``Thank you, thank you very much,'' he said when he was
applauded. ``I was going to say, I would accept the nomination, but
I think it's already been spoken for.''
   ``I can't remember the guy who got it,'' said Dole.
   Robertson announced his suport for Bush after a private session
between the two at the White House, claiming ``the race is pretty
much over.''
   The former television minister has won only 46 delegates. He
said he would wait until Monday before formally withdrawing to give
his supporters a chance to win additional national convention seats
at GOP caucuses this weekend in Arizona and Virginia.
   ``I didn't ask anything for myself. I spoke about education and
the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of
1988,'' Robertson said. ``We definitely had a meeting of the minds
on the platform.''
   Robertson's campaign later said in a statement that Robertson
had said he was not withdrawing, but that he would address his
campaign status on Monday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Strong in California, But Demographics Good for Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California Democrats are likely to go for the
favorite next month, abandoning their longtime penchant for backing
underdogs in presidential primaries, pollsters say. But the
tradition may not succumb without a fight.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is substantially ahead of
Jesse Jackson in opinion polls, most recently in a Gallup survey
this week giving Dukakis 67 percent to 26 percent for Jackson and 7
percent undecided.
   But if Dukakis is the heavy favorite to win, pollsters said in
recent interviews, Jackson still may do better than his recent
finishes, perhaps well enough to boost his influence at the party's
convention in Atlanta.
   ``I would be extremely surprised if Jackson got over 40
percent,'' said I.A. Lewis, chief of polling for The Los Angeles
Times.
   While that strong a showing is by no means assured, pollsters
say there are several reasons Jackson could do well in California
on June 7. One is demographics: Many of the voters fit the profile
of Jackson supporters. Another is history: Jackson, who has found
support from whites elusive, did his best on that score in his 1984
campaign with California whites.
   Yet another factor is a decreased expectation that Jackson can
win the nomination. Several analysts said dissatisfied Democrats
may be more likely to cast a protest vote for Jackson when it
appears he cannot actually win.
   ``When you don't think Jackson is a viable nominee he gets a
better vote than when you do,'' said Lewis. He noted that Jackson's
support from whites fell off after the Wisconsin primary, when he
looked strong. But after losing a series of landslides, Jackson got
24 percent of the white vote in Nebraska this week, his second-best
showing among whites all year.
   Given the liberalism of many California Democrats, ``there's a
number of people that would like to give him bargaining chips in
Atlanta by his showing well here _ people who may not want him to
be president but want to give him some clout,'' Lewis said.
   Any added clout from second place would stem from vote totals
rather than the delegate count; the primary is a winner-take-all
contest, with delegates awarded only to the first-place finisher in
each congressional district.
   Pollsters stressed that a victory by Jackson in California would
be exceedingly difficult, even with his plans to campaign heavily
in the state. Blacks, who have been giving him support in the
90-percent range, made up only about 15 percent of the primary
electorate in 1984, and Jackson has not increased blacks' share of
the vote in most other states.
   Jackson in 1984 won four of the state's 45 congressional
districts and received 21 percent of the vote statewide.
``Conventional wisdom is that Jackson should do better than four
years ago, but not dramatically,'' said California-based pollster
Mervin Field. He said Jackson may be hurt by his recent losses
while Dukakis is fueled by his run of wins.
   Still, Lewis noted that California Democrats have a history of
backing the anti-establishment candidate. California went for Gary
Hart over front-runner Walter Mondale in 1984, Edward Kennedy over
President Carter in 1980, favorite son Gov. Jerry Brown over Carter
in 1976, and George McGovern over Hubert Humphrey in 1972.
   Added pollster Gordon Black: ``The Democratic Party there is
more liberal than the Democratic Party in the rest of the country.''
   John Brennan, a poll analyst for ABC News, noted that four years
ago 45 percent of the Democratic voters in California identified
themselves as liberals, 24 percent were under 30 and 40 percent
were college graduates _ all groups in which Jackson has done his
best among white voters.
   ``It's got good demographics for Jackson,'' Brennan said. He
said a 1984 ABC News exit poll found that Jackson got 13 percent of
the white vote in California, the only state that year in which he
reached double digits.
   That poll said 7 percent of the vote in 1984 was Jewish, and
Jackson has fared poorly among Jews because of concern about his
position on Israel.
   But homosexuals could make up 5 percent of the vote and may
favor Jackson because of Dukakis' resistance to homosexual couples
as adoptive parents.
   Hispanics made up 9 percent of the electorate in 1984 in the ABC
poll. Jackson lost Hispanics badly to the Spanish-speaking Dukakis
in Texas this year, with 60 percent for Dukakis and 20 percent for
Jackson in an ABC poll.
   Still, Brennan noted that the 1984 California electorate was
only 25 percent Catholic and one-third blue collar, groups that
Dukakis has been winning. And the primary is closed, meaning
independents, who have backed Dukakis, can't vote.
   If the black vote reaches 20 percent and goes entirely to
Jackson, he still would need 31 percent of the remainder to beat
Dukakis _ a level of non-black votes that he has achieved only in
one state this year, Vermont.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Reagan's Nod; Dukakis Praises Tutu</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Fitzwater on endorsement reaction, inserting 2
grafs after lead</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis traded kind
words with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa today
at the Capitol, one day after George Bush finally got President
Reagan's public promise to ``campaign as hard as I can'' for Bush
against Dukakis this summer and fall.
   Reagan's statement of support Wednesday night was brief, and he
mispronounced Bush's name once. But White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said today it would be inaccurate to call the endorsement
lukewarm and he said Reagan ``is mortified'' that it may have been
seen that way.
   ``He feels it was a very strong endorsement, very appropriate,
sets the stage for him to talk about the vice president throughout
the campaign,'' Fitzwater said.
   Dukakis' only remaining Democratic rival, Jesse Jackson, brushed
aside this week's losses in Nebraska and West Virginia with his
stock line that his candidacy is ``winning every day.''
   All three candidates were to campaign today in Western states,
as the race pointed toward June 7, with its big delegate payoff
from races in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   Dukakis, who has been criticized by Bush for lacking foreign
policy experience, met for 30 minutes with Tutu, who was in
Washington to lobby for new sanctions aimed at ending apartheid in
South Africa.
   The Massachusetts governor told reporters he ``very strongly''
supported legislation to apply such sanctions. Tutu said ``we
didn't have a point at which we disagreed.''
   ``I don't think we need to give an endorsement, but we know we
would be amongst friends and we would have very, very powerful
friends in the White House if we had a Democrat occupying the White
House,'' Tutu said.
   Dukakis, standing with Tutu, praised ``your courage and your
leadership.''
   Tutu said, ``God bless you.''
   On another foreign policy issue, Dukakis, in answer to
questions, voiced reservations about a deal reported to be being
worked out by the administration to have Panama strongman Manuel
Noriega leave office in exchange for dropping U.S. drug indictments
against him.
   ``I don't think you drop indictments against drug pushers and
people suspected of murder,'' Dukakis said.
   He also was meeting with Latin American ambassadors and making
the rounds on Capitol Hill, meeting with leaders including House
Speaker Jim Wright, House Majority Leader Tom Foley, Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd and House Budget Committee Chairman
William Gray.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said after meeting with Dukakis that he was ``the
candidate best able to lead our nation.''
   Bush was formally given Reagan's endorsement at a pricey
Republican fund-raiser in Washington on Wednesday night.
   Reagan had remained neutral during the fight for the Republican
nomination, but the vice president has had a mathematical lock on
the nomination since the Pennsylvania primary last month. The
president said the time had come to break his silence.
   ``I intend to campaign as hard as I can,'' Reagan said. ``I'm
going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President George Bush
the next president of the United States.''
   The brief endorsement came at the end of a lengthy speech in
which the president cited his administration's accomplishments.
Reagan referred to Bush by name three times, at one point calling
him ``George Bosh.''
   Bush, who preceded the president at the podium, praised Reagan
for ``your simple humanity, your decency and your strength,''
adding: ``What an inspiration you have been to all of us.''
   After Reagan spoke, Bush joined him and the two clasped hands
and held them high, while hundreds of red, white and blue balloons
were released.
   Bush's former rival Bob Dole drew laughter from the crowd at the
Republican event when _ acknowledging applause as he rose to speak
_ said: ``I would accept the nomination, but I think it's already
been spoken for.''
   Hours before Reagan's endorsement, Bush got the blessing of
former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who technically remains
a candidate although he has long ceased active campaigning and has
only 46 delegates to Bush's 1,344, according to the latest AP count.
   Robertson, who came to Washington to formally bestow his support
on Bush, told reporters at the White House afterward he would
withdraw from the race on Monday, and would be releasing his
delegates.
   But later, Robertson aide Richard Pinsky said Robertson was
suspending his campaign rather than quitting outright, and would
release his delegates, but not right away.
   Still later, the Robertson campaign weighed in with a press
release asserting that the former television evangelist had told
reporters he was not withdrawing and was not releasing his
delegates. It promised Robertson would discuss his campaign status
on Monday, however.
   On Wednesday, Jackson led a march against drugs through a
crime-ridden neighborhood in Portland, and talked to Indian leaders
near a reservation in central Oregon.
   ``I earn my votes every day,'' Jackson told a cheering crowd in
Salem. ``When I win, you win.''
   In other developments:
   _Former President Nixon has notified Republican Party officials
that he does not want to be invited to address the party's national
convention in August, a party source says. The source, who insisted
on anonymity, said there was sentiment among party officials to
invite Nixon to address the New Orleans convention. But Nixon, who
was driven from office by the Watergate scandal, was aware that his
appearance would be controversial, the source said.
   _Supporters of Jesse Jackson have filed a formal challenge to
the delegate selection process in Kansas, where state party
officials were preparing for a state committee meeting over the
weekend to choose the last of Kansas' delegates to the Democratic
National Convention in July in Atlanta. Backers say Jackson should
have been allocated 12 national delegates instead of the seven he
received, based on the results of county caucuses March 19.

<HEAD>Pothole Settlement Costs Dallas Nearly $1 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A potholed street has cost Dallas almost $1
million in a settlement that nearly wiped out its litigation
reserve fund, officials said.
   City Council approved, by a 5-2 vote Wednesday, a $969,000
settlement with a man whose wife was killed three years ago by a
motorist who swerved after hitting a pothole.
   In a suit in state district court, the family of A. Glennie
Mayer of Rowlett had sought $2.4 million from the city for failing
to fill the pothole, which was about 8 inches deep and 3 feet
across.
   The suit contended the city had been negligent because it failed
to properly maintain the street despite a complaint filed with the
Streets and Sanitation Department.
   City Attorney Analeslie Muncy said the city's litigation fund
has ``just a little'' more than $1 million, which must last until
Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
   In 1985, there was no state limit on death claims resulting from
faulty street maintenance. The state's 1987 tort reform law set a
$250,000 limit.
   The lawsuit, filed by Robert E. Mayer, stems from a Nov. 18,
1985, accident that killed Mrs. Mayer, 48.
   Under Texas law, a city may be held liable for an accident
caused by a pothole only if a complaint has been filed and there
was time for crews to fill it.

   The Energy Department has delayed for a
second day a major nuclear weapons test at the Nevada Test Site.
   The test was rescheduled for Friday morning.
   Thursday's delay was blamed on technical problems at
instrumentation trailers near ground zero. The test was originally
scheduled for Wednesday, but was delayed because of unfavorable
wind conditions.
   DOE spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg said workers had to go back to a
trailer area near ground zero to correct the technical problems,
and the problems could not be resolved in time to conduct the test
Thursday.
   The trailers house instruments used to record data from the
tests.
   The test, code-named Schellbourne, is the third announced shot
this year.

   The defense ended its closing
arguments today in the cocaine-smuggling trial of Carlos Lehder
Rivas, ridiculing prosecutors for trying to make the Colombian
appear responsible for the nation's drug problem.
   ``If that is true, you could lock up the doors to this
courthouse and tear down all the `Just Say No,' signs,'' defense
attorney Edward Shohat said, referring to a national anti-drug week
campaign.
   Shohat urged the jury to make an independent judgment about the
charges against Lehder, saying ``The government does not own the
jury _ noboby owns the jury.''
   Counsel for Lender's co-defendant, Jack Carlton Reed, also was
expected to finish his closing arguments today, followed by a
rebuttal from U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle. The case was scheduled
to go to the jury Friday.
   Lehder, 38, and Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., are charged with
conspiring to smuggle about 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States from Colombia via Lehder's private Bahamian island, Norman's
Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   A separate Miami indictment accuses Lehder of being one of the
leaders of the so-called Medellin cartel, a violent Colombian
smuggling ring believed to be responsible for a major portion of
the cocaine entering the United States.
   Shohat spent this morning hammering again at what he said were
inconsistencies in the testimony of government witnesses, many of
whom were admitted smugglers given immunity for their testimony.
   On Wednesday, Shohat said chief prosecution witness, convicted
smuggler Ed Ward, was ``given the break of a lifetime'' for his
testimony against Lehder.
   By agreeing to cooperate with the government, Ward was able to
reduce a possible 215-year sentence and $5.9 million fine to less
than six years in prison, Shohat said.
   Shohat reviewed what he termed ``the litany of lies'' testified
to by several members of Ward's group of American smugglers.
   ``These people planned to dump on Mr. Lehder. These people knew
how to get an American Express card to freedom,'' he said.
   ``You can't believe any of these people without hesitation,''
the defense attorney said.
   Shohat urged the panel to focus on the actual charges listed
against Lehder in the indictment and not what he called the
government's attacks on his character.
   ``The issue is not whether Mr. Lehder was good or bad. The issue
in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment,'' said Shohat.
   He said the actual charges were discussed in only five weeks of
the 22-week case.
   ``Mr. Lehder has no burden of proof. It is the obligation of the
prosecutors to prove Lehder guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he
said.
   Winding up his prosecution arguments Wednesday, Merkle referred
to testimony that Lehder used bribes, charm and threats to run a
smuggling empire. For once, Merkle said, Lehder couldn't use such
tools.
   ``He cannot buy his way out of a just verdict. He cannot charm
his way out of a just verdict. And he cannot force his way out of a
just verdict,'' Merkle said.
   The prosecutor said Lehder was responsible for smuggling 19 tons
of cocaine into the United States, earning him $20 million.
   Lehder was captured in February 1987 at a mansion near the town
of Medellin after a shootout between Colombian army troops and his
bodyguards. He was whisked onto a U.S. Air Force plane for the
United States.
   The prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial, which began
in October. Last week, defense attorneys surprised the courtroom by
announcing they would call no witnesses.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. Reed is charged with conspiracy.

<HEAD>State Department Said to Thwart Drug Agents Who Targeted Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug agents say the State Department
for 18 years stood in the way of efforts to smash drug smuggling by
Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, according to a story by the
Scripps-Howard News Service.
   ``We found out about Noriega'' shortly after the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs was established in 1968, Jerry
Strickler, former chief of Central American investigations for the
bureau, was quoted as saying in a Scripps-Howard story published
today.
   ``It was organized crime controlled by government,'' said John
Parker, former director of foreign operations for the bureau.
   Noriega was a rising power in Panama in 1968. He had just helped
Gen. Omar Torrijos become Panama's president in a coup and was
rewarded with the job of military intelligence chief.
   The now-retired agents were quoted as saying they obtained their
first hard evidence linking Noriega to drug smuggling in 1970, when
a group of Panamanians was arrested trying to bring a boatload of
marijuana into Miami. The captain had an address book listing
Noriega's name and telephone number along with those of well-known
Latin American drug traffickers.
   John Bacon, then chief of the bureau's Latin American
intelligence division, said the captain told agents he had picked
up the drug cargo in Panama and paid Noriega a cut of the profits.
   Less than a year later, the agents learned that Noriega had
arranged through Joaquim Him Gonzales, chief air traffic controller
at the Panama City airport, to smuggle heroin onto planes from
Panama City to South Florida.
   Noriega's cut, they said, was $100,000 a shipment, with 90- to
150-pound shipments leaving Panama City daily.
   Agents arrested Gonzales in February 1971 and said they were
ready to pounce next on Noriega, until the State Department became
involved.
   The agents were quoted as saying that Gonzales' arrest had
angered U.S. Ambassador Robert Sayre.
   ``We were open about what we were doing (in Panama),'' Strickler
said, but the agents say they didn't want to tell Sayre in advance
that they intended to arrest Gonzales. They said they feared he
might not keep quiet because he was more concerned about
maintaining friendly relations with Torrijos and Noriega during
negotiations to seal a new canal treaty and solve the issue of
Canal Zone sovereignty.
   They lured Gonzales into the Canal Zone with an invitation to
play in a softball game.
   After Gonzales' arrest, ``Sayre wanted to know everything we
were doing all the time,'' Strickler said.
   He also ordered the agents that he felt were most responsible
for the Gonzales arrest to leave Panama, the agents said.
   ``State Department officials in Panama began reviewing all
bureau confidential cables on Noriega and Torrijos and refused to
send some of them on because they felt it would upset the
government,'' Strickler said.
   Gonzales' arrest had outraged and unnerved Torrijos so much that
the State Department had to beg for the general's forgiveness, the
agents say.
   ``As Noriega became more known, nothing we said made an
impression on the State (Department),'' Strickler said.
   Some current and former administration and State Department
officials deny ignoring Noriega's drug smuggling or interfering
with agents who tried to stop him. They say they were never shown
hard evidence of Noriega's involvement in drugs. Others, however,
back up the agents.
   The bureau become the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1973.

   The White House will quickly follow up
President Reagan's veto of the wide-ranging trade bill with
attempts to get another form of the legislation passed, President
Reagan's spokesman said today.
   ``We wil seek to get a new bill,'' Fitzwater said as the bill
was being analyzed by administration officials in advance of
Reagan's promised veto. ``At the moment, the plan is to talk to the
(congressional) leadership and see what happens.''
   Fitzwater, as he has previously, refused to say what form the
administration believes a trade bill should take, although he
indicated there is no White House interest in trying to salvage a
plant-closing provision.
   Democrats had sent their 1,000-page bill toward the against international
trade violations.
   At the rally, House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., warned
that if Reagan vetoed the measure, Democrats will attempt to
override the action ``and we have the votes to do it.''
   The measure cleared the House by a 312-107 margin, more than the
two-thirds needed to override a presidential veto.
   But it passed the Senate only by 63-36, three votes short of the
two-thirds needed. Democrats conceded they remained unsure of just
where the remaining support could be found.
   ``We'll consult the stars,'' cracked Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the former presidential
candidate, appeared at the rally and declared: ``The president
should sign the bill.''
   When reminded that he had voted against the legislation,
Gephardt said that was due to special circumstances _ House-Senate
conferees had dropped his plan for mandatory trade retaliation
against countries running large trade surpluses with the United
States.

   The Air Force announced Thursday it would
change the name of Blytheville Air Force Base in Arkansas later
this month to honor aviation pioneer and World War II hero Gen. Ira
C. Eaker.
   The change in name to Eaker Air Force Base will occur during
ceremonies May 26 at the facility, the Air Force said. Gen. Larry
D. Welch, the service's chief of staff, will preside.
   The Blytheville base was first established as an Army Air Force
pilot training school in 1942. The Strategic Air Command assumed
control of the facility in 1958 and it currently is the home of the
97th Bombardment Wing and the 42nd Air Division.
   Eaker, who died last August, received a Congressional Gold Medal
for his accomplishments in aviation and the military. He
established a world record for flight endurance in 1929 and then
participated in the first transcontinental flight using aerial
refueling techniques in 1930.
   During World War II, he commanded the Eighth Air Force and later
all U.S. Army Air Forces in Britain. Eaker became
commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces in 1944.
   Eaker retired from the Air Force in 1947 and worked later as the
head of the Hughes Aircraft Co. and as a vice president and
director of the Douglas Aircraft Co.

   A 450-pound Siberian tiger named Miguel crashed
through a window to attack and kill an employee at the Houston Zoo
this morning, zoo officials said.
   Ricardo Tovar, 59, was killed after the tiger went crashed
through a 2{-foot-wide window that was part of his cage, said John
Werler, zoo director.
   ``It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' said Houston Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw.
   Shaw said Tovar, a 10-year-employee of the zoo, was found by a
co-worker about five minutes after the 7:45 a.m. attack. The tiger
was outside in a natural habitat display while Tovar was in an
interior hallway when the attack occurred.
   The tiger crashed through a window, attacked the zookeeper and
dragged him outside. The animal ran into an enclosed part of its
cage after zoo curator Tom Dieckow fired three shots and sprayed a
fire extinguisher to scare it. The animal was not wounded.
   Werler said the Siberian tiger would probably not be destroyed
because it is an endangered species.
   The tiger initially was reported to be named ``Rambo,'' the
other male Siberian tiger at the zoo. One of Tovar's jobs was to
feed the big cats.
   About 90 minutes after the attack, an orange sheet was draped
over what appeared to be a body on the ground at the zoo's tiger
display. The display was roped off with yellow tape.
   The zoo opened for business about 10:30, about 30 minutes later
than usual.
   The tiger has been isolated in its cage, officials said.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight types of tigers and
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

   The cover of Prince's new album,
``Lovesexy,'' reveals most of the rock star, but it may not be easy
to find.
   ``Between 75 (percent) and 90 percent of our customers are going
to take a pass on it,'' said David Lieberman, chairman of
Bloomington-based Lieberman Enterprises, which stocks record
departments in such department and discount stores as Sears,
Wal-Mart, Pamida and ShopKo.
   ``They find it objectionable. They sell general merchandise.
They're very sensitive to their customers' sensibilities,''
Lieberman said.
   He declined to specify which stores would not sell ``Lovesexy,''
which has a cover photo of Prince in the nude, his legs
strategically placed.
   The album was scheduled to arrive in record outlets Tuesday, but
many stores nationwide, including the Target chain, have rejected
it, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Thursday. Other shops
will stock the album but keep it behind the counter, the newspaper
said.
   ``We're surprised at the reaction,'' said Alan Leeds, operations
manager for PRN Productions, Prince's Chanhassen-based business
operation. ``The cover represents what he wants it to represent. If
it's misconstrued, it's just part of the risk of being an artist.''

   The movie ``Dead Heat'' might be dead meat by
the time actor Joe Piscopo gets done promoting it.
   ``It's an interesting thing because it's not really my kind of
film. I want to just wholeheartedly say, `It's the greatest thing
in the world,' but there's too much blood and violence in it for
me,'' Piscopo said during a West Coast visit.
   The movie, about a live police officer and a dead one who try to
catch the man who killed and resurrected the dead cop, opened
Friday to poor reviews. The dead character, portrayed by Treat
Williams, decomposes during the film.
   Piscopo, who rose to fame on television's ``Saturday Night
Live'' and now stars in a number of beer commercials, said most
comedy roles are those of losers.
   ``I don't want to be another (jerk) on the screen. That's why I
did `Dead Heat,' because it's a real (physical) role,'' he said.
   But it wasn't the right role for him, he said, noting that even
``a guy as brilliant as Robin Williams'' did half a dozen films
before he found the right role in ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''

   The Navy accidentally destroyed film
confiscated from a newspaper photographer who was accused of
sailing too close to a shipyard where Trident submarines are built,
a photo editor said today.
   Five rolls of color film were taken April 22 from photographer
Stanley Badz of the Florida Times-Union after he and a reporter
were detained for allegedly sailing too close to a restricted area
at the Electric Boat Shipyard in Groton, Conn.
   Navy officials told the newspaper they would process the film
and return any parts not considered sensitive, said Times-Union
photo editor Don Burk.
   But a week later the Navy reported the color film accidentally
had been destroyed in processing, along with numerous rolls of Navy
film, Burk said.
   The captain of the boat used by the Times-Union denied sailing
too close to the site. The Trident submarine Pennsylvania was
launched from the boatyard the following day.
   A memo from Naval investigator Ronald J. Possanza said, ``I
regret any inconvenience this has caused you.''
   The ruined film was returned to the paper and appeared to have
been fogged before full processing, said Burk.
   The newspaper is awaiting further information before deciding
what action to take, he said.
   A roll of black-and-white film confiscated at the same time is
still being reviewed, Burk said.

   A flip of a Kennedy half-dollar in a Christian County courtroom
Wednesday decided a 129-vote tie between her and Alderman Ray

   Ms. Williamson lost to Pauley in the Democratic primary but
waged a write-in campaign in the general election. The initial
results were a 129-to-109 victory for Pauley.
   But Ms. Williamson took those results to court, and 20 write-in
votes which had been disallowed were counted in her favor. A judge
ordered the coin flip.
   ``I've had two bottles of champagne on ice for a year, and now
we will celebrate,'' said the ecstatic victor.
   Pauley had no comment, but his wife said he won't appeal.

   Shell Oil Co. workmen with respirator gear
Thursday were gathering asbestos scattered by last week's refinery
explosion that killed seven people, state officials said.
   Mike McDaniel, a Department of Environmental Quality assistant
secretary, revealed Wednesday that asbestos, which has been linked
to lung cancer and lung disease, was dispersed with other debris by
the blast at the Shell plant.
   Debris containing asbestos has been found near the plant on the
east bank of the Mississippi River, as well as on the west bank in
Boutte, McDaniel said.
   Residents who find debris should leave it alone and contact
Shell, he said.
   Gus Von Bodungen of the state's air quality division said he
doubts any public exposure to asbestos from the blast has been
serious.
   But the Department of Environmental Quality does not know how
much asbestos was scattered or how many people may have come in
contact with it.
   State personnel are surveying both sides of the river to
determine how wide dispersal of the fibers has been.
   The pre-dawn explosion at the refinery plant injured 42 people
and damaged homes in Norco. It was felt as far as 40 miles away and
caused minor damage in New Orleans, 20 miles away.

   Viio, 49, was showing off a new safety vest and tether he
designed in front of police, Coast Guardsmen, city River Rescue

   The Swedish inventor climbed atop a 10-foot ladder Wednesday on

edge, Viio allowed himself to fall until the tether and vest broke
his plunge about 20 feet below the bridge.

   Surfing could become an endangered sport

   Surfers have lost privileges to park in two popular spots where

   Israeli warplanes blasted a Palestinian
guerrilla base south of Beirut today in the eighth air raid on
Lebanon this year, police said.
   They said six fighter-bombers rocketed the targets near the
Kharroub region town of Barja in three bombing runs. Barja is 16
miles south of Beirut.
   The raid began at 6:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. There was no
immediate report of casualties or damage.
   Police said the target appeared to be a base of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   They said from the Lebanese port of Sidon, nine miles south of
Barja, that smoke could be seen billowing from the bombed base.
   In Jerusalem, the military command said Israeli warplanes raided
guerrilla bases north of Sidon. The brief statement said all
Israeli planes returned safely to their bases and that pilots
reported accurate hits on their targets.
   The attacking planes drew anti-aircraft fire, but no hits were
claimed, the Lebanese police said.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, headed by former Syrian army Captain Ahmed Jibril, is
based in Syria and bankrolled by Libya.
   The group has claimed responsibility for an attack into northern
Israel last November in which a guerrilla flying a motorized hang
glider killed six Israeli soldiers and wounded eight before he was
shot dead.
   Forty-nine people were killed and 71 wounded in the seven
previous Israeli air raids this year. In the last raid May 9, which
Israel never confirmed, helicopter gunships pounded the southern
Lebanese village of Kabrikha, destroying a house.
   Security sources said the house might have been used by
guerrillas to launch cross-border attacks into northern Israel.

   An explosion and fire at a metals plant today
killed one person, injured at least eight others and prompted the
evacuation of neighboring businesses, officials said.
   Fire Chief James McNamee said the fire started in a metal dust
collector at the Mineral Met Inc. plant on the city's east side.
   ``The dust collector blew up and spread these flaming metal
chips and debris all over and started the fire,'' said McNamee.
   ``The whole building shook,'' said Clark Oil & Chemical Co.
sales representative Linda Weiss, in a building across the street.
``It (fire) was shooting out of the top of the building.''
   Denise Sobola, a secretary at Mineral Met, said there were 29
people in the plant when the blast hit. The dead man was identified
only as a temporary worker hired from an employment service.
   The plant processes powdered metal into a substance used in
metal rod coatings, workers said.
   ``I think my ceiling fell in _ I'm not sure _ behind me. But I
just ran out the side door,'' said Ms. Sobola. She said workers
were ``just running out and collapsing outside the doors.''
   A hazardous materials team of the Cleveland Fire Department was
at the scene. The fire was controlled about noon.
   ``The dust was so heavy you couldn't see in front of your
face,'' said Mark Eakman, a chemist for Clark. He described the
Mineral Met building as a one-story concrete block structure.
   Kim Chambers, a supervisor at Precision Coating, next door to
Mineral Met, said he saw a cloud of smoke before the explosion.
   ``It just went boom. It shattered the windows upstairs in the
(Precision Coating) building,'' he said. Chambers said he helped a
truck driver off the street who hurt his leg running from the
Mineral Met building.
   Sue Dawson, spokeswoman for Cleveland Metropolitan General
Hospital, said six people were being treated there. Two were in
fair condition and one was in good condition; the conditions of the
other three were not released.
   Maria Tayek, spokeswoman for St. Vincent Charity Hospital, said
two men were being treated there. She said the victims included a
34-year-old man in stable condition with an injured left foot and a
40-year-old man in good condition with injuries to his right leg
and back.

<TEXT>
   The Tass news agency eulogized Harold ``Kim''
Philby on Thursday as a master spy who carried out heroic and
seemingly impossible feats to protect the Soviet Union from Western
agents.
   Philby died Wednesday in Moscow, where he had lived since
defecting to the Soviet Union in 1963. As a rising star in British
intelligence, the upper crust Englishman spied for the Soviets for
26 years. He eventually became a decorated KGB officer.
   ``On May 11, 1988, in the 77th year of his life, the remarkable
Soviet intelligence officer Kim Philby died,'' the official news
agency reported in a brief dispatch.
   Tass did not elaborate on the circumstances of Philby's death or
say where it occurred. The British Foreign Office said Wednesday
that Philby had died in Moscow.
   With three colleagues, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony
Blunt, the Cambridge-educated Philby turned Britain's most precious
secrets over to the Kremlin.
   ``For a long time, Kim Philby was engaged in exceptionally
delicate work, or, better said, a struggle directly within the
special services of the capitalist countries whose thrust was
spearheaded against the Soviet Union and the world's progressive
movement,'' Tass said.
   ``These were years of truly Titanic nervous stress which
required the whole of his spiritual and physical forces,'' Tass
said. ``Not infrequently Philby was able to accomplish things which
seemed well-nigh impossible to achieve.''
   Tass called Philby's activities ``heroic'' and ``multifaceted
and vast in their geographic sweep.''
   ``In 1963, having successfully accomplished a regular
assignment, Kim Philby came to Moscow, where he continued the work
that had become the reason and content of his entire life,'' Tass
said.
   ``Being an internationalist, Kim Philby loved his own English
people, valued their spiritual richnesses and believed in their
happy future,'' Tass said.
   While spying for Moscow, Philby sent many Western agents to
their deaths. He was even able to head off the defection of a
Soviet diplomat who threatened to expose him.
   For his services to Soviet intelligence, Philby was awarded the
nation's highest decoration, the Order of Lenin, and other awards
including the Red Banner and the Order of the Patriotic War, First
Class, Tass said.
   After an initial hero's welcome in Moscow, Philby sank into
obscurity and confessed in an interview with a British newspaper
earlier this year that he went through depression and began
drinking heavily when he believed that the Soviet KGB had no
further use for him.
   But Philby told Phillip Knightley of the Sunday Times in his
first and only interview with a Western publication since his
defection that he had no regrets, except for personal friends he
had lost.
   Asked ``Would you do it all again?'' Philby replied,
``Absolutely.''
   Philby said then that he had found peace, was happy in his
fourth marriage, to a Soviet woman, and that he felt at home in the
Soviet Union.
   He told Radio Moscow last November he wanted to be buried in the
Soviet Union, ``which I considered to be my country since the
1930s.''
   The Tass announcement of his death gave no details of funeral
arrangements.

   A truck driver shot two workers at a
food distribution company at close range today, critically injuring
both before he gave himself up, officials said.
   Police said the gunman, an independent trucker from Missouri,
went to the Wilson Certified Express company and shot Larry Fritz
Meyer, 30, of Des Moines, and Jack Jones, 39, of Friendswood,
Texas, with a .380-caliber pistol.
   Charged with two counts of attempted murder was Sam Lacy, 48, of
Blue Springs, Mo., police said.
   As he was being led away, Lacy yelled to reporters that the
company had discriminated against him and taken everything away
from him.
   Authorities said that just before the shooting, Lacy's truck
tractor was found destroyed by fire in a parking lot behind a
nearby store. The state fire marshal's office was investigating the
cause of the fire.
   The sheriff's office said a load of oranges and lemons that Lacy
was supposed to be driving from California to Wisconsin had not
been located.
   Glenn McDole, chief of the Polk County Patrol Division, said
that after the shooting, Lacy handed ammunition to a receptionist
and put his gun down on a bookcase. After his arrest Lacy said he
would not talk to anyone but his wife, McDole said.
   ``The company called us. We had an officer near by. He (the
suspect) laid the gun down, and went and sat down and gave up,''
said McDole.
   ``We kind of locked our doors and stayed inside,'' said a
receptionist at Mid-Continent Bottlers, a company which shares the
office building with Wilson.
   Meyer was reported in critical condition at Iowa Methodist
Medical Center, suffering from two gunshot wounds to the chest,
while Jones also was in critical condition at Mercy Hospital
Medical Center with a single chest wound.
   A man answering the telephone at the company said there would be
no immediate comment. As employees left the building, they told
reporters they had been instructed not to comment.

<TEXT>
   Chocolate milk, that longtime
mainstay of kids' lunches, won't be on the elementary schools' menu
come fall because the school board thinks it's unhealthy for
growing minds.
   Instead, a calcium-fortified orange drink may be offered.
   Some teachers and nurses who have expressed concern about
children having sweets at lunch requested the ban, Superintendent
Robert J. Moore said Wednesday.
   The panel voted 5-4 this week to discontinue selling chocolate
milk at lunch to the 4,000 pupils in the township's 10 elementary
schools.
   Moore said several school employees said they noticed children
who drank chocolate milk for lunch showed signs of hyperactivity in
the afternoon.
   ``Whether that's scientifically qualified, I don't know,'' Moore
said.
   Chocolate milk outsells regular milk 2-1 at Aletta Crichton
Elementary School, Principal Gerald L. DeClementi said.
   ``That's eight cases of chocolate to four cases of white a
day,'' he said.
   DeClementi said he was unaware of behavior problems that might
be tied to the chocolate milk.
   Both he and Moore said they doubt the ban will provoke an outcry.
   But if it does, school board President Thomas Bridge said the
panel could change its decision.
   Bridge, who cast the tie-breaking vote, said he was a fan of the
banished beverage.
   ``I love chocolate milk,'' Bridge said. ``But yes, there is a
lot of merit to the fact that chocolate has an effect on children.''

<TEXT>
   A man accused of the Christmas holiday
slayings of 14 relatives and two other people was convicted today
of capital murder and five counts of attempted capital murder.
   R. Gene Simmons' defense had rested this morning without
presenting any evidence. The jury deliberated for 84 minutes.
   Simmons was on trial for a Dec. 28 rampage that left two people
dead and four injured. He is to be tried in the other 14 killings
in July.
   Capital murder applies to crimes involving multiple killings
under Arkansas law, and the jury was to consider the sentence this
afternoon. There are only two sentences for a person convicted of
capital murder _ life imprisonment without parole or death.
   The circuit court jury also reduced a kidnapping charge to
first-degree false imprisonment and convicted Simmons on that
charge. The attempted murder charges referred to the four people
Simmons wounded, plus another person who was fired at but was not
hit.
   Circuit Court Judge John S. Patterson read the jury's verdicts
to a standing room only crowd of about 100.
   Viola O'Shields, and her husband, Roger, relatives of some of
the Simmons' family victims, were pleased. Tears welling in her
eyes, Mrs. O'Shields displayed a photograph of Simmons' late
17-year-old Loretta and said, ``Isn't it a shame.''
   Simmons, 47, had no immediate reaction to the verdict.
   ``The evidence in this case is strong; it's stout,'' said
Prosecutor John Bynum during a 32-minute closing statement this
morning.
   The defense's closing argument lasted 34 minutes, most of it by
Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin, who contended that there was a lack of
evidence to support a contention of premeditation and deliberation.
   Irwin also said there were no tests to link Simmons to the
murder weapons and other evidence. Bynum said such tests were
unnecessary when witnesses testified about details and the police
chief had testified that Simmons handed him the murder weapon.
   The state rested late Wednesday and Patterson denied defense
motions for directed verdicts and dismissal of the charges. The
defense rested this morning.
   A route salesman who chatted with Simmons testified Wednesday
that a month before the Christmas-time killings began, Simmons was
talking about settling some scores.
   Simmons ``said he had a few people in town he would like to get
even with,'' Paul Epperson, 49, told the jury. ``Rusty Taylor was
the only name he called.''
   The state contends that on Dec. 28, 1987, Simmons shot six
people, including Taylor; two of the six died. After Simmons
surrendered, police searched his home and found the bodies of 14
family members, all shot to death or strangled.
   Epperson was the last of 30 state witnesses who testified in
Franklin County Circuit Court in the trial of Simmons on a charge
of capital murder for the slaying of two people plus five counts of
attempted capital murder and one count of kidnapping. Simmons could
face the death penalty if convicted.
   Epperson said his talk with Simmons, 47, took place in a small
Russellville market where Simmons was a cashier and to which
Epperson delivered bread and cake on a daily route.
   A state ballistics expert, Paul McDonald, testified that
markings on bullets taken from the two murder victims showed they
had been fired by the same nine-shot revolver that Simmons handed
to police when he surrendered.
   Killed were Kathy Kendrick, 24, at a Russellville law firm where
she worked and James Chaffin, 33, at a Russellville oil company. A
man also was wounded and a woman shot at, but not hit, at the oil
company.
   Police said Ms. Kendrick once refused Simmons' amorous
attentions.
   Bullets recovered from the market, where Simmons had quit his
job 10 days before the shooting, came from the same pistol,
McDonald said. Two people were wounded at the market.
   Simmons also allegedly shot a former co-worker at a freight
company, Joyce Butts.
   Mrs. Butts, whose husband assisted her to and from the witness
box, said she and Simmons once had a bad encounter while they
worked together. Later, after she told him to do a better job with
some of the accounts he was handling, ``he got angry,'' she said.
``He screamed. He shouted acrss the office that he didn't get paid
enough,'' which led to a discussion about how he had treated her on
that previous occasion.
   Mrs. Butts was shot in the back of the head and the bullet went
into her heart, for which she underwent open heart surgery. The
shooting let her unable to bend her left leg and with poor vision.
   Vicki Jackson, who the state says was taken hostage at the
freight company after Mrs. Butts was shot, testified earlier
Wednesday.
   ``Vicki, I'm not going to hurt you,'' Ms. Jackson said Simmons
told her as he held a gun to her temple. ``I came to kill Joyce. I
got everybody that hurt me. I'm not going to hurt you.''

<HEAD>Forest Service Agents Seek Increased Powers Against Pot Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest Service officials asked Congress on
Thursday for ``hot pursuit'' authority against marijuana growers in
national forests whose illicit crops are protected by powerful
weapons and snarling guard dogs that respond to commands sent
through radio-equipped collars.
   William L. Rice, deputy chief of the Agriculture Department
agency that oversees 191 million acres of national forests and
grasslands, said his law enforcement agents are severely hampered
by a legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana growers beyond
the boundaries of federal lands.
   Frank G. Packwood, a Forest Service special agent assigned to
Shasta-Trinity National Forest in northern California, blamed the
lack of ``hot pursuit'' for the poor success rate in prosecuting
growers who cultivate the potent variety of marijuana known as
``California gold'' in his region.
   The request for statutory authority to pursue those engaged in
what Rice called ``a major billion-dollar criminal industry'' in
national forests was endorsed by Sens. Tom Harkins, D-Iowa, and
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., at a Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearing.
   ``These marijuana gardens are protected by a Marquis de Sade
torture chamber of devices intended to main, cripple or kill
intruders,'' Fowler said. ``Hunters and hikers have been injured in
these booby traps.''
   Rice said heavily armed marijuana growers forced the Forest
Service to close 886,000 acres of national forest lands last year
as unsafe for visitors, commercial interests and federal employees.
   The witness table at the hearing was littered with samples of
weapons used by marijuana growers to keep intruders away.
   Among them were a Uzi submachine gun, hand grenades, makeshift
shotguns attached to rat traps and trip wires, boards studded with
heavy nails and triple fish hooks designed to be strung at eye
level from tree branches.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., testified that during one raid on a
methamphetamine laboratory near a national forest in southern
Oregon, the county sheriff ``seized a cache of weapons that could
outfit a small army.''
   He said they included 51 machine guns, semi-automatic rifles,
anti-aircraft guns and other automatic weapons, 100,000 rounds of
ammunition and 150 pounds of gunpowder.
   Forest Service officials said the growers also set out poisoned
feed to kill wildlife that eat marijuana plants, and sabotage the
equipment of timber workers and other commercial operators.
   The growers train guard dogs to respond to commands to attack
intruders when an electrical shock is activated in their collars by
a remote radio signal, the hearing was told.
   ``These people mean business,'' Wyden said.
   ``These are modern-day moonshiners,'' Harkin said, ``but they
are a lot more sophisticated than the old moonshiners.''
   Rice said the Forest Service eradicated more than 250,000
marijuana plants from 220 cultivation sites last year, about 40
percent of all the marijuana being produced in national forests.
   But agent Packwood said eradication efforts are not enough.
``The solution lies in increased arrests, thorough investigations,
aggressive prosecutions and sentences that clearly establish a
deterrent to the temptation to spend six months and `earn' half a
million dollars tax-free,'' he said.
   Wyden, declaring that the $14 billion domestic marijuana
industry is ``threatening the quality of life all over the West,''
urged support for his bill to grant Forest Service agents to
conduct investigations, searches, seizures and arrests outside
national forests where drug crimes occur.
   He also proposed to strengthen federal penalties for
unauthorized use of fertilizers and chemical herbicides in national
forests, and to stiffen the maximum penalties for marijuana
cultivation on those lands.
   Forest Service officials said the maximum federal penalty for
using booby traps or other weapons at illicit marijuana farms now
is 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Additional penalties for
marijuana cultivation depend on the amounts involved, they said.

Blunt, the ``fourth man''</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Harold ``Kim'' Philby is dead, but the bitter
aftertaste of his colossal betrayal still lingers in Britain.
   Even 25 years after the privileged English gentleman was
unmasked as Moscow's highest-placed mole in Western intelligence,
central questions remain unanswered:
   Were there others of higher rank? Were the operations of Western
intelligence agencies compromised more seriously than they realize?
When Philby gave his only interview to a Western journalist four
months before he died, was it part of a new plot by his KGB masters
to discredit the British and undermine their relationship with
Washington?
   A tribute to Philby came Thursday, the day after he died at age
76, from Peter Wright, a former British intelligence officer.
   Wright has done much to keep the scandal alive with his
allegation that an even higher mole existed: the late Sir Roger
Hollis, who directed the MI5 security service from 1956 to 1965.
Wright's claim is in his volume of memoirs, called ``Spycatcher,''
which is banned in Britain.
   In a statement from Australia, where he now lives, Wright called
Philby ``an outstanding man in the intelligence world.''
   Philby became a Soviet agent while at Cambridge University in
the 1930s, joined the secret service and rose to high rank. He was
believed to be in line to head MI6, the sister service of MI5.
   His network unraveled in 1951 with the defection of Guy Burgess
and Donald Maclean to Moscow, but Philby escaped exposure for 12
more years. In 1963 he, too, defected.
   In 1964 the ``fourth man,'' Anthony Blunt, confessed he had
worked for the Soviets while in MI5 and received immunity in
exchange for information about the other three. His treason was
kept secret and he eventually became art adviser to Queen Elizabeth
II, receiving a knighthood.
   Blunt's past was made public in 1979 and he was stripped of his
honors. He died in London in 1983.
   The damage to British security, which shared secrets with
Washington, is incalculable. Now that all four of ``Stalin's
Englishmen'' finally are dead, the suspicion persists that there
were five.
   Wright's claim about Hollis, whether true or not, illustrates
the doubt that still eats at the British security services because
of Philby's treachery.
   ``It's bad for morale, and it's actually bad for operations,''
said Rupert Allason, a Conservative member of Parliament and who
writes histories and analyses of espionage under the name Nigel
West.
   He said the suspicions mean intelligence analysts must ask
themselves constantly whether the files they use contain ``tainted
information'' left by the traitors.
   Philby still was a KGB officer when he died, and intelligence
experts here believe the lengthy interview he gave in January to
Phillip Knightley of The Sunday Times was a KGB operation.
   ``The Soviets had things in mind that they wanted to
accomplish,'' said Miles Copeland, a retired CIA officer living in
England.
   Copeland and Allason, in separate interviews, said the purpose
was to revive U.S. suspicions of British intelligence generated by
the Philby affair.
   They pointed to remarks by Philby to Knightley in which he
hinted that other traitors remained in British intelligence and
that the British could not be trusted to keep secrets.
   Allason said Philby had clearly hinted to Knightley that there
were other moles, still undiscovered.
   He also saw hidden purpose in letting Knightley see how
comfortable and privileged Philby was in his adopted homeland. ``It
was a carrot to other people'' who might want to defect, Allason
said.
   Copeland noted Philby's recollection of a British intelligence
official taking classified files with him when he retired. The
traitor's aim, Copeland thinks, was to show once again that secret
British files are not leakproof.
   Apart from all this is the question of what possessed this
epitome of the English gentry to devote himself to communism and
treachery.
   Author Malcolm Muggeridge, once a close friend, blamed the
double agent's father Harry St. John Philby, the celebrated
explorer and expert in Arabic.
   ``Kim could never be the towering figure his father was, so he
compensated for it by defying him and all he stood for in the most
appalling manner,'' Muggeridge told The Times of London.
   He called Philby ``a cad's cad.'' Allason called him ``a
grotesquely unpleasant man who betrayed everyone he came in contact
with, including his close friends and family.''
   Philby, born in India and raised in the Middle East, wrote that
he felt little conventional English patriotism. He said he embraced
communism at Cambridge because Britain was not challenging German
militarism, and communism alone seemed to offer resistance.
   An editorial in the conservative Daily Telegraph said he
deserved only contempt.
   ``The convention whereby the dead should be judged charitably
demands suspension in the case of Kim Philby,'' it said. ``He has
died impenitent, glorying in his own treason.''

   Soldiers closed Arab schools
months ago, but children are back in class, reciting lessons in
unfinished buildings, mosques and churches with the added spice of
defying the Israeli occupiers.
   About 60 youngsters aged 6 to 12 study math, English, Arabic,
history and geography in bedrooms of an incomplete villa on a rocky
hillside _ peering out during the multiplication tables, as
children do, at yellow flowers in the valley.
   Secret schools are different, and to many students an adventure.
The children do not have to wear uniforms, classes are
coeducational, and some children from private Moslem and Christian
schools are studying together.
   The army closed all 820 West Bank schools Feb. 2, sending home
300,000 elementary and secondary students. Schools in the Gaza
Strip have been closed for days at a time, but the army has not
shut down the entire system.
   Israeli officials said schools had become assembly points for
the anti-Israeli rebellion that began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Leaflets issued this week by the uprising's clandestine
leadership urge more secret schools to get started. Those already
operating include half a dozen in Bir Zeit, 12 miles north of
Jerusalem.
   The underground schools symbolize the transformation of the
5-month-old revolt, which has claimed the lives of 186 Arabs and
two Israelis. There is far less street violence now, but the air of
defiance is little diminished.
   Teachers and students interviewed at the ``people's schools''
agreed that challenging Israel's authority was a significant reason
for organizing the classes.
   ``Because the Israelis closed the schools, we come here to show
that we can break their rules,'' said Amjad Shibli, 16. His school
``uniform'' was brown jeans and yellow and black running shoes.
   Amjad was among about 75 teen-agers attending high school
classes in an unfinished building behind the city hall. He said he
had spent the past three months working in his father's cafe and
sometimes joined other youths in throwing stones at Israeli
soldiers.
   Rocks intended to slow Israeli vehicles are scattered in streets
leading to the makeshift high school. The pavement near another
school had been blackened by bonfires of tires burned as protest
barricades.
   The military government, known as the Civil Administration,
closed four universities as well as the lower schools because many
protests began on the campuses.
   ``Schools were closed because the children didn't want to study.
They had become a place for disturbances and violence,'' said
Olivier Rabovitch, a spokesman for army administration.
   He said protests had decreased dramatically in recent weeks and
the schools might be allowed to reopen if the situation remained
calm.
   An Arab teacher who identified himself only as Professor M.
said: ``The Israelis have kept the schools closed as a general
punishment of the population.'' He is a lecturer at the shuttered
Bir Zeit University and organized most of the underground schools
that opened here two weeks ago.
   Thirty-seven parents, university graduates and laid-off
university teachers were recruited to conduct classes for several
hundred volunteer students in Bir Zeit, Professor M. said.
   He said regular teachers, who are Civil Administration
employees, refused to help because Israeli authorities threatened
to dismiss them.
   Professor M. acknowledged ``an element of challenge'' to the
army in organizing the schools, but he and other teachers said
their main concern was seeing that the children did not fall too
far behind in their studies.
   Although many classes are coeducational, some Moslem families
send their children to study in mosques, where boys attend in the
morning and girls in the afternoon.
   At the unfinished villa on the hill, Assad Sayegh, a 26-year-old
economics graduate of Bir Zeit University, was teaching math to 14
pupils aged aged 8 and 9 who sat in small chairs against the
unpainted concrete walls. His blackboard and textbooks were
spirited from the government school.
   Sayegh said the youngsters were taught the politics of the
``intefadeh,'' or uprising, but a reporter saw no evidence of
indoctrination in the classes visited.
   ``The government wants to keep the Palestinian people
empty-headed,'' Sayegh said. ``That way Palestinians can't make
bombs or fly airplanes. They want all the knowledge for themselves
so Palestinians can't destroy the Jewish government.''

   Two Iranian factions clashed Thursday
during a demonstration against Israel's occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and three Iranians were stabbed, police said.
   Chief superintendent Evert Karlen said three men were arrested
on suspicion of attempted murder. One of the victims had
life-threatening wounds, police said.
   Fighting broke out after about 40 demonstrators, some carrying
pictures of Iran's revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, gathered in Stockholm's central square to protest Israeli
policy.
   A group of anti-Khomeini activists arrived and the rival groups
shouted slogans at each other. Fighting broke out despite the
presence of police on horseback and in riot gear.
   The Swedish national news agency TT said about 100 demonstrators
gathered outside a Stockholm hospital after the clash to protest
the stabbings.

   The first decline in an annual index of
American health practices illustrates there is a big difference
between people knowing they should eat right and exercise and
actually doing it, authorities said Thursday.
   Dr. James Michael McGinnis, a federal health official, said the
drop underscores the need for leaders ``to redouble our efforts to
convince Americans that health promotion ideas are not a fad.''
   Despite extensive publicity in recent years about the value of
proper diet and exercise, the 1988 survey by Prevention magazine
showed few gains in those areas, McGinnis, director of the Office
of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, noted.
   In particular, he told reporters it is ``an issue of some
concern that we haven't seen improvement'' in the number of people
who told pollsters they ``try a lot to avoid eating too much fat.''
   Only 54 percent answered ``yes'' to that question, down from 56
percent in the 1987 report. The latest result also is down from the
55 percent who gave a ``yes'' response in polling done for the
initial index in 1984.
   The overall 1988 Prevention Index stood at 64.8 out of a
possible 100 _ down from 65.2 last year but 3.3 points above the
first index in 1984.
   However, the overall gain from 1984 is due largely to sharp
jumps in the number of people who have smoke detectors in their
homes, a 15 percent jump; and the number who report wearing auto
seatbelts, a 38 percent climb.
   McGinnis complimented the commercial magazine for compiling the
index, noting that is the only survey that has tracked trends in 21
specific areas over a five-year period.
   ``One clear message from this year's survey is that the spread
of good health habits is not automatic,'' said Thomas Dybdahl,
director of the Prevention Index.
   ``People may know more than ever about good health, but they may
not be acting on what they know. In key areas such as diet,
exercise and weight control, there is still much room for
improvement.''
   For example, the number saying they are making efforts to limit
high-cholesterol foods fell from 46 percent in the 1987 report to
42 percent this year, the same as it was in 1984.
   Compared with 1984, there was a two-percentage-point drop in the
number who said they try to avoid too many sweets and three-point
decline in the number who said they get seven or eight hours sleep
most nights.
   Although up two points from the 1984 report, only 35 percent of
Americans say they exercise strenuously three or more days a week
and only 24 percent say they are at their proper weight, up one
point from 1984.
   Seventy-two percent say they do not smoke, the same as last year
and up two points from 1984.
   Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris and Associates, which
conducts the poll that forms the basis for the index, described the
figures on diet and nutrition as ``amazingly flat'' from a
statistical viewpoint.
   Taylor said the lack of significant improvement in the diet and
exercise portions of the five-year survey show a gap between ``lip
service and good intentions'' and actual practice.
   Weight control is ``a truly dismal story,'' he said, noting that
76 percent of Americans think they are overweight. ``We remain the
most obese country in the world,'' he said.
   Harris pollsters ask the same questions each year to give an
accurate year-to-year comparison.
   The current year's report was based on telephone interviews
conducted with 1,250 randomly selected adults Nov. 11-25 and has a
3 percent margin of error.
   Taylor acknowledged that the typically small year-to-year
changes registered in the survey often fall within the margin of
error.
   However, he said the theoretical chance for error is largely
overriden because consistent trends tracked over the five-year
sampling period give added credence to the figures reported in any
one year.
   The single-number Prevention Index itself is derived by
assigning weights to each of the 21 survey questions and applying
poll results to that relative value scale.
   For example, not smoking is assigned the highest ranking _ 9.78
on a scale of one to 10.

<BYLINE>Hypnosis Blocks Pain By Changing Brain's Functioning, Study
Suggests

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who can make their hands go numb through
hypnosis show a marked change in brain waves, suggesting that a
trance blocks pain by altering the brain's processing of
information, a new study says.
   Hypnotized people who create a pain-blocking hallucination may
essentially be reducing the signal on normal sensory circuits and
turning instead to imagination-linked circuits, said researcher
David Spiegel.
   ``These findings provide evidence for the objective as well as
subjective reality'' of hypnotic hallucinations that affect the
sense of feel, Spiegel said Wednesday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association.
   Hypnosis is a state of aroused and concentrated attention,
similar to getting lost in a good book. Scientists have known for a
century that hypnotism can reduce pain, but they do not know how.
   Spiegel said the new findings provide a starting point for
further exploration of the cause.
   He and two Stanford University colleagues studied 10 highly
hypnotizable people and 10 with little ability to enter a trance.
The brain waves were studied while a series of electrical impulses,
not quite strong enough to cause discomfort, was applied to their
left wrists.
   Each person went through the experience four times. Without
hypnosis, they were told at one time to simply pay attention to
what they felt, and at another time to press a button when they
felt slightly longer pulses.
   Another time, after a procedure to induce a trance, they were
told again to push a button when they felt the longer pulses.
   The fourth time, they were put into a trance and told to imagine
that a local anesthetic was spreading from the fingers of their
left hand up through the forearm. They were told to make the arm
cold, tingling and numb. Then they were told to press the button if
they felt any long electrical pulses.
   The hallucination was more effective in the highly hypnotizable
subjects, who pushed the button after only 38 percent of the long
pulses, than in the low hypnotizables, who felt 80 percent of the
long pulses.
   Without the hallucination, both groups responded to 86 percent
or more of the long pulses either with or without hypnosis.
   The brain waves studied are called ``cortical event-related
potentials,'' which reflect the brain's reponse to a stimulus.
   When researchers looked at the behavior of brain waves about a
tenth of a second after each electrical impulse, they found that in
highly hypnotizable people, the hallucination reduced brain wave
strength by about 45 percent from the level seen without hypnosis.
   In contrast, when the highly hypnotizable people were asked
under hypnosis to pay attention to the impulses, but not create the
numbness in their arm, the wave strength at the one-tenth second
mark rose 35 percent over the level without hypnosis.
   Brain waves in the low hypnotizables showed no such changes.
   The flexibility that the highly hypnotizable people showed in
adjusting the sensory input in the brain fits in well with the
ability of such people to reduce or eliminate pain with hypnosis,
Spiegel said.
   The results are ``a very interesting finding,'' said Fred
Frankel, psychiatrist in chief at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston
and psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School.
   Previous work has shown brain wave differences in visual
hallucinations, he said Thursday in a telephone interview.

   The Reagan administration is discussing a deal
that could result in the dropping of drug trafficking charges
against Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega in exchange for
his agreement to relinquish power, a White House spokesman said
today.
   ``We're still talking'' about such a deal, said chief
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``What this amounts to is
a plea bargain,'' he said. However, the spokesman said no direct
negotiations have taken place with Noriega on the matter.
   Pressed at a briefing later to spell out the legal and other
ramifications of such a deal in this country, Fitzwater said, ``I
offer no definition of plea bargaining.''
   ``I'm not going to speculate on possibilities that we don't know
are going to happen,'' he said. Fitzwater did say, however, that
President Reagan has not talked to Noriega.
   ``The president obviously has directed the negotiations that
have gone on there, but I won't go further,'' the spokesman said.
``Negotiations are continuing, with no agreements reached.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner of Miami, whose office is
prosecuting Noriega, met with Attorney General Edwin Meese III at
the Justice Department in Washington. Kellner left the building
without talking to reporters and Meese declined comment. A
department source said before the meeting that the two men were
expected to discuss the Noriega case.
   Earlier, White House chief of staff Howard Baker, without
actually confirming an offer, told CBS-TV that if such an
arrangement got Noriega out of power, ``that would be the most
fruitful and productive plea bargain that we have seen in a long
time.''
   Reports of an offer brought sharp criticism today from several
senators and Panama's anti-Noriega ambassador to the United States.
   Administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday that Florida drug-trafficking indictments against the de
facto Panamanian ruler would be dropped if he stepped down and left
the country for a year. The sources said the Justice Department
objected to the offer, which was approved at a White House meeting.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said if descriptions of the offer were
accurate, it would appear to be a victory for Noriega, allowing his
loyalists to retain control while he spent ``a year's vacation on
the Riviera.''
   ``If I was a cop in Boston or Miami or somewhere, I'd sit there
and say this administration has sent a signal that crime does
pay,'' Kerry said on the CBS show.
   Kerry such such a deal would be ``a mistake and even an insult
to the efforts of this country to fight a war on drugs.''
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``I think it'd be a
terrible mistake to take the word of a drug-dealing killer dictator
that he's going to get out and allow free elections sometime next
year, and he'd be allowed to stay in until August. And the only
thing you're going to have is a transferance of power to his
cronies.''
   ``For us to be saying that we can trust this man to keep his
word is naive,'' D'Amato said. ``We can only consider dropping the
indictment after Noriega leaves Panama with his henchmen and with
the proviso that President del Valle take over and provide for free
elections.''
   Ambassador Juan Sosa, appearing on the CBS program, said Noriega
opponents cannot accept the dropping of charges without any
arrangements made for next year's election, the restructuring of
the defense forces Noriega controls or the setting up of a
government of reconciliation.
   Sosa also said the obvious differences among U.S. officials on
how to handle Noriega have only helped him.
   He said if Noriega is to leave, he should leave now and not wait
until August, which reportedly would be part of the arrangement
between U.S. officials and Noriega.
   The reported offer is the latest in a series of administration
efforts since February, including U.S. economic sanctions, that
have paralyzed the Panamanian economy but have so far not succeeded
in ousting Noriega. The administration had offered previously not
to extradite Noriega on the drug trafficking charges if he went
into political exile.
   A Panamanian government spokesman said in response to word of
the new offer Wednesday night, ``There has been no agreement about
anything.''
   Panama's official news agency, Panapress, reported Wednesday
night that President Reagan had ``entered in direct contact with
General Noriega,'' but gave no details.
   The Reagan administration has sent a State Department envoy in
recent weeks to talk with Noriega, but a U.S. Embassy spokesman
would not comment when asked whether the envoy met with Noriega or
his representatives Wednesday.
   The news agency said: ``General Noriega has said there can be no
deal if the U.S. aggression and the violation of Panamanian
sovereignty continue.''
   An administration source said Wednesday that if Noriega accepts
the deal, he would step down probably in August and would stay out
of Panama until after the next presidential elections there in 1990.
   The deal was approved Tuesday at a White House meeting over the
objections of the Justice Department, including Meese, the source
said.
   Kellner said he was aware of the proposed deal but did not know
any details.
   ``I was informed that an offer was being made,'' said Kellner,
reached by telephone at his Miami office. ``I have no knowledge of
anything else.''
   In Panama City, the government said Noriega had not agreed to
step down.
   ``There has been no agreement about anything,'' said Boris
Moreno, director of the government's National Information System.
``Such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking
the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation.''
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael G. Kozak went to
Panama early last week and has been conferring there with Noriega
and his representatives ever since, sources said.
   ``The situation in Panama has many aspects and no agreement has
yet been reached,'' State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said
Wednesday night.
   Noriega was charged in a 12-count indictment unsealed in Miami
last Feb. 5 with taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from
Colombia's violent Medellin cartel to protect cocaine shipments,
launder money, supply drug laboratories and shelter the gang's
leaders from law enforcement.
   A separate three-count indictment unsealed the same day in Tampa
accused Noriega of conspiracy to import, distribute and attempt to
import more than 1 million pounds of marijuana.
   Neal Sonnett, one of Noriega's Miami attorneys, said he knew
nothing about the proposal to drop the indictments as part of a
deal to end Panama's crisis, but said he was not surprised by the
reports.
   ``The dismissal of the indictment is something that I have
always insisted would be a prerequisite to any negotiation,'' he
said.
   NBC News, quoting an unidentified American official, said
President Reagan decided to support the proposal after National
Security Council advisers warned that further delay in getting
Noriega out could lead to a political alliance between Noriega and
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

   A holdout juror at the center of a controversy
over the verdict in the nation's first death-by-tampering trial has
admitted that she herself was involved in an earlier tampering
case, according to a report published today.
   Juror Laurel Holliday told the Seattle Times that she sued after
she bit into a cracker that contained an aspirin substitute and
settled the case out of court only two months before she became a
juror in the cyanide case.
   She said she never told court officers of her own case before
she became involved in the trial of Stella Nickell, who was
convicted Monday of killing her husband and another person with
tainted Extra-Strength Excedrin.
   Ms. Holliday, the focus of a jury tampering investigation being
pushed by Mrs. Nickell's attorney, has admitted to being the
holdout juror who broke an 11-1 deadlock on Monday when she changed
her vote.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn, was convicted on five counts of
product tampering and faces a June 17 sentencing in the deaths of
her husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Susan Katherine Snow, 40, of
Auburn. She faces life imprisonment.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer has already ordered the panel
to come back to court Friday, at the request of the defense, to
determine whether the verdict was tainted by outside influece.
   Ms. Holliday had told Dwyer that she got a telephone call last
Friday, while the jury was deliberating, from an anonymous caller
who told her that Mrs. Nickell had failed an FBI lie detector test.
   She told Dwyer the call would not affect her vote and Dwyer
allowed her to remain on the jury until it reached a verdict.
   Mrs. Nickell poisoned her husband to collect his insurance, then
put tainted painkillers on a store shelf to divert suspicion from
herself, according to the prosecution. She faces a maximum penalty
of life in prison.
   In an interview in today's Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Ms.
Holliday, confirmed that she was the holdout in a series of 11-1
votes during five days of deliberations, as indicated earlier by
lawyers and other jurors.
   The Times said that in her own tampering incident, Ms. Holliday
told police her mouth started burning after eating a cracker on
July 31, 1986. She found half of an ibuprofen pill in the uneaten
portion of the cracker, called poison control and vomited, she said.
   Ibuprofen is an aspirin substitute commonly used in
over-the-counter pain relievers. A year later, Ms. Holliday sued
the manufacturer of Goldfish crackers, Pepperidge Farm Inc. The
case was assigned to arbitration and settled out of court for $500.
   There were no witnesses and Pepperidge Farm attorneys questioned
whether the event ever took place.
   Ms. Holliday said she didn't tell the judge or attorneys about
the incident during juror screening because she didn't think it was
important.
   In her interview with the Post-Intelligencer, Ms. Holliday
denied defense attorney Thomas Hillier II's suggestions that she
might have fabricated the report to be excused from deliberations
or that another juror might have made the call.
   ``He is playing his last cards in a desperate attempt to save
his client,'' Ms. Holliday said.
   Ms. Holliday, a real estate agent, told Dwyer before the verdict
Monday that a female voice she did not recognize told her Friday
night that Mrs. Nickell had failed an FBI lie-detector test _ a
fact that had not been admitted as evidence in court.
   Dwyer let her stay on the jury after she said the call wouldn't
influence her deliberations, and Hillier concurred at the time.
   But on Tuesday, after the verdict and learning about the 11-1
votes, Hillier filed a motion asking for permission to question the
12 jurors individually.
   And on Wednesday, Dwyer said ``The court is required by law to
investigate one way or the other'' whether there was jury
tampering. ``It cannot let the matter sit.''
   However, he emphasized that he was ``not suggesting in the
slightest any misconduct by any juror.''
   He told Hillier and assistant U.S. attorney Joanne Maida to
submit questions to him. Dwyer said he would question the jurors
under oath.
   In the newspaper interview, Ms. Holliday expressed skepticism
that the anonymous caller could have been another juror.
   ``I really resent the implication about the truth of the other
jurors,'' she said. ``Hundreds of people knew who the jurors were,
and my name happens to be in the (telephone) book.''
   Names of the jurors were broadcast and published only after the
trial but were given in court during jury selection and were
available from the court clerk during the trial.
   Ms. Holliday said she had no need to fabricate the report
because had she wanted to be excused from the panel, she said, ``I
could have called in sick.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov a
traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic
portrait of the human rights activist and his wife.
   This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that
Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet
Union.
   The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past
charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena
Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.
   Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize
winner has praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social and
economic reform.
   The 66-year-old Sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in
their seventh-floor Moscow apartment, eating cabbage, beet soup,
potatoes and other simple fare, and Sakharov insists on washing the
dishes afterward himself, the paper said.
   It said their two-room home was always filled with people
seeking Sakharov's aid, and that the words most often heard there
are: ``Help me.'' But Moscow News asked: ``Can he really do
everything?''
   Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov to
date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the
nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the
Kremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.
   Sakharov, a brilliant physicist, was allowed to return to Moscow
in December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of
Gorky, where he was banished without trial in January 1980.
   ``In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to
return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on
scientific work,'' Moscow News said. ``Of course, concerning Gorky,
that's a bitter joke.''
   Since his return to Moscow, Sakharov has been a vocal supporter
of Gorbachev's program for nationwide reforms that includes the
policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics.
   ``He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts
of the majority into state policy,'' Moscow News said.``He calls
perestroika (restructuring) an enormous event for our country and
for the entire world.''
   However, Sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving
the Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting in
the Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were
imprisoned for their views.
   Moscow News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled ``Knowledge
and the World,'' Sakharov set forth his views on Soviet affairs.
   Those writings have not been published in the Soviet Union.
   ``Now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then,
and those ideas that we are putting forward today,'' Moscow News
said.
   Sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the
Kremlin. The human rights activist, one of the most prominent
members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the
1970s, sought openness in Soviet society years before ``glasnost''
became Communist Party policy.
   Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm
caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.
   It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in
``oriental luxury'' and engaging in ``scandals between spouses.''
   Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an
undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with
his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and
the demands of this life.
   His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do
the dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov at
his apartment.
   ``What is that, Andrei Dmitrievich, your hobby?'' asked Moscow
News correspondent Gennady Zhavoronkov.
   ``Not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously,''
Sakharov replied.

   Tabatha Foster, the chubby-cheeked tot who
smiled despite adversity, won the hearts of many, and her
supporters say her fight following a historic five-organ transplant
reveals more about life and courage than about medicine.
   ``Through her, God touched the world,'' her uncle, James Foster,
said Thursday. ``He said: `Look, y'all think you got problems, well
look at this girl. Look what she has done.' It brought the highest
and the lowest people together for just a minute.''
   Tabatha, 3{, of Madisonville, Ky., died Wednesday afternoon in
the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh after
an infection in her bloodstream caused her heart, kidneys and liver
to fail.
   The 36-pound, pigtailed child was the world's longest survivor
of a five-organ transplant. She received a new liver, small
intestines, pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon during a
15-hour experimental operation that ended Nov. 1.
   Similar procedures had been performed only twice before, and
both patients died within a few days.
   ``You couldn't help but love that little girl. So many of us
learned so much from her and not just medically,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   ``Tabatha was never down,'' she said. ``When people ask if the
operation was a success, it's hard to measure success. It was a
success because Tabatha lived six additional months and there were
good times.''
   Because of an intestinal deformity, doctors had been forced to
remove 95 percent of Tabatha's small bowel three days after she was
born. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet, which
damaged her own liver.
   Doctors had said Tabatha would soon die without the transplant.
   She was hospitalized for all but seven weeks of her life and
though she said she craved pizza, the only solid food she ever ate
was rice cereal, Ms. Cardillo said.
   Tabatha won the affection of hospital staff with good-natured
teasing, playing peek-a-boo and singing ``The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.''
She walked through hospital halls with an intravenous pole in tow,
wearing her cherished tennis shoes and chatting with anyone.
   Tabatha's hospital room was empty Thursday. The countless
stuffed animals, ``tons and tons'' of cards and a photo of a puppy
recently given to Tabatha have been packed in boxes, Ms. Cardillo
said.
   ``I think it's affected everybody in the hospital from
housekeeping on up. At every level heartstrings are being pulled,''
Ms. Cardillo said.
   Tabatha's parents, Roy and Sandra Foster, quickly checked out of
Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, where they had stayed for
months. Ms. Cardillo said they did not want their whereabouts known
Thursday as they prepared to leave for home.
   Other family members gathered in Madisonville, waiting for the
parents to join them and remembering Tabatha.
   ``She had those fat jaws and was always smiling,'' Foster, 33,
said in a telephone interview. ``She was a survivor. She was a
fighter.''
   Tabatha's aunt, Doris East, 41, of Huntsville, Ala., said the
child taught her to have faith.
   ``She taught me to endure because she did,'' she said.
   Ms. East said the family was grateful the transplant kept
Tabatha alive for a time.
   ``They gave her another day,'' she said. ``It just gave us more
time with her.''
   Foster said it was amazing Tabatha won the affection of people
like President Reagan, who had mentioned Tabatha's plight in a
national radio address in January and contributed $1,000 toward her
medical expenses.
   Well-wishers from around the country, including Frank Sinatra,
donated more than $350,000 to help cover medical expenses for
Tabatha. Much of the money came from black churches. Tabatha was
black.
   ``Tabatha Foster showed us that courage and strength come in all
sizes,'' Kentucky Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, under Republican
attack for lacking foreign policy experience, exchanged warm words
with Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa on Thursday and
criticized reported White House dealing to drop drug charges
against Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Dukakis, before heading west to campaign for primaries in Oregon
and California, also made the rounds among Democrats on Capitol
Hill, winning the endorsement of Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd
and praise from other leaders.
   On Noriega, he said, ``I think before we start talking about
dropping indictments and making deals, the American people deserve
a full explanation of what kind of relationship this administration
has had with Noriega. ... Just exactly what has been going on for
the past 7{ years?
   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug
runners and murderers,'' he said at the Capitol.
   Dukakis began his day by meeting with Tutu in private, focusing
news media coverage on foreign policy, an area that Vice President
George Bush has portrayed as a Dukakis weakness.
   A spokesman for the Massachusetts governor said Dukakis and Tutu
discussed House legislation that would toughen trade sanctions
against South Africa, including a requirement that U.S. companies
get rid of investments in South Africa. Dukakis later told
reporters he supports the legislation ``very strongly.''
   Tutu told reporters he and Dukakis had no points of disagreement.
   ``I don't think we need to give an endorsement, but we know we
would be amongst friends and we would have very, very powerful
friends in the White House if we had a Democrat occupying the White
House,'' Tutu said. ``I know that our people back home would be
very delighted to have a change in the White House.''
   Dukakis praised Tutu for showing courage and leadership, and
said, ``It's time to change our policy and I assure you if all goes
well ... there will be a fundamental change in policy. This country
has got to lead in human rights.''
   Tutu said, ``God bless you.''
   Dukakis, with a big lead in delegates, talked with congressional
Democrats in meetings that were in keeping with his role as the
party's expected presidential nominee.
   While he won warm words from those who appeared with him after
their meetings, the get-acquainted sessions underscored that
Dukakis, as a three-term governor of Massachusetts, is something of
a stranger on Capitol Hill.
   Besides Byrd, he won the endorsement of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., the House Ways and Means chairman, who called Dukakis ``the
candidate best able to lead our nation.''
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., who had backed Richard
Gephardt before he dropped out of the presidential race, praised
Dukakis for signaling he values cooperation with Congress. But
Foley said he wasn't endorsing Dukakis over Jesse Jackson, citing
his role as parliamentarian of the Democratic National Convention
and saying he wished to remain neutral.
   Byrd emerged from a private meeting with Dukakis and offered his
endorsement to the candidate who just two days earlier won
overwhelmingly in the primary in Byrd's home state, West Virginia.
   ``I do it without any reservations because I'm confident, based
on our conversation, we're going to have a president who will work
with the Congress,'' Byrd said.
   ``I feel in the interest of party unity and with the progress
Gov. Dukakis has shown ... we need now to begin to close ranks, and
that's what we're doing today,'' Byrd said.

   Dubbed ``Delta Duke,'' Gov. George Deukmejian
took to the roads and to the airwaves Thursday pushing a $1 billion
bond to unclog the nation's most congested roads.
   ``Today the governor is a Los Angeles commuter and a traffic
tipster,'' said anchorman Bill Zorn of KNX-AM, one of three radio
stations to broadcast Deukmejian's live traffic reports.
   During his hourlong, 32-mile commute from a hotel near his Long
Beach home to Beverly Hills, the governor crept through the West
Los Angeles junction of the San Diego and Santa Monica freeways,
which traffic officials have labeled the nation's busiest
interchange. Some 513,000 vehicles use it daily.
   The Republican governor wanted to demonstrate how California's
freeways, once the idyllic image of wide-open roadways ideal for
cruising, are now the nation's busiest.
   Transportation officials confirmed this week that nine of the
nation's 10 busiest freeway interchanges are in California.
   ``Just traveling along now on the San Diego Freeway, I'm taking
note of the fact there's only one person in each car. If we can
just increase that to 1.4 persons, we can relieve congestion during
the peak traffic hours,'' Deukmejian said.
   Deukmejian traveled in a telephone-equipped van, provided by the
state Office of Emergency Services, to a transportation hearing to
dramatize his support for a $1 billion bond issue on the June 7
ballot.
   Proposition 74 is the first phase of a $2.3 billion package of
supplemental financing for California highway improvements which
Deukmejian first proposed two years ago.
   He averaged 35 mph during the commute, but slowed to 5 mph at
one point where the Century Freeway is being constructed near Los
Angeles International Airport.
   ``We are approaching the El Segundo Boulevard exit. We're almost
at a standstill, moving 5 mph,'' he said.
   KNX-AM traffic reporter Bill Keene gave Deukmejian the handle
``Delta Duke'' for his traffic reporting stint, which was also
heard on KABC-AM and KGIL-AM.
   Deukmejian laughed, saying, ``Well, I've been called a lot
worse.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people move to the nation's
second-largest city each year. Roadway congestion became so bad
last summer that flare-ups among commuters resulted in a rash of
freeway shootings killing five and wounding 11.
   ``I'm aware of the frustration people have in the peak hours,''
Deukmejian said.
   California transportation officials who worked with the Federal
Highway Administration in Washington, D.C., said this week that six
of the country's 10 busiest interchanges are in Los Angeles County.
Two of the other top 10 spots were claimed by neighboring Orange
County.
   ``I looked at the numbers and said, `Holy mackerel!''' said
transportation engineer Chuck Pivetti. ``Ten years ago, all the top
spots would have been in New York, New Jersey and Chicago. Now we
have nearly all the spots. We're talking about some tremendous
volumes of traffic.''
   Behind the Santa Monica-San Diego freeway junction is the East
Los Angeles interchange of the Santa Monica, Golden State, Pomona
and Hollywood freeways, with 509,000 vehicles per day, and the
Santa Monica junction with the Harbor Freeway in Central Los
Angeles with 502,500 vehicles per day.
   The point where the Ventura and San Diego freeways meet in
Sherman Oaks claimed the fourth busiest spot with 480,000 cars per
day.
   The junction of the Eastshore, MacArthur and Nimitz freeways in
Alameda County in Northern California placed fifth in the
congestion lineup because it serves 455,000 vehicles per day.
   Another 444,000 drivers use the junction of the Harbor and San
Diego freeways in Carson, making it the sixth busiest interchange
in the country.
   The Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways in Orange County
took seventh place with 441,000 vehicles a day, while the Orange
and Riverside freeways in Anaheim claimed ninth place with 421,000
vehicles a day. Both are in Orange County.
   The eighth spot was claimed by the Artesia and San Gabriel River
freeways in Cerritos, Los Angeles County, where 425,500 vehicles a
day pass through.
   An interchange in Chicago placed 10th.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A truce ordered by Syria and Iran ended a
six-day battle between rival militias Thursday in which the radical
Hezbollah captured most of south Beirut's Shiite Moslem slums.
   Sniper fire was heard in the ramshackle 16 square miles adjacent
to the Beirut airport, but the howitzers and tank cannons were
silent. Police reported a woman killed and two other civilians
wounded in the Ghobeiri neighborhood.
   Police said 188 people were killed and 534 wounded in the battle
that began last Friday between the mainstream Amal militia, backed
by Syria, and Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is loyal to Iran.
   South of the capital, the Israeli air force blasted Palestinian
bases in its eighth raid into Lebanon this year. Police said six
fighter-bombers made three passes to rocket targets near Barja, 16
miles from Beirut. There were no reports of deaths or serious
injuries.
   The truce was ordered for 11 p.m. Wednesday after telephone
conversations between President Hafez Assad of Syria and President
Ali Khamenei of Iran.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of Hezbollah,
said he had no information about the 18 foreign hostages in
Lebanon, most of whom are believed held in the slums by groups
linked to Hezbollah. There has been no word of the foreigners, who
include nine Americans, since the fighting began.
   Although its fighting force was outnumbered 2-1, Hezbollah
appeared to have won the contest for supremacy. Police said it
controlled 70 percent of the slums when the fighting ended,
compared with about one-third when it began.
   Police estimated Hezbollah's fighting force at 3,000 men. They
said Amal put about 6,500 men into the field, about 2,000 brought
in from the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon and sent 7,500 of them to
Moslem west Beirut in February 1987 to stop factional war. Although
they patrol west Beirut, the Syrians have not entered the southern
Shiite slums.
   After 13 years of civil war, Assad was the undisputed power
broker in Lebanon until Iran began challenging Syrian influence
among the 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Hezbollah denied police reports that 500 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards joined them in the slum war.
   A police spokesman said Amal lost ``most'' of its positions in
south Beirut. He said Amal moved its fighters to the edges of the
disputed area and Hezbollah took over the inner neighborhoods.
   Most of the 250,000 people who normally live in the southern
slums fled during the battle and more were planning to go despite
the truce.
   ``We don't trust cease-fires,'' a man who identified himself
only as Hussein told a reporter. ``I have five children and I've
already lost my home. I don't know where to go now. I don't think
the fighting will ever stop unless one side exterminates the
other.''
   Fadlallah spoke with journalists at his home, which was damaged
by artillery fire, in the Haret Hreik neighborhood. ``I think it's
over now because of the high-level solutions that are being worked
out by the presidents of Syria and Iran,'' he said.
   Asked about the foreigners, he replied: ``I have no information
about the hostages and I don't know anything about them. I don't
know where they are and, therefore, I can't answer your question.''
   He called Amal ``a local force that represents American
interests in the area.''
   Posters stuck on walls in districts Hezbollah had conquered
depicted Nabih Berri, Lebanon's justice minister and the Amal
leader, with vampire teeth over the slogan: ``The war criminal who
sold himself to the Great Satan,'' Iran's standard term for the
United States.
   Iranian flags were hoisted on positions formerly held by Amal.
   A four-man committee was formed to supervise the cease-fire,
under which the combatants were to withdraw from the streets and
free prisoners by Friday.
   Its members are Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikoleslam of
Iran; Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, Syria's intelligence chief in west
Beiut, and one representative each of Amal and Hezbollah: Ayoub
Homayed and Hassan Khalil.

   An explosion spewed flaming metal chips
throughout an industrial plant Thursday, killing one worker and
injuring eight others, officials said.
   Businesses near the plant on the city's east side were evacuated
while firefighters worked to keep flames from spreading to a
warehouse containing powdered metals, including magnesium, titanium
and aluminum.
   ``The dust collector blew up and spread these flaming metal
chips and debris all over and started the fire,'' said Fire Chief
James McNamee.
   Firefighters found one worker's body in the Mineral Metals Inc.
plant after the fire was brought under control about noon, three
hours after it was reported.
   The victim's identity was not immediately available.
   Plant secretary Denise Sobola said there were 29 people in the
plant when the explosion occurred. The plant processes powdered
metal into a substance for welding rod coatings, workers said.
   Ms. Sobola said her office filled with dust and she ran out a
side door. She said workers were ``just running out and collapsing
outside the doors.''
   Ms. Sobola said there have been minor explosions at the plant in
the past that have spread dust throughout the plant. ``I knew this
time (it was worse). I heard glass busting and everything,'' she
said.
   Chemalloy Co. of Bryn Mawr, Pa., is the parent company of
Mineral Metals. Chemalloy President Anthony Demos was en route to
Cleveland on Thursday and not available for comment, his office
said.
   Six workers were treated at Cleveland Metropolitan General
Hospital for burns and smoke inhalation, said hospital spokeswoman
Terri Manns. One man was unconscious and in critical condition, she
said. Two men were treated at St. Vincent Charity Hospital,
spokesman Maria Tayek said.

   Depressed teen-agers intent on killing
themselves show chemical abnormalities in their brains that appear
to predispose them to suicide, according to a study released
Thursday.
   ``It clearly demonstrates some brain differences in suicidal
adolescents. It's not purely a mind phenomenon,'' said Dr. Neal D.
Ryan, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh.
   Earlier studies have found similar abnormalities in the brains
of suicidal adults, although experts are divided as to what
conclusions can be drawn. Ryan's research is believed to be the
first that demonstrates neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal
adolescents.
   ``What this suggests is that there is a biochemical basis to at
least depressive people with chronic suicidal plans,'' Ryan said.
``There's something that goes on with the brain and there are
environmental phenomena that impinge on that.''
   Ryan said his findings, reported at the American Psychiatric
Association's annual conference in Montreal, could help doctors
identify and treat certain patients before they try to commit
suicide.
   Irma Lann, a science administrator in child and adolescent
disorders research for the National Institute of Mental Health,
said Ryan's work is preliminary, and further study is needed.
   ``It's premature to even think that we could be able to identify
groups of suicidal adolescents,'' she said.
   Of the 29,453 suicides in the United States in 1985, the last
year for which figures are available, 2,127 were committed by
youngsters 19 and under, according to the National Center for
Health Statistics. About 80 percent of them were boys.
   Boys and girls are afflicted about equally by depression. But
while more girls attempt suicide, more boys succeed at it,
according to Ryan.
   Ryan and Dr. Joaquim Puig-Antich, professor of psychiatry at
Pitt, began their study in 1980 at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute in New York City. They continued their work, funded by
the National Institute of Mental Health, after moving in 1984 to
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh.
   From 1980 to 1987, the psychiatrists monitored the growth
hormone secretion of 140 boys and girls ranging in age from 12 to
just under 18. The tests were conducted while the subjects slept.
   Most growth hormone secretion occurs during sleep, especially
during the first several hours, according to Ryan. At least three
neurotransmitter systems in the brain are involved in controlling
sleep growth hormone secretion, which also affects moods.
   The 34 youngsters who suffered from major depression and had
attempted suicide or devised a suicide plan secreted less growth
hormone than the 40 depressed but non-suicidal students and 66
healthy children, whose levels were about the same, Ryan said. The
subjects' sex was not a factor, and their ages were taken into
account.
   Later, 43 of the students received a one-time shot of
Desipramine, an antidepressant known to stimulate the release of
growth hormone.
   Among the eight depressed, suicidal youths who received the
shot, less growth hormone was released than among the 12 depressed
but non-suicidal and 23 healthy adolescents, Ryan said.

   The federal government should direct its efforts
to providing health care for the chronically ill, says the new
president of the American Association of Retired Persons.
   ``We contend that national legislation based on a social
insurance approach is required so that the risk can be spread over
millions of working and retired persons,'' said Louise Crooks, 76,
who ascended to the presidency Wednesday during the biannual
meeting of the 28 million-member association.
   ``We must find a way to assure adequate health care for the
estimated 37 million Americans, who have no health care insurer
whatsoever, and expand and improve private pension plans so that
future generations of older Americans will have more adequate
retirement income,'' the West Lafayette, Ind., woman said.
   Among the health issues discussed at the convention was
Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia that afflicts about 2
million elderly Americans. The disease's cure and cause remains
unknown.
   Dr. Gene Cohen, director of the Program on Aging at the National
Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., said the federal
government is spending $90 million a year to research the disease,
up from $4 million in 1974.
   ``Alzheimer's has emerged as one of the great mysteries of
medical science,'' Cohen said.
   The conference also looked at the needs of those who care for
the elderly. Those people, mostly women, often are burdened by
unrelenting demands and develop health problems of their own, said
Rhonda Montgomery, director of the Institute of Gerontology at
Wayne State University. She said twice as many senior citizens are
being cared for in private homes as in nursing homes.

   The first new ``Tonight Show'' since the
writers' strike started two months ago was a sight for sore eyes
for millions of viewers who boosted the show's ratings by 36
percent, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Host Johnny Carson, who is not a member of the striking Writers
Guild of America, got back on the air by writing his own material,
beginning with Wednesday night's show.
   According to overnight ratings from the country's 16 largest
television markets, ``Tonight'' got a rating of 8.7 and a 27 share
on Wednesday night, a 36 percent rise over its average rating since
the strike began.
   The rating is a percentage of homes with televisions. The share
is a percentage of sets in use.
   The 2-month-old strike over royalties and creative control
forced reruns of ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' and
``Late Night with David Letterman,'' both on NBC, and caused an
early end of the season for some series. CBS has announced it is
delaying the start of its fall season due to the strike.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Declares U.S. Sentencing Commission Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has declared
unconstitutional a commission that sets federal sentencing
guidelines, saying the president's authority to remove commission
members violates the separation of powers between the executive and
judiciary branches of government.
   Chief U.S. District Judge W. Brevard Hand also threw out the
sentencing guidelines themselves.
   Hand's ruling Wednesday on a motion in a cocaine case was
similar to one issued by U.S. District Judge Marvin Shoob in
Atlanta; challenges to the guidelines also have been filed in other
jurisdictions and many federal judges have criticized them.
   Under the commission's guidelines, federal judges must impose
sentences within prescribed ranges unless special circumstances
exist that are not adequately considered by the commission's rules.
   The guidelines, Hand said, substantially restrict the
traditional discretion allowed judges in sentencing.
   Hand said the commission, created by Congress in 1984,
improperly includes three federal judges. Members of the commission
are appointed by the president and may be removed by him for
neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or for other causes.
   ``Federal courts must carefully abstain from exercising any
power that is not strictly judicial in its character, and which is
not clearly confided by the Constitution,'' Hand ruled.
   He said the job of setting guidelines is essentially an
administrative rule-making task, legislative in nature, and ``not a
proper function of the judiciary.''

   A Chinese jetliner
with 118 people aboard was hijacked to Taiwan today by two Chinese
men seeking to defect. The aircraft later took off for China but
the hijackers remained in Taiwan, a military spokesman said.
   The Boeing 737 left Chingchuankang air force base in the central
Taiwan city of Taichung at 2:55 a.m. Friday (2:55 p.m. EDT
Thursday) for Canton in southern China after refueling, said Wang
Pao-hua, spokesman for the air base. The two hijackers asked for
political asylum in Taiwan, he said.
   The Government Information Office, however, said in a statement
that the jet was headed for the British colony of Hong Kong on
China's southeastern coast. It did not say whether the plane would
later go somewhere else.
   The hijackers carried fake guns and bombs, Taiwan Television
Station Co. said. They and the passengers and crew members had left
the Boeing after it landed in Taiwan.
   In Beijing, the official Xinhua News Agency said the plane was
hijacked to Taiwan while flying to Canton from Xiamen, in
southeastern China 136 miles across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan.

   Singer Natalie Cole, a three-time Grammy winner,
says she has come to terms with her late father's fame and now
wants to do an album of Nat ``King'' Cole ballads.
   Miss Cole successfully battled drug and alcohol dependence in
the early 1980s with the help of a therapist and overcame her
hostility toward her father, according to the May 30 issue of Us
magazine.
   ``My whole theme was, `I'll never be as good as my father,'''
Miss Cole said. She said the time was right to record her father's
songs ``because I have confidence in my own talent.''
   Miss Cole, who is riding high with a hit single ``Pink
Cadillac,'' was frank about her problems.
   ``I was a human garbage disposal,'' she said, speaking of her
years on cocaine, methaqualone and alcohol. Then, after her
rehabilitation, ``people wanted to know if I could stay sober. Then
they wanted to know if I could still sing. It was humiliating and
scary and just plain hard work, but I proved that I could do both.''

<HEAD>House Votes To Make Itself More Immune To Civil Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House unanimously approved a resolution
Thursday that asserts the right of its members to be immune from
civil lawsuits when they issue news releases, hold news conferences
or communicate with government officials.
   The 413-0 vote was triggered by a federal appeals court decision
that limited lawmakers' immunity to activities such as speaking and
voting on the House or Senate floor.
   The resolution requested that the Supreme Court hear an appeal
of the case, in which the need for a broader interpretation of
immunity would be argued.
   The House expressed ``deep concern'' with the ruling ``because
of its impact on the necessary and proper functioning of the House
of Representatives.''
   The dispute began in 1985 when Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn.,
wrote to the attorney general and the president of the Legal
Services Corp. about a controversy over expenditure of federal
money by Memphis Area Legal Services.
   Sundquist, who released the letters to the news media, made a
reference to a staff attorney for the Memphis group, who sued the
lawmaker for defamation of character.
   In April 1986, a U.S. district judge in Washington dismissed the
suit on grounds that members of Congress are entitled to immunity
while acting in good faith within the scope of their official
duties.
   Last November, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington voted 2-1 to reverse the ruling. The appellate court
said immunity was limited to that granted by the Constitution's
speech and debate clause, which has been held to apply only to
activities such as floor action.
   Sundquist then appealed to the Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Expert Testifies Train Crew Lacked Sleep Before Fatal Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE McGRAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YORK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail crew members in a fatal train accident
suffered from a lack of sleep and could have dozed off while still
instinctively performing basic duties, an industrial psychologist
testified Thursday.
   Donald I. Tepas, professor of psychology and director of the
industrial and organizational psychology program at the University
of Connecticut, said the three crew members on each of the two
trains suffered from ``chronic sleep deprivation.''
   Tepas testified during the second day of a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing on the Jan. 14 train accident
in Thompsontown, which killed four people.
   The two Conrail trains, one hauling coal and the other carrying
trailer-vans, smashed head-on at about 8 a.m., killing the engineer
and the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives.
Damage was estimated at $5 million.
   Tepas said the rail employee's erratic work schedules; harsh,
monotonous work environment; and a lack of programs to help
employees deal with job stress promote sleeping on the job.
   ``Work systems which result in night work, shifts of unusual
length and unpredictable work hours result in conditions which
place workers and the general public at risk,'' he said in prepared
testmony.
   Spokesmen for Conrail, a private freight rail organization set
up by Congress to operate six bankrupt railroads, have said they
wouldn't comment on any of the testimony.
   During his testimony, Tepas said workers on erratic schedules do
not make up for lost sleep, nor do they adapt to those schedules.
The same workers are not usually able to judge how their work has
been affected while suffering from chronic sleep deprivation, he
added.
   Though asleep, people can still react automatically in different
situations, he said, adding that dozing rail workers could respond
to danger signals as part of a natural reflex.
   ``In all stages of sleep, it is possible for people to perform
simple responses to simple stimuli,'' Tepas said.
   ``People can sleep for a few seconds or minutes and can perform
quite well when they wake up,'' he added.
   U.S. railroad companies must pay more attention to the
consequences of sleep deprivation, Tepas said.
   Training employees who work unpredictable work schedules how to
handle odd sleeping hours would help, as well as adding some kind
of change to routine duties, he said.
   The accident apparently occurred when the westbound trailer
train had been shifted to an eastbound track on the Conrail main
line between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. The eastbound coal train
apparently ran a stop signal and smashed head-on into the trailer
train.
   The two survivors of the accident both said Wednesday they had
had only a few hours of sleep before they reported to duty the day
of the wreck.
   Inquiry Board Chairman James L. Kolstad said the inquiry board
would not issue its report for several months. The hearings are
scheduled to last through Friday.

   Two congressmen accused the Reagan
administration Thursday of ruining children's lives and wasting
taxpayer's money by failing to enforce a 1980 law meant to improve
the foster care system.
   ``Children are being abused beyond our wildest expectations.
Millions of dollars are being misspent,'' Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., told three federal officials responsible for children's
programs.
   The children ``don't have permanency. They don't have services.
They can't get back to their families. ... What you're really
engaged in is state child abuse,'' Miller said.
   Miller, chairman of the House Select Committee on Children,
Youth and Families, and Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., chairman of the
Ways and Means public assistance subcommittee, led the attack on
the trio at the last of three hearings on the foster care system.
   ``It appears to me that we're doing a reasonably adequate job.
It's not an exceptional job,'' said Sydney Olson, assistant
secretary for human development services at the Department of
Health and Human Services. ``We're trying to improve.''
   Earlier witnesses had charged that neither the federal
government or the states were enforcing the 1980 law, which
stresses preserving and reuniting families, and finding permanent
homes for children who cannot be with their parents. Case plans and
case reviews for children in foster care are required at specific
intervals.
   The American Public Welfare Association said ``many positive
changes'' had occurred as a result of the law. The Children's
Defense Fund said that without the changes, ``the crises facing the
child welfare system today would be even more overwhelming.''
   Those and other groups said there remain serious problems
ranging from patchwork services and inadequate federal funds to the
increasingly disturbed children entering the foster care system as
a result of unemployment, poverty, drug abuse, homelessness and
family violence.
   Downey and Miller aimed their fire at the administration,
contending officials are failing to penalize states no matter how
bad their records are.
   ``As one of our witnesses told us, you'd have to work overtime
to flunk your audit,'' Miller said. He said the department is
relying on a checklist filled out by states themselves, plus sample
cases that don't reflect the serious problems pinpointed by
lawsuits and studies across the country.
   Those problems have included child abuse by foster parents,
slipshod monitoring by authorities responsible for the child's
future, and failure to refer children for adoption or return them
to their families where that is appropriate.
   Downey said a lawsuit in New York City revealed that child
welfare offices were being used as shelters and 1,000 children had
been subjected to multiple one-night placements. He said a suicidal
12-year-old was sent to 17 placements in 28 working days. Despite
this information, he said, New York is one of seven states that has
not been audited since the law was enacted.
   Olson said she was not aware of the lawsuit, probably because
the federal government is not a party to it.
   ``You are a party to it,'' Miller rejoined. ``You're paying the
bill for the care of these children... When states are out of
compliance, they're not supposed to get the money. Somehow, that
doesn't happen.''
   Miller and Downey also scored the administrators for failing to
help states cope with soaring rates of homelessness, drug abuse and
child abuse. They said thousands of children are in foster care
because their parents are homeless or the social services their
families need are unavailable.

<HEAD>Shamir Tells Palestinians to Behave, Extra Security In Jerusalem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HEBRON, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
urged Palestinians in this Arab city Thursday to stop their
uprising against Israeli occupation and said if they did, the
bloodshed would cease.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Israeli troops opened fire on
Palestinian protesters, wounding five, Arab reports and hospital
officials said. The army reported three wounded.
   About 3,000 police were deployed in Jerusalem as the Moslem fast
of Ramadan drew to a close.
   The Israeli air force made its eighth raid into Lebanon this
year, blasting Palestinian targets south of Beirut. Police said six
fighter-bombers took part in the attack at Barja, 16 miles outside
Beirut. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries.
   Israel's Police Commissioner David Kraus said ``all necessary
measures'' would be taken to prevent disturbances at the close of
Ramadan, the Moslem holy month due to end Monday or Tuesday with
the sighting of the new moon.
   Thursday marked Laylat Al Kadr, Arabic for ``Night of Fate,''
which falls on the 27th day of Ramadan and marks the giving of the
Koran to the prophet Mohammed. Police were on patrol to prevent
rioting by Moslems gathering at Jerusalem's sacred Temple Mount for
all-night prayers.
   Officials also are concerned about possible violence on Sunday,
when Israelis mark the 40th anniversary of their state as well as
the 21st anniversary of the seizure of Arab east Jerusalem.
   Shamir visited Hebron, the second largest West Bank city, for
the first time since unrest broke out in the occupied territories
Dec. 8. He toured the narrow stone-paved streets of the Qasbah, or
open-air market, passing surprised vendors selling meat, vegetables
and donkey saddles.
   Speaking through a translator, Shamir urged Palestinian
residents of the city to stop violence. One Arab told him ``the
government should start treating the Palestinians as human beings,
especially now, during religious celebrations.''
   Shamir responded that ``the population should start to behave,
and not only during holidays.''
   ``If there would be quiet and order, nothing would be done
against the population,'' Shamir said.
   Asked by Shamir what he was doing to promote peace, one merchant
said: ``We are praying and hoping.'' But an Arab youth shouted:
``There won't be peace. We want Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa!'' He
was quickly pushed away by troops.
   Arab witnesses said the prime minister's party was preceded by
dozens of troops who banged on shop doors and used megaphones to
order striking shopkeepers to open.
   After touring Hebron, Shamir was taken by army helicopter to the
neighboring Beit Hagay Jewish settlement, where about 90 Jewish
settlers live in the barren hills south of Hebron.
   Shamir said the land was ``thirsty for Jewish settlement'' and
promised settlers that Israel would ``march forward'' with the
settlement drive.
   Throughout the West Bank, many shops remained shuttered all day
due to conflicting PLO and army orders. PLO leaders have ordered
shops to open in the morning and close in the afternoon, and the
army has tried to thwart the organization's control by issuing the
opposite orders.
   The clash in the open-air market of Nablus started after troops
ordered shops in the city closed and youths began throwing stones,
Arab reports said.
   An official at the city's Ittihad Hospital said five youths,
including one 13-year-old, were brought in with gunshot wounds.
Four were wounded in the legs and one was wounded in the stomach.
   Since the uprising began, 186 Arabs have died in clashes with
Israelis. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish teen-ager also have been
killed.

   The Reagan administration is backing Kuwait's
request to buy sophisticated F-18 fighter-bombers for defense in
the Persian Gulf, and has begun consulting Congress to help the
plan get off the ground, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   It would be the first sale of two-engine, 500-mile range F-18s
to an Arab country, but State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said, ``Kuwait obviously faces a threat in the gulf.''
   ``We've said over and over again that views of Congress will
play a large part in our consideration of this question, but we
stress again the threat in the gulf region is clear and we think
the Kuwaiti request is consistent with our policy,'' she said.
   The administration notified Congress several months ago that it
expected Kuwait to make a request for advanced aircraft to replace
aging, A4 attack planes vulnerable to equipment being used by both
Iran and Iraq in their seven-year-old war.
   Of the possible replacements, Kuwait picked the McDonnell
Douglas Co's F-18, the newest of the choices and a plane sold only
to treaty allies, Spain, Australia and Canada.
   Kuwait apparently picked the plane because it was built for the
U.S. Navy for operations over water and can be converted within
minutes from an air-to-air fighter to a well-stocked bomber.
   Of the other possibilities, McDonnell Douglas's F-15 is
considered purely an air-to-air combat plane and General Dynamics'
F-16 has less versatility than the F-18 in performing bombing and
fighter missions with equal effectiveness.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
administration is consulting with Congress to determine if approval
would be granted for the sale of all 40 F-18s Kuwait wants. In
addition, the administration wants to see if Congress would resist
selling F-18s to Kuwait, but would accept the transfer of F-16s.
   Congress has already permitted F-16 sales to Egypt and Bahrain,
another small oil-producing state.
   Arms sales to the Middle East are closely scrutinized on Capitol
Hill, where there is concern about giving sophisticated weapons to
Arab nations still technically in a state of war with Israel. Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee,
raised another concern: the level of weaponry in the war-torn gulf
region.
   ``The administration keeps trying to escalate the level of
sophistication when there is already an escalation of modern
weapons in the region,'' Kerry said. He cited the sale of
long-range Chinese missiles to Saudi Arabia as an example.
   ``The F-18, that's our most sophisticated, latest technology,''
Kerry said. ``I'm concerned about it. I just don't see a need for
it at first blush.''
   Kuwaiti interest in the F-18s was disclosed during congressional
testimony earlier this week by Richard W. Murphy, assistant
secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs.
   The United States and Kuwait have created an increasingly close
security relationship since last year, when the United States
committed naval forces to protect U.S.-flagged ships traveling
through the Persian Gulf.
   Individual F-18s as supplied to the U.S. Navy by McDonnell
Douglas Co. cost $17 million, making the Kuwaiti sale a potential
$680 million deal.
   With a range of 500 nautical miles, Kuwaiti-based F-18 jets
could hit targets throughout most of the Persian Gulf and deep in
Iranian territory.
   Mrs. Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, said, meanwhile,
a request by another gulf state, Oman, for U.S. shoulder-fired
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles ``reflects legitimate defense
requirements.''
   She noted Congress has prohibited such sales to all Persian Gulf
countries during the fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30, but
she added, ``no decisions on future actions have been taken.''
   The U.S. ambassador to Oman, G. Cranwell Montgomery, said he is
trying to get Congress to change its mind, but Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., sponsor of the Stinger sale ban, said he would
oppose the effort.
   DeConcini has expressed concern that the light, portable
Stingers could be diverted from Middle Eastern nations to terrorist
groups and used against civilian aircraft.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Hit Noriega Deal; Reagan `Mortified' by
Endorsement Flap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson joined the chorus of
criticism Thursday against reported U.S. plans to drop drug charges
against Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, while President Reagan
was ``mortified'' that his endorsement of George Bush was viewed as
less than enthusiastic.
   Dukakis made his first visit to the Capitol as the presumed
Democratic nominee and won backing from several congressional
leaders before heading to the West, where Bush and Jackson were
campaigning.
   The White House acknowledged U.S. officials were trying to coax
Noriega to surrender power, but refused to say whether dropping the
drug charges might be part of the deal.
   In New Mexico, Bush refused to discuss the matter except to say,
``I favor getting Noriega out. ... When negotiations are going on
that are sensitive, you don't discuss them.''
   The Republican vice president called the fuss over the terseness
of Reagan's endorsement ``much ado about nothing.''
   ``I couldn't have been more pleased,'' he said.
   Reagan devoted three brief sentences at the end of a speech to a
GOP fund-raising dinner Wednesday night to declare his backing for
Bush, who clinched the Republican presidential nomination more than
two weeks ago.
   Dukakis still is short of the majority he needs at the
Democratic convention, but the string of primary victories put
together in recent weeks by the Massachusetts governor has ended
any doubt that he will be the party's candidate against Bush in the
general election.
   With his new status, Dukakis met privately in Washington with
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and then with Democratic
congressional leaders. He picked up endorsements from Senate
Majority leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   Dukakis won nearly 80 percent of the vote in the West Virginia
primary earlier this week and Byrd, the state's senior senator,
said he was endorsing the governor ``without any reservations,
because I'm confident, based on our conversation, we're going to
have a president who will work with the Congress.''
   Byrd also said, ``It's time now that we unite ... We need now to
begin to close ranks, and that's what we're doing today.''
   Rostenkowski called Dukakis ``the candidate best able to lead
our nation.''
   After meeting with Tutu, Dukakis said he ``very strongly''
supported tougher sanctions against the white supremacist regime in
South Africa.
   ``It's time to change our policy and I assure you if all goes
well ... there will be a fundamental change in policy,'' Dukakis
said. ``This country has got to lead in human rights.''
   In recent days, the Massachusetts governor has hammered away at
Bush on the question of what the vice president knew about
Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking.
   At the Capitol, he focused on the reports the administration
might drop the drug charges.
   ``I think before we start talking about dropping indictments and
making deals, the American people deserve a full explanation of
what kind of relationship this administration has had with Noriega
... Just exactly what has been going on for the past 7{ years,'' he
said.
   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug
runners and murderers.''
   Jackson sounded a similar theme during a Portland, Ore., news
conference.
   ``They want to exonerate him altogether,'' Jackson said. ``It's
not just Noriega. Others are dealing in drugs. We can't indict them
one day and exonerate them the next day. That is no policy at all.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, Reagan's press secretary, told reporters the
president was ``mortified'' about the endorsement flap. ``He
thought the speech was terrific. He wrote it himself,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Reagan issued a statement later that said, ``I was surprised by
the news reports that have said my endorsement last evening of the
vice president was `lukewarm.' I am enthusiastic, fully committed
and, as I have said, will go all out to make Vice President Bush
the next president of the United States.''
   Bush said he and Reagan talked about the endorsement in advance.
   ``He showed me those remarks he had handwritten,'' said the vice
president. ``I still have them.''
   In other political developments:
   _ The three major television reaffirmed their support of
legislation to set a uniform poll closing time during presidential
election years. The legislation, which has passed the House and is
pending in the Senate, would order a 9 p.m. EST poll simultaneous
poll closing time.
   _ Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York embarked on a political trip to
the West Coast and said he planned to ``have some fun'' attacking
Bush. Cuomo, who resisted entreaties he get into the Democratic
race, said he thought the contest for his party's nomination had
strengthened Dukakis.
   ``Dukakis is already a favorite in the polls and I'm not
surprised,'' said Cuomo.

<TEXT>
   Nearly six months after Congress tabbed Yucca
Mountain, Nev., as the permanent burial site for high-level nuclear
wastes, a House panel began deliberations Thursday on how to get
the stuff there without risking a catastrophe.
   House Interior Chairman Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., noted that the
years-long struggle to pick a repository site for spent reactor
fuel and other highly radioative junk may have been only half the
battle.
   ``No one wants a repository in his backyard, but no one wants
nuclear waste trucks driving down his street either,'' he said.
   Major shipments of nuclear wastes, principally from storage
pools near the 110 nuclear power plants around the nation, will not
begin until the repository is completed early next century. But
nearly every state is on proposed transit routes.
   Industry officials told Udall's energy subcommittee that past,
albiet limited, experience in shipping high-level wastes
demonstrates no cause for alarm.
   ``There has never been an accident in over 20 years of spent
fuel shipment that has resulted in a release of radiation,'' said
D.A. Brodnick, a nuclear specialist at the Florida Power & Light Co.
   But Melinda Kassen of the Environmental Defense Fund said that
``although the people of the United States have been spared the
consequences of an accident involving a release of radioactivity,
it is not because the government runs a technically unimpeachable
program, but rather because, so far, we have been lucky.''
   She pointed to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission study which said
an ``extreme'' accident involving a truck carrying one type of
container used in the past, called an LLD-1, could result in the
release of a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of plutonium. If that
happened in a major urban area, she said, it could result in
thousands of latent cancer deaths and billions of dollars in
contamination damage.
   Udall's panel is considering a variety of bills designed to
upgrade shipping standards, including new requirements for the
crash-worthiness of shipping casks, selection of routes and
pre-notification to communities along the way.
   Ron Lurie, the nuclear waste project manager for Las Vegas,
Nev., complained that his city was ``at the end of the
transportation funnel'' to Yucca Mountain, and that ``without a
beltway bypass and alternative railroad spurs, we will become
exposed to the hazards and risks of thousands of road and rail
shipments.''
   Robert M. Jefferson, an industry consultant, said a study by the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories indicated that, using trucks, there
was a probability of one accident involving a measurable release of
radiation for every 15 billion miles traveled.
   Jefferson said that assuming all shipments of spent fuel were
made by truck, ``there might be an accident which results in a
minor release about every 1,300 years, with minimal public health
consequences.''
   But Rep. James Bilbray, D-Nev., said the Energy Department had
told him its own calculations indicated an accident would be likely
every 40 million truck miles. And that, he noted, would be the
mileage required to transport the waste already stored at reactor
sites _ to say nothing of the amount that will be generated in the
years ahead.

<HEAD>Bush Says It's `Absurd' to Suggest Reagan Endorsement Was Lukewarm</HEAD>

   George Bush said Thursday he ``couldn't
be more pleased'' with President Reagan's endorsement of his
Republican presidential bid, brushing aside as ``absolutely
absurd'' suggestions that Reagan's support was unenthusiastic.
   The GOP nominee-to-be refused to answer questions about a
reported U.S. deal with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega that
would involve dropping drug trafficking charges in exchange for his
stepping down from power.
   ``I favor getting Noriega out,'' Bush told reporters at the
Honeywell Defense Avionics plant in Albuquerque. ``I've learned
something from some experience in this _ when negotiations are
going on that are sensitive you don't discuss them.''
   Bush kicked off a seven-day western campaign swing with a slap
at Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   ``We cannot afford a radical swing. We cannot afford a president
who opposes every step we are taking to keep our defense at the
technological edge,'' Bush told the Albuquerque Rotary Club after
the defense plant tour. He portrayed Dukakis as someone ``who
opposes the MX, who opposes the Midgetman, who opposes testing of
nuclear weapons ... who flirts with the withdrawal of our troops
from South Korea.''
   New Mexico holds a primary on June 7 along with California, New
Jersey and Montana. After the Albuquerque stop, Bush flew to San
Diego. He also planned to visit Oregon before that state's primary
next Tuesday.
   The Republican heir-apparent to Reagan was quick to reject
suggestions that Reagan's endorsement Wednesday night was less than
he wanted.
   ``I thought it was just great,'' Bush told reporters. ``I
couldn't have been more pleased.''
   He said he couldn't understand the commentary that the
president's endorsement was flat and uninspiring from the man he
has loyally served for the past seven years.
   ``Where all this flak is coming from I heard about on the news _
it's totally absurd,'' he told reporters. ``It's much ado about
nothing.''
   Reagan's endorsement was just three sentences in a speech that
he delivered to a party dinner in Washington.
   On Thursday, the president issued a statement about the flap.
   ``I was surprised by the news reports that have said my
endorsement of last evening of the vice president was `lukewarm.' I
am enthusiastic, fully committed and, as I have said, will go all
out to make Vice President Bush the next president of the United
States. George has been a partner in all we have accomplished and
he should be elected. He has my full confidence and my total
support. I will campaign actively on his behalf.''
   Bush said he and Reagan had talked about the endorsement in
advance.
   ``He showed me those remarks he had handwritten. ... I still
have them,'' Bush said.
   Bush referred to Reagan's endorsement at the Rotary Club speech.
``You may have seen that the president endorsed me last night. That
was a relief,'' he said as the audience laughed.
   Bush aides were hesitant to comment on the Reagan endorsement.
All Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater would say was, ``That's
behind us now.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was
mystified that his endorsement was viewed as anything less than
whole-hearted.
   ``He is mortified,'' Fitzwater said. ``He thought the speech was
terrific. He wrote it himself. He thought it was strong, a full
endorsement of his vice president who he thinks incredibly highly
of.''

   The Near East and South Asia are the Third
World's largest arms importers, and the Soviet Union is their
biggest single supplier, according to a report released Thursday.
   The report by the Congressional Research Service found that the
United States ranks second among the world's 11 major arms
suppliers to the Third World.
   The 70-page study by defense analyst Richard F. Grimmett ranked
China fifth after France and Britain, saying the Beijing government
committed 79 percent of its arms exports to Iran and Iraq from 1984
to 1987. Rounding out the list of the top 11 are Italy, West
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Brazil and South Korea.
   The report, which charts arms agreements with the Third World
from 1980 to 1987, found that the Soviets had increased their share
of the Latin American arms agreements by 10 percent over the past
three years.
   In 1987, arms agreements with the Third World amounted to $30
billion _ the lowest since the peak 1980 total of $60.5 billion,
according to the report.
   From 1980 to 1987, the value of all Third World arms contracts
was $306.8 billion, with the Near East and South Asia accounting
for more than 67 percent.
   U.S. arms sales agreement with the Third World rose to $5.6
billion in 1987, from $4.1 billion in 1986, constituting 18.5
percent of the total.
   Soviet agreements, which constituted 48.5 percent of the total
for the period, fell slightly in 1987 to $14.6 billion, the report
said.
   Iran and Iraq, who have been at war with each other for 7{
years, accounted for 20.9 percent _ or $64.1 billion _ of all Third
World arms agreements from 1980 to 1987, according to the study.
   The Soviets supplied 29 percent of the combatants' arms, and
China accounted for 13 percent. The share of all European
non-communist countries in agreements with Iran and Iraq was 31
percent, the study said.
   Iran's largest supply source was all communists states excluding
the Soviet Union. They accounted for 31 percent of the total. China
was Iran's second-largest supply source with 21 percent.
   The Soviets were Iraq's single biggest supply source with 37
percent of the total, and China's share was 10 percent, according
to the study.
   The trend of arms contracts to Latin America underwent a major
shift, the report found.
   The Soviet Union's share rose from 48.2 percent in 1980-1983, to
59.8 percent in 1984-1987, the study said. Of the Soviets' nearly
$8.2 billion in 1984-1987 arms agreements with Latin America, 70
percent were with Cuba.
   Meanwhile, the share of Latin American arms contracts with the
major Western European countries as a bloc _ England, France, Italy
and West Germany _ dropped from 21.2 percent in 1980-1983 to 10.6
percent in 1984-1987.
   The U.S. share in Latin America decreased slightly to 9.6
percent in 1984-1987, from 9.9 percent in the previous period.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Urges House To Pass Securities Underwriting Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Thursday urged the House to follow the Senate's lead and pass major
legislation to give banks new securities underwriting powers.
   Greenspan said the Federal Reserve favored the approach taken by
the Senate, which in late March approved legislation that would
repeal most restrictions of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.
That statute barred a mingling of the banking and securities
industries.
   The 1933 law was one of the reforms passed following the 1929
stock market crash. It was aimed at curbing the types of
speculation which were blamed for the crash.
   Greenspan said that one of the attractive features of the Senate
legislation is ``that its near-complete repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act allows for a market driven evolution of
financial services and products.''
   ``I would urge the House in its deliberations in the months
ahead to adopt an approach similar to that of the Senate,''
Greenspan said.
   However, the Senate proposal, sponsored by Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., faces an uncertain future. Opponents of the
measure in the securities industry have an ally in Rep. Fernand St
Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House Banking Committee.
   Once before, in 1984, the Senate passed a bill to give banks
broader powers but the House has never done so.
   Greenspan made his comments in a speech to banking officials in
Chicago. His remarks were also released in Washington.
   Greenspan said the legislation did not represent a bailout for
banks but was instead a reorganization of the financial services
industry which would better serve the public.
   ``The public benefits of expanded powers include not only a
stronger and safer banking system, but also the more efficient and
convenient delivery of a wider array of lower-cost financial
services,'' he said.
   The Senate bill would permit a company that owns a bank to also
own a securities company as long as the two subsidiaries were
operated separately. The securities affiliate would be allowed to
underwrite municipal-revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and
commercial paper. Within six months of the bill becoming law, the
legislation would allow the securities affiliates to begin
underwriting mutual funds and corporate bonds.
   In 1991, the legislation requires that Congress vote on whether
to allow the securities affiliates to take the next step of being
able to underwrite corporate stock.

<HEAD>Networks Ask Passage of Uniform-Poll-Closing Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three major television networks renewed
their support for a national uniform-poll-closing time on Thursday
and promised in the meantime not to project a winner in any state
in November's presidential election before polls are closed in that
state.
   Representatives of ABC, CBS and NBC told the Senate Rules
Committee they will make permanent their commitment to avoid early
calling of state races if legislation is approved to have all polls
in the continental United States close at 9 p.m. EST.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who conducted the hearing and is a
strong supporter of the Senate legislation, drew the commitment
from Thomas Ross, senior vice president for news at NBC; George
Watson, vice president and Washington bureau chief of Capital
City-ABC News, and Warren Mitofsky, vice president, election and
survey unit, CBS News.
   Adams and Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., said, however, that the
networks had made the commitment previously but that NBC had
violated it during the New York Democratic presidential primary.
   Swift, who helped push a uniform-closing-time bill through the
House in November, showed the committee a videotape of the three
networks during the New York primary. In it, NBC said exit polls
indicated Michael Dukakis could be a big winner over Jesse Jackson,
even though many of the state's polling places were still open.
   ``I can assure you that it was an inadvertent aberration and it
will not occur again,'' said Ross.
   In 1984, Adams said, all three networks had declared President
Reagan's re-election by 5:30 p.m. PST.
   ``At that point, only 3 percent of the vote had been tallied and
polls in 26 states were still open,'' said Adams. ``There is
something wrong when voters in Walla Walla or Boise do not feel
their votes have the same impact as that of voters in Charleston or
Providence.''
   Under the legislation, polls would close at 9 p.m. in the
Eastern time zone, 8 p.m. in the Central time zone and 7 p.m. in
the Mountain time zone.
   In the Pacific time zone, daylight saving time would be extended
until the Sunday after Election Day. This provision, affecting
California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and the Idaho panhandle,
would permit a 7 p.m. local-time poll closing simultaneous with 9
p.m. EST.
   Alaska and Hawaii would not be affected by the measure, which
the House approved 208-109 on Nov. 10.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, ranking committee Republican,
expressed concern that the two states not in the continental United
States would be exempt.
   ``I'm not going to upset the agreement,'' said Stevens, who has
sought uniform-poll-closing legislation since 1971, ``but I will
look into this to see if we can get the off-shore states involved.''
   When Stevens asked if the networks would withhold declaring a
presidential winner until the polls close in Alaska and Hawaii,
each of the representatives shook his head in the negative.
   ``We have believed for a long time that when the polls close in
a given state, we should report what we know about what happened in
that state,'' said Watson.
   ``I don't think we're prepared to withhold any information after
the polls close (in the continental United States).''
   James E. Landry, senior vice president and general counsel of
the Air Transport Association of America, which represents most of
the scheduled airlines, and James C. Benfield, executive director
of the Daylight Saving Time Coalition, testified that they oppose
passage of the legislation.
   Landry said the changing of daylight saving time on the West
Coast for two weeks every four years would disrupt airline
schedules, affect overnight service standards and result in the
deterioration of quick deliveries.

   The deal the Reagan administration is trying
to make to remove Panamanian military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega
from power is prompting renewed concern over using plea bargains in
criminal cases.
   But even critics acknowledge that such negotiations, while
stirring public outrage at times, are essential to prosecutors and
the courts.
   ``This takes the air out of the guts of agents who are busting
their chops fighting drug smuggling,'' Joseph diGenova, a former
U.S. attorney in Washington, said of the Noriega negotiations.
``They're going to ask, `Why the hell was he indicted in the first
place?'''
   But diGenova quickly added, ``Plea bargaining is perfectly
proper. It depends on the what the bargain is. What does the U.S.
government get out of it?''
   The Reagan administration said Thursday it was discussing a deal
that could result in the dropping of drug-trafficking charges
against Noriega in exchange for his agreement to relinquish power.
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to say if the
drug charges were involved in the plea bargain.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said if the arrangement
works it ``would be the most fruitful and productive plea bargain
that we have seen in a long time.''
   Plea bargains _ resulting in reduced prison terms, probation or
dropped indictments _ sometimes may resemble distasteful deals with
the devil. But they are an entrenched part of the criminal justice
system, a vital tool for easing crowded court dockets or persuading
a defendant to testify against a higher-up in a criminal conspiracy.
   Prosecutors also bargain with defendants because they fear
weaknesses in their cases, settling for a reduced sentence rather
than risking acquittal.
   ``There are always plea bargains you would rather not make,''
said Lawrence Barcella, a former U.S. attorney. ``Do I regret them?
Yeah, I regret a lot from the emotional standpoint. From the
intellectual standpoint, I agree with all of them.''
   Barcella said it may well be that the Reagan administration
``views the presence of Noriega as such a cancer on the people of
Panama'' that it is willing to let him off the hook to get him out
of power.
   But Barcella also noted that there was a slim chance Noriega
ever would be brought to trial in the United States even if the
charges against him were not dropped. The difficulties in
extraditing a foreign leader or forcing his expulsion from his
homeland could be insurmountable, he said.
   One of the most publicized plea bargains in the nation's history
led to the resignation of then-Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on
Oct. 10, 1973.
   Agnew pleaded no contest to federal income tax evasion and was
fined $10,000 and sentenced to probation for three years.
   Agnew had been under investigation in a probe of alleged
political graft and bribe-taking dating back to his days as a
county executive and then governor of Maryland before Richard Nixon
picked him as his running mate.
   The plea agreement prompted outrage in some quarters. But
then-Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson said it was an honorable
end to the Justice Department's investigation.
   Richardson said the evidence ``establishes a pattern of
substantial cash payments'' to Agnew while he was governor of
Maryland in return for state engineering contracts. But the former
attorney general said Agnew's resignation and the stain on his
reputation were punishment enough.
   In 1985, E.F. Hutton & Co., a leading Wall Street brokerage
firm, pleaded guilty to 2,000 felony counts of mail and wire fraud
in a $4.35 billion scheme to write checks exceeding funds on
deposits at more than 400 banks.
   No individuals were named in the charges, and no one went to
jail. But Hutton paid a $2 million fine, plus $750,000 to help pay
for the government's investigation. The company also agreed to set
up an $8 million fund to make restitution to the banks.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said the agreement sent ``a
message to the business world that so-called white-collar crime ...
will not be tolerated.''
   But critics said the company and its officials escaped with
barely a slap on the wrist.
   The Carter administration was criticized by some when in 1977
former CIA Director Richard C. Helms pleaded no contest to two
misdemeanor charges of failing to testify fully about the agency's
attempts to prevent the election of Marxist Salvador Allende as
president of Chile in 1970.
   The government said it accepted the plea to avoid accidental
disclosure of government secrets if Helms went to trial.
   Helms was fined $2,000, placed on probation for a year and
declared ``in disgrace and shame'' by U.S. District Judge
Barrington D. Parker.
   In contrast, a plea agreement in March this year involving
former presidential aide Robert C. McFarlane caused hardly a ripple.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misleading Congress by assuring
lawyers the Reagan administration was not helping arm Nicaraguan
rebels during a ban on U.S. military aid.
   McFarlane has not yet been sentenced.

   Jewish leaders said Thursday that President
Reagan had assured them he will press Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at the Moscow summit to make good on promised human
rights gains.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, quoted Reagan as saying, ``In no way are the Soviets going
to get us to retreat from these principals and from the insistence
to their obedience to their obligations.''
   Abram, accompanied by Simcha Dinitz, former Israeli ambassador
to the United States, told reporters outside the White House that
the meeting ``went extremely well.''
   Reagan will travel to Helsinki, Finland, on May 25 and make a
presummit speech en route to his May 29-June 2 summit with
Gorbachev.
   Abram credited the president with having ``absolutely
institutionalized the use of summitry to advance the cause of human
rights and Soviet Jewry in a way that it can never be ignored by
any subsequent administration.''
   ``And the proof of that is that on Oct. 10, 1987, prior to the
Washington summit last year, Chairman Gorbachev for the first time
joined the president of the United States in a statement that human
rights and humanitarian affairs would be on the agenda _ something
they had never admitted before as a matter that was rightfully on
the agenda.''
   Dinitz was asked whether he thought Gorbachev would be willing
to make major headway in improving Jewish emigration rights, given
the Kremlin leader's boast during the Washington summit that ``I'm
not on trial here.''
   ``I might say he might not be on trial,'' said Dinitz, chairman
of the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency, Israel,
``but the action and behavior with regard to human rights are on
trial. And the prosecutor, so to speak, is not the president of the
United States but the conscience of mankind.''
   ``We are all aware of the fact that at the last summit meeting,
Mr. Gorbachev said to the president, `By what right do you have to
challenge us on those questions''' Abram said. ``The right is
derived from documents they themselves signed.''
   ``And to be fair about it, there has been an improvement of the
emigration figures in the last few months under Mr. Gorbachev,''
Abram said. He said there had been about 1,100 emigrations in the
first four months of 1988, compared with about 1,000 in an entire
year before Gorbachev's ascension to power.
   But Abram said the figures were even higher under Leonid I.
Brezhnev, before the advent of Gorbachev and his ``glasnost''
society.
   ``We welcome improvement, and with every improvement, we will
say, on behalf of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, `Things
are improving,' but they are a long way from fulfilling their
obligations under international undertakings,'' he said.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo headed for the
West Coast on Thursday to ``have some fun'' attacking Vice
President George Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee,
and help raise money for Democrats.
   ``Since I'm never going to leave the bullpen, I may as well get
out there for some scrimmaging,'' said the former minor league
baseball player who was once considered a potential 1988 Democratic
presidential nominee. ``I may as well have some fun.''
   Cuomo said he would use a Friday night appearance in San
Francisco on behalf of Rep. Nancy Pelosi and one in Seattle on
Saturday night for Washington Gov. Booth Gardner to go after Bush.
   In between, Cuomo was to stop in Portland, Ore., to deliver a
foreign policy speech.
   Cuomo said the battle for the Democratic nomination, now
expected to go to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, had been good
for the party.
   ``They had virtually no contest,'' said Cuomo of the
Republicans, offering a preview of his attacks on Bush. ``They
would have us believe that it was because they were all eager to
speak with just one voice, the voice of George Bush. I think it's
because they have nothing to say.''
   ``...We will ask him (Bush) to use his voice to tell us why he
hasn't used his voice for eight years,'' said Cuomo.
   The New York governor's West Coast trip, planned months ago, was
once viewed as possible evidence that Cuomo had hopes of a
deadlocked national convention turning to him with its presidential
nomination.
   Cuomo's Portland speech on Saturday comes just three days before
the Oregon presidential primary. The California primary is June 7.
   However, that was all before the April 19 New York presidential
primary when Dukakis stormed ahead of Jesse Jackson in the delegate
count and buried Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s faltering
campaign _ with no help from Cuomo.
   Cuomo said Thursday that his address Saturday to the Oregon
World Affairs Council would focus on U.S.-Soviet relations. The
governor spent a week in the Soviet Union in September.
   ``One need not be a candidate to have an opinion,'' said Cuomo.
   And what if he's asked about a possible 1992 presidential
campaign?
   ``Please, forget '92. I have the state to deal with,'' said
Cuomo.

   The Soviet Union is turning increasingly to
barter arrangements with other countries in an effort to stretch
its declining reserves of foreign currency, an Agriculture
Department analyst said Thursday.
   ``Foreign currency is tight for the Soviet government, which in
turn has decreased the Soviet Union's buying power significantly,''
said Thomas Hamby of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Hamby, now the agency's deputy director of marketing for dairy,
livestock and poultry, recently returned from Moscow after 2{ years
as U.S. agricultural attache. His remarks were in a new issue of
the agency's Foreign Agriculture magazine.
   The Soviets make it plain they are in a better position to
exchange products for foreign goods than to pay in foreign currency.
   ``This is a difficult constraint on trade from the U.S.
standpoint,'' Hamby said. The Soviet Union simply does not have the
ability to supply the quantity or quality of either agricultural or
non-agricultural products which would make a barter arrangement
feasible.''
   Hamby said the United States imports only about $25 million
worth of Soviet agricultural products each year, while the Soviet
Union's imports of U.S. farm products averages around $2 billion
annually.
   ``This situation has led to continuing Soviet pressure to lift
U.S. import restrictions on Soviet furskins and other commodities,
and pressure for most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status, which
would give the Soviet Union preferential access to the U.S.
market,'' he said.
   Under MFN, the United States would grant the Soviet Union the
same trading privileges that it offers most other foreign trading
partners. The MFN designation for the Soviet Union has been held up
for years because of Moscow's restrictive emigration policies.
   These issues are likely to persist in any trade negotiation
between the Soviet Union and the United States, Hamby said.
Currently, negotiators are working on a successor to the five-year
grain agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States.

<HEAD>Girl Scout Cookies Leave For Japan For Second Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipment of Girl Scout cookies
winged out of Texas on Thursday on its second trip to U.S. sailors
in Japan after a Brownie troop got a taste of the power of politics.
   Sailors aboard the USS Midway, stationed in Atsugi, bought the
402 boxes from Brownie Troop 807 in Beeville. But the plan crumbled
when the the girls were told that the cookies faced a stiff customs
tariff in Japan.
   The cookies were sent back and sat in an American Airlines
office at the Corpus Christi International Airport for more than a
week.
   The sweets finally left Thursday morning on a flight to Dallas,
where the Thin Mints, Golden Yangles, Scot Ts, Savannahs, Jubilees,
Classic Cremes and Hoedowns caught a connecting non-stop flight to
Tokyo, said officials for the airline, which provided free
transportation.
   ``They're on the way, and the red tape should be turning to
green by now,'' Marchetta White, the troop's leader, said Thursday.
The shipment was to arrive Friday afternoon in Japan.
   Mrs. White said U.S. Navy personnel originally told her the
Japanese demanded a tariff of more than $2,000 before releasing the
cookies from customs.
   But the consulate-general of Japan in Houston last week
attributed the cookie misfortune to ``insufficient communications
among those who are involved with customs clearance.''
   A spokesman for the consulate said the import fees amounted to
about 20,000 yen, or about $150. According to a statement issued by
the consulate, there would have been no customs fee ``if the U.S.
armed forces had taken necessary procedures.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, worked through diplomatic channels
to get the cookies to the sailors without a customs fee, and sent a
telegram to the Brownies on Wednesday.
   ``This all happened because you wanted to do something nice for
some sailors serving our country on the other side of the the world
...,'' the telegram said. ``Now everyone has seen how helpful
Brownies in Texas are.''
   He added that he was ``sure the `Cookie Monster' is pleased,
too.''
   The 18-member Brownie troop first started corresponding with the
sailors at Christmas, then sent a Valentine's Day package and
finally the April 26 shipment of cookies, Mrs. White said.
   They could not send the cookies by mail because it would have
been too expensive, Mrs. White said, and the airline offered free
shipment.
   ``Everybody who was supposed to be getting the cookies was
really upset when they didn't get them,'' said Petty Officer 3rd
Class Sid Woolford, Mrs. White's son-in-law, who is stationed on
the Midway and on leave in Beeville.
   The girls prepared another gift for the sailors Wednesday by
posing on the steps of the Bee County Courthouse for a color photo
they will send the sailors, said Mrs. White.
   Meanwhile, she added, the troop will wait to hear how the
sailors liked the cookies: ``They're waiting for the letters that
will be coming to them again.''

<HEAD>Army Says Germ Warfare Research Is Safe, Essential and Benefits
Science</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army unveiled a massive study Thursday
designed to support its biological warfare research program,
portraying the work as safe to the environment, essential to
national security and a boon to science.
   ``In recognition of the potentially hazardous nature of (this)
type of research ... the Defense Department as well as the
scientific community has developed and implemented elaborate
controls to assure adequate protection for the work force and
virtually total protection for the external environment,'' the Army
concluded in a draft environmental impact statement.
   ``The history of the Biological Defense Research Program
illustrates the effectiveness of these controls. ... Additional
mitigation was not found to be justified.''
   The report, which runs several hundred pages, was condemned
quickly by the environmental group that forced its preparation as
``shoddy and incomplete.''
   ``They have not complied with the spirit or the letter of the
court order against them,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, the president of
the Foundation on Economic Trends.
   ``We are putting the Defense Department on notice that unless
they completely revise the method and content of the environmental
impact study, we will file suit again,'' Rifkin said.
   The environmental study was prompted by a lawsuit Rifkin's group
filed in September 1986. The foundation is a Washington-based
environmental activist group that has long focused its attention on
the dangers of biological research and genetic engineering.
   Within the biological field, the United States has committed
itself by international treaty not to develop offensive biological
weapons. However, the Army maintains a large defensive program
aimed at developing vaccines and antidotes, detection systems and
battlefield gear that could be used to protect American soldiers if
attacked with natural or man-made poisons.
   In order to develop such defenses, laboratories must work with a
variety of deadly toxins.
   According to the Pentagon, roughly $60 million is now being
spent yearly on such research at more than 100 military, university
and private laboratories in 27 states and eight foreign countries.
   The foundation's suit sought to stop the research on grounds the
program had grown so large that an impact study had become a legal
necessity. The Pentagon agreed to submit the environmental study as
long as it could continue the work in the interim.
   In essence, the Army concluded Thursday its operating procedures
and lab safety features had evolved to the point ``that even severe
accidents would not create significant risk or impact upon the
quality of the human environment.''
   ``It is recognized that controversy exists concerning the need
and appropriateness of the Biological Defense Research Program,''
the study continued. ``But defense against biological weapons is
considered a vital component of the overall defense posture of the
United States and its allies.
   ``And ... certain aspects of the program should be recognized as
beneficial. A large portion of the BDRP effort ... is for basic
research and development.''
   ``Offering us conclusory statements that everything is OK is
simply immaterial,'' Andy Kimbrell, a foundation attorney, said.
   ``The legal standard here is a `hard look' analysis of possible
hazards, and this isn't a `hard look.' For example, they list 129
laboratories across the country and don't tell us exactly what's
going on at those labs, what organisms are being researched and
what security and precautions have been taken. That's
unacceptable.''
   Ironically, the Army released its impact study just one day
after a Senate subcommittee blasted the Pentagon for ``serious
deficiencies'' in the safety management of both the biological and
chemical warfare research programs.
   The majority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs oversight
subcommittee reported it had found ``inadequate regulations, lax
safety enforcement and documented safety lapses.''
   In the biological weapons area, the review found that ``there is
no comprehensive set of safety regulations for research'' with
biological warfare agents and toxins, ``no emphasis on safety in
the contractor program and no office that monitors contractor
safety.''

   Sen. James J. Exon of Nebraska on Thursday
joined the growing list of Democratic members of Congress who have
endorsed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as the Democratic
nominee for president.
   Exon, who will go to July's national convention as a ``super

Democrats who gave Dukakis a 63 percent backing in Tuesday's
primary.
   ``Mike is a friend of many years going back to the time we both

<HEAD>Dukakis Holds Slight Edge Going Into Colorado Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
goes into next week's Colorado state convention with a slight lead
over Jesse Jackson, according to the latest count of convention
delegates.
   Wednesday's count of delegates to the May 21 convention in
Boulder showed 52 percent supporting Dukakis, 38 percent backing
Jackson and 10 percent uncommited or supporting another candidate.
   But unless Dukakis can pick up nearly all of those uncommitted
delegates at the state convention, he will split the 16 Colorado
national delegates with Jackson.
   ``I am committed to making that 60 percent threshold,'' said Tom
Glass, Dukakis' state campaign coordinator. ``It is very clear that
Dukakis will have a clear majority of the delegates to the state
convention, but it would be very tough ... to get a 10-6 split.''

   Harold Washington ``would not have been amused''
by a painting showing him in women's lingerie, but the late mayor
wouldn't have gone along with aldermen who stormed the exhibit and
had the work removed, a longtime friend said Thursday.
   ``He would have been the first one to say the artist has a right
to do whatever the artist does,'' former mayoral press secretary
Alton Miller said a day after the outraged aldermen had police
confiscate the painting from the School of the Art Institute.
   Officer Patrick Camden said police removed the painting ``for
safekeeping because of the possibility of inciting civil unrest.''
He said it would be returned Thursday.
   The painting by student David K. Nelson depicts Washington
wearing a frilly white bra, panties and stockings, holding a pencil
and frowning out at viewers. It had been displayed in a school hall
with dozens of others in a student competition.
   The school offers a four-year bachelor of arts program and a
two-year master's degree, said Kevin Frech, a spokesman for the
private school whose sister institution is the adjacent art musuem.
   The exhibit is closed to the public, but the aldermen say they
got involved after receiving numerous complaints from angry
constituents who had seen the painting.
   They contend the work titled ``Mirth and Girth'' is an insult to
Washington.
   But a group of students argue the painting is artistic
self-expression and protected by the First Amendment.
   Washington would have agreed with both assessments, Miller said.
   ``He would not have been amused,'' and would have seen the
painting as ``aiding and abetting'' a campaign waged by his
detractors to raise questions about his character, Miller said in a
telephone interview.
   But Miller added, Washington would have strongly felt that ``in
terms of either ordinance statute or constitutional law ... there's
absolutely no way that it can be suppressed.''
   ``I don't think it's the most tasteful portrait, but I don't
think that matters,'' Nelson told radio station WLUP.
   ``Nobody said when I went to the Art Institute that I had to
produce tasteful artwork. In fact ... that goes against everything
the institution is about,'' he said. ``It's like saying you have to
produce artwork in a certain way.''
   At the school, a group of about 15 people marched peacefully
outside Thursday to protest the painting as the board of directors
met inside to discuss the matter.
   Frech said he did not know what options the board was
considering.
   Civil liberties experts and legal scholars took the students'
side.
   ``We're against censorship and this seems to be a form of
censorship,'' said Jay Miller, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.
   Daniel Polsby, a Northwestern University law professor, called
the aldermen's behavior ``constitutionally indefensible.
   ``They behaved like a lynch mob and very seriously violated the
civil rights of (the artist) as well as the Art Institute.''
   Alderman Allan Streeter, who was among those who stormed the
school and helped draft a resolution demanding that the painting be
removed, said he's aware of the constitutional issues involved.
   ``There's a moral question that outweighs the constitutional
question,'' he said Thursday.
   The city of Chicago gives the Art Institute, which oversees the
school, subsidies of $5 million a year ``as well as other public
and private funds, and we don't feel that any institution, private
or public, has a right to portray a leader of any community ... in
such a derogatory fashion,'' he said.
   Alderman Robert Shaw, who sponsored the resolution, said police
removed the painting because ``it posed a threat to the safety to
the school and the general community.''
   ``People, particularly from the black community, are highly
perturbed _ using it mildly _ about this particular portrait,''
Shaw said. Washington, who died in November, was the city's first
black mayor.
   Miller said the ACLU was looking for the student and would
represent him if he chose to protest the case in court.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright is keeping on
indefinitely a press aide who was the focus of controversy due to
angry letters he wrote to newspapers and revelations he was the
author of a sex book.
   Wright and George Mair, 59, originally had agreed to a six-month
contract that was due to expire at the end of May.
   But Wright decided Tuesday after talking to Mair that he would
keep the press aide on his staff ``as another hand at the oar,''
Mair said Thursday.
   Mair and Wright are working together on a book on the 200-year
history of Congress, which celebrates its bicentennial in April
1989. Mair said he will concentrate on media liaison work, helping
the speaker research material for newspaper opinion columns and
revive the Democratic congressman's newsletter to the constituents
in his Texas district.
   Rumors circulated in January, a month after Mair was hired, that
he would be resigning following revelations he was the author of a
book of reviews of 113 books on sex, love and romance.
   ``We're two honorable men who stick by our word,'' Mair said.
``We both told everyone I would have a six-month trial period and
everyone became astonished when we kept our word and I was
astonished that everyone was astonished.''
   Wright in January had distanced himself from a series of
intemperate letters written by Mair to 19 newspapers, including one
to the Los Angeles Times suggesting two reporters had engaged in
plagiarism in their profile of the speaker.
   The Los Angeles Times angrily protested Mair's letter.
   Other recipients of angry letters included the Wall Street
Journal, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report.
   Wright apologized for the letters, saying at the time: ``While I
am as concerned as George over lack of balance in some of this
coverage, angry letters obviously do little to correct it.''
   ``I wrote 19 letters, but only five were reported on,'' Mair
said of criticism of him. ``Then I wrote a book on love and
intimacy and relations between men and women. I just wrote 113 book
reviews. It was originally titled `A Guide to Books on Love and
Intimacy.' But it was changed to `The Sex Book Digest.'''
   Mair, an author of numerous books, a former columnist for the
Los Angeles Times Syndicate and a former editor and publisher of
the Alexandria (Va.) Gazette, said his letters did not reflect that
he is ``against my fellow journalists.'' He said his letter
outlined ``patent, outright lies.''
   ``I talked to almost all of those people I wrote letters to and
several said they checked back the story and found the reporter did
not have the facts straight, and that's all I asked,'' he said.

<HEAD>FAA Proposal Would Require Safer Airline Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday proposed that existing airline seats be modified to better
protect passengers during hard or crash landings and that seats on
new aircraft offer similar protection.
   The upgraded seats would increase passengers' chances of
escaping survivable accidents without serious injury and would be
less likely to reak loose and block aisles, allowing easier
emergency evacuation, the FAA said.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the seats would ``meet new
dynamic test standards that simulate actual crash loads and are
consistent with current floor strength levels. The new seats would
also be required to absorb some of the impact of a crash landing
without passing it on to the passengers.''
   Under the FAA's proposed rules, airlines would have seven years
to retrofit their fleets with better seats, starting from the time
that new aircraft were required to carry upgraded seats.
   The proposal is based on a five-year research and development
program by the FAA and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. The program used dummies to monitor human tolerance
for crash impact forces.

<TEXT>
   A man charged with drunken driving
was allowed to plead guilty to speeding in exchange for a $20,000
donation to a drug task force, a plea bargain that has angered some
residents.
   District Attorney General David Crockett said the benefit to the
public outweighed the mandatory 48-hour jail term, $250 fine and
yearlong driver's license suspension for first-time drunken driving
convictions.
   Tom Donihe of Kingsport pleaded guilty Friday to the reduced
charge.
   Donihe was arrested in April 1986 after he was clocked driving
at 78 mph and had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 percent, police
said. Legal intoxication in Tennessee is 0.10 percent.
   The leaders of two area chapters of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving criticized Crockett for accepting the offer by Donihe's
lawyer.
   Elizabeth Price, head of the Johnson City MADD chapter, is
calling for Crockett's resignation.
   ``If I wasn't a Christian, I could tell you what I really
think,'' she said. ``I feel that the people who let him off are the
real criminals.''
   Lynda Fortner, president of the MADD chapter in Kingsport, said
the decision to accept a plea bargain in the case ``almost sounds
like a bribe.''
   ``I've weighed the criticism and I'm willing to take it,''
Crockett said. ``We have successfully prosecuted several thousand
drunk drivers. ... If we made a mistake in the case then my batting
average is still 999.99 of doing the right thing.''
   Criminal Court Judge Arden Hill, who approved the plea bargain
expressed some reservation before accepting the plea, saying, ``It
bothers my conscience.''
   Crockett, whose teen-age son was killed in a 1986 traffic
accident, has been a vocal opponent of drunken driving.
   He said the contribution to the First Judicial Drug Task Force,
which he helped found, was ``a proper disposition of the case.''
   The unit, made up of officers from various agencies,
investigates drug cases in four counties. It is funded with court
fines, private donations and tax dollars from local governments.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Actor Rose Was Murdered; Cocaine Found</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four men have been
charged with murdering actor George Rose by clubbing him to death,
police said Thursday. The four include Rose's 18-year-old adopted
son and the youth's father.
   A sworn statement said the Broadway performer was held for eight
hours before he was killed May 4 and attempts were made to make the
death look like an accident.
   The death of the British-born Rose, 68, winner of Tony awards
for ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' and a revival of ``My Fair
Lady,'' had originally been blamed on a single-car accident.
   Police and doctors said Thursday that cocaine was found on Rose
and that laboratory tests performed in Miami showed traces of a
cocaine derivative in his body at the time of his death.
   A statement read by police spokesman Col. Aquiles Cruz Gomez at
a news conference said three men were arrested and a fourth suspect
was at large.
   The statement said the three ``confessed to police that they
planned the crime when they noticed Mr. George Rose felt certain
amorous weaknesses for another 14-year old minor.''
   The three _ Rose's adopted son, Domingo Antonio Ralfe Vazquez,
nicknamed Juan; the young man's natural father, Juan Antonio
Vazquez Padilla, and the youth's uncle, Maximo Padilla Vazquez _
appeared at the news conference and told reporters they took part
in the actor's death.
   ``What I really wanted was to take revenge on the American Rose
because of his homosexual activities, since he was hurting a lot of
boys in this sector, in addition to mine, whom he had already
prostituted since the age of 13,'' said a sworn statement from Juan
Antonio Vazquez Padilla distributed to reporters by police.
   The statement said the youth, the youth's uncle and another man
he paid $200 agreed to take Rose to an isolated location and kill
him.
   On May 4, when Rose was driving his car to the city of Santiago
with his adopted son, the three other men waited by the side of the
road near the north coast town of Sosua and forced the car to stop.
   They got in, leaving the adopted son behind, and drove to a
nearby farm, where they held Rose for eight hours before killing
him, it said.
   ``Around 8 p.m. we clubbed him to death beating him on the
head,'' the statement said.
   The father's statement said the men took the money from Rose's
pockets and divided it, but left his documents intact. They then
put Rose's body in the car and drove to a small ditch, where ``we
flipped the car over to make it look like a traffic accident.''
   Results of an autopsy released Monday described the death as
accidental, but pathologist Sergio Sarita told reporters Thursday
the final report indicated ``the death was not an accident but a
homicide.''
   He said ``investigations ... indicated the car was impacted at a
very slow speed that would not have exceeded 15 kilometers per hour
(just over 9 mph) so (Rose's) injuries could not have been from
that impact.''
   Sarita said tests in Miami showed traces of a cocaine derivative
in Rose's urine but none in his brain.
   ``While examining Rose's documents at the site where the body
was found police ... found he was carrying an amount of cocaine in
his purse,'' said the police statement.
   Rose had owned a beach home outside Sosua, about 15 miles east
of Puerto Plata, for the past nine years.
   His adopted son, who lived in the house, said in a sworn
statement released by police that he met Rose six years ago when he
was a student and that Rose suggested adopting him in 1985.
   He said his real father agreed and the adoption was legal.
   The youth said in the statement that on April 30, he told his
father Rose was returning to the island in a few days and that ``I
felt bad because he had shown he felt a certain weakness for a
minor ... who lived in our house.''
   Rose, who had lived in New York City since 1961, was a versatile
actor who was as much at home playing Shakespeare as he was in a
comedy or a musical. He preferred the stage, but also appeared in
scores of motion pictures and television productions.
   A memorial service is planned for May 25 at the Shubert Theater.

   State prison inmates with AIDS sometimes get
improper medical care and are being unnecessarily denied freedom
for the final days of their lives, a prison watchdog group charged
Thursday.
   The Correctional Association of New York said an 18-month
investigation demonstrated that the prison system and state
government have not responded adequately'' to AIDS in the prisons.
   ``AIDS and prison is proving to be a devastating combination,''
said Cathy Potler, author of the report.
   Among other things, the association urged mandatory education
about AIDS for prisoners and staff, expanded and better-supervised
medical care, and new provisions to allow the release of terminally
ill prisoners.
   New York, which has more AIDS cases than any other state, also
has more prisoners with AIDS.
   As of the end of last year 597 AIDS cases had been confirmed
among New York's prison inmates, said state prison system spokesman
James Flateau. Of those, 346 inmates died while in prison, 152 had
been released and 99 remained in custody. He said about 100 AIDS
cases and 120 cases of AIDS-Related Complex, are in the
42,000-inmate system.
   There is no known cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
which is fatal.
   The association had medical consultants and non-medical
investigators visit several prisons to prepare its report.
   The group said it also found that inmates suffering from AIDS
are often shunned by other inmates who are afraid of even casual
contact. Inmate barbers at one prison refused to give haircuts to
men with AIDS, said the report.
   And while prison officials told the association that ``the
hysteria initially expressed by the security staff has subsided
considerably'' over the last three years, the watchdog group still
found evidence of fear.
   State Corrections Commissioner Thomas Coughlin said the
association's medical team should have spent more time in the
prisons.
   ``Much of the report consists of the opinions of non-medical
researchers, supported by unattributed comments by staff and
inmates, the content of which may or may not be accurate,''
Coughlin said.

   A federal judge questioned Thursday whether the
government alone can drop the drug indictment against Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, and local prosecutors inisted they want to
try the case.
   ``My understanding and knowledge of the law is that the
presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the
motion of the government,'' said U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler, who is handling the case. ``However, I am having the law
researched further.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that the
Reagan administration is discussing a deal that could result in the
dropping of drug trafficking charges against Noriega in exchange
for his agreement to relinquish power.
   The lead prosecutor in the case, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney
Richard Gregorie, said Thursday he strongly opposes any deal.
   ``I am against the dismissal, and right now I am ready to try
this case,'' said Gregorie. Gregorie's boss, U.S. Attorney Leon
Kellner, released a statement through his executive assistant Ana
Barnett following his meeting with Attorney General Edwin Meese III
in Washington.
   ``He would not discuss the details of his talk with Mr. Meese,
but he said, `I presented my views,''' Ms. Barnett said. ``I am
authorized to say his views haven't changed, and he wants to
proceed with the case and he's ready to proceed with the trial.'''
   Kellner has previously vowed not to dismiss the indictment, but
Noriega's attorneys said the government has little choice.
   ``General Noriega believes, and always has believed, that the
indictment against him was a political indictment,'' his attorney,
Neal Sonnett, said Thursday. ``So a dismissal of the indictment
would have to be a pre-condition to any discussions.''
   Sonnett's associate, attorney Raymond Takiff, was called back to
Panama on Thursday following the revelations about a possible deal.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who brought a separate indictment
in Tampa against Noriega, refused comment Thursday on reports he
has threatened to quit if the charges are dropped.
   Merkle was in Jacksonville prosecuting Carlos Lehder Rivas,
alleged to be a member of the same Medellin Cartel that prosecutors
say paid Noriega to protect its interest.
   Noriega is charged in a 12-count Miami indictment with accepting
$4.6 million in bribes from the cartel; in Tampa, he faces three
marijuana importation counts.
   The possibility of a deal was good news for Noriega's
co-defendants.
   Brian Davidow, the only defendant arrested in the Miami case,
also should have his case dismissed, said his attorney, Richard
Sharpstein.
   Gregorie agreed.
   ``If they made me dismiss this case, I would dismiss against Mr.
Davidow and all the other defendants,'' the prosecutor said. ``It
would be a travesty of justice to proceed against any of the
defendants if the case against the chief defendant was dismissed.''

<HEAD>Presidential Panel Says Adoption Overlooked as Alternative to
Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of federal officials Thursday
recommended legislative and other changes to encourage adoption,
which it said was ``too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood''
as an alternative to abortion.
   The Interagency Task Force on Adoption also said ``the pool of
adoptive parents should expand, and martial status, age or physical
disabilities should not preclude individuals from consideration as
prospective parents.''
   However, it curtly dismissed the demands of some gay rights
organizations for expanded rights for gay men and lesbians to adopt
children, saying only, ``The task force does not support adoption
by homosexuals.''
   The panel said it was preferable that a child be placed in a
family of his or her own racial background, but adoption across
racial lines ``should be permissible to provide a child with a
loving, permanent home.''
   The report of the 13-member task force, appointed by President
Reagan last August, was made public after the president, himself an
adoptive parent, presented it to representatives of private
agencies in an Oval Office meeting.
   The task force said about 40 percent of the 1 million American
teen-agers who become pregnant each year have abortions. Of the
teenagers who have their babies, it said, at least 90 percent end
up parenting them.
   ``A prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not get
an abortion, she must want to have a baby and take care of him
herself,'' the panel said. ``The option which gives life to a baby,
while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptive
parents, is too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood.''
   The task force recommended that states consider a law adopted in
California that reimburses licensed, non-profit maternity homes for
the costs of materinty home care and services necessary for a woman
under 21 to carry her baby to full term.
   It also recommended that states consider legislation, which it
said at least 20 have already adopted, exempting directors and
officers on non-profit orgqanizations from liability suits unless
willful or wanton misconduct is involved. It said such legislation
is needed because adoption agencies have been hit hard by rising
liability insurance costs.
   The task force recommended support for pending federal
legislation concering social security benefits for adopted children
and health insurance coverage for disabled adopted children.
   ``Children often remain in foster care programs for too long a
period of time before a plan for adoption is developed,'' the panel
said. It recommended ``procedures for more timely termination of
parental rights, establishment of foster care review boards,,
accountability and supervision of agency caseworkers'' and related
steps.
   The chairman of the task force was Mary Sheila Gall, counselor
to the director of the Office of Personnel Management and the
single adoptive parent of two children.
   Other members included representatives from the White House,
Justice Department, Treasury Deparrtment, Department of Health and
Human Services, Department of Education, Department of Defense,
Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.

<HEAD>Price Declines Greatly Reduce Recoverable Oil, Gas Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department may again drastically
lower its estimates of undiscovered oil and gas that can be
recovered from federal waters, according to preliminary figures
released Thursday.
   If the estimates are not revised during public review, the
department would show 37 percent less undiscovered oil and gas both
onshore and offshore compared with currently used figures.
   Part of the lowered estimates result from the decline in crude
oil prices, which means small, high-cost reservoirs are dropped
from the list of prospects because it doesn't pay to recover the
oil and gas there.
   Oil today costs about $18 a barrel, and the new estimates are
based on that price. In 1981, the price was almost double that.
   Part of the decline, however, represents dry holes, notably in
Alaska.
   By coincidence, the new offshore estimates came the same day the
Energy Department released what it meant to be a cheery estimate of
the nation's total natural gas reserves, discovered and
undiscovered.
   The Energy Department said these amount to a 35-year supply, 583
trillion cubic feet, at current usage rates and a wellhead price of
$3 per thousand cubic feet. The current price is $1.83.
   In asking for industry and scientific comment on the new
offshore oil and gas estimates, the Interior Department declined to
make comparisons with existing figures. Officials said they wanted
to emphasize by their reticence the tentative, subject-to-revision
nature of the estimates.
   But simple arithmetic showed the offshore oil estimate off 27
percent from the figure in current use and the gas estimate down 18
percent: 8.9 billion barrels of oil compaired with 12.2 billion
barrels and 74 trillion cubic feet of gas compared with 90.5
trillion cubic feet.
   In March, preliminary new onshore estimates showed unrecovered
oil down 39 percent and gas down 41 percent: oil, 33.4 billion
barrels compared with 54.6 billion; gas, 254 trillion cubic feet
compared with 427 trillion cubic feet.
   Combined, that means estimated oil remaining to be found dropped
from 66.8 billion barrels to 42.3 billion and gas fell from 518
trillion cubic feet to 328 trillion.
   The current onshore figures were compiled in 1984 and themselves
represented reductions from 1981 estimates of 55 percent for oil
and 44 percent for gas. Current onshore estimates were made in 1981.
   Some offshore areas showed little change, but Alaska's federal
waters were almost wiped out as a promising place to look. The new
estimates showed no gas at all there, compared with almost 14
trillion cubic feet in 1984, and 900 million barrels of oil
compared with 3.3 billion.
   Gas estimates for the Gulf of Mexico were raised, largely
because of the extension of drilling to deeper water in recent
years: 64.3 trillion cubic feet compared with 59.6 trillion cubic
feet. The oil estimate was down slightly to 5.6 billion barrels
from 6.0 billion.
   Pacific Coast oil estimates were about the same as before at 2.1
billion barrels. Gas of 4.7 trillion cubic feet was down from 5.2
trillion. The Atlantic Coast oil estimate was lowered from 680
million barrels to 250 million and the gas estimate slashed from
12.3 trillion cubic feet to 4.5 trillion.
   A gas price of $5 would draw into the market only an additional
10-year supply, 174 trillion cubic feet, the study said. This fiure
and other estimates would be ``substantially larger'' if the
analysts had incorporated forseeable new technologies, but they
stuck strictly with known technologies in the interest of being
conservative, said the study director, William L. Fisher.
   The study made no price forecasts. The department's Energy
Information Administration projects that gas will rise to only
$2.85 in 1995 and $4.02 in 2000.
   Nicholas Bush, president of the Natural Gas Supply Association,
a producer group, said the Energy Department's findings were ``very
positive ones for producers and consumers alike.''
   ``I think the study is deceptive,'' said Ed Rothschild,
assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, a
consumer advocacy group.
   ``It doesn't look at gas at $2, which is a much more realistic
price, and when you do, there isn't as much gas there.''

<HEAD>New Procedures Set For Inspecting Imported Meat And Poultry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New procedures have been designed to regulate
the inspection of imported meat and poultry, including the
permanent marking of shipments that fail to meet U.S. standards,
the Agriculture Department announced Thursday.
   Each consignment that fails to pass U.S. inspection would be
stamped ``U.S. Refused Entry'' on each carcass or packing
container, said Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   ``This will help ensure that rejected meat and poultry does not
get into the human food supply in the United States,'' he said.
``It will also warn other countries where the products might be
subsequently shipped that the U.S. has rejected the items.''
   Products that are refused entry must be removed from the United
States, converted to animal food or destroyed. Previously, such
products were identified with temporary placards and had to be
closely monitored by USDA employees.
   The new regulation, which takes effect June 12, also will
eliminate a requirement that products refused entry be sealed
before being transported in the United States, since the permanent
markings will serve to identify it.
   Crawford said the new rule also reinstates the practice of
``controlled pre-stamping'' in which import inspectors can put
their ``passed'' mark on containers of imported products before the
inspection has been fully carried out.
   This procedure is especially useful at cold storage facilities,
so that meat and poultry can be stamped and samples taken for
testing and inspection. If there are no problems, the products
don't have to be handled again, he said. If the products fail
inspection, inspectors can remove the marks and stamp the products
indelibly as refused.
   In a related action, the agency announced a proposal to allow
imported meat and poultry to be inspected only at the port where
the products are unloaded. Currently, the products can be shipped
across the country to another port for checking by USDA inspectors.
   Crawford said the proposal, which will be open for public
comment until July 12, would give federal inspectors ``much better
control of imported products entering food channels'' in the United
States.

<HEAD>Israeli Air Raid on Lebanon Wounds One Guerrilla</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian
targets south of Beirut on Thursday while a Syrian-backed radical
guerrilla leader was visiting the region. Police said at least one
guerrilla was wounded.
   Six fighter-bombers took part in the eighth aerial attack on
Lebanon this year, police said.
   The Israelis rocketed and destroyed three guerrilla command
posts in olive groves near the Kharroub region town of Barja in
three bombing runs, police said. Barja is 16 miles south of Beirut.
   The raid began at 6:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. The positions
were manned by guerrillas of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Paslestine-General Command, police said.
   The group's 52-year-old commander, Ahmed Jibril, was inspecting
the Kharroub region at the time of the raid, but several guerrillas
said he was not hurt.
   Jibril is a former Syrian army captain. His group is based in
Damascus and gets financial support from Libya.
   His fighters quickly cordoned off the stricken area and would
not allow reporters and photographers to inspect the damage.
   But from Sidon, nine miles south of Barja, smoke could be seen
billowing from the groves.
   In Israel, the military command said Israeli warplanes raided
guerrilla bases north of the southern port city of Sidon and
returned safely to their bases. The location would be in the same
area as the raids reported by Lebanese police.
   Pilots reported accurate hits, said the brief communique.
   Guerrillas fired at the planes with anti-aircraft guns, but no
hits were reported, the Lebanese police said.
   ``They appeared to have whisked their victims to a nearby field
clinic of their own,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be named
under standing regulations.
   ``We know of only one seriously wounded guerrilla. But there may
be more,'' he added.
   The targeted group has claimed responsibility for an attack in
northern Israel last November by a guerrilla flying a motorized
hang glider. The guerrilla killed six Israeli soldiers and wounded
eight before he was shot dead.
   In retaliation, a squadron of 12 Israeli fighter-bombers raided
three of the front's posts between around Barja on Jan. 3.
   Police said at the time that 26 people were killed and 30
wounded in that raid, the first on Lebanon in 1988.
   In all, 49 people have been killed and 71 wounded in Israeli air
raids on Lebanon. The last one was carried out by helicopter
gunships against the south Lebanon village of Kabrikha on May 9.

<HEAD>Campaign To Fight Preventable Injuries In Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children's advocates on Thursday announced a
``Safe Kids'' campaign designed to combat the leading killer of
America's children _ injuries that can be prevented.
   ``Preventable injuries are epidemic in this country ... (these)
things are preventable and that's what people have to be made aware
of,'' actress Markie Post of NBC-TV's ``Night Court'' said at a
press conference.
   ``We've got to change our vocabulary and priorities with
children now,''she said. ``We need to become more child-oriented.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who has scheduled hearings on
the issue, said surveys show that most parents would identify drug
abuse and kidnapping as the major concerns about their child's
safety.
   Dodd said 67 children in the United State were abducted last
year and 57 died from drug abuse, while nearly 8,000 children aged
14 and under were killed and 50,000 were permanently disabled as a
result of avoidable accidents.
   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, nearly
half the deaths of children aged 14 and under are caused by
unintentional injuries.
   The Safe Kids campaign was developed by Children's Hospital in
Washington, and is supported by Johnson & Johnson Co. and the
National Safety Council. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop serves as
honorary chairman of the national campaign.
   More than 40 health, corporate and children's organizations have
joined the campaign, with President Reagan expected to sign a
proclamation designating May 16-22 as National Safe Kids Week.
   Public service announcements featuring Ms. Post will begin
airing nationwide on Monday, inviting listeners to call
800-365-KIDS to request a 16-page safety booklet.
   The publication advises parents on how to protect children from
injury in five leading risk areas: traffic accidents, drownings,
burns and scalds, choking and poisoning, and falls.
   The booklet also urges parents to take first aid and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation courses to enable them to provide
immediate proper care if an injury does occur.
   Safe Kids groups in 24 cities will host injury prevention
activities next week.
   ``This campaign has set an ambitious goal _ to change the way
America thinks about and deals with the epidemic of preventable
injuries to children,'' said Herta Burbach Feely, executive
director of the campaign.
   ``The fact is we have not done and we are not doing everything
that we can to prevent childhood injuries either as individuals,
the community or as a nation.''

<HEAD>House Appropriations Subcommittee Cuts NASA Budget By $780 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House appropriations panel cut more than
$780 million out of the NASA budget Thursday and agency officials
said the reduction could seriously affect the civil space program.
   In the markup of appropriations for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the Appropriations Committee's subcommittee
on housing and urban development and independent agencies approved
a total budget for fiscal year 1989 of $10.706 billion. NASA had
asked for $11.488 billion.
   While that subcommittee was cutting the budget, the full House
Committee on Science, Space and Technology authorized the total
dollars that NASA had requested, making only minor changes in
distribution of the funding. But this action will have little
effect if the funds are not appropriated.
   The budget reduction by the Appropriations subcommittee ``is
really going to hurt the program. There is no more slack left in
NASA,'' said shuttle astronaut Jon McBride, on assignment in NASA's
congressional relations office. ``Something will have to be cut.
There's nothing left. If they do make these cuts, some serious
things will happen to the civil space program.''
   In one of the largest reductions, the Appropriations
subcommittee cut NASA's request for the struggling space shuttle
program by more than $200 million. The language of the bill would
let NASA decide what shuttle program activities will be eliminated.
   NASA had asked for $3.610 billion to improve and start flying
the shuttle again, but the subcommittee agreed to appropriate only
$3.4 billion.
   ``This will be one of the toughest cuts to accommodate,'' said
Terry Dawson, a staff member of the House subcommittee on space
science and applications.
   Dawson said some of the shuttle program items that could be
affected include manufacture of spare parts, an effort to enhance
the performance of the rocket engines and fuel pumps on the orbiter
and the scheduling of missions. It would not, however, affect the
resumption of shuttle flights.
   ``It's going to hurt them no matter what they do,'' said McBride.
   The space shuttle has been grounded since January 1986 when the
explosion of the Challenger shuttle killed seven crew members. The
winged spacecraft fleet is scheduled to resume flights in August.
   Appropriations subcommittee members also cut $65 million from
the $967 million NASA had requested for development of the space
station. Dawson said the $902 million allocation would allow the
space station program to continue will little effect.
   Other cuts, with the original NASA request in parenthesis,
include:
   _Advanced X-ray astrophysics facility, an astronomy satellite,
$16 million ($27 million).
   _Commercial Development Space Facility, a privately built
orbiting factory that NASA was to lease, zero. (A $25 million
appropriation from last year was rescinded).
   _Titan 4 launch rocket, $23 million ($43 million).
   The subcommittee also cut NASA plans to buy a Delta II and a
Titan 3 launch rocket.
   The marked-up bill is expected to go to the full Appropriations
Committee, where it could be changed, later this month. It then
must go to the full House for a vote before it can be considered by
the Senate.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Intelligence Committee said Thursday
it has approved and sent to the full House legislation that would
require the president to notify Congress within 48 hours when he
authorizes covert intelligence missions.
   The bill, which grew out of the recommendations of the
congressional panels that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, was
approved Wednesday on an 11-to-6 party-line vote and announced
Thursday by the committee.
   It is similar to a covert-action measure passed March 15 by the
Senate on a vote of 71 to 19.
   A central dispute in the Iran-Contra affair was the approval by
President Reagan of a secret arms-for-hostages swap which was not
discovered for 10 months after it was authorized, even though the
law requires notification of Congress ``in a timely fashion.''
   The congressional Iran-Contra committees recommended that the
law be changed to eliminate all ambiguity.
   The House and Senate bills would require the president to make a
written ``finding'' that any covert action is required on national
security grounds, and to provide copies to the congressional
intelligence oversight committees.
   The committees would have to be given prior notice of such
actions, unless an emergency prevented notification. In such cases,
the president would have up to 48 hours to get word to Congress.
   The president also would have to tell Congress which agencies
are to be involved in the covert action and disclose whether
private third parties are to be involved, as they were in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Under the bill, a covert action is any U.S. activity, other than
traditional military, diplomatic and law enforcement actions,
designed ``to influence political, economic or military conditions
abroad so that the role of the United States government is not
intended to be apparent or acknowledged publicly...''
   As it considered amendments to the measure, the
Democrat-controlled panel rejected an effort by Rep. Dick Cheney,
R-Wyo., to leave an exemption from the 48-hour notice requirement.
The committee also rejected an effort by Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., to provide for fines up to $20,000 and up to five years in
prison for unauthorized disclosure of classified information.

   Thunderstorms drenched the Texas Gulf Coast on Thursday as rain
fell across much of the lower Mississippi Valley. Most of the
nation had sunny skies.
   Southern California sweltered, while showers were widely
scattered across Wisconsin and Michigan, northeast Florida and the
northern Pacific Coast.
   Heaviest rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 4.10 inches near Corpus Christi, Texas. Other reports were
of less than one-half inch.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44 degrees at both
Houghton and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 108 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif. The nation's morning low was 18 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for rain and occasional thundershowers
in northern New England, the lower Great Lakes and the upper Ohio
Valley and across much of Florida, and showers from the northern
Pacific Coast across the northern Plateau.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 50s and 60s over
northern Maine, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley and
along the northern and central Pacific Coast; the 90s to about 110
degrees from the desert Southwest through inland portions of
southern California, and the 70s and 80s elsewhere.

   A single-engine plane that ran out of gas
barely missed a football field full of students before making an
crash landing on the grounds of a high school Thursday.
   The two men in the plane suffered minor injuries, but none of
the students at Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High School was hurt,
said Steven Hynson, a spokesman for the Arlington Fire Department.
   ``The pilot did his very best and did an excellent job of
getting around them,'' said Hynson. ``He was extremely low when he
came in.''
   The pilot of the plane was identified by the Fire Department as
Ed Sanchez, 45, and his passenger as Dick Scheeringa, 44, both of
Toronto, Canada. They were taken to Arlington Hospital for
treatment of minor injuries.
   Hynson said the single-engine Piper Cherokee came in from the
east about 2:30 p.m. and circled the football field full of
students as it descended.
   The aircraft knocked down a 40-foot flagpole, touched down on
the surface of the track surrounding the field, leapfrogged at an
awkward angle down the length of the field, and slammed to a stop
in an embankment. It was prevented from going any further by an
eight-foot chain-link fence at the top of the small hill that faced
a residential road and a house across the street.
   The crash landing broke the plane's landing gear and smashed the
aircraft's nose.
   ``The pilot did a fine job of getting past the football field
into the bank,'' said Col. John Gutter, assistant principal at
Bishop O'Connell. ``We had a class of girls out on the (football)
field and a class of boys playing softball.''
   ``They were fortunate in three things,'' said Hynson. ``One is
that he (the pilot) could maneuver the plane. Two is that he didn't
hurt anyone. And three is that there wasn't any fuel that could
have caused an explosion or fire when he crashed.''
   The plane had taken off from Toronto and was bound for Raleigh,
N.C., Hynson said.
   Hynson said Virginia State Police and the Federal Aviation
Administration were investigating the accident.

<HEAD>Hostage's Sister Returns After Meeting With Released Frenchmen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

   Peggy Say said Thursday she learned from
released French hostages that her brother, the longest-held hostage
in Lebanon, was told to pack a bag for his release just before
three Frenchmen were set free.
   Mrs. Say, returning from a trip to France and Switzerland, said
she was given greater access to French officials than she has had
with U.S. officials since the beginning of the Iran-Contra scandal.
Her brother, Associated Press Middle East correspondent Terry
Anderson, 40, was seized in west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Mrs. Say, of Batavia, N.Y., met with Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua, who negotiated the French hostages' release.
   She also gave a representative of President Francois Mitterrand
a letter from a group of journalists working for Anderson's
release, urging the French to use their contacts to seek freedom
for 18 other foreign hostages, including nine Americans still held
by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   ``They told Terry he was going home,'' she said, describing
diplomat Marcel Fontaine's last moments with her brother after they
had shared a room for several months. Anderson packed and was led
away, she said, but it was Fontaine, 45, who was released, along
with diplomat Marcel Carton, 64, and journalist Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, 44.
   The Frenchmen gave her other details about the U.S. hostages,
Mrs. Say said, but she said they did not want them made public
unless hostage relatives agree. ``There's always a danger. The
families have to decide if talking about it is worth the risk,''
she said.
   Meeting with the Frenchmen, however, gave her the feeling that
``he's okay, he's going to survive,'' she said.
   Mrs. Say said the French hostages were released because France
was willing to deal with Iran and because the French government,
journalists and people ``apparently place a higher value on human
life'' than the Americans. The French deny that any ransom was paid.
   ``The French hostages had a feeling that the Americans had been
abandoned,'' said Mrs. Say.
   ``The French people wanted the hostages released. They gave
their government room to maneuver,'' she said, adding that the
scandal over U.S. arms shipments to Iran in exchange for hostages
has doused U.S. popular concern for their release.
   Mrs. Say said State Department claims that her government puts
the highest priority on human life are inconsistent with the
government's refusal to negotiate or give any concessions for the
release of hostages.

<HEAD>Legal Attempt Fails To Block Panda Exhibition in Toledo</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with judge turning down TRO. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday refused to halt the
shipment from China of two giant pandas to help celebrate the 150th
anniversary of Toledo, Ohio.
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson refused to grant a
temporary restraining order sought by the World Wildlife Fund to
prevent the two giant pandas from being shipped by air from
Shanghai to this country on Friday.
   The fund and the American Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums charged that the exhibition of the pandas would violate
an international convention that prohibits trafficking in
endangered species for commercial purposes.
   But the judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate
``a substantial likelihood of success on the merits'' to warrant
issuance of a temporary restraining order.
   The denial of a temporary restraining order cannot be appealed,
so the judge's ruling cleared the way for the shipment of the
pandas.
   The pandas, which are set to arrive in Seattle on Friday
afternoon, will spend 100 days to 200 days at the Toledo Zoo.
   The plaintiffs claimed Toledo zoo officials were interested in
the pandas only for their fund-raising potential.
   ``The Toledo Zoo does not plan to and indeed would not be
authorized by the People's Republic of China to breed the pandas or
to study them scientifically,'' the filing said.
   Instead it wants to use the estimated $1.9 million to be earned
from the exhibition to improve a building, parking lots and other
facilities, they added in a memorandum to the court.
   ``This is precisely the kind of commercial activity condemned by
international law (and) U.S. law,'' the memorandum said.
   Zoo attorney Randal C. Teague Sr. said his client had spent $1.9
million to build a panda house plus another $1.1 million for ramps
and other improvements at the zoo.
   The plaintiffs called the giant panda one of the Earth's most
critically endangered animals, with fewer than 1,000 surviving in
the wild.
   The suit named as defendants Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel
and Frank H. Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, because they issued an import permit.
   The memorandum called the decision to grant the permit
``arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in
accordance with the law.''
   Earlier, the fund asked that permits be denied for exhibitions
of pandas in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Detroit, as well as Toledo.
   One potential exhibitor denied that the purpose was commercial.
   ``Certainly, we are not a circus, or a carnival, or even a zoo
for that matter,'' said Tom Washington, executive director of the
Michigan United Conservation Clubs. ``There is a whole string of
hypocrisy involved here.''

   Mayor Bill Frederick helped rescue a woman
who was being stabbed by her estranged husband Thursday, chased
down the suspect, fired a warning shot and then held the man at
gunpoint until officers arrived, officials said.
   According to the mayor, police and witnesses, a man was stabbing
his estranged wife with a long screwdriver in a car parked outside
a popular restaurant when the mayor and others ran out to try to
help the woman.
   ``I would not have shot the man,'' the mayor said later. ``I had
this gun, at this time, for my protection. ... I had witnessed this
guy trying to kill his wife.''
   Richard Russell Bohannan, 32, of Altamonte Springs was booked
into jail, and police said he would be charged with attempted
murder.
   His wife, JoAnn Turner Bohannan, 23, was treated for multiple
puncture wounds in the neck, face and arms at Orlando Regional
Medical Center and released later in the day, officials said.
   A witness to the attack came into the restaurant to summon help,
and recognized the popular, two-term mayor who was just about to
pay for his breakfast and leave, authorities said.
   The robust Frederick, 53, described as a health enthusiast, and
others ran into the parking lot, pulled the man off the woman and
dragged him out of the car.
   The man came up swinging and slashing, narrowly missing in a
swipe at Frederick, and then ran off. The mayor got his 9mm handgun
out of his car and gave chase, first on foot and then in a pickup
truck driven by another rescuer.
   The mayor jumped out of the truck as the man was running
alongside a nearby ditch, trying to scale a fence. Frederick said
he yelled at the suspect to stop, and when he didn't, he fired into
the air. The man then stopped.
   The mayor and another man then forced the suspect to the ground,
and the mayor held the gun on him until police arrived.
   Frederick carries an automatic weapon _ issued to him by the
police department _ in his city car's glove compartment for his own
safety, said the mayor's spokesman, Joe Mittiga.
   ``He was shaken by the whole incident,'' Mittiga said. ``He
thought the man had a knife. ... We found out later it was a
Phillips-head screwdriver.''
   Frederick told reporters he believed he had done the right thing
in making a citizen's arrest because he is experienced in handling
guns and said the man may have gotten away if he hadn't acted.
   ``If the man had not had the weapon, if he had not made an
attack on me with it, I wouldn't have done that,'' the mayor said.
   The gun ``was the only way I could get him to stop and the only
way I felt secure approaching him. So if that was wrong, I'll just
have to apologize for it,'' Frederick said.

<HEAD>Agreement Seals Deal Between Consortium, Defense Department</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sematech sealed its pact with the Defense
Department Thursday, with officials saying that the research
consortium is poised to help the United States claim the
competitive edge in the semiconductor industry.
   The memorandum of understanding between the Pentagon and
Sematech, based in Austin, Texas, allows Sematech to begin
receiving the first allotment of a $100 million federal
appropriation.
   Sematech should receive $15 million of those funds in about two
weeks, officials said.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said at a news conference after the
signing that the federal funds ``were a good buy for American
taxpayers'' and that the technological advancements by Sematech
researchers would create jobs and opportunities.
   Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas, in whose district Sematech is
located, said it had created a ``new and exciting partnership''
that will help the United States ease its dependence on foreign
technology.
   Sematech is a consortium of 14 semiconductor manufacturers,
including IBM Corp., Texas Instruments Inc., American Telephone and
Telegraph, Rockwell International Corp. and Motorola.
   It will develop advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes,
materials and equipment and will transfer research results to
member companies. The Department of Defense will be treated as a
member, although it will not have a seat on the board of directors
and does not have the power to approve individual contracts.
   Sandy Kane, chairman of the Sematech executive committee and a
vice president of IBM Corp., said new technology and tools
developed by Sematech can be passed on to defense contractors for
defense contracts but not commercial use.
   Sematech now has 70 employees and ``assignees'' from member
companies, and Kane says 700 staff members are anticipated by next
year. It expects to be operating its clean room facility in October
and to produce its first silicon in early 1989, Kane said.
   Kane called it an unprecedented partnership between business and
government, and said it was a significant undertaking because there
will be sharing of technology between traditionally staunch
competitors.

<HEAD>Weather Service Employees Union Files Suit Against Drug Test Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit challenging plans to randomly test
National Weather Service employees for illegal drug use was
announced Thursday by a group representing 4,000 agency workers.
   The National Weather Service Employees Association said its
lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, challenges plans
to test 1,800 meteorologists, 1,700 meteorological technicians and
200 hydrologists for illegal drug use.
   The random testing is part of the Reagan administration's
program for a drug-free work place. The suit is the latest in a
series of court challenges to the government-wide drug testing
program.
   The Reagan administration last week submitted to Congress a list
of positions subject to random drug testing. Employees in those
so-called sensitive positions were singled out for testing because,
the administtation contends, their work affects the public safety.
   The suit, brought on behalf of 16 National Weather Service
employees in California, disputes that claim and charges that drug
testing would be an illegal invasion of privacy.
   The suit said that for at least three years, the agency has
reported no incidents of drug use or impairment by illegal drugs of
employees on the job.
   The suit seeks an injunction to bar the testing.

   Afghan rebels shot down a Soviet
helicopter gunship Thursday as Red Army troops evacuated their
biggest garrison in eastern Afghanistan prior to the start of a
Soviet troop withdrawal, guerrillas said.
   ``If they want an honorable return from Afghanistan, the Soviets
should have talked to us,'' Gulbaddin Hekmatyar told a news
conference, hours after rebels reportedly shot down an MI-24
gunship in Jalalabad.
   Hekmatyar heads the seven-party Afghan Resistance Alliance.
   ``We consider the Soviet presence in Afghanistan an aggression .
.. that will continue until the last Soviet soldier is in our
homeland. Therefore fighting cannot stop,'' he added.
   ``People coming from Jalalabad say the Russians are sending
their heavy equipment to Kabul,'' said a rebel official identified
only as Kabir, a member of the military committee of the Yunis
Khalis faction of Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group. Kabir said an
airlift was under way.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted
rebel sources as saying the gunship had been shot down. No details
were available.
   According to the sources, up to 60 Soviet trucks headed west
Thursday toward Kabul, 110 miles from the Jalalabad garrison.
   The diplomat said about the reported attack on the helicopter,
``It would indicate the Soviets have resorted to using close air
support again during their withdrawal.''
   Both the Soviets and the Afghans virtually stopped using their
air force in 1986, because the Islamic, anti-Marxist guerrillas
started shooting down aircraft with U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles.
   In Moscow, the Soviet military charged Thursday that foreign
sponsors have stepped up arms shipments to the rebels and sent in
more military advisers, endangering Soviet troops who are scheduled
to start withdrawing May 15 under an agreement reached in Geneva
last month.
   A civil war has raged in Afghanistan since April 1978, when a
Soviet-inspired revolution brought a Marxist government to power.
About 115,000 Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 to help
the Kabul government and stayed on to help fight the insurrection.
   Reports reaching Pakistan said the Soviets' 66th Brigade,
estimated at 4,000 men, will be deployed in the Kabul area after
leaving Jalalabad, 30 miles from Pakistan. An Afghan division will
replace them.
   Jalalabad is the second major garrison evacuated by the Soviets,
following the April 22 withdrawal from Barikot.
   Hekmatyar said 12 administrative districts and many military
posts fell to the rebels in recent weeks. He said the government is
vacating the areas since it fears that otherwise ``the Afghan
troops and militia ... will surrender to mujahedeen (Moslem
fighters).''
   He said garrisons in the south and north were vacated, and not
just those in the east as Afghan leader Najib claimed two weeks
ago. Najib said this was to facilitate the return of Afghan
refugees from Pakistan.
   About 3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan and an
additional 2 million in Iran.
   A Pushtu language newscast by state-owned Radio Kabul, monitored
in Islamabad on Thursday, confirmed Hekmatyar's assertion that
evacuation of garrisons is taking place in a large part of
Afghanistan, not just the east.
   Hekmatyar claimed that except for the Kandahar air base and the
military outpost of Spinboldak, all of southeastern Kandahar
province is under rebel control.
   He balked at U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez's proposal for
convening a meeting of all parties to the Afghan dispute, so a
government acceptable to the rebels, the refugees and Najib's
government can be formed. Cordovez made the proposal in an article
published Monday by The Washington Post.
   ``There is no place for such a conference,'' Hekmatyar said
Thursday. ``We will ourselves elect the Parliament which will form
the government.''
   Cordovez brokered the Geneva accord signed by Pakistan,
Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Union which provided
for Soviet troop withdrawal.

<TEXT>
   A 450-pound Siberian tiger smashed through a
reinforced window Thursday, dragged a veteran Houston Zoo worker
into its outdoor area and mauled him to death, officials said.
   Ricardo Tovar, 59, apparently was peering through a
quarter-inch-thick glass-and-wire-mesh window when the tiger broke
through and pulled him outside, zoo director John Werler said. The
window was in a door leading from a hallway to the tigers' natural
habitat area outside.
   ``At this time and until there is more information, we cannot be
sure just how the accident happened,'' Werler said during a news
conference. No one saw or heard the attack.
   The 11-year-old male tiger, named Miguel, was isolated after the
attack but was not going to be destroyed because it is a member of
an endangered species, Werler said.
   Tovar, a 10-year zoo employee, was the first worker to die at
the zoo.
   John Gilbert, senior zookeeper of cats, said he realized that
something was wrong was about 7:45 a.m. when he called to his
co-worker ``and the tiger reared up and put his face into the
door.'' It was unclear how long the attack had gone undiscovered;
Tovar's shift began at 6 a.m.
   ``It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' Houston Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw said, adding that's much of
Tovar's left arm was torn away. ``He had numerous bites about him
and possibly a broken neck.''
   Tom Dieckow, curator of exhibits and leader of the zoo's
response team, fired a rifle into the ground three times to try and
scare the 11-year-old cat away from Tovar's body.
   Workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage
with a fire extinguisher, Dieckow said.
   Zoo officials praised Tovar as a good employee.
   ``I've known him for 18 years. I worked with him at the San
Antonio Zoo. He was very competent. He knew his job,'' said Nelson
Herwig, a friend of Tovar's and curator of the zoo's aquarium for
10 years.
   The tiger was aggressive, Wehler said. ``It snarls and growls,
and we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions,'' he
said.
   But he said the tiger poses no threat to the public because
there are three doors between the public's area and the tigers'
area.
   Because the Siberian tiger is an endangered species, the zoo
would have to get federal permission to kill it, Herwig said.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers and
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of slaying 16 people was
convicted Thursday and sentenced to death in the holiday season
shooting rampage that left a man and a woman dead. He immediately
asked that the sentence be carried out as soon as possible so that
the ``torture and suffering within me'' would end.
   A Franklin County Circuit Court jury deliberated less than 1{
hours before convicting R. Gene Simmons of capital murder and five
counts of attempted capital murder. They then heard arguments on
whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison without
parole, and later returned the death penalty.
   This trial, which started Monday, stemmed from a 45-minute
shooting spree in Russellville on Dec. 28.
   Simmons, 47, is scheduled to stand trial again in July in the
deaths of his wife, seven children, four grandchildren, and two
in-laws whose bodies were found in and around his house after the
rampage ended. They had all been shot or strangled.
   After Circuit Judge John S. Patterson ratified the death penalty
verdict, Simmons put on his glasses and in a calm voice read a
brief statement asking that the sentence be carried out as soon as
possible.
   ``It is my wish and my desire that absolutely no action by
anybody be taken to appeal or in any way change this sentence,''
Simmons said.
   ``It is further respectfully requested that this sentence be
carried out expeditiously. I want no action that will delay, deny,
defer or denounce this very correct and proper death sentence.''
   ``I only ask for what I deserve,'' he said. ``Let the torture
and suffering in me end. Please allow me the right to be at peace.''
   Afterward, the judge said it was not clear whether Simmons had
the legal right to cancel the automatic appeal provided for death
sentences in state law.
   Under Arkansas law, the death penalty would be carried out by
lethal injection.
   Earlier, prosecutor John Bynum, arguing for death for the
retired Air Force master sergeant, had said ``there is nothing in
the record that says this man is entitled to a break _ nothing.''
   Defense attorney Robert E. Irwin, who had rested his case
without calling any witnesses, asked the jury for mercy.
   ``One thing is certain _ Ronald Gene Simmons is going to die in
prison,'' Irwin said. ``The only question is whether it is by our
hand or by some act of providence or by a merciful God.''
   Later, another defense attorney, John Harris, said they had
urged Simmons not to ask for the death penalty but now felt duty
bound not to oppose him.
   ``He wanted the death sentence; he felt like he deserved it,''
Harris said. ``And he wanted us as his attorneys to do everything
within our power to see that he could get the death sentence, if
you can imagine that.''
   Simmons was found guilty of capital murder _ the deaths of two
people made it a capital crime _ and of five counts of attempted
capital murder for the four people who were wounded and a fifth
person who was fired at but not hit.
   Jurors reduced a kidnapping charge to first-degree false
imprisonment and also convicted Simmons of that charge.
   In addition to the death penalty on the murder charge, the
jurors sentenced Simmons to 30 years for each of four attempted
capital murder counts, 20 years for the fifth attempted murder
count, and seven years for first-degree false imprisonment.
Patterson ordered that those sentences be served consecutively.
   In his closing statement, Irwin argued that the state did not
support its contention the murders were premeditated and that there
were no tests to link Simmons to the murder weapons and other
evidence.
   But Bynum said such tests were unnecessary because of the number
of witnesses and the testimony from Russellville Police Chief Herb
Johnston that Simmons handed him the murder weapon.
   ``The evidence in this case is strong; it's stout,'' Bynum said.
   Among the spectators in the standing-room-only courtroom were
Viola O'Shields, and her husband, Roger, relatives of some of the
Simmons' family victims.
   Tears welling in her eyes, Mrs. O'Shields displayed a photograph
of one of the victims, Simmons' 17-year-old daughter, Loretta.
``Isn't it a shame?'', she said.
   Killed were Kathy Kendrick, 24, who reportedly had spurned
Simmons' advances a year before the shooting; and James Chaffin,
33, described by police as a chance victim. She was shot at the law
office where she worked, while he was shot at an oil company.
   A state ballistics expert, Paul McDonald, testified that bullets
that killed Kendrick and Chaffin, and bullets found at a market
where two people were wounded, had been fired by the same nine-shot
revolver that Simmons handed to police when he surrendered.
   The trial was moved to Ozark because of extensive pretrial
publicity.

   Was Carlos Lehder Rivas responsible
for smuggling tons of cocaine into this country from his native
Colombia, or was he victimized by a group of deceitful American
smugglers who are cooperating with prosecutors to reduce their own
legal problems?
   Those are the contrasting points of view advanced by attorneys
for the government and defense in closing arguments in Lehder's
trial on cocaine-smuggling charges.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, in his rebuttal arguments Thursday,
said Lehder wore masks ``that have been stripped away by the
evidence.''
   Merkle was scheduled to finish his arguments Friday morning and
the jury was expected to get the case later in the day.
   He blasted closing arguments by defense attorney Edward R.
Shohat, saying it was an ``attempt to plant a seed of doubt in your
mind that is not there.''
   ``All he wants to do is to create doubt in one person's mind
because your verdict has to be unanimous,'' Merkle told jurors.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial
on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into
the United States from Colombia via Lehder's private Bahamian
island, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   The prosecutor contends the Colombian was responsible for
smuggling 18,000 kilograms into the United States and had earned
$20 million.
   Merkle challenged arguments by defense attorneys that Lehder was
victimized by convicted drug smuggler Ed Ward and members of his
American organization.
   ``Ward was just another pilot,'' Merkle said.
   Shohat ended his arguments for Lehder on Thursday by telling the
jury to ``do what you feel is right.''
   The jury must not condemn Lehder based on the prosecution's
attacks on his character, said Shohat, but must stick to the
specific charges contained in the 11-count indictment.
   Shohat spent the morning again hammering away at what he said
were inconsistencies in the testimony of government witnesses, many
of whom were admitted smugglers given immunity for their testimony.
   Later, Merkle said, ``The attack on the credibility of the
witnesses is this case is so much sound and fury.''
   Shohat had said the chief prosecution witness, convicted
smuggler Ed Ward, was ``given the break of a lifetime'' for his
testimony against Lehder, getting a possible 215-year sentence and
$5.9 million fine cut to less than six years in prison.
   Shohat went through what he termed ``the litany of lies''
testified to by several members of Ward's group of American
smugglers.
   ``These people planned to dump on Mr. Lehder. These people knew
how to get an American Express card to freedom,'' he said.
   Lehder, who officials have said was a key member of Colombia's
violent Medellin cartel, is charged with conspiracy, possession of
cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise. He was arrested near
the Colombian town of Medellin in February 1987 after a shootout
and was immediately flown to Florida for trial.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with smuggling conspiracy.

   Here is the statement that R. Gene Simmons,
accused of murdering 16 people, read in court Thursday after he was
sentenced to death for a capital murder conviction arising from the
slayings of two people in Russellville on Dec. 28:
   ``I, Ronald Gene Simmons Sr., want it to be known that it is my
wish and my desire that absolutely no action by anybody be taken to
appeal or in any way change this sentence.
   ``It is further respectfully requested that this sentence be
carried out expeditiously. I want no action that will delay, deny,
defer or denounce this very correct and proper death sentence.
   ``My attorneys have repeatedly counseled me to appeal. However,
that is not what I want.
   ``I believe now and always have in the death penalty. To those
who oppose the death penalty, I say, in my particular case,
anything short of death would be cruel and unusual punishment.
   ``I am of sound mind and body and have been seen by
psychoanalysts who can verify that I am capable of making a clear
and rational decision. I have given clear and careful thought and
consideration so there is nothing that will cause me to change my
mind.
   ``I only ask for what I deserve. Let the torture and suffering
in me end. Please allow me the right to be at peace.''

   Five people were arrested Thursday on
charges of running a treasure-hunting scam that fleeced 700
investors of $1.7 million.
   ``This was a treasure salvage company, but the only treasure
found was the money that was taken from the pockets of investors,''
state Comptroller Gerald Lewis said.
   The three companies accused of wrongdoing traded on the success
of the treasure-hunter Mel Fisher, who found Spanish treasure ships
off the Florida Keys and retrieved gold and jewels worth millions
of dollars, Lewis said.
   ``The people bought a ship from Mel Fisher and they bought
apparently a small amount of treasure so they could show this and
use it and use Mel Fisher's name,'' Lewis said.
   Lewis said the operators falsely claimed they found three
wrecks. No treasure-hunting was ever done and no treasure was
found, he said.
   Instead, the defendants pocketed investors' money, and it is
unlikely they will get any of it back, the comptroller said.
   Fisher is not involved in any of the operations and is not
accused of any wrongdoing, Lewis said.
   The five people arrested were indicted by a grand jury May 5 on
charges of fraud, sale of unregistered securities and racketeering.
   The three agencies that announced the arrests also are
investigating as many as 15 other treasure-hunting operations
seeking investors with ``treasure fever,'' Lewis said. Most of the
bogus operations are in Florida, but a few are out of state.
   Most of those under investigation also have been trading on
Fisher's success.

   The White House said Thursday the United
States was immersed in diplomatic ``plea bargaining'' aimed at
coaxing Panama's Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega from power, while a
U.S. attorney urged that the drug indictments against the
Panamanian ruler be prosecuted rather than dropped.
   ``We're still talking,'' chief presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. ``What this amounts to is a plea bargain.''
   ``Maybe something will come of it and maybe something will
not,'' he said.
   At the Justice Department, U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner of Miami,
whose office obtained an indictment against Noriega, met with
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and later issued a statement
saying he wants to carry out the Noriega prosecution.
   ``I am authorized to say his views haven't changed and he wants
to proceed with the case and he's ready to proceed with the
trial,'' said Ana Barnett, Kellner's executive assistant. Meese
declined to comment on the Noriega situation. Kellner said through
Barnett, ``I presented my views,'' but he refused to discuss
details.
   Administration sources said Wednesday the indictments against
the de facto Panamanian ruler would be dropped if he stepped down
and left the country for a year. The sources, declining to be
identified publicly, said the Justice Department objected to the
offer, which was approved at a White House meeting.
   When reporters pressed Fitzwater on Thursday on the legal and
other ramifications of such a deal, he said, ``I offer no
definition of plea bargaining.''
   He said no direct negotiations have taken place with Noriega on
the matter.
   The administration move reflected increasing frustration with
the failure to dislodge Noriega after weeks of diplomatic, economic
and political pressure. But it was criticized immediately.
   ``I don't think you drop indictments against drug pushers and
people suspected of murder,'' Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis said.
   Fitzwater appeared in the White House briefing room not long
after chief of staff Howard Baker talked sympathatically of
arranging a deal to win Noriega's removal. Baker told CBS-TV such a
legal arrangement ``would be the most fruitful and productive plea
bargain.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``obviously has directed the negotiations
that have gone on there, but I won't go further.'' He stressed that
there have been no direct talks between Reagan and Noriega.
   An administration source said Wednesday that if Noriega accepts
the deal, he would step down probably in August and would stay out
of Panama until after the next presidential elections there in 1989.
   The deal was approved Tuesday at a White House meeting over the
objections of Meese, the source said.
   In Panama, Noriega was quoted as saying in the army newspaper
Critica, one of his propaganda organs: ``There cannot be and will
not be a deal while aggression against Panama and plans for
dismantling the popular forces continue'' to form part of the
administration's plan.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael G. Kozak went to
Panama early last week and has been conferring with Noriega and his
representatives ever since, according to administration sources who
spoke on condition they not be named.
   Fitzwater refused either to name the U.S. contacts in the
negotiations with Noriega or say what sorts of incentives were
being offered by this country.
   ``You may characterize it as plea bargaining, but I'm not saying
what's on the table,'' he said. ``We won't discuss who's directly
involved.''
   In Miami, the federal judge handling the Noriega case questioned
whether the government alone can drop the drug indictment.
   ``My understanding and knowledge of the law is that the
presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the
motion of the government,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler
said. ``However, I am having the law researched further.''
   Noriega's attorney, Neal Sonnett, said the Panamanian ruler
``always has believed that the indictment against him was a
political indictment. So a dismissal of the indictment would have
to be a precondition to any discussions.''
   Noriega, a onetime close associate of the late Panamanian leader
Omar Torrijos, has headed the Panamanian Defense Forces for nearly
five years. In February, he refused an order from President Eric
Arturo Delvalle to resign, and then fired Delvalle, who has been in
hiding since.
   There were earlier reports of a U.S. willingness to allow
Noriega to go into exile without pursuing his extradition, and in
early April, there were reports that the State Department was
advocating kidnaping.
   Baker acknowledged April 9 that an array of economic sanctions,
including the freezing of Panamanian assets in this country and the
withholding of U.S. payments to the Panama Treaty Commission, have
``hurt the people more than they have hurt'' Noriega.
   NBC News, quoting an American official it did not identify, said
Wednesday night that Reagan had decided to support dismissing the
indictments after National Security Council advisers warned that
further delay in getting Noriega out could lead to a political
alliance between Noriega and Cuban leader Fidel Cstro. Fitzwater
would not comment on that.
   Dukakis wasn't alone Thursday in reacting to the possibility of
dropping the indictments.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said if descriptions of the offer were
accurate, it would appear to be a victory for Noriega, allowing his
loyalists to retain control while he spent ``a year's vacation on
the Riviera.''
   ``If I was a cop in Boston or Miami or somewhere, I'd sit there
and say this administration has sent a signal that crime does
pay,'' Kerry said in a CBS interview.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``I think it'd be a terrible
mistake to take the word of a drug-dealing killer dictator that
he's going to get out and allow free elections sometime next year,
and he'd be allowed to stay in until August. And the only thing
you're going to have is a transferance of power to his cronies.''
   D'Amato said of the administration's dealings with Panama:
``What we have here is an administration that's set its hair on
fire and is trying to put it out with a hammer.''
   Ambassador Juan Sosa said Noriega's opponents cannot accept the
dropping of charges without any arrangements made for next year's
election, the restructuring of the defense forces Noriega controls
or the setting up of a government of reconciliation.

   Israeli soldiers prohibited residents from
leaving the occupied Gaza Strip on Thursday, trying to reduce the
violence expected in Jerusalem at the close of the Moslem holy
month of Ramadan.
   In the West Bank, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the people
of Hebron bloodshed would end if they stopped the 5-month-old
rebellion against Israeli occupation. The violence has taken the
lives of 186 Palestinians and two Israelis.
   The Israeli air force made its eighth raid into Lebanon this
year, attacking Palestinian targets south of Beirut. Lebanese
police said six fighter-bombers took part in the attack at Barja,
16 miles outside Beirut.
   An Israeli army spokesman said the ban on leaving the coastal
Gaza Strip, where 600,000 Palestinians live, began at 10 p.m. and
would last ``until further notice.''
   He said the closure did not apply to the West Bank, home to
about 900,000 Palestinians, but police spokesman Alex Lapidoth said
extra soldiers were at roadblocks between the West Bank and Holy
City and they were being ``more strict.''
   Closing off Gaza was intended to to lessen the potential for
violence during the period beginning with the Moslem ``Night of
Fate'' Thursday and continuing through Friday, the last Moslem
sabbath of Ramadan.
   Israeli officials have expressed fear that mass prayer services
Thursday and Friday on sacred Haram al Sharif would lead to riots
in Arab east Jerusalem. Haram al Sharif means Noble Enclosure and
is the Arab name for Temple Mount.
   The ban also might run through the last day of Ramadan early
next week. The holy month ends Monday or Tuesday, depending on when
the new moon is sighted.
   Tens of thousands of Moslem worshipers traditionally come to
Jerusalem for the ``Night of Fate,'' marking the revelation of the
holy Koran to the Prophet Mohammed. More come for sabbath prayers
on the final Friday of Ramadan.
   Israel radio said about 10,000 worshipers prayed Thursday night
at Temple Mount, site of the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques.
It said several hundred raised the outlawed Palestinian flag,
chanted slogans and threw stones at military police, who responded
with rubber bullets.
   Reports by the state and army radios said a policeman was hit in
the head by a stone and 38 Palestinians were arrested. There were
no reports of Arab wounded.
   Israel television said police and troops would turn back groups
of Palestinians trying to enter the city Thursday and Friday in an
effort to reduce the crowds on Temple Mount, which also is sacred
to Jews.
   About 3,000 police began patrolling the hill and surrounding
areas. Residents reported a huge police presence in east Jerusalem.
   Israel's police commissioner, David Kraus, said ``all necessary
measures'' would be taken to prevent disturbances.
   Officials also are worried about violence Sunday. Israelis will
honor both the nation's 40th anniversary and the 21st anniversary
of the seizure of Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war,
when the West Bank and Gaza were captured.
   Israel radio said the army had decided to begin re-opening West
Bank schools early next week. It said elementary schools would open
first, followed by the higher levels if no disturbances occurred.
   An army spokesman said he could not comment on the report. The
schools were closed Feb. 2 because they had become rallying points
for protesters.
   Israel radio said about 200 prisoners in the occupied
territories would be freed Friday as a goodwill gesture for the
close of Ramadan. The army spokesman confirmed prisoners would be
released but said he did not know how many.
   Soldiers fired on Palestinian protesters in Nablus, wounding
five, Arab reports and hospital officials said. The army reported
three wounded.
   Shamir visited Hebron, the second largest city in the West Bank,
for the first time since violence began in the occupied territories
Dec. 8, and toured the open-air market.
   He appealed through an interpreter for an end to the violence
and an Arab rejoined: ``The government should start treating the
Palestinians as human beings, especially now during religious
celebrations.''
   The prime minister's reply: ``The population should start to
behave, and not only during holidays. If there would be quiet and
order, nothing would be done against the population.''

   The Senate on Thursday was trying to find a
way to increase U.S. military involvement in the war against
illegal drugs, but bogged down in a dispute over whether to give
the Navy new powers to arrest drug traffickers in international
waters.
   The dispute centered around a Pentagon budget bill, which the
Senate is trying to finish. The argument over the anti-drug
provision is the major remaining hurdle and Senate leaders said
they don't expect to pass the bill before Friday.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci attended a closed-door
series of meetings at the Capitol to discuss the anti-drug plans,
which have been proposed in response to what legislators say is
public demand to do more to halt drug-trafficking.
   ``We're all looking for a way to have the military more involved
in a meaningful way in the war against drugs,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the chief
author of one anti-drug proposal.
   The bill authorizes defense spending in the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1 of $299.5 billion, the same total contained in a separate
Pentagon budget bill passed Wednesday by the House. Differences
between the measures will be worked out later by a House-Senate
conference committee.
   The House bill contains a provision ordering President Reagan to
have the military ``substantially halt'' the penetration of U.S.
borders by ships and planes carrying illegal drugs.
   The plan proposed by Nunn is not as far reaching, but it would
make the Pentagon the chief federal agency in halting illegal
drug-trafficking, and also would have the Pentagon provide more
coordination and communications to other drug-fighting agencies
such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Coast Guard.
   Making the Defense Department the chief federal agency for
anti-drug efforts would mean it would have to approve actions by
all other federal agencies.
   Another proposal authored by Sens. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., would allow U.S. military personnel to
make anti-drug arrests outside U.S. borders, such as beyond the
three-mile limit recognized by the United States.
   Nunn, D'Amato and Wilson said they were trying to craft their
separate proposals into a single bill, but the main sticking point
was over whether to give the military arrest powers in
international waters.
   The plan will not be approved before Friday, Nunn said.
   Asked about the reaction of Pentagon officials, D'Amato said,
``They're not happy. ... They're not doing cartwheels.''
   The military is now barred from enforcing civilian laws by the
Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law enacted to halt the practice of
having the Army enforce laws in the post-Civil War southern states.
   That law was amended in 1981 to permit the military to provide
some aid, and U.S. military surveillance information is now passed
along to some civilian agencies. In addition, Coast Guard officials
now travel aboard Navy ships patrolling the Caribbean Sea.
   Carlucci has offered to have the Pentagon do more in the
anti-drug effort, although he opposes having the military make
arrests.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Thursday that the military
can slow, but not halt, the flow of drugs.
   ``If the effort here is to reduce the amount of drugs coming
into this country, it can be done,'' Howard said. ``If the effort
is expected to stop drugs coming into this country, it cannot be
done. Unless you do it on the demand side, ways will be found.''
   The military can track planes, Howard noted, but ``it's
difficult to tell the difference between a civilian flight and one
that is engaged in drug smuggling.''
   ``We have ample military resources to be able to stop every
aircraft at our border, but in fact that's a much more complex
problem than I think most people realize,'' he said.
   As it worked through the bill Thursday, the Senate:
   _Voted 57-39 to kill an effort to ban most U.S. underground
nuclear testing. The House, in its version of the bill, approved an
underground test ban, meaning the issue will have to be resolved by
the conference committee.
   _Voted 64-32 to restore a ``Buy America'' requirement which
requires the Petnagon to buy U.S. products, including anthracite
coal. The Pentagon says it already has a four-year supply of the
coal and doesn't need any more.
   _Killed, on a 60-37 vote, a proposal that would have halted the
sending of any U.S. combat troops to leftist-ruled Nicaragua or its
neighbor, Honduras. The troop ban was approved last week by the
House, meaning the issue will have to be decided by the conference.
Reagan has said repeatedly the United States has no intention of
sending combat troops to Nicaragua.
   _Killed, on a 61-36 vote, a plan to reduce spending for the
railroad version of the MX nuclear-tipped missile from $700 million
to $200, using the extra $500 million to buy more non-nuclear
weapons. The House proposes to spend only $100 million for the rail
version of the MX.
   _Rejected, 82-13, the latest proposal to have the Senate express
a formal opinion on Reagan's Persian Gulf policy. The amendment
would have required a detailed report from Reagan outlining his
plans for Navy involvement in the war-torn region, and would have
given Congress 15 days after that to formally vote on the policy.

<HEAD>Illinois Bell Says Weeks Required To Restore Service After Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phone service to Chicago's western suburbs will
not be fully restored until late in June following a fire at a
switching station that caused the worst service disruption in the
company's history, Illinois Bell said Thursday.
   James Eibel, Illinois Bell's vice president of operations, said
``significant progress'' has been made in restoring telephone
circuits passing through its west suburban Hinsdale switching
center, which was heavily damaged by fire Sunday.
   But he told a news conference it would take at least until the
third week in June before all 35,000 customers affected by the
outage have full service. Phones in all or parts of six western
suburbs have been dead since the fire.
   ``This was the most severe service disruption Illinois Bell has
had in its history,'' Eibel said of the 107-year-old company. ``The
scope and complexity of the repair work far exceeds anything we've
had in the past ... and that includes any natural disasters.''
   Illinois Bell investigators have still not determined the cause
of the fire.
   By overhauling damaged local switching equipment as a stopgap
measure, the phone company hoped to restore 21,000 service lines by
Sunday, Eibel said. But he cautioned that this was the most
optimistic projection.
   Eibel said he could not guarantee the old equipment would hold
up against corrosion caused by the chemical reaction from smoke and
water sprayed by firefighters.
   Emergency service to hospitals, police and fire departments, the
company's first priority, may be back in service in the next couple
of days, Eibel said.
   Illinois Bell employees were working round-the-clock Thursday to
install new equipment, which should be in place by June 1, although
it will take another three weeks to restore service to all local
residents, Eibel said. It normally takes 50 weeks to install a
completely new system.
   The telephone company was having more success in repairing
damage to 13,000 special lines used by businesses and the
``trunking service'' knocked out by the fire at the Hinsdale
station.
   About half of the trunking service had been restored by
Thursday, and all 118,000 circuits connecting the western and
southwestern suburbs with the rest of the Chicago metropolitan area
and long distance providers should be back in service by late
Sunday, Eibel said.
   He expected that the business service lines would be fully back
in operation by the end of next week. Special service lines are
used by business customers for a variety of purposes, including
data transmission.
   Eibel acknowledged a considerable delay in the time between when
the fire was first reported at the unmanned switching station and
the arrival of firefighters to fight the blaze.
   Bell received an alarm at 3:50 p.m. at a monitoring station in
Springfield, more than 150 miles away, but it was not until 4:20
p.m. that a full fire alarm sounded, Eibel said.
   After another 30 minutes, an employee arrived to check out the
alarm, but he had to hail down a passing motorist to alert
firefighters because the phones were already out of service.
Firefighters did not arrive at the scene until after 5 p.m.
   The phone company was reviewing its fire prevention measures in
light of the fire, Eibel said.
   Meanwhile, residents were trying to cope as best as possible
with the lack of phone service. People lined up at mobile trailers
with public coin phone stations at six locations in the western
suburbs.
   ``I'ts been very inconvenient,'' said Sandy Barthick, assistant
editor of a telecommunications trade paper in Hinsdale. ``I've been
doing all my phone work from my home in Chicago.''

<HEAD>Chinese Herbs, Antiseptics Join Dental Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>

   Chinese herbs and antiseptics are the
newest weapons in the war against cavities and gum disease,
researchers said Thursday.
   `They're as common as the common cold,'' University of Maryland
Dental School microbiologist Barbara Margaret said of gum problems
and tooth decay.
   Speaking at the 88th annual convention of the American Society
for Microbiology, she said her study involved having patients with
gum disease dip special toothbrushes in a mild prescription
antibiotic called chlordexidine, and then brush.
   Within one to three weeks, plaque-causing bacteria decreased,
she said.
   `This is an attempt to combine treatments, a mechanical cleaning
with the use of a mild antiseptic,'' she said. `The up-and-down
scraping dislodge the bacteria.''
   The seven patients in the test group used tiny,
Christmas-tree-shaped brushes designed to get the antibiotic
solution in pockets of infection near tooth roots. They use the
technique in conjunction with regular brushing, said Margaret, who
hopes to soon launch a larger study.
   Extracts of plants used in Chinese folk medicine also appear
promising in the fight against tooth decay and gum disease, said
University of Colorado microbiologist Christine Wu-Yuan.
   She started her research after a 1984 trip to Taiwan, where
dentists prescribe herbs for patients.
   ``They know it works, but they don't know why it works,'' she
said. `Chinese folk medicine is rich with plant-derived products
used to treat gum disease and maintain oral health. We looked at
herbs that can affect cavities and gum disease.''
   She pulverized 40 kinds of plants that she found in Chinese
markets in Chicago and San Francisco, and mixed the extracts with
bacteria commonly found in mouths.
   Forty-two percent of the extracts inhibited bacterial growth,
including 10 percent that outright killed the germs, she said.
   She refused to name the plants used, saying corporations are
pressing her for that information.
   Ms. Wu-Yuan said the next step is further research on the
promising extracts _ using patients instead of bacteria _ and
fine-tuning the amounts that could be used in a toothpaste or
mouthwash.
   `A lot of the time with gum disease, there are no symptoms, so
people don't take it seriously'' until their teeth are in danger of
falling out, she said.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Official Says Humanitarian Aid To Rebels OK</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez said
Thursday his government is willing to allow immediate delivery of
humanitarian supplies to rebels in Nicaragua and he denied his
government is trying to starve the Contras into submission.
   ``We are in full disposition to accept that the Contra forces
could receive humanitarian aid inside Nicaragua tomorrow, if
possible,'' Ramirez told reporters after a 1{-hour meeting with
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other Democratic
congressional leaders.
   ``We are not trying to gain this war through starvation,''
Ramirez said.
   The visit appeared to be in part an effort to counter Reagan
administration accusations that Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government is dragging its feet in peace talks to delay food and
medical supplies destined for the rebels under a $48 million aid
package passed by Congress earlier this year.
   ``There were some things necessary to clarify here about the
serious attitude of the government of Nicaragua'' toward permitting
the rebels to receive non-military supplies, Ramirez said.
   A temporary cease-fire agreement in Nicaragua's seven-year war
reached March 23 called for aid to the Contras to be delivered by a
neutral agency, but there has been no agreement on who that
delivery agent should be.
   The Sandinistas have proposed the Red Cross _ ``the very symbol
of neutrality in the world,'' according to Ramirez _ but the rebels
have rejected that idea.
   Ramirez said he was meeting later in the day with Secretary
General Joao Baena Soares of the Organization of American States to
hear his proposals for delivering the aid and said he would take
that information back to Managua.
   ``I'm sure we can agree without problems'' on some way to
deliver the aid, he said. ``If they don't want to accept (the Red
Cross), we are willing to discuss other proposals.''
   Ramirez also said he was confident talks aimed at reaching a
long-term peace accord would resume soon. The rebels have proposed
resumption of formal talks on May 19, but the Sandinistas want to
schedule one or two preliminary private rounds of talks first.
   The 60-day temporary cease-fire runs out at the end of the
month, and Ramirez reiterated his government's belief that some
extension of the temporary truce will be necessary, perhaps for
another 30 to 60 days.

Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday easily rejected the
latest attempt to have the chamber express a formal opinion on
President Reagan's expanded policy of protecting shipping in the
war-torn Persian Gulf.
   The Senate voted 82-13 to table, and thus kill, an amendment to
a Pentagon budget bill that would have required a report from
Reagan outlining his policy.
   The proposal would have required specifics about the U.S. goals,
anticipated length of deployment and the rules under which U.S.
weapons would be fired.
   The plan was offered by Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who again
criticized his colleagues for refusing to vote on whether the
Senate approves of Reagan's year-old policy.
   Adams, a critic of the administration policy, told his fellow
senators that ``for over a year we have danced around the issues.''
   Reagan's policy involves having the Navy protect 11 reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf, which has been the scene of fighting
in the long Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait is an Iraqi ally.
   The U.S. policy recently was expanded to provide American
protection to neutral merchant ships who are attacked and who seek
U.S. help from Navy warships.
   That expanded policy came in the wake of an April 18 clash
between the Navy and Iran, in which the Navy sank or damaged six
Iranian vessels. It was the latest in a series of military fights
between the Navy and Iran.
   Congress has yet to vote formal approval or disapproval of
Reagan's policy. The Senate also has rejected Adams' repeated
efforts to invoke the War Powers Act. That is the 1973 law that
would, under some circumstances, require the withdrawal of U.S.
forces from situations of ``imminent danger.''
   Reagan has refused to invoke the War Powers law, arguing that it
is an unconstitutional restriction on his authority. Adams and 110
other legislators have sued to invoke the law, but a federal judge
rejected the suit and they are appealing that rejection.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former secretary of the Navy, led the
opposition to Adams' proposal.
   ``I think it would be ill-advised for the Congress to single out
any particular military operation and say, on an annual basis, that
we're going to appropriate money for that operation.''
   Adams' proposal rejected by the Senate would have required the
report from Reagan and then would have provided 15 days for
Congress to disapprove the policy. If no disapproval vote were
taken, the policy would have been considered approved.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, criticized Reagan's policy as ``foolish
... stupid'' but he opposed Adams' plan. He said it might mean that
U.S. forces would be pulled out of the region.
   ``I don't want to see us take an action in the Persian Gulf that
would really mean we are willing to pull out,'' said Glenn.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., opposed the plan because ``this would
require the president to be a prophet. ... I'm not sure the
president can provide a plan, given the fluid nature of events in
that part of the world.''
   Adams said his proposal ``isn't a withdrawal from the Persian
Gulf. ... I do not want to withdraw our forces.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the plan ``is another example
of what Congress is criticized for. ... You can't have 535
secretaries of state,'' referring to the total number of House and
Senate members.

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed To Strengthen Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of senators introduced legislation
Thursday to impose a virtual ban on economic dealings between the
United States and South Africa.
   ``The United States has indulged the apartheid regime for 40
years,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the primary Senate
sponsor of the bill. ``It is time to chart another course.''
   The bill, similar to one pending on the House calendar, would
force U.S. businesses to divest their holdings in South Africa
within a year and would ban most trade with and lending to that
country.
   Other supporters included Sens. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., Paul Simon, D-Ill., Carl Levin and Donald
Riegle, both D-Mich., Bill Bradley and Frank Lautenberg, both
D-N.J., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.
   ``This will end once and for all time American complicity in,
and support for, apartheid,'' Kennedy said in announcing the bill
at a news conference.
   While supporters of the sanctions are optimistic about House
passage, the bill's fate in the Senate is unclear, in part because
moderate Republicans who were key to the passage of limited
sanctions in 1986 are reluctant to go along with harsher measures.
   The Reagan administration opposes the sanctions and a
presidential veto is likely if Congress should pass the bill.
Efforts are under way in the House to enlist the two-thirds support
that would be needed to override a veto, but that effort would be
more difficult in the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested four of Sikhism's five
high priests and 26 followers as they prepared to march Thursday to
the Golden Temple, officials said. Security forces killed at least
three people at the besieged shrine.
   Indian commandos backed by paramilitary troops captured a
strategic water tank on the temple complex grounds, where an
estimated 100 Sikh militants have been holed up since Monday,
officials said.
   About 2,500 police and paramilitary troops surrounded the
militants at the temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine. They have been
fighting intermittently since Monday.
   The Punjab government ruled out new negotiations with the
militants and demanded they surrender.
   ``If they do not do so the state government will continue its
pressure on them,'' Punjab Governor S.S. Ray said in a statement
issued in the state capital, Chandigargh.
   Talks Wednesday on ending the temple standoff were inconclusive
and a cease-fire that took effect that day ended Thursday morning.
   The militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983
for more autonomy or an independent homeland for the Sikhs in
Punjab.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   Three more people, two Sikh militants and an unidentified man,
were shot and killed by security forces on Thursday, raising the
death toll in the fighting to at least 15, said A.A. Siddiqui,
state police deputy chief.
   United News of India said as many as seven Sikhs died inside the
shrine Thursday.
   Indian commandos captured the water tank in the living area of
the temple complex, said witnesses who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The priests were arrested as they attempted to march on the
Golden Temple from another Sikh shrine about a half-mile to the
north, Siddiqui said. The priests were placed in custody for 15
days on charges of violating curfew orders, Siddiqui said.
   Among those arrested was Jasbir Singh Rode, the temple's head
priest, who held talks Wednesday with government officials to try
to end the confrontation. Rode has called for the militants to
dismantle their bunkers and for the security forces to withdraw.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Sarbjeet Singh had asked them to call
off their march because two bursts of gunfire were reported inside
the temple Thursday after an overnight lull.
   ``We take responsibility for any firing from inside the
temple,'' Rode told Sarbjeet Singh, insisting that the march should
be allowed to proceed. ``You take responsibility for firing from
outside.''
   Firing from the temple increased as the morning wore on.
   Police lifted a curfew in most parts of Amritsar on Thursday,
but it remained in force within 200 yards of the Golden Temple,
Indian television said.
   Most of the shops and businesses in the old sector of Amritsar
which surrounds the temple remained shuttered even after curfew was
withdrawn in the area.
   Security forces for the first time Thursday began blocking
reporters from approaching the temple. They said Sikh militants
might shoot the journalists.
   More than 940 people have been killed this year in Punjab in
attacks blamed on the extremists. Most have been Hindus or moderate
Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign.
   The confrontation at the Golden Temple began Monday when
militants inside the shrine opened fire on security forces who had
gone to a nearby rooftop to look at fortifications the Sikhs were
building on the northern edge of the complex.
   The temple complex covers an area equivalent to more than five
city blocks. The temple sits in the center of a pool.
   The Indian army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June
1984 to flush out Sikh extremists. More than 1,200 people were
killed in the attack. Later that year, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.

   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, head of U.N.
relief for Afghanistan, said Thursday an international appeal will
be launched in three weeks for hundreds of millions of dollars for
refugee aid and reconstruction.
   ``We must see to equitable distribution and certainly relief
would be without strings attached and should not be used for
political manipulation,'' he told a news conference.
   ``The important thing is that the aid gets to the people who
need it.''
   The amount has not been set.
   The prince, a U.N. high commissioner for refugees from 1965-77,
said he hopes to meet all parties concerned, rebels included. The
rebels control much of the Afghan countryside and he indicated they
could play an important part in relief distribution.
   ``I am concerned about the Afghan people as a whole and we need
to find ways to get help where it is needed,'' he said.
   The 55-year-old prince was named Wednesday as
undersecretary-general to coordinate all international relief
efforts in Afghanistan and resettlement of 5 million refugees.
   Facing him is the task of insuring that a vast amount of aid
will be distributed fairly by U.N. and other agencies. He must see
aid is not exploited or manipulated by the pro-Soviet government in
Kabul or by the anti-Marxist rebels, who reject the political
accord on withdrawing Soviet troops.
   The United Nations mediated the Geneva agreement between
Afghanistan and Pakistan providing for the 115,000 Soviet troops in
Afghanistan to withdraw over a nine-month period.
   The prince emphasized that U.N. relief efforts are separate from
the political agreement.
   Answering a question, he said he could not give the amount of
aid needed for relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation, but it
would amount to ``hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   He said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar probably will
launch the appeal to donor countries in three weeks.
   Sadruddin Aga Khan said he will shuttle between Kabul and
Islamabad from his base in Geneva and that he will go to the area
next week.
   He said his work will involve coordinating the work of many U.N.
agencies _ including the World Health Organization, the United
Nations Development Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization
and others _ as well as the International Red Cross; the Red
Crescent, its Islamic counterpart, and other groups.
   He said many governments already have indicated their
willingness to make generous contributions and have been awaiting a
U.N. mechanism for distribution. He said his immediate task is to
formulate an appeal and assure donors how their money will be spent.
   He said repatriation of refugees will be a major task and
reception centers must be set up for displaced people wanting to
return.

   A rocket fuel manufacturer Thursday
blamed a natural gas leak for a series of earthquake-force
explosions May 4 that demolished a plant, killing two people and
injuring 326.
   Fred Gibson, chairman of the Pacific Engineering and Production
Co., said the high-pressure gas line passing through the plant had
been leaking for at least 30 minutes before a fire broke out May 4
at the plant.
   ``All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the
gas leak, the gas fire and the gas explosion,'' he said.
   Gibson said the leak is believed to have saturated the earth
below the paved surfaces of the plant and ignited ``as a result of
circumstances unrelated to PEPCON operations.''
   Earlier Thursday, Kerr-McGee Corp. bowed to pressure from the
state and halted production at the only other U.S. plant making the
fuel component ammonium perchlorate until an independent inspection
determines its plant is safe.
   Southwest Gas Corp. vehemently denied the allegation, saying gas
mains under the plant ruptured only after the initial explosions.
   ``As far as we're concerned, our facilities are a victim of the
explosion and not the cause,'' said spokesman Dennis Hetherington.
   Fire Chief Roy Parrish said Wednesday that the Fire Department
would withhold judgment until it completes an investigation of the
blast, which caused an estimated $73 million in damage.
   A Kerr-McGee official said he hoped the company's own plant
could resume manufacture within a few days of ammonium perchlorate,
an oxidizer used in the space shuttle and in missiles.
   ``A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us,'' said Paul
Gaines, Kerr-McGee director of governmental relations.
   ``I think Kerr-McGee has done the responsible thing in agreeing
to suspend production,'' said Gov. Richard Bryan, who had met with
company executives two hours Wednesday.
   Bryan said ``legal work was being prepared'' to force the plant
to suspend production at McKerr-McGee before it agreed to the
shutdown.
   Gaines said the company, which will continue to manufacture
other chemicals at the Henderson plant, has contracted with an
unidentified safety consultant to study the plant. He said the
inspection could begin by Monday.
   Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant
resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate. Plant officials
had said last week they would not reopen until authorities
determined the cause of the Pacific blast.
   Gaines said the Kerr-McGee plant is completely safe. ``We are
blameless here,'' he said. ``It is not our plant that exploded.''
   Meanwhile, Bryan announced the appointment of seven people to a
panel charged with reviewing health, safety, zoning and insurance
standards for industries with highly combustible materials.
   Lt. Gov. Bob Miller will be chairman of the the panel, which
Bryan said will complete its work within 90 days.

implemented a plan for modernizing the police force. A member of
the Socialist Party's executive committee, he led the Socialists in
the National Assembly from 1981-84. His father was a minister under
Gen. Charles de Gaulle.

   Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, 62, also served as finance
minister from 1984-86, after first serving as social affairs
minister from 1982-84. Known as a pragmatist, he won praise from
financiers and industrialists for his steps to modernize French
markets.

   Minister of Culture Jack Lang, 48, served as culture minister
from 1981-86. Only Andre Malraux held the post longer. His dynamic,
passionate style and dark good looks made him a media darling. A
fan of American culture, Lang created the National Orchestra of
Jazz. A jurist and former professor of international law, he held a
number of posts in the Socialist Party.

   Minister of Education Lionel Jospin, 50, replaced Mitterrand as
Socialist Party chief after Mitterrand was elected president in
1981.
   The education post is seen as key and sensitive. Mitterrand
promised that education would be a priority during his next seven
years in office. Reform of the educational system has brought
hundreds of thousands of demonstrators into the streets on at least
two occasions.

   Minister of Overseas Territories Olivier Stern, 52, is to the
right of the mainstream Socialists and is a former member of the
conservative Rally for the Republic. He served as minister of
overseas territories from 1974-78 under the Chirac government.
Stern's problems include resolving the political crisis in France's
Pacific territory of New Caledonia.

Development</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Thursday endorsed
a plan calling for $4.3 billion in economic development programs in
Central America aimed at fostering peace and democracy.
   The 159-nation body approved the resolution by consensus only a
day after a military rebellion was put down in Guatemala. That
country represented the region during the U.N. debate.
   Nealy half the money, $2 billion, would be debt relief.
   The resolution puts the assembly's stamp of approval on an
ambitious and wide-ranging program for regional reconstruction,
emergency relief and long-term development that depends on the
generosity of the international community.
   U.N. officials have not indicated exactly how they plan to raise
the money for the program. However, its coordinator, Augusto
Ramirez Ocampo, has been trying to line up donors, particularly in
Western Europe.
   More than 45 nations, including most of the European Community,
signed on as sponsors of the resolution. Britain, concerned about
the plan's call for debt relief, was an exception.
   ``We take the view that the matter of bilateral commercial debt
is a matter between creditor governments and creditor banks,'' said
Stephen Smith, a spokesman for the British mission.
   The United States, which did not commit itself to contributing
any money to the U.N. plan, shared Britain's reservations about
debt relief.
   Ambassador Lester B. Korn reminded the assembly that the United
States has given $4 billion in direct aid to El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica since 1985 and contributed an
additional $1 billion to international organizations active in the
region.
   ``The United States is pleased that the General Assembly is on
record as supporting what the United States has been doing for the
past decade in this troubled area of the world,'' Korn said.
   Korn criticized the plan for being vague about sources of
funding.
   Work on the development plan began shortly after five Central
American presidents signed a regional peace accord last summer.
   The U.N. development plans calls for $392 million to resettle
the estimated 830,000 people displaced by the civil wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, and to provide emergency food
and energy assistance.
   About $1.4 billion would be earmarked for long-term projects
running the gamut from rebuilding roads to vocational training for
the handicapped to encouraging tourism.
   The plan also calls for spending $600 million to revive a
Central American common market.

   The United States and Soviet Union settled their
differences Thursday on a historic treaty to scrap medium-range
missiles and sent the agreement to the U.S. Senate in an effort to
speed ratification of the pact before the Moscow summit.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, winding up two days of
talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, told
reporters: ``We have reached a completely satisfactory agreement on
all of these issues.''
   The Senate postponed debate on the treaty Monday while some
members accused Moscow of backsliding and leaving loopholes for
cheating. But Shultz said the differences over verifying compliance
with the pact were a result of implementing an unprecedented system
of on-site inspection.
   ``Occasionally, they'll have an argument,'' Shultz said of the
technicians who will carry out the agreement to destroy 683 Soviet
missiles and 364 U.S. missiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles.
``That's life.''
   He called the settlement he reached with Shevardnadze
``absolutely satisfactory.'' It was initialed by Maynard Glitman,
who negotiated the treaty, and Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, the
senior arms control adviser to the Soviet military.
   Shultz said Glitman and Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the U.S. national
security adviser, would fly to Washington on Thursday night to
report to the Senate on Friday.
   ``I think it will be well-received,'' Shultz said.
   The Moscow meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is scheduled to begin May 29.
   Chief U.S. negotiator Max Kampelman and Soviet negotiator Viktor
P. Karpov signed another document at the Soviet mission that
guarantees any futuristic weapons developed in the
intermediate-range also would be banned under the treaty.
   Two of the principal stumbling blocks to verification of the
treaty dealt with U.S. demands to inspect Soviet missile containers
big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket and the issue of how
much access U.S. inspectors will have to Soviet missile plants and
bases.
   Other issues dealt with photographing equipment, updating data
exchanged between the two sides and the size and weight of vehicles
that can be inspected leaving Votkinsk, where Soviet SS-20 missiles
are assembled.
   The pact on intermediate-range missiles is unprecedented in its
provisions for on-site inspection to guard against infractions. It
also is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entire
category of nuclear weapons.
   The document on futuristic weapons was aimed at convincing Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and other critics that the ban would apply to
intermediate-range weapons that have not been developed yet.
   Glitman and Powell were taking the second document to the Senate
as well. While Shultz obviously was satisified with the results, he
said ``what the Senate does is up to the Senate.''
   With evident relief, however, he told reporters: ``I hope I've
heard the last of INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) at these
ministerials.''
   Shevardnadze, at a separate news conference, said the Soviets
did not view the differences as technical but as ``very serious
problems that required political decisions.'' He added: ``And such
solutions were found.''
   Shultz and Shevardnadze declined to provide specific details of
how the dispute was resolved.
   Senior U.S. officials, however, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Soviets wanted the United States to destroy
West German Pershing 1-A missiles, but were satisfied the Bonn
government itself would scrap them.
   After a telephone call to Bonn, the U.S. side told the Soviets
where the missiles are stored and how many there are _ 21.
   ``We got back to everything we wanted,'' an official said,
referring to the range of disputes on INF.
   Another official, while not criticizing the Senate, said all the
issues could have been resolved quietly with the Soviets if they
had not been made public in newspaper accounts.
   Regarding missile canisters, the official said American
inspectors will be able to look inside, but not take the parts out.
``They gave in enough,'' he said.
   Shultz said, ``I think when the senators see it (the agreement)
I think they will see that it was worked out satisfactorily.''
   On a related subject, Shultz ruled out quick completion of
another treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons
arsenals by 30 to 50 percent.
   Reagan had hoped to make the accord the centerpiece of his four
days of talks with Gorbachev.
   Negotiations are moving slowly on how to verify the scrapping of
mobile missiles as well as cruise missiles carried on warships and
fighter planes.
   There is also a nagging dispute over the U.S. program to develop
a space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles. The
Soviets are trying to constrict the program, known as Star Wars.
   ``It's now clear,'' Shultz said, ``there is no way these
questions can be shaped up and ready in time for the summit.''

   The Vatican said Thursday it was shocked
by the sudden cancellation by Paraguay's military government of a
meeting between Pope John Paul II and civic leaders, including
opposition politicians.
   ``For now, I must clearly state the astonishment caused by a
decision without precedent in the exercising of the pastoral
mission by the Holy Father,'' chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said in a written statement.
   It was the first time in 37 foreign papal tours that a
government had scratched a meeting after it was announced.
   The Vatican statement was released as the pope arrived in this
9,150-foot- high university city. John Paul is on a 12-day,
four-country visit to South America.
   Police in Paraguay interrupted a Mass Thursday and arrested the
country's top opposition leader, Domingo Laino, and six others
including a journalist with the Roman Catholic Catholic radio
station Caritas, an opposition party spokesman said.
   Laino, head of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, and the
others were taken into custody in Arroyito, 185 miles northeast of
Asuncion, said party spokesman Luis Wagner.
   Police gave no reason for the arrests.
   The pontiff is due to arrive in Paraguay on Monday and was
scheduled to meet the next day with the Builders of Society, a
church-sponsored group of about 350 intellectuals, union leaders,
business leaders and politicians.
   Those scheduled to meet with John Paul included representatives
of political parties that are opposed to Paraguay's president, Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner. The parties are not recognized by Stroessner.
   In all, about 3,000 people were expected to attend the meeting
at a government-owned sports complex.
   But Stroessner, South America's longest-ruling military
dictator, canceled the meeting Wednesday, citing security reasons
and charging that the encounter would be used for political
purposes.
   An official traveling with the pope said the Vatican statement
was issued in hopes the government would change its mind.
   The Vatican official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the church was pursuing discussions with Paraguayan
authorities on the conflict.
   In Asuncion, Catholic Church officials vowed Thursday to hold
the meeting at another location.
   Tensions between the church and government in Paraguay have been
building for some time. Bishops there have been increasingly
critical of the human rights record and authoritarian style of
Stroessner, who took power in a 1954 coup.
   Through such groups as Builders of Society, the church has been
campaigning for a pluralistic system of politics. The Catholic
radio station, Caritas, has given air time to opposition figures.
   In Sucre, John Paul celebrated a Mass and visited a hospital. In
his homily at the outdoor Mass, attended by more than 100,000
people, the pope praised European missionaries who have worked in
this predominantly native Indian country.
   The pope ended his day in the tropical city of Santa Cruz, where
he met with cultural and intellectual leaders.
   Santa Cruz, a farming and ranching center of 377,000 near the
Brazilian border, is an important transit point for cocaine.
   In his meeting with the intellectuals, the pontiff said the
Third World's ``brain drain'' _ the emigration of trained
professionals _ is ``a reason for serious concern.''
   John Paul added, however, ``we do not want to deny the
legitimate right ... to emigrate.''
   Simon Reyes, first secretary of Bolivia's legal Communist Party
and executive secretary of the country's principal union
federation, told the pontiff: ``You give us hope so the people can
continue their struggle.''
   Reyes gave the pope a letter describing the plight of Bolivia's
workers and acknowledged the local church's support of workers'
rights.
   John Paul, on his ninth Latin American tour, flies Saturday from
Bolivia to Lima, Peru, for a regional religious conference.
   In a Lima seminary where the pope is due to speak this weekend,
armed pro-Cuba rebels disrupted a Mass Thursday, news reports said.
   Eight armed members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
seized the Santo Toribio Seminary, demanding that seminarians,
priests and others join their insurgency, according to Radio
Programas, Peru's leading news station.
   There were no injuries, the radio said.
   During the pope's last visit to Peru in February 1985, the
Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group caused a power outage that cut
airport lights as the pontiff's jet was landing in Lima. The jet
landed safely.

<DATELINE>CHINGCHUANKANG AIR FORCE BASE, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Chinese men
hijacked a domestic airliner from the mainland to Taiwan, where
they were granted asylum, and the jet took the other 116 people
aboard back to China early Friday.
   It was the first piracy of a Chinese commercial airliner to
Taiwan. The two air pirates carried two bombs and handguns.
   Some foreigners, but no Americans, were aboard.
   The Boeing 737 left Chingchuankang military airport in central
Taiwan at 2:55 a.m. (2:55 p.m. Thursday EDT) after refueling, a
litle under six hours after it landed there, said Wang Pao-hua,
spokesman for the air force base.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency later confirmed that the
plane landed just over an hour later _ at about 5 a.m. (4 p.m.
Thursday EDT) _ in Xiamen, a coastal city in China's Fujian
province where the hijacking ordeal began Thursday evening.
   Xiamen is just across the narrow Taiwan Strait which separates
the communist mainland from the Nationalist Chinese island bastion
of Taiwan.
   An official at the Xiamen office of China's national airline,
the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said the passengers
were in good condition. The plane was operated by Xiamen Aviation
Co., a subsidiary of the national carrier.
   Xinhua said the mayor and other officials met those returning on
the plane and extended sympathy to them from Premier Li Peng.
   There are no air links between Taiwan and mainland China.
Taiwan's Nationalist government claims to be the legitimate ruler
of China and maintains no official contacts with the Beijing
government.
   Taiwan's Government Information Office said the hijackers were
granted asylum, and also said the government was opposed ``to any
threats affecting commercial flight safety.''
   It said the plane carried 107 passengers and 11 crew, including
the hijackers. They were identified as Chang Ching-kuo, 27, an
arsenal worker in southern Yunnan province, and Lung Kuei-yun, 26,
a steel mill employee in Guizhou province, also in the south.
   Hu Yizhou, head of China's national airline, sent a request
before the asylum announcement that Taiwan ``assist in a quick
return of the crew members and all the passengers to Xiamen, and
hand over the hijackers at the same time,'' Xinhua reported.
   Taiwan did not mention Hu's request, but said merely that the
plane was ``allowed'' to fly to Hong Kong _ apparently trying to
avoid any impression of cooperating with the communist government.
The plane actually flew to Xiamen.
   The hijackers commandeered the plane soon after it left Xiamen
at 7:27 p.m. Thursday for Canton, capital of neighboring Guangdong
province. Wang said they carried two bombs and handguns, although
initial reports had said the explosives were fake.
   Several Japanese and a French passenger were aboard, as well as
many Taiwanese who were visiting relatives under a new policy that
eases restrictions on unofficial contacts with the mainland.
   Reports on Taiwan's official television and radio said the
hijackers gave themselves up after the plane landed at the
Chingchuankang base. They raised their hands in ``V'' for victory
signs as they walked out of the aircraft.
   Television said radar detected the hijacked plane when it
crossed the Penghu islands held by Taiwan, and two air force F-104
jets went aloft as escorts.
   It was the first hijacking of a Chinese passenger airliner to
Taiwan but several military pilots have defected to the island
since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists retreated to Taiwan 1949 after
losing a civil war to the Communists.
   A Chinese air force squadron commander flew his MiG-19 jet
fighter to Taiwan in November, becoming the sixth pilot defector
since 1960.
   Thursday's hijacking was the second time a Chinese domestic
airliner was forced to land outside the mainland. In May 1983, six
Chinese who initially demanded to be taken to Taiwan landed in
South Korea.
   On Feb. 22, a Taiwanese man said to be seeking better relations
between Taiwan and China tried to hijack a domestic China Airlines
to Beijing. China Airlines is Taiwan's major carrier.
   Four stewards and two passengers overpowered him, and on
Saturday he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

   Workers repairing the exterior of the Cabildo
apparently touched off a blaze that destroyed a roomful of antique
furniture in the building where the Louisiana Purchase was signed,
investigators said Thursday.
   The fire Wednesday raced through the third floor of the
wood-and-stucco French Quarter landmark that has served as a museum
since 1911, destroying a painting and causing water damage to
artworks and other items.
   Napoleon's death mask and the bulk of other historic artifacts
survived, said museum director James F. Sefcik.
   Offficials refused to give a damage estimate for the
193-year-old, three-story building, which was undergoing
renovation, and the contents.
   Fire Superintendent William McCrossen said that workers
repairing the roof and waterproofing the walls apparently touched
off the fire.
   An investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said a spark
from a welding torch being used on a gutter on the front of the
Spanish baroque building could have started the blaze in the
building's old timbers.
   McCrossen said he expected to have a report on the cause of the
fire Friday.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer said the building, the seat of government in
Louisiana under three nations, would be restored ``as soon as
humanly possible.''
   ``It's like somebody said: `Louisiana was burning last night.'
So it's important,'' Roemer said.
   Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy said he expected repairs to take between one
and two years.
   Lost to the blaze was an 1802 portrait of Luis Penalver y
Cardenas, first Roman Catholic bishop of Louisiana, on loan from
the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Furniture from the 18th-century
French colonial period was stored on the gutted third floor.
   Roemer said officials were trying to determine how to preserve
historic state records kept there and were considering short-term
measures such as erecting a temporary roof.
   The Cabildo was built in 1795 and served as the seat of
Louisiana government under France, Spain, the Confederacy and the
United States.
   It was there that America and France signed in 1803 the
Louisiana Purchase that doubled the size of the United States. Only
a copy of the document is at the Cabildo, Sefcik said. Originals
are in France and Washington, D.C.
   The Cabildo was the third such building on the site to bear the
name. The two earlier buildings were destroyed by fire, in 1788 and
1794.

   The Elysee Palace on Thursday announced new Premier
Michel Rocard's Cabinet, dominated by members of a previous
Socialist government but containing non-Socialists, non-politicians
and a former union leader.
   Jean-Louis Bianco, secretary-general for the Elysee, read a list
of 26 ministers to replace the conservative government of Premier
Jacques Chirac.
   Chirac was defeated in May 8 presidential elections, which
returned Socialist President Francois Mitterrand to a second
seven-year term.
   Among the top new ministers is Lionel Jospin, who has just
resigned as head of the Socialist Party. He was appointed minister
for national education and research. Mitterrand had called
education and training a top priority for the new administration.
   Pierre Beregovoy, a finance minister under the Socialist
government of 1981-1986, was returned to the post.
   Similarly Roland Dumas returned to his post as foreign minister,
replacing Jean-Bernard Raimond, and Pierre Joxe to his old post as
interior minister, replacing Charles Pasqua, who had been known for
his law-and-order command of the ministry.
   The Socialist government was defeated in March 1986 legislative
elections which brought Chirac to power.
   Jean-Pierre Chevenement, education minister in the earlier
Socialist government, was named minister of defense, replacing
Andre Giraud.
   The government, expected to reflect the spirit of
``enlargement'' on which Mitterrand campaigned, contained at least
nine non-Socialists but only two figures who could be called
centrists.
   Mitterrand, whose Socialist Party has moved toward the right,
had made a point of appealing to centrists.
   But Chirac spokesman Alain Juppe said Mitterrand's talk of
reaching beyond the ranks of the Socialists was but a
``pre-electoral trap for fools.''
   Jacques Toubon, secretary general of Chirac's conservative Rally
for the Republic party, said the Cabinet was ``a hard-core
Socialist government.''
   The announcement of the Cabinet, originally expected Wednesday,
was reportedly delayed because of last-minute hesitation on the
part of centrists wary of joining a Socialist government.
   Sen. Jacques Pelletier was named minister for aid and
cooperation and Sen. Michel Durafour was appointed minister of
public works. Both were ministers under former President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, who is from the centrist Union for French
Democracy. They are both part of the center-right parliamentary
majority.
   Among the non-politicians is judge Pierre Arpaillange, named
justice minister, replacing Albin Chalendon.
   Roger Fauroux, who had been director of the prestigious Ecole
Nationale d'Administration where most French politicans study, was
named minister of industry and foreign trade.
   Jacques Chereque, a former union leader, was named minister for
territorial management.
   Bianco said the rest of the Cabinet members would be announced
Friday.
   The announcement of the new government came two days after
Rocard's appointment by Mitterrand.
   Rocard said earlier Thursday that he would not rush the process.
   ``I intend to do my work in a spirit of calm and serenity,
listening to everyone concerned,'' he told reporters.
   He met twice Thursday with the president, who must approve his
Cabinet proposals.
   Most prominent centrists who supported Chirac's conservative
government have said they would decline Cabinet ministries in a
Socialist-led government.
   Rocard would be assured of only the votes of the 211 Socialists
in the 577-member National Assembly, but the center-right
opposition parties have said they would not necessarily vote to
bring down the new government.
   Mitterrand has the power to dissolve the assembly, and public
opinion polls show an early election would likely produce a
Socialist majority. Officials of Chirac's party as well as leaders
of most of the centrist parties are saying they think legislative
elections should wait at least until autumn.
   Pressure is mounting within the Socialist Party, however, for an
election next month.
   Jean Poperen, a member of the party executive committee, said in
a radio interview Wednesday that ``logic and coherence'' argue for
an immediate election. He was named minister for parliamentary
relations.

<HEAD>Agreement Near on Shoreham Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the $5.3 billion Shoreham
nuclear plant was reported close to an agreement with the state
Thursday on a plan to abandon the power station without ever
operating it commercially.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, with the Legislature's backing, has been
trying to scrap the plant because of arguments that Long Island
could not be evacuated in a nuclear accident.
   If the agreement is concluded, Shoreham will become the first
completed nuclear power plant ever shut down without operating
commercially. The plant, commissioned in 1973, took a decade to
build and ran more than 10 times over budget.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed a report in
The New York Times on Thursday that the plan would have the state
take over the Long Island plant from its builder, the Long Island
Lighting Co., then scrap it.
   The utility would pay the estimated $500 million cost of the
shutdown. In return, it would be guaranteed rate increases of 4
percent to 5 percent a year for 10 years and would remain an
independent, investor-owned utility.
   The state had threatened a complete takeover of the utility to
force a shutdown of Shoreham.
   Cuomo confirmed that state and utility company representatives
continued discussing the plant's future. He declined to say whether
an agreement was at hand.
   ``There are some areas, important issues, which we have agreed
on. There are still some critical issues that are unresolved,''
said James Lois, a utility spokesman.
   A source close to the talks said a sticking point was the issue
of a change of the utility's management, which Cuomo has said must
be part of any settlement.
   Nora Bredes, a Shoreham opponent and a member of the Long Island
Power Authority, said she was against a settlement with the Long
Island Lighting Co.
   ``From what I've heard of the proposed agreements, Long Island
will continue to be held hostage by LILCO rates and the company
walks away free and clear,'' she said. ``President Reagan is
offering Noriega better terms.''

   A woman on trial with her three sons in the
slayings of three policemen who came to arrest her at a motel was
heard on tape Thursday vowing not to leave her room ``unless they
take me out on a stretcher.''
   The tape was played during opening arguments in the murder trial
of Alberta Easter, 69, and her sons, George, Roy and William
Lemons. The July 9 shooting in Inkster killed Officers Daniel
Dubiel and Clay Hoover and Sgt. Ira Parker.
   With at least 115 witnesses due to testify and several hundred
exhibits to be presented, the trial is expected to last three
months.
   Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Douglas Baker played a tape
made when Dubiel and Hoover, sent to the Easters' rooms to serve a
bad-check warrant, telephoned Parker, their supervisor.
Conversation in the room was also picked up on the taped telephone
call.
   Easter and her sons have said that the shooting erupted when
Parker arrived at the motel after the telephone call, was abusive
toward Easter, grabbed her arm, drew his gun and fired.
   ``You will be asked to judge who sounds reasonable, who sounds
out of control, and who sounds ready for a fight,'' Baker told the
jury.
   On the tape, the voice identified as Easter's insisted that the
bad check charge is a mixup and asks an extra day to straighten it
out. The speaker identified as Parker said, ``I'd like to do that
but they won't give me that kind of leeway.''
   ``Talk to somebody before I call President Reagan or somebody,''
Easter said, adding, ``I'm not going to go out of here unless they
take me out on a stretcher.''
   Baker said witnesses would testify that less than 10 minutes
later Parker arrived at the motel, knocked on the Easters' door and
walked in. ``Before the door is shut a barrage of shots is heard,
maybe 30, according to witnesses,'' Baker said.
   In their opening arguments, defense attorneys told jurors they
should not be swayed by publicity in the case and talked about the
prosecution's obligation to prove the defendants guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt.
   ``We all know that Alberta Easter has been convicted,'' said
Gerald Evelyn, Easter's attorney. ``The press has convicted her.''

   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., insisted Thursday he will schedule debate on the US-Soviet
medium-range missile treaty only after three Senate committees
examine and approve a new anti-cheating agreement.
   But some senators of both parties objected, declaring it is
imperative the Senate begin work on the pact immediately so that
President Reagan can take a ratified treaty to Moscow on May 29 for
his summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas reported to the
Senate that Secretary of State George P. Shultz believes he struck
a ``completely satisfactory'' bargain with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in Geneva on the outstanding disagreements
involving the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty.
   Dole said White House national security adviser Colin Powell
will fly back from the meeting Friday to brief Senate leaders on
what has been accomplished.
   If Powell can report that Shevardnadze has confirmed Moscow will
live up to the letter of the treaty, Dole said debate on
ratification should begin on Monday with the aim of taking a final
vote before the Moscow summit.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said Shultz will testify before his panel Monday
afternoon and that Senate's bipartisan leadership and the chairmen
and the ranking Republican members of the Armed Services and
Intelligence committees have been invited to attend.
   Pell suggested that if no further snags are uncovered, Senate
debate could open on Tuesday.
   But Byrd insisted he will not be ``driven by a calendar date''
and will not permit floor debate to begin until the on-site
inspection plan is reviewed and approved by the Foreign Relations,
Armed Services and Intelligence committees.
   ``We were told all the I's were dotted and all the T's were
crossed,'' Byrd said. ``It was through the examination of these
committees that it was found that this was not the case.''
   ``If we make a mistake in this treaty and we find we have been
hoodwinked or outsmarted, then you can kiss the next arms treaty
goodbye,'' he declared. ``Let's do this thing right.''
   But Byrd said: ``I want our committees which have the
responsibility for taking the microscopic look at the fine print to
have the opportunity to go carefully into this and advise the joint
leadership if these agreements adequately resolve the problems.
   ``Briefings are fine but the final word will be what these
committees have to say,'' he declared
   But Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the Senate must do nothing
to cause further delay and prevent ``this American president from
being able to present before the Soviet people this historic
agreement.''
   ``If he goes to Moscow and faces the question of why he can't
get ratification, I think we place the presidency in jeopardy so
far as the success of future negotiations is concerned,'' Stevens
said.
   ``Time is the commodity that's scarce now,'' he said.
   Byrd on Monday shelved debate on the new treaty to give Shultz
and Shevardnadze time to resolve a serious dispute over the
implementation of anti-cheating provisions.
   The dispute centers on what U.S. inspectors will be permitted to
see and what they will be permitted to do as they seek to learn
whether the Soviets are living up to the requirements of the treaty
to eliminate all medium-range missiles.
   Earlier, Byrd told reporters a go-ahead for debate ``depends on
who's giving the answers and what they look like,'' Byrd said.
   ``I'm going to depend on the committees with jurisdiction to
determine whether these matters have been resolved in the proper
way... whether these things that need to be fixed are really
fixed,'' Byrd said.
   ``We need to stand firm on these things,'' Byrd told the Senate.
``The Soviets cannot realistically expect us to now compromise away
decisions which already have been negotiated and closed between the
two parties.''
   Calling the on-site inspection provisions of the new treaty the
single most important aspect of the pact, Byrd said that what
happens in the next few days ``could be the beginning or the end of
arms control.''
   ``If the verification system is sound and stands the test of
time, then the negotiations for future treaties will be given added
chance of support and success,'' Byrd said.
   ``But if now, when we are just on the verge of approval of the
INF treaty, we allow its verification provisions to be unraveled by
the Soviets, then the prospects of sound future arms control
agreements will be dismal, very dismal indeed.''
   Byrd said the last-minute snag justifies the searching
examination to which the Senate put the new treaty since it was
signed last December by Reagan and Gorbachev.
   The process, he said, uncovered a number of flaws and unanswered
questions, including whether or not the pact covered futuristic
weapons such as those using laser or particle beams.
   ``If we had rushed in and approved the treaty, say a month ago,
and then discovered these ambiguities and contradictions, the level
of confidence of the country in our ability to reach good, solid
agreements with the Soviets would have plummeted,'' Byrd said.

   Members of the Board of Education say they'll
risk the loss of thousands of dollars in aid and take the state to
court if necessary to keep the taxpayer-paid chauffeurs who drive
two of its members to meetings.
   On Wednesday, the state Senate voted 36-1 to prohibit schools
from spending money for chauffeur-driven cars for board members.
The measure was sent to the House.
   Board president Gloria C. Cobbin, who does not use a chauffeur,
called the legislation ``racist _ another example of
Detroit-bashing at its worst.''
   ``We challenge the state's authority to impose these
restrictions on how we run our school system,'' she said. Detroit,
with an 11-member school board, is the only Michigan district known
to use drivers.
   Wednesday's action reinforced steps taken by the Senate last
year, when it told the district that unless it stopped issuing cars
to its members or paying for their drivers, it would withhold money
used for that purpose.
   The action reduced the amount of state money the district is
scheduled to receive in June by $270,000.
   In addition, state Treasurer Robert Bowman said that until the
drivers are dropped, he will not sign $30 million in notes for the
district _ a move that could mean teachers in the 181,000-student
district will not get paid May 31.
   The district has a $25 million payroll.
   ``The notion that the state will send money to local governments
no strings attached is an outdated notion,''' Bowman said Wednesday.
   Board member Rose Mary Osborne said that without a chauffeur,
she would be unable to attend evening functions because she cannot
to drive at night.
   ``I'm not backing down,'' Osborne said. ``I don't think he
(Bowman) has the authority to do this. This is a legitimate
expense. I only use the board driver for board-related activities.''
   According to a study by The Detroit News in 1987, the drivers
for the district earned an average of $35,060. The average salary
for a teacher in the district is $32,930.
   Nine of the board members stopped using drivers after the
state's action last year.

<TEXT>
   A member of the jury that convicted a woman in
the nation's first death-by-product-tampering case has admitted
settling a product-contamination suit of her own less than two
months before she was selected as a juror.
   Laurel Holliday told the Seattle Times she did not think her
suit was relevant and did not reveal it during jury selection for
the trial of Stella Nickell on charges of killing two people with
cyanide-laced Excedrin capsules.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn, was found guilty Monday in the
death of her husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Susan Katherine Snow,
40, of Auburn. She could receive up to life in prison at sentencing
June 17.
   Court records show that Ms. Holliday had settled a lawsuit
against a company she alleged made a cracker containing the aspirin
substitute ibuprofen.
   Ms. Holliday said that she did not raise the matter during jury
selection because she believed the suit involved a manufacturing
mishap, not product tampering.
   Mrs. Nickell's attorney, Thomas Hillier II, did not return calls
for comment Thursday.
   On Monday, before the verdict in the Nickell case, Ms. Holliday
reported receiving an anonymous call during deliberations last week
telling her that Mrs. Nickell had failed a polygraph test. That
information was not admitted as evidence.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer, with Hillier's concurrence,
allowed Ms. Holliday to remain on the jury after she said could put
the information out of her mind.
   Three days earlier, the jury had reported it was hopelessly
deadlocked at 11-1. Soon after the verdict was announced several
jurors identified Ms. Holliday as the holdout.
   Hillier, after the verdict, suggested that another juror may
have influenced Ms. Holliday or that she ``contrived'' the
anonymous call to end the pressure of being the holdout vote,
hoping to be excused.
   At Hillier's request, Dwyer ordered the jury back to court
Friday to ask members if they were improperly influenced.
   Ms. Holliday has said she reached the verdict of her own accord.
   Repeated calls to Ms. Holliday's home went unanswered or were
not returned Thursday.
   In her own tampering incident, Ms. Holliday, a real estate
agent, told police her mouth started burning after she ate a
cracker in 1986. She said she found half of a pill in the uneaten
portion of the cracker and vomited.
   A year later, Ms. Holliday sued the manufacturer, Pepperidge
Farm Inc. The case was settled for $500. There were no witnesses,
and Pepperidge Farm attorneys questioned whether the event ever
took place.

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Health Department closed all
but two units of a large Philadelphia hospital Thursday, saying
inadequate care might have caused 12 deaths in the past year.
   The state stopped short of the most severe punishment, revoking
the license of the James G. Giuffre Medical Center. The hospital
serves a predominantly poor area of north Philadelphia.
   An investigation focusing on 66 cases since May 1987 found 124
deficiencies, including 29 instances of unnecessary surgery and 55
cases of post-operative complications, said department spokesman
Gary Froseth. In 12 cases the patients died.
   In one instance, a doctor's untrained son assisted in an
operation, Froseth said.
   Scrutiny in many cases fell on the hospital's namesake, Dr.
James G. Giuffre, until recently the hospital's executive director,
and the board of directors.
   ``The hospital will remain closed until they submit a plan of
corrections and we determine those areas cited as deficient have
been corrected,'' Froseth said. He said no deadline was set.
   In a statement, hospital officials said that many problems
already had been addressed and that they hoped to receive
permission to reopen all units soon.
   The order allows the hospital's clinic and its drug and alcohol
in-patient services to continue operating.
   It closes all in-patient acute care, including surgical
services, the emergency room and the podiatric clinic. Patients
already at the hospital will continue receiving treatment, Froseth
said.
   Under an agreement Giuffre and state officials signed Thursday,
the hospital's board will be replaced by May 25, Froseth said.
   Part of the state investigation, conducted for the U.S. Health
Care Financing Administration, determined that the hospital was
ineligible for particiation in the Medicare program, Froseth said.
   However, the federal agency has not made a final determination,
he said.
   The investigation began in February, the month the state closed
the surgical and primary care units for three days, saying
assistants and podiatric residents had conducted examinations,
diagnosis and treatment and had written prescriptions for clinic
patients without supervision from doctors.
   A federal grand jury also is investigating the hospital,
focusing on financial affairs from 1981 through 1985.

   About 125 children and 30 adults suffered from
smoke inhalation Thursday night after someone pulled the emergency
brakes on an Amtrak train while it was in a tunnel near Union
Station, sending exhaust fumes spewing into the cars, officials
said.
   The first and second cars of the Crescent, which operates daily
between New York and New Orleans, were evacuated.
   Approximately 125 school children and about 30 adult chaperones
who occupied the first two cars were taken to several area
hospitals where they were treated for possible smoke inhalation,
said Paul Harvey, supervisor for the District of Columbia's
Emergency Ambulance Division.
   The children and their supervisors had been planning to depart
the train in Birmingham, Ala., said Amtrak spokesman Clifford
Black. Amtrak officials said the students are from Long Leaf
Elementary School.
   The Crescent departed Washington at 6:40 p.m. EDT going
southbound with about 400 passengers and 18 crew members on board.
It had two engines and 16 cars.
   ``At 6:45 p.m., as the train was in the tunnel, an unknown
person for unknown reasons pulled the emergency brake,'' Black
said. ``The train stopped with its emergency brakes applied in the
tunnel'' as the second engine stalled or died.
   The train crew, thinking that an air hose that controls the
brake system had parted accidentally, ``walked the train'' looking
for such a problem, he said.
   After finding none, the crew searched the train's interior and
found that the emergency brake handle in the first passenger car
had been pulled, he said.
   Unable to release the brake, the crew shut down the remaining
lead engine which was spewing out diesel smoke that entered the
cars.
   Trains that leave Washington going south immediately enter a
3,900 foot tunnel that roughly goes under the grassy mall
stretching from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, Black said.
   Another Amtrak engine pulled the train back to Union Station, he
said. By 9 p.m. buses were ordered to retrieve the children from
the hospitals and take them to hotel for the night.

<HEAD>Police Announce Biggest Arms Seizure, Including Missile</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Wednesday announced
their biggest arms seizure, including a ground-to-air missile, and
arrested four whites who purportedly planned to carry out attacks
for the African National Congress.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok described the three men and
one woman as ``a highly specialized terror unit.'' He said they
were captured Sunday at a farmhouse near Pretoria, where they had
been staying since early this year.
   Police said the four had an assassination list of top police
officials and planned to use the missile to shoot down a police
helicopter at a recent fair.
   They said that besides one Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air
missile, the weapons seized included limpet mines, hand grenades,
assault rifles, pistols, machine guns, mortars and explosives.
   In his statement, Vlok alleged that the suspects were trained in
Moscow, Cuba and Angola and had radio transmitters which they used
to communicate with ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   The predominantly black African National Congress, outlawed in
South Africa since 1960, began a sabotage-and-bombing campaign the
next year aimed at toppling white-minority rule.
   Vlok did not release the names of the four. He did say the men
were South African citizens and the woman was from another country
he did not specify.
   He said two of the men were armed forces deserters and one was a
former South African journalist. They had university degrees and
were in their 20s and 30s, he added.
   The minister said police were investigating how the weapons were
brought into South Africa.
   The South African Press Association, citing unidentified police
sources, said a disenchanted ANC member apparently tipped off
authorities.
   Police said the four apparently had no connection with Heinrich
Grosskopf, a white South African and an alleged ANC member who is
the leading suspect in a March 17 car bombing that killed three
people. Grosskopf remains at large.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The United States refused visa
applications from six leading Vietnamese economists as part of a
policy to pressure the Hanoi government to end its occupation of
Cambodia, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   The group included Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a Harvard-educated
government advisor who visited several Asian capitals earlier this
year to try to attract capital and technology, officials said.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the State Department denied the visa requests on April 16 because
the group was ``deeply involved in Vietnamese economic policy
planning and the U.S. government policy is to isolate Vietnam
politically and economically to force its withdrawal from
Cambodia.''
   The Christopher Reynolds Foundation invited the group to visit
Harvard, the University of Michigan and other institutions to talk
about Vietnam's economy and efforts to attract Western investment,
said a U.S. source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States does not have diplomatic relations with
Vietnam.
   David Lyon, consul general at the Embassy, said Washington was
acting under Section 212A27 of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
which says the government can bar aliens whom it ``knows or has
reason to believe seek to enter the United States solely,
principally or incidentally to engage in activities which would be
prejudicial to the public interest or endanger the welfare, safety
or security of the United States.''
   Communist Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and maintains
125,000 troops there, according to U.S. estimates.
   Petzing said Oanh submitted a second application on April 19,
this time for him to travel alone, and that application is being
reviewed.
   The spokesman said that since Oct. 1, the United States has
approved applications for a half-dozen Vietnamese government
officials to visit the United Nations and other international
organizations.
   A larger number of private Vietnamese citizens have gone to the
United States to attend medical conferences and the like, Lyons
said. He said he did not know of any other Vietnamese visa
applications denied in the past 10 months.
   In the past few years, Vietnam has played host to many U.S.
congressmen, relief agency officials, journalists and others in an
effort to break its isolation.

   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration says serious health problems among workers required
to do repetitive physical labor on assembly lines prompted the
agency's second-largest fine ever against a single company.
   IBP Inc. says OSHA is trying to impose ``Alice in Wonderland
theories'' on industry, but the union representing workers at IBP's
Dakota City, Neb., meatpacking plant hailed Wednesday's decision to
get tough with the company.
   OSHA said it was imposing a $3.1 million fine against IBP for
willfully ignoring the hazards of repetitive motion. The agency
maintains that IBP could have taken numerous steps to reduce the
risk of injury, but did not.

   Bank customers with loans pegged to the prime
rate are about to feel the impact of the rising cost of money, but
economists say a big increase in interest rates is unlikely this
year.
   The first spike in the prime rate since the October stock market
crash was announced Wednesday by major banks. The rise from 8.5
percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans for
purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars.
   The prime rate reflects the banks' costs of borrowing money and
trails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rate
is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for
calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of
fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popular
home-equity loans.

   Upper-crust Englishman Harold ``Kim'' Philby, who

   The Foreign Office said it learned from the Soviet Embassy in

   Johnny Carson returned with a vengeance
to his late-night show, poking fun at revelations of White House
astrology in a monologue he wrote himself to end reruns forced by a
2-month-old writers' strike.
   ``I just could not stay away any longer from all things that are
going on in the country. I was compelled to come back,'' Carson
said Wednesday in his first new show since the strike began March 7.
   ``You know, we finally have a clue now as to what the hell (are)
the Looney Tunes things that have been coming out of Washington,''
he told viewers of ``The Tonight Show.''
   Carson referred to revelations by former White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan that Nancy Reagan regularly consulted an
astrologer to determine President Reagan's schedule.

   The number of unmarried couples in America has
topped 2.3 million, including more than 700,000 couples who are
raising children, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   In addition, there are more than 1.5 million couples of the same
sex living together, including 92,000 with children, according to
figures for 1987.
   The number of unmarried couples _ which the agency defines as
people of opposite sex living together _ has risen steadily in
recent years, except for a brief pause in 1985. They totaled 2.2
million in 1986 and just about 2 million in 1985.

   The first decline in an annual index of
American health practices illustrates there is a big difference
between people knowing they should eat right and exercise and
actually doing it, authorities said Thursday.
   Dr. James Michael McGinnis, a federal health official, said the
drop underscores the need for leaders ``to redouble our efforts to
convince Americans that health promotion ideas are not a fad.''
   Despite extensive publicity in recent years about the value of
proper diet and exercise, the 1988 survey by Prevention magazine
showed few gains in those areas, McGinnis, director of the Office
of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, noted.

   Although the number of known AIDS cases is
approaching 100,000 worldwide, much of the globe still remains
untouched by the epidemic, seven years after the disease was
detected, says a new report.
   The World Health Organization has reported 88,091 AIDS cases in
138 nations, but the actual number is believed to be much higher
because reporting efforts have just begun in some places, such as
some African nations.
   Thirty-six countries have told the Geneva-based organization
they have had no cases of the deadly disease.

   Harold ``Kim'' Philby is dead, but the bitter
aftertaste of his colossal betrayal still lingers in Britain.
   Even 25 years after the privileged English gentleman was
unmasked as Moscow's highest-placed mole in Western intelligence,
central questions remain unanswered:
   Were there others of higher rank? Were the operations of Western
intelligence agencies compromised more seriously than they realize?
When Philby gave his only interview to a Western journalist four

to discredit the British and undermine their relationship with

underdogs in presidential primaries, pollsters say. But the
tradition may not succumb without a fight.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is substantially ahead of
Jesse Jackson in opinion polls, most recently in a Gallup survey
this week giving Dukakis 67 percent to 26 percent for Jackson and 7
percent undecided.
   But if Dukakis is the heavy favorite to win, pollsters said in
recent interviews, Jackson still may do better than his recent
finishes, perhaps well enough to boost his influence at the party's

<TEXT>
   On a recent Sunday, after a Harlem congregation
prayed for a mother who threw her baby out a window and the pastor
preached against drug abuse, a woman rose to advocate funding for
the arts.
   ``We have some real problems. We have drugs. We have housing
problems. We have a multitude of severe crises we have to face,''
acknowledged Mary Schmidt Campbell, the city's cultural affairs
commissioner.
   ``Why should we spend our time and our energy on culture? ...
What claim do we have on the city's resources?'' she asked the
flock of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the city's oldest black
house of worship _ the church made famous by the late Adam Clayton
Powell Jr.
   And then she answered her own question.
   ``Our culture,'' she said, ``has been our salvation.''
   In the six months since Campbell succeeded Bess Myerson in one
of the nation's most powerful arts posts _ overseeing a cultural
budget that is second only to the National Endowment for the Arts _
she has repeatedly argued for more arts money in a city where
bridges are falling down, crime is ever escalating and level,
untroubled ground is hard to find.
   She has also restored the morale of a department dispirited by
the scandal that forced Myerson out of office and rekindled
enthusiasm in the arts community.
   Campbell recalled the black heritage she and the congregation
share: music and art dating back to the days of slavery in the
Americas, and before that to the great kingdoms and societies of
Africa.
   When she mentioned the success of the Dance Theater of Harlem
and noted that 98 percent of the young singers in the Boys Choir of
Harlem go on to college, the audience applauded vigorously.
   Later, in an interview, the commissioner said, ``I'm really
trying to accomplish a mentality, an attitude about the arts that
recognizes that it is one of the most essential services that the
city provides to its citizens.
   ``The real challenge for government is not to let itself get
overwhelmed by its problems _ that is, begin to seek out and carve
out real resources for opportunity.''
   Campbell, 40, does not underestimate the difficulty of what she
is trying to do. When she became commissioner last October, she had
hopes of doubling the department's budget.
   However, two weeks after her appointment, the stock market
crashed. Mayor Edward I. Koch recently proposed that the agency cut
$6 million from its current budget of $133 million for fiscal 1989.
   Campbell remains undaunted.
   Culture, she says, helps educate ``people who are going to be
our leaders, who we have to think of as being the salvation for the
city,'' and it helps in ``the reclamations'' of communities.
Moreover, arts-related tourism is among the city's most important
sources of revenue.
   During Myerson's tenure, the importance of culture as something
that was ``not just a leisure time activity ... had not been
conveyed,'' said Campbell, quickly adding, ``not that I was
critical of her personally.''
   Myerson, a former Miss America, was a glamorous presence at gala
cultural events, and the public's interest in her put the
relatively new and small Department of Cultural Affairs in the
spotlight.
   The department is 11 years old (it had been lumped in with the
parks department) and has about 55 employees.
   This year the department provided $66 million to 32 major
cultural institutions ranging from the Metropolitan Museum of Art
to El Museo del Barrio for operating and energy costs. It also
distributed $13 million to arts groups in grant money for programs
or projects such as the Metropolitan Opera's free performances in
city parks.
   ``I think Bess was very concerned about bringing some visibility
to the agency,'' said Kathleen Hughes, assistant commissioner for
program services.
   John Hayworth, assistant commissioner for cultural institutions,
agreed. ``She brought an immediacy, an understanding of the city's
political life.''
   But the controversy surrounding Myerson's romantic involvement
with millionaire Carl ``Andy'' Capasso took its toll on the
department. She was accused of improperly influencing a judge
presiding over his divorce case.
   ``It has been a difficult time for people here,'' Hughes said.
``I don't think there's any denying that going through something
like what we've been through in terms of publicity has an effect.''
   Campbell, the daughter of a Philadelphia family court judge,
received a doctorate in humanities at Syracuse University, where
she wrote a study of the late American artist Romare Bearden.
   As director of the Studio Museum of Harlem for 10 years, she
transformed it from a struggling community arts project occupying
two floors over a liquor store and fried chicken outlet into a
premier fine arts museum focusing on black artists. It has a $2
million annual budget and is the only museum of its kind accredited
by the American Association of Museums.
   Campbell also taught English literature for two years at Nkumbi
International College, a school in Zambia for refugees from South
Africa.
   Those in the arts mainstream are eager to praise her.
   ``She's intelligent, energetic and a compatible person,'' said
Martin Segal, chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center for the
Performing Arts and chairman of the board of the upcoming New York
Festival of the Arts.
   William H. Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
said he's ``dazzled by her intelligence.''
   ``One of the things that is difficult in government is to
understand how museums work. She has come from a museum environment
and she knows the issues. She knows the concerns, the weaknesses,
the strengths,'' he said.
   Campbell knows, also, that New York is the nation's cultural
capital, and she is eager to exert New York's influence on the
national scene.

<TEXT>
   Mary Deng once lived with her husband and
five children in the relative comfort of a village in southern
Sudan. Today she lives in her nation's capital in a shack without
water or sanitation, a refugee in her own country.
   A 5-year-old civil war in southern Sudan chased the family away
from their home, along with an estimated 820,000 other people,
forced from their homes into lives of poverty, hunger and social
ostracism.
   Mrs. Deng's story is similar to those of many of the others.
   ``The army came into our village and took our cattle and killed
many people,'' she said.
   ``My husband fled before me to get away from recruiters for both
the army and the rebels. I joined him with our five children
later.''
   The Dengs are among the estimated 400,000 to 600,000 southerners
who have crowded into eight camps around Khartoum.
   They run in all directions, mainly toward Khartoum and Sudan's
other cities, to become wards of an impoverished state.
   More than a quarter million have fled even into neighboring,
starving, war-torn Ethiopia. Several thousand of those died because
they arrived after long treks too weak to be saved.
   The refugees blame their plight on both sides in the war, rebels
and soldiers, and the tribal and ethnic conflicts that are at the
root of the fighting.
   About 6 million people remain in the south, where the population
is mainly Christian and animist of African extraction. Sixteen
million Arab-descended Moslems live in the dominant north.
   Because of the great religious and ethnic divisions between
north and south, Sudan has been torn by hostilities in the south
for most of the 32 years since it asserted its independence from
Britain and Egypt on Jan. 1, 1956.
   But for hundreds of years before that, southern and northern
tribes have fought over pastureland and water, northerners
traditionally dominating as they do now.
   The current round of warfare began in the spring of 1983.
   The rebel leader, John Garang, is fighting for a greater share
for the south of development money and of Sudan's potential wealth
from petroleum and mineral reserves, mostly in the south.
   Southern tribes like Garang's Dinka form the backbone of his
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
   The Sudanese army recruited Arab tribes and gave them modern
weapons.
   ``In 1985, the government started a policy of arming Arab tribes
to help in fighting the SPLA,'' said Sulaiman Baldo, a southerner
who is a professor at the University of Khartoum. He told an
interviewer the new automatic weapons enable Arab tribes to
dominate in intertribal clashes.
   Baldo recently co-authored a book on an alleged massacre a year
ago by an Arab tribe. He wrote that more than 1,000 Dinkas were
burned to death as police and soldiers watched without intervening.
   The government denies the atrocity charges, maintaining that the
victims died in cross fires. It also denies that it shirks its duty
to displaced southerners.
   ``We give them help, but not just to anyone so that they don't
become encouraged and come to stay and be fed for free and not
work,'' said el-Hag el-Tayeb, Sudan's acting commissioner for
relief and rehabilitation.
   The southerners in the Khartoum camps, he added, are ``people
who used to be producers and are now just consumers. They affect
the city's already taxed infrastructure.''
   In the civil war itself, the SPLA now controls most of the
southern countryside, with government troops in control of a
handful of large towns, diplomatic sources said.
   The fighting, nevertheless, has forced southerners to flee their
cultivated land and their cattle.
   Non-combatant southerners who have remained in the combat area
also are in a bad way, said a diplomatic source with access to
military information.
   ``The SPLA go on recruiting trips into villages and attack them
if the villagers refuse to support them,'' he said. ``The army
troops view most Dinka youth as potential SPLA supporters.''

<DATELINE>CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Moroccan workers are
laboring around the clock to complete King Hassan II's monumental
act of faith in time for his 60th birthday next year.
   When completed, the builders say, it will be the world's largest
mosque.
   Growing at a frenzied pace on a concrete platform jutting out
over waves breaking in from the Atlantic, the massive minaret is
already Morocco's tallest structure and is rising at a rate of
eight feet a day toward its planned pinnacle at 576 feet.
   It will soon dominate the skyline of this huge city and the
nearby Atlantic shore. It will be visible for 30 miles in two
directions.
   By far the most ambitious civilian construction project ever
undertaken in this North African Arab nation of 26 million people,
the ``Great Hassan II Mosque'' is budgeted to cost at least $250
million.
   Gifts from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and loans from several
Western nations are helping pay for it. Interior Minister Driss
Basri, who is in overall charge of the project, said Moroccan
businesses, private individuals and local authorities around the
country will be asked to contribute toward it.
   The ornate building was designed in a modernistic Moorish style
by the French architect Michel Pinseau, 62, who has lived and
worked in Morocco for the past 14 years.
   More than 2,500 workers are busy 24 hours a day seven days a
week so Hassan can consecrate the mosque July 9, 1989, his birthday.
   The site faces the Atlantic Ocean. Because the Koran, the Moslem
holy book, refers to God's ``throne over the water,'' Hassan wanted
the mosque built partly over the Atlantic.
   ``The tremendous pressure of the incoming waves created our
greatest technical problem,'' Pinseau said in an interview.
   ``Last year we measured one record wave that was more than 30
feet high. We had to build two enormous concrete `combs' to break
such waves and had to take other extraordinary measures to make
sure the ocean could never rock the building.''
   Pinseau, whose past designs include the former Pan American
World Airways building on the Champs Elysees in Paris and the
spectacular governor's palace in Casablanca, said the 430,000
square-foot platform would contain bathing facilities for men and
women, a Koranic school, a library and parking space for 900
vehicles.
   The main hall of the mosque will be big enough, he said, to
accommodate more than 20,000 worshippers, kneeling.
   ``The whole of St. Peter's in Rome could fit inside the main
building,'' Pinseau said. ``The minaret will be higher than the
great pyramid of Cheops. Casablanca's main highway, the Avenue of
the Armed Forces, will be lengthened to run in an unbroken
perspective to the minaret. It will be a magnificent focal point
for Morocco's largest city.''
   Casablanca, once a sleazy harbor town, now has high rise hotels
and office blocks that line the Avenue of the Armed Forces. The
city has more than 4 million inhabitants.
   King Hassan, said to be a direct descendant of the Prophet
Mohammed in the 38th generation, is Morocco's political and
religious leader.
   The mosque's main entrance door to the west will be reserved for
his exclusive use. At the east end of the nave, Hassan will have a
personal place to pray.
   The exterior of the building is to be covered with white
Moroccan marble. As soon as the concrete outer structure is
completed, more than 6,000 craftsmen will go to work on the
intricately sculptured interior and exterior decoration in
geometric Moorish patterns.
   At night, a laser beam will shine from the minaret toward Mecca,
the Islamic holy city in Saudi Arabia. Engineers at the site said
the beam will be visible at night across much of northern Morocco.
   In hot weather, sliding panels will allow a large section of the
roof to be opened with hydraulic pulleys.
   Hassan laid the foundation stone last year. It bears a citation
from the Koran: ``The prophet said whosoever builds a mosque in
God's name, God will build a house for him in paradise.''

<HEAD>Japanese Leader Trying to Break Pro-U.S. Mold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After six months in office, Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita still faces trade disputes with the United States and
Western Europe and has been unable to break the pro-U.S. mold set
by his predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   His critics call his devotion to Nakasone's policies his one big
failure, while at least one admirer, Seizaburo Sato, an adviser to
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said it is only natural for
Takeshita to remain committed to them.
   ``Takeshita occupied many important positions in the Cabinet and
the party, and he is committed to the policies of Nakasone,'' Sato
said.
   But others see signs that Takeshita finally is beginning to head
off on his own course.
   ``I think he has not yet found his own way of solving problems,
but he is on his way,'' said Rei Shiratori, professor of political
science at Tokai University.
   But he added that one of Takeshita's biggest problems is ``the
heavy burden left by former Prime Minister Nakasone, especially
with the United States.''
   Many Japanese feel Nakasone was too closely allied with the
United States.
   Takeshita himself has said the time had come for a change in
Japan-U.S. relations.
   ``The international economic framework so long sustained by the
overwhelming economic might of the United States is being
transformed, and there is a need for Japan and Western Europe to
join forces with the United States in supporting the international
economy,'' he said in a policy speech.
   An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun in late April called on
Takeshita to assert Japan's independence from U.S. policies.
   ``We want the prime minister to be aware that Japan has become
an important pillar for the West,'' the independent liberal
newspaper said. ``It is now time for Japan to assert its own
diplomacy, independent of the United States.''
   On resolving major policy issues, Takeshita has a slim record so
far. He achieved limited success in resolving a trade dispute with
the United States over lack of access to Japan's construction
market, primarily because of the major influence of one of his
Cabinet officials on Japan's construction industry.
   However, talks with U.S. officials on liberalizing Japan's beef
and orange imports broke down, and the United States is seeking a
resolution through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Takeshita's administration was also unsuccessful in persuading
President Reagan to lift sanctions imposed last year on some
Japanese products because of alleged violations of an agreement on
U.S. access to Japan's computer chip market.
   Takeshita also was unable to prevent the U.S. Congress from
passing a sweeping trade bill that includes sanctions against
Japanese companies. He is relying heavily on Reagan to veto the
bill.
   The prime minister's major test at home will come later this
year, when the Diet, Japan's national legislature, considers a tax
reform package that Nakasone desperately wanted, but was unable to
get.
   Many Japanese say the current tax system is unfair. New
proposals call for taxes on capital gains from the sale of
securities, the elimination of tax privileges for doctors, the
cutting of provisions that allow some people to estimate their
income, and taxation of farmland.

<DATELINE>OUKASIE, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government accustomed to getting
its way has met its match in this ramshackle black township, which
officially doesn't exist.
   For years, white authorities have been trying to coax or coerce
the people of Oukasie into moving to a newer township 12 miles away.
   Officials legally abolished Oukasie in 1986, but about 8,000
residents remain and are determined to stay.
   In April, the government declared the 55-year-old township an
``emergency camp'' subject to severe new regulations. Rents were
raised by 50 percent, unauthorized visitors will be barred as of
June 1, and permits are required to renovate homes, keep pets or
take in lodgers.
   Members of the community believe the government seeks to
demoralize them so they will give up and move. That would enable
the authorities to eliminate Oukasie without resorting to forced
removal, a policy the government claims to have abandoned.
   Oukasie residents say they won't give in to the pressure.
   ``Sometimes in life you get tired of being harassed and moved
about,'' said Sello Ramakobye, a spokesman for Oukasie's civic
association. ``You decide it's time to resist.''
   The official reason for Oukasie's intended demise is that the
government considers it an unhealthy slum, beyond rehabilitation
because of ``astronomic costs.''
   Residents commissioned a study of their own that found upgrading
would cost 3 million rands ($1.4 million). They say this would be
cheaper than relocating all of them at the new township,
Lethlabile, and they believe the government's real reason for
wanting Oukasie shut down is that it is just a few hundreds yards
from Brits, a white suburb 30 miles west of Pretoria, South
Africa's capital.
   Brits is a stronghold of the far-right Conservative Party. Its
white residents have displayed little sympathy for their black
neighbors, who are able to walk to their jobs in Brits but would
have to pay for transport if they moved to Lethlabile.
   Because of government funding, Lethlabile has advantages over
Oukasie, and some of the 5,000 former Oukasie residents who have
moved there are pleased with their choice. The new township's
streets are smooth, its homes have electricity and plumbing. A few
houses are relatively lavish, with patios and two-car garages.
   Oukasie is overcrowded and dilapidated. Many homes are in ruins,
demolished by former owners as a prerequisite for getting state
compensation to move to Lethlabile. The only services provided are
water from communal taps and removal of waste from bucket toilets.
   But Oukasie has certain charms. Trees, a rare sight in many
townships, are abundant, and well-tended gardens adjoin even some
of the sorriest-looking metal shacks. Two soccer fields are
maintained diligently by local youths.
   ``Everything we want to do, we do it ourselves,'' said Elias
Sithole, a 39-year-old former carpenter. He is one of an estimated
50 percent of the adult population that is unemployed, and says
job-seeking from Lethlabile would be costly and difficult.
   Other jobless residents don't want to move because they have
improved their homes in Oukasie over the years and can't afford
houses in Lethlabile, except for the small metal huts allocated to
newcomers.
   ``The social structure in Oukasie is so coherent,'' said
Ramakobye. ``It's wrong to destroy it. In Lethlabile, everybody is
for himself.''
   Oukasie residents also are wary of Lethlabile's proximity to the
nominally independent black homeland of Bophuthatswana. They fear
the new township will be incorporated into the homeland, thus
depriving residents of South African citizenship.
   ``No one is going to volunteer to go to Lethlabile,'' said
Sithole. ``The government thinks everybody is going to be scared
into going, but it will take force. You should see the unity of
these people.''
   Sithole guided visitors to the edge of the nearby white suburb,
where a concrete moat filled with dark green muck separates
handsome, new hillside homes from a dirt road leading to Oukasie.
   ``How can they say it's too expensive to upgrade Oukasie when
they upgrade their mountain?'' he said.
   Raw sewage from whites' homes runs into a gully next to the
township.
   Sithole said Oukasie residents are somewhat cynical about white
complaints that the black community smells.

<HEAD>Methodists Blast Israel In Conflict With Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the months of Israeli-Palestinian violence,
various church organizations have criticized Israel as moving too
harshly to curb disorder. Last week such criticism got tougher.
   In one of the severest condemnations yet of Israeli conduct, the
United Methodist Church said, ``Israel's current iron-fist policy
... is totally unacceptable as civilized behavior.''
   The blast from this church of nearly 10 million Americans,
second-largest in U.S. Protestantism next to Southern Baptists,
came in a late-night finale of its governing conference and got
scant news attention.
   Yet it marked a heightened level of church reproach against
Israel, putting added strains on Jewish-Christian relationships in
this country.
   Rabbi James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee, called the statement a one-sided
expression of ``selective outrage'' against Israel without also
criticizing Arab fomenters of violence.
   ``Overall it's an unbalanced statement,'' he said, and the
``harshest emanated from the church world toward Israel.''
   However, it was approved by an overwhelming 816-76 vote, urging
the United States to stop all military and security aid to Israel
until ``Israel ceases the repression of Palestinians in the
occupied territory.''
   Castigating Israel's use of force to put down rock-heaving
Palestinian upheavals, the resolution said of Israel's actions:
   ``This violent behavior brutalizes human beings, both oppressed
and oppressors, and leads to a deepening cycle of hatred and
violence.''
   The statement called on Israel ``to stop beatings, to end the
killings, to cease destroying Palestinian homes, to stop deporting
Palestinians, to enter into negotiations with Palestinian civilians
and the Palestine Liberation Organization over legitimate demands,
including fair and just distribution of disputed lands.''
   Oddly, a few days before, the church's bishops had issued an
even-handed statement on the Israel-Palestinian crisis, seeing in
it impetus for fresh approaches, urging Arab recognition of Israel
and a plebiscite among Palestinians on their desires.
   However, the church delegates, half laity and half clergy from
around the country, asked the U.S. government to press
international efforts and open negotiations with the PLO to settle
the region's problems.
   Rudin, a familiar figure in Christian-Jewish discussions, said
the demand that the U.S. cut off aid to Israel until it shifts
policies was a ``carrot and stick technique that good friends don't
use and that won`t work.''
   ``There was no similar call for us to stop miliitary and
security aid to Arab countries that harbor and train terrorists. It
calls on Israel to do various things, but doesn't call on Arab
countries to recognize Israel.''
   In various ways, Rudin said the statement applied a ``selective
double standard'' of blaming only Israel.
   He said the statement ``does not mention what the Palestinians
are doing. To read it, you would come to the conclusion that they
are Mahatma Gandhi-like non-violent people, when we all know they
are not.''
   However, the statement does ask Palestinians and the PLO to
recognize Israel and ``to cease the support or initiation of all
terrorist activities.''
   Ronald Young of New York, executive of a newly organized U.S.
Interreligious Committee for Peace in the Middle East, told the
conference earlier: ``It is a conflict that is not reducible to all
the right on one side and all the wrong on the other.''
   However, he said Christian leaders usually are reluctant to talk
about it for fear of being labeled anti-Jewish. That inhibition
didn't prevail among the Methodist representatives.

<HEAD>Joseph Campbell's Mythology Featured on PBS</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Campbell made his career teaching about
life, as comprehended in the myths or stories people tell about
themselves and the universe.
   Half a year after his death, public television offers a
stimulating seminar with the great teacher starting May 16 with
``The Hero's Journey,'' a one-hour documentary about Campbell.
   A week later, PBS begins a six-week series of Bill Moyers'
conversations with Campbell in ``Joseph Campbell and the Power of
Myth.''
   ``The Hero's Journey'' is a useful introduction to Campbell's
ideas about mythology and his core conviction: ``There is one
mythology in the world,'' with variations called Christianity,
Islam, Buddhism and so on.
   A myth, in this sense, is not a lie, but a metaphor for the
experience of life.
   So, to Campbell, the idea of God is not true or false. ``God is
a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human
categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being.''
   The metaphor is valid, he says, if ``it is putting you in touch
with the mystery that is the ground of your own being. If it isn't,
it's a lie.''
   Though ``Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth'' is simply the
two men talking, it may be the most compelling television series
this year.
   The conversation is strewn with ideas that will be enlightening,
provocative and at times maddening. The success of the series may
be measured by the number of times a viewer will want to argue, and
by the conversations that begin after the TV is switched off.
   Campbell, who taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 38 years,
died Oct. 30 in Honolulu at age 83. He left an extensive record of
his work in books, including ``The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' and
``The Masks of God.''
   ``He is a writer of important scholarship, but you don't find
the person in the writing,'' Moyers said in a recent interview.
   ``You find the mind there, but not the personality, not the
power of the individual that comes through any great teacher.
That's why I wanted to do so much with him. We would have his
works, but we wouldn't have his teaching. Teachers have to be
experienced, they can't be read.''
   Moyers didn't know much about Campbell when they met in 1979 for
an interview that appeared two years later on ``Bill Moyers'
Journal'' on PBS.
   ``We had over 14,000 requests for a transcript, so I knew I had
touched a chord,'' Moyers said. ``Even without the requests, I knew
he had touched a chord because he moved me. He opened my eyes. He
connected what had been unrelated phenomena in my own experience in
life.''
   For this series, Moyers taped 23 hours of interviews and spent
many more hours in informal conversations.
   ``We became pretty good friends, more so than I usually do with
somebody I put on the air because I don't have that much time with
them,'' Moyers said. ``I was his perpetual student, his graduate
student for life.''
   Campbell was raised as a Roman Catholic and fondly recalled that
experience as ``powerful, life-supporting and beautiful.'' But,
like many another believer, his faith was derailed by Charles
Darwin.
   ``The thing that saved me,'' he says, ``was the Upanishads _
Hinduism.''
   In those texts, he says in ``The Hero's Journey,'' he found the
same mythology as in Christianity, without the insistence that the
stories were historically true.
   Campbell ``is the most spiritual man I ever met,'' Moyers said,
but he knows that this series will not be welcomed by
fundamentalists.
   ``What I took him as saying is that all religion is true, and if
it works for you, fine,'' said Moyers.
   ``If it does in fact lead you to love the lord thy god with all
thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind and thy neighbor as
thyself, fine. You don't have to move on to this other angle of
seeing ...
   ``Faith,'' Moyers added, ``is an excruciatingly personal choice
or rejection. Your idea of God may be terribly dissatisfying to me,
which is why I love the democratic way which is that you can't
impose it on me.''
   Moyers' interviews with Campbell are also the basis for a book,
``The Power of Myth,'' compiled by Betty Sue Flowers, a professor
at the University of Texas. It will be published this month by
Doubleday.
   Moyers said the book was initiated by Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, an editor at Doubleday.
   Moyers said Mrs. Onassis had been impressed by the earlier
interviews in which Campbell talked about the mythic significance
of John F. Kennedy's funeral and of the ``ancient mythological
symbol, the widow who helps us all come to terms with our grief
when the ruler is killed.''

   BACK TO UNREALITY _ Due to the veritable abyss left in the
entertainment world by the absence of ``That's Incredible!'' from
the airwaves, hyperbolic hosts John Davidson, Cathy Lee Crosby and
Fran Tarkenton will engage in a reunion special on ABC on May 22.
ABC promises the one-hour special will include a man kissing a
deadly cobra on the mouth, another putting a red-hot metal bar into
his mouth and yet another blowing bubbles ``into unique and unusual
shapes.'' Not to be mythed.

<HEAD>Oscar's Golden Touch Might Not Glitter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month after the 60th Academy Awards, evidence
persists that the Oscar's golden touch doesn't always live up to
its reputation.
   Columbia Pictures had hoped that the sweep of nine Oscars by
``The Last Emperor'' would result in a box-office bonanza. But
despite doubling the number of theaters to more than 800 after the
awards, the Chinese epic has added only $10 million to theater
grosses.
   After 164 days in release, ``The Last Emperor'' had sold $36.6
million worth of tickets in the United States and Canada. By
comparison, the ghostly comedy ```Beetlejuice'' grossed $46.7
million in just 33 days.
   Still, James R. Spitz, president of Columbia's domestic
distribution, maintains ``The Last Emperor'' has had a very good
performance since the awards.
   ``Comparing `The Last Emperor' to `Beetlejuice' is like
comparing apples to oranges,'' he said. ```The Last Emperor' will
never have the teen-age audience that `Beetlejuice' has.''
   Spitz predicted the Bernardo Bertolucci film will continue doing
good business through Memorial Day and will remain in distribution
for a long time.
   ``Moonstruck,'' which collected acting awards for Cher and
Olympia Dukakis, has added $10 million since the Oscars, bringing
its total to $69 million. The figure is impressive, since the film
had been in wide release for more than two months.
   Much has been written about how winning Oscars can inflate
actors' salaries. With one exception, this year's winners seem
unlikely to boost their paychecks.
   Since ``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Fatal Attraction,'' Michael
Douglas has become one of the most in-demand stars in Hollywood.
His win for ``Wall Street'' will have little effect on Douglas, who
sometimes produces his own films (``The China Syndrome,'' ``Jewel
of the Nile'').
   Douglas' next film is for Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe, who
produced ``Fatal Attraction.'' In ``Black Rain,'' he will play an
American police officer trying to solve a murder by the Yakusa, the
Japanese Mafia.
   Having appeared in ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Suspect'' and
``Moonstruck'' in 1987, Cher can afford a rest. No new films have
been announced for her in the wake of the Oscar, but the scripts
must be piling up at her door. Meanwhile, she will collect a
fortune with her Las Vegas act.
   Sean Connery, winner as supporting actor in ``The
Untouchables,'' needs no help from Oscar or anyone else in his
career. He has been a top wage earner since his James Bond days.
He'll appear this summer in ``Presidio'' with Mark Harmon, and
works next as Harrison Ford's father in the third ``Indiana Jones''
movie.
   Olympia Dukakis seems to be the major recipient of Oscar's
beneficence. Although a distinguished stage actress, she was little
known before ``Moonstruck.'' Since her nomination, she has been
able to decline two offers for television series. She has accepted
a small role in Mike Nichols' ``Working Girls,'' which stars
Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver, but her
agents predict big things for her.
   The April 11 Oscar show drew generally poor notices but also the
best television rating in years.
   ``The ratings show that we didn't lose our audience, even during
a sweep (by `The Last Emperor'),'' said Samuel Goldwyn Jr. who
produced the show for the Academy. ``I tried to prevent that by
putting a heavy load of comedy (Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy)
toward the end. The audience stayed with us.''
   Goldwyn recognized the problems in moving to the Shrine
Auditorium with its poor acoustics, and the horendous traffic jam.
``But those problems can be solved. I think we benefited from
having 6,000 in the theater; it was a much warmer audience.'' The
Music Center, where the awards show previously was staged, held
only 2,000 people.
   Most critics lambasted the 3{-hour broadcast time, and Goldwyn
commented that the Academy will have to address that problem.
``There are certain things in the show that the Academy is
interested in but the public isn't,'' he said.
   Efforts to eliminate such awards as short subjects,
documentaries and animation from the show have so far failed to
achieve Board of Governors approval.
   Will Goldwyn be around next year to help deal with such problems?
   ``Not on your life,'' he said. ``Two years is enough.''

<HEAD>Scripture Lashes Astrology, But It May Be Different Now, Or Dumb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astrology and other strategies presumed to
predict the future are sharply denounced in the Bible, but the
ancient star-gazing system has evolved somewhat over the centuries.
   In its modern popular form, which reportedly has been used by
Nancy Reagan, it has little to do with religion, but scholars say
it still has ramifications that can turn it at odds with biblical
faith.
   ``A lot of people today regard it as kind of an innocent
pastime,'' says the Rev. Page Kelley, an Old Testament scholar of
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   ``They don't put much store in it. I put it in the same category
as reading fortune cookies in a Chinese restaurant. But if people
really take it seriously as a scheme for ordering their lives, the
old objections become valid again.''
   To rely on it seriously, he added, ``borders more on stupidity
than sin.''
   In olden times, astrology was closely connected with idolatry,
used along with other devices both to determine courses of action
and ascertain the will of the gods.
   ``An abomination,'' Scripture calls it in Deutertonomy 18:9,
decreeing death by stoning for any Israelite, man or woman, who
``practices divination'' or uses soothsaying, augury, sorcery, a
charmer, medium, wizard or necromancer.
   Divination, linked to early astrology, used various clues to
determine the will of the gods, such as positions of celestial
bodies, tossed arrows to see how they fell, examining
configurations of oil on water or in a sheep's liver.
   The prophet Isaiah, assailing the evils of Babylon, says
scornfully:
   ``Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make
predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming
upon you. Surely they are like stubble. The fire will burn them
up.''
   Similar reproaches are scattered through Scripture, with
astrologers described as those ``who divide the heavens (into 12
signs of the zodiac), who gaze at the stars, who at the new moons
predict what shall befall...
   ``They wander about each in his own direction.''
   Rabbi David Sperling of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of
Religion said the strong condemnations of divination (early
astrology) were because of its ties to idolatry, contrary to
Judaism.
   ``We had the prophets and got the word of the Lord directly from
them,'' he said. ``We didn't have to rely on looking up at the
stars or inside animals to see what the gods had in store for us.
The prophets were much more reliable.
   ``What the Bible condemns is considering the stars as kind of
heavenly writing, telling you what God has in store for you.''
   He said astrology had evolved since ancient Bible times,
modified in later ancient Greek and Egyptian civilizations to be
seen not as revealing the gods, but charting planetary effects on
earthly behavior and moods.
   ``That's not quite what the Bible was dealing with,'' Sperling
said.
   Added Rabbi Eugene Borowitz, also of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion: ``There's not a simple straight line from
the Bible to the kind of astrology Mrs. Reagan is involved in.''
   However, religious scholars said astrology, claiming the planets
partly control human affairs, tends to run counter to biblical
teaching of humanity's free will to choose good or evil.
   However, religious institutions rarely speak of astrology these
days, although it was often attacked in the early centuries of
Christianity and also in Islam.
   ``Fundamentalist theology very clearly condemns astrology,''
Kelley said, but he noted that contemporary churches generally have
shown little, if any, concern with it. He said the assumption seems
to be that few people take it seriously.
   ``If they do, that's another matter, and something to be
concerned about,'' he said.
   Sperling said that Jewish Scritpures (the Old Testament)
strongly condemn early tendencies of astrology (as a conduit of
gods), but rabbinical thought since then has varied on the subject.
   ``We're not of one mind,'' he said. ``Some are opposed to it,
while others think it's not such a terrible thing.''
   The prophet Daniel, who served in the court of the Babylonian
king Nebuchadnezzar, bewildered by his fortune-tellers and
astrologers, told him:
   ``No wise men, enchanters, magicians or astrologers can show to
the king the mystery which the king has asked, but there is a God
in heaven who reveals mysteries...''
   Daniel proceeded to tell Nebuchadnezzar his reign was ended.
``You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting.''
   Legend has it that the wise men who visited the Christ child
were Persian astrologers alerted to the event by planetary
conjunctions.
   Called variously a pre-science or pseudo-science, astrology
became ``scientifically untenable'' with the rise of modern
physics, says the Encyclopedia Britannica. But it still holds wide
attention in newspaper columns, other publications and commercial
establishments.
   The encyclopedia says: ``In short, modern Western astrology,
though of great interest sociologically and popularly, generally is
regarded as devoid of intellectual value.''

   A theologian for the National Association

not affect evangelical belief in Christ's resurrection, whatever
the results.
   ``It is no more than an interesting investigation,'' says the
Rev. Arthur Climenhaga, chairman of NAE's theological committee.
``Even if proof could be offered that the Shroud of Turin was the
shroud of Christ, that would be no more than an additional artifact
in the historical evidences of Christ's resurrection _ already so
well attested.''
   The Vatican is allowing the carbon-14 tests on bits of the
shroud, preserved in Turin, Italy, and bearing the image of a
crucified man, to determine its age, and whether it dates to the
time of Christ.
   Results of the tests are expected later this year.

<HEAD>War Forces Iraq to Streamline its Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's economy lost its footing in the 1986
oil price collapse but is regaining its balance, partly because of
the 7{-year-old war with Iran.
   The conflict, which is costing $10 billion a year, has forced
President Saddam Hussein to streamline a bloated prewar
bureaucracy, increase efficiency in government sectors and scrap
some of his socialist programs.
   Oil prices are firmer and oil exports are climbing. Saddam has
sold off inefficient state-owned enterprises in a program aimed at
revitalizing the private sector, long suppressed by socialist
policies.
   All this has helped ease the worries of Iraq's many creditors,
who last year had to reschedule the country's debt repayments
because the Iraqis did not have enough cash.
   Even so, Iraq is only just managing to keep pace with a
war-incurred foreign debt of at least $35 billion, diplomats say.
   The government's decision last year to loosen its grip on
subsidized prices and foreign exchange has helped reduce
once-chronic shortages but at a painful cost for many of Iraq's 15
million people.
   The long lines of shoppers outside stores are fewer now than in
1986 because goods are more plentiful.
   Some Iraqis grumble about prices, however.
   Local meat, which used to cost the equivalent of $7.50 to $9 a
pound, now sells for $9 to $10.50 a pound, at the dollar's official
rate of exchange against the dinar of $3.30 to one. Exchange houses
outside Iraq, however, trade the dinar at 50 cents for one.
   Bread, rice and cooking oil remain subsidized. But a package of
30 eggs that once cost $4.30, now sells for at least $8.30.
   Even the cost of candy bars has risen, from 25 cents to nearly
$1.
   These are stiff prices for many workers. Civil servants, for
example, earn 90 to 150 dinars a month.
   Many Iraqis have found their incomes squeezed further this year
by increased working hours in essential industries and offices,
making the once-common practice of moonlighting nearly impossible.
   It's still difficult to find many goods at subsidized prices,
forcing Iraqis into the costly black market for such things as car
parts or cigarettes.
   The variety on the vegetable stands is the most visible sign of
Iraq's move away from 20 years of strict socialist controls on the
economy.
   The government told businessmen last year they could import
goods with foreign currency, with few questions asked about how
they got the money.
   Planning Minister Samal Majeed Faraj said recently Iraq will
allow Arabs from other countries to invest in Iraq with guarantees
against government seizure of their assets.
   In the last year, the government has sold off bus companies,
poultry farms, dairies, gas stations and supermarkets and other
businesses and is trying to get outside investors to buy a stake in
Iraqi Airways, the national flag carrier.
   Saddam also abolished labor laws that had guaranteed employment.
   Other countries are looking at Iraq with more confidence.
   It has won promises of new loans or credit guarantees from the
United States, France and West Germany.
   ``Until the war, it didn't matter if the economy was well run or
not because they had so much money,'' said a European diplomat.
   ``This is a country with more than 100 billion barrels of proven
oil reserves,'' the diplomat noted. ``They plainly have a way to
repay.''

<HEAD>The Two Educations of Afghanistan's Young</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen-year-old Noorieh Mazloumpoor
has had two educations in her young life _ one Moslem, the other
Marxist.
   She got her Marxist education in her homeland, Afghanistan.
   As a refugee with her family in Pakistan for the past two years,
her education has been based on Islam, her religion.
   She is typical of Afghan children who have been taught two
conflicting ideologies over the past decade of war in their country.
   Now with the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, the
children who have had an Islamic education in Pakistan will be
returning home to join those whose education was wholly Marxist.
   The gap may be wide, but students interviewed here were
confident it won't deter them from reuniting their country in the
long run.
   Noorieh went to school in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, until
she was 12.
   In Pakistan, she enrolled in a Moslem school run by the
guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government.
   Like many of her classmates, she has had to switch from courses
that taught Communist doctrine to interpretations of the Koran, the
Moslem holy book.
   In Kabul, she said, she was taught that it was her ``duty to
serve the country, the masses, the revolution and the fruits of
history.''
   At her refugee school in Peshawar, the blue cover of her Persian
language text book has a map identifying her country as ``Moslem
Afghanistan.'' Another map in the book carries the Koranic verse,
``There is no god but Allah. Mohammed is his prophet.''
   Refugee books published by the guerrillas' Afghan education
council also teach: ``The future of Afghanistan should be
reconstructed on the principles of Islamic culture.''
   ``Eventually we will have to reconcile the two,'' said
Ehsanollah Poopal, 17-year-old 10th grader.
   ``It's going to take a lot of effort, patience. They have their
reasons and we have ours.''
   Poopal, however, said he will not accept the Communist teachings
and will try to explain to his classmates back home why his beliefs
are different.
   Another refugee student, 15-year-old Mehrafsa, said he thinks it
is going to be difficult in the beginning.
   ``We are going to suffer first, especially to see our friends
are led toward a corrupt path, taught bad values. But I don't think
it will be too long before we understand each other. I don't think
the gap will affect the country in the long run.''
   Wassimeh, 24, a teacher at one of the refugee schools, believes
Moslem education will continue when the children among the 3
million refugees in Pakistan return home.
   Maliheh Malekzad, 28, an mathematics teacher, said she taught at
a Kabul school until two years ago. She added that unless a teacher
was a member of the Communist Party, there was no hope of promotion.
   ``It is very difficult for a Moslem not to be able to express
her religious viewpoint and to be taunted for her belief,'' she
said.
   Schools in Afghanistan, according to the teachers and students
here, have their own party recruitment bodies _ the scouts, the
first stage of Communist ``indoctrination,'' and the youth
organization, where Russian culture and language are taught, and
where some are given schoolarships to study in the Soviet Union.
   The third stage is the older youth organization where advanced
Communist books are read outside the school curriculum.
   Ms. Malekzad said the refugee schools here are good at teaching
theories but poor in practical education.
   The walls and classrooms are adorned with guerrilla posters, and
during class, the students sing: ``I cry for my motherland, I cry
for its martyr. Wherever I turn, I see broken limbs.''
   But 9-year-old Godsiyeh Amir Mohammad said she likes studying
Islam because it will ``make me go to heaven.''

<HEAD>Rambo, Crocodile Dundee and a Dwarf Head Summer Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rambo, Crocodile Dundee and a dwarf named
Willow begin the summer movie season this month with a blast that
industry analysts expect to help propel the nation's theaters to a
record year.
   ``It looks like another record,'' said Art Murphy, financial
writer for the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety. ``The first
four months are already $100 million more than last year's record.
If the pace is continued at the same rate, the year will easily
exceed 1987's $4\ billion.
   ``The 15 weeks of summer, which amount to 40 percent of the
year's total, look very promising. First sequels of big hits are
always strong, and you've got `Crocodile Dundee II,' plus `Rambo
III,' which is really a first sequel since the original film was
`First Blood.' Plus you have a George Lucas film which is not in
the same `Star Wars' mold.''
   ``Crocodile Dundee II'' and ``Rambo III'' open on May 27, while
the Lucas epic, ``Willow,'' was moved ahead to May 20 in an
apparent attempt by MGM-UA to beat the crowd. The company is
understandably nervous about the $35 million film _ plus $20
million for advertising and promotion _ which has no stars, and the
hero is a dwarf who protects a baby from an evil queen.
   ``Rambo III'' also seems a perilous investment in view of its
reported $63 million cost, including $20 million to Sylvester
Stallone. Also, Stallone's last two releases failed to ignite the
box ofice.
   Other repeats of past hits will be offered for the summer trade:
``Poltergeist III,'' the last film of young Heather O'Rourke;
``Caddyshack II,'' with Jackie Mason replacing Rodney Dangerfield;
``Arthur 2 on the Rocks,'' again with Dudley Moore and Liza
Minnelli, and a ghostly appearance by John Gielgud; ``Short Circuit
II''; plus ``Phantasm II,'' ``Deathstalker III,'' Angel III'' and
``Barbarian Queen II.''
   Once again comedy is the strong suit of summer. The original
offerings include:
   _ ``Big Business,'' Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin as a pair of
twins who are switched in the maternity ward and find out 30 years
later.
   _ ``Punchline,'' Sally Field and Tom Hanks as stand-up comic
hopefuls who fall in love.
   _ ``Me and Him,'' Griffin Dunne as an architect who suffers a
sexual crisis.
   _ ``Funny Farm,'' Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith as a fast-lane
pair seeking tranquility in a small town.
   _ ``Hot to Trot,'' comic Bob Goldthwaite and a talking horse.
   _ ``Big,'' Tom Hanks as a 13-year-old whose wish to grow up in a
hurry is granted.
   _ ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' Pee-wee Herman as a country clod who
falls for a circus star.
   _ ``Coming to America,'' Eddie Murphy as an African prince in
search of a bride.
   _ ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and
Kevin Kline in a comedy about United States-British relations.
   _ ``Married to the Mob,'' Michelle Pfiefer and Matthew Modine in
a Mafia comedy.
   _ ``Bull Durham,'' the lighter side of baseball with Kevin
Costner and Susan Sarandon.
   _ ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' a Steven Spielberg-produced
Disney fantasy starring Bob Hoskins and a host of Hollywood cartoon
stars.
   _ ``The Great Outdoors,'' Dan Aykroyd and John Candy as
brothers-in-law on a disastrous summer vacation.
   _ ``Midnight Run,'' Robert De Niro in a comedy about a bounty
hunter for the Mob.
   _ ``Moon over Parador,'' Richard Dreyfuss as an actor who
impersonates a Caribbean dictator.
   _ ``Vibes,'' Cyndi Lauper in her film debut, with Jeff Goldblum
and Peter Falk.
   The macho men will be back for summer. Besides Stallone,
theaters will be offering Clint Eastwood (``The Dead Pool''),
Arnold Schwarzenegger (``Red Heat''), Chuck Norris (``Hero and the
Terror''), Michael Dudikoff (``Nam'') and Charles Bronson
(``Messenger of Death'').
   Summer will also bring Bruce Willis as a New York cop fighting
terrorists in ``Die Hard,'' and Sean Connery and Mark Harmon as
investigators of murder in ``Presidio.''
   A handful of dramatic films offer hope for adult audiences.
Francis Coppola returns with his long-planned ``Tucker,'' with Jeff
Bridges as the inventor who tries to revolutionize the automobile
industry. Tom Berenger and Debra Winger star in ``Betrayed,'' about
an FBI agent who infiltrates a Midwest hate group.
   That nearly extinct species, the Western, gets another chance
for revival with ``Young Guns,'' whose cast include Emilio Estevez,
Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips.
   And for the small fry: ``The New Adventures of Pippi
Longstocking,'' and a revival of Disney's ``Bambi.''
   How does the summer season look to movie buyers?
   ``I think it's going to be `Willow,' `Rambo' and `Crocodile
Dundee,''' said Todd Zsmania, booker for the 75-screen Mescop chain
in Michigan and Wisconsin.
   ``I saw a rough cut of `Willow' that was a little slow getting
started, then picked up speed. I assume they made some cuts, and I
think it will be a winner. I also saw a rough cut of `Crocodile,'
and the ending was confused, but I think they'll take care of that.
`Rambo,' I think, will be big for a couple of weeks, then drop
off.''

<TEXT>
   Egypt built the Aswan High Dam two decades
ago as a safeguard against the whims of the Nile River. But the
worst drought in 70 years has dangerously lowered water levels and
threatens to shut down the dam's electric-power generators.
   The government is using television jingles and newspaper
campaigns to urge Egyptians to conserve water and electricity.
   President Hosni Mubarak warned on television that thousands of
villages could go dark this summer unless the eight-year-long
drought upriver eases.
   He said the water of Lake Nasser, the Aswan dam's
1,335-square-mile reservoir, is perilously close to a level
impossible to sustain electricity generation.
   The dam, built during the 1960s with Soviet help and inaugurated
in 1971, was intended mainly to end annual killer floods. It also
was to provide adequate Nile water to irrigate Egypt's agricultural
heartland along its banks.
   In addition, it supplies 30 percent of Egypt's electricity.
   Experts say agricultural production has escaped serious harm so
far but could be affected by another year of drought. Agriculture
was the main casualty from the Nile Valley's last serious drought,
which began in 1913 and continued for seven years.
   In the current drought, the high dam has been credited with
sparing Egypt the famine that has spread across Sudan and Ethiopia
upriver. But the prolonged lack of rainfall at the Ugandan and
Ethiopian headwaters of the White Nile and Blue Nile has lowered
the river's level in Egypt by more than 69 feet at the high dam.
The water surface is now 508 feet above sea level.
   Summer rains in Ethiopia normally provide the Nile with 84
percent of its water.
   This past January, the month when the river is always at its
shallowest, houseboats were high and dry in Cairo, 600 miles
downstream from Aswan, for the first time in anyone's memory. Nile
cruises from Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo, to Abu Simbel were
abandoned or started upstream from Luxor.
   Trans-Nile ferry service was halted at Luxor for a while last
year, and long-time residents reported more land outcroppings in
the Nile's dark, murky water than ever before.
   Maher Abaza, the minister of electricity and energy, sounded the
alarm almost a year ago, cautioning against increased consumption
and waste of electricity and water.
   Consumption continued to climb, however, and official figures
indicate that at least 45 percent of Cairo's share of the Nile
waters is wasted by negligence and the city's outmoded water system.
   Current predictions hold that the water level at the dam will
decrease to 495 feet above sea level by July, Abaza said in a
recent interview.
   ``That will mean that the dam will be able to work only at half
capacity, producing 900 megawatts,'' Abaza said. ``If the level
goes under 147 meters (485 feet), ... production of the high dam
will be zero.''
   He added that generating plants are producing electricity as
fast as they can now just to keep up with an ever-increasing demand.
   Much of the increase in demand has been in the countryside,
where peasants returning from well-paying jobs in Saudi Arabian oil
regions have come home with electric fans, ovens and television
sets.
   Mubarak said in his TV address that if high-dam generation
stops, the government will have to keep factories working by
cutting off power to some of the country's 5,000 villages.
   Egypt's 54 million people use 45 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity, increasing by up to 20 percent a year. Figures
indicate that the steady increase is due to what Egyptians regard
as luxury items, such as air conditioners and color television sets.
   ``Egyptians open their taps and find water, and switch on the
light and everything lights up, and they think that it is easy and
will remain that way,'' said Abaza.
   ``But they have to start cooperating and curbing their
consumption or there are going to be serious consequences.''

<HEAD>200,000 Volunteer To Watch Presidential Balloting in Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a little financial help from abroad
and a lot of enthusiasm from 200,000 volunteers, opponents of
Chile's military government have launched a campaign they say will
keep fraud out of this year's presidential election.
   Ten opposition parties, from left to right, have united in the
campaign of door-to-door voter education, poll-watching on election
day and independent vote counting afterward.
   Leaders of the National Election Command for Democracy maintain
that the system is necessary because they believe fraud tipped a
1980 plebiscite to approve a government-drafted constitution.
   Genaro Arriagada, secretary general of the command, said the
1980 plebiscite, in which the government received 67 percent of the
vote, ``lacked the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee any
honest election.''
   That vote took place without voter registries, because the old
ones had been destroyed by the military shortly after they seized
power in 1973. Polling stations were manned only by
government-appointed officials, without any opposition or
independent supervision.
   Arriagada said a national census taken two years after the vote
showed that in several cities the number of people who voted in the
plebiscite was higher than the number of residents in the cities.
   The government has denied accusations of fraud.
   ``The upcoming presidential plebiscite will be very different,''
Arriagada said. He said voter registries now have reopened, ``and
this time we have the capacity to guarantee a clean vote.''
   In the plebiscite scheduled for an unspecified date later this
year, Chileans will be able to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on a single,
military-appointed candidate for the 1989-97 presidential term. If
the candidate is rejected by voters, a competitive election will
take place a year later.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the 73-year-old army commander who
has ruled since 1973, is considered the most likely candidate.
   Ricardo Lagos, leader of the Socialist Party and a key member of
the National Election Command, said 700 specialists are training
the 200,000 volunteers throughout the country to work as
poll-watchers on election day.
   He added in an interview that the opposition will be able to
have three to five monitors at each of the 20,000 or so voting
places.
   ``We can guarantee to every citizen that his vote will be
properly accounted for, and that it will remain secret,'' Lagos
said.
   Some volunteers have already visited hundreds of thousands of
voters in the door-to-door campaign to ``explain to them that this
time the vote will be totally clean,'' he said.
   Lagos added that part of the financing for the campaign has come
``from groups abroad interested in the restoration of democracy in
Chile.''
   He said the cost is relatively low, however. He estimated his
Socialist Party will spend the equivalent of around $100,000.
   Lagos did no identify the foreign groups sending money, but the
National Endowment for Democracy of the United States and several
West European foundations, especially in West Germany, Italy and
Sweden, have been officially reported in the past as granting
financial aid to Chilean democratic dissident groups.
   The National Election Command also has organized a nationwide
computerized vote-counting system to operate independently of the
government system.
   Eduardo Arriagada, an engineer in charge of the Vote Counting
Center said ``we will be able to quickly deliver a projection of
the vote and complete returns.''
   Eric Campana, a leading electoral expert of the Christian
Democratic Party, the largest in the opposition, said, ``The system
we are implementing fully guarantees a clean vote. There will be no
fraud this time. Chileans can rest assured of that.''
   Campana said volunteers trained as poll-monitors show ``an
enormous enthusiasm.''
   ``Many of them are paying for their travel and other expenses
connected with the campaign out of their own pockets.''
   Juan Gabriel Valdes, who works at the Vote Counting Center,
said, however, old legislation granting the government emergency
powers could still be invoked.
   ``That legislation, for example, would allow the government to
prevent us from announcing the returns we will be gathering,''
Valdes said.
   That, said Lagos, is ``the only fraud possibility that remains
open.''

   Thirty-five years after security officers
first noticed that the Soviets were bombarding the U.S. embassy in
Moscow with microwave radiation, the U.S. government still has not
determined conclusively _ or is unwilling to reveal _ the purpose
behind the beams.
   Among the possible reasons put forward by experts: attempts by
the Soviets to trigger eavesdropping devices, to interfere with
U.S. intelligence-gathering operations or to affect the health,
minds or behavior of Americans working in the embassy.
   Low-power microwave signals ``continue to be detected'' at the
embassy, according to the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic
Security.
   However, the department has ceased special efforts to monitor
the health of U.S. personnel exposed to the mysterious Soviet beams.
   Over the years, several studies to investigate potential effects
of the Moscow radiation led to controversial results. In some
cases, the projects were terminated over the objections of
researchers.
   The United States has made a series of diplomatic protests to
the Kremlin over the microwave situation, beginning at least as
early as the Glassboro summit in June 1967.
   The Associated Press examined 5,000 pages of declassified
documents from the State Department, the Central Intelligence
Agency, and the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act and
interviewed dozens of current and former U.S. officials, scientific
researchers, medical specialists and attorneys.
   Many questions remain about the microwave bombardment, which has
involved a variety of transmitter sites, frequency ranges,
modulations and power levels over a time span stretching from just
after Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's death in 1953 to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's current reform drive.
   Nonetheless, these key facts emerge:
   _The Moscow microwaves affair has had broader implications in
several areas, including U.S.-Soviet political relations, research
into the biological effects of non-ionizing radiation, electronic
intelligence-gathering operations and employee-management relations
at the State Department.
   _The U.S. government apparently has succeeded in fighting back
lawsuits and administrative claims totalling about $250 million
brought by employees who were exposed to the Moscow radiation or
their dependents.
   _Some American scientists and medical specialists investigating
the problem have been seriously concerned about a possible Soviet
bloc lead in research on the use of radio-frequency and microwave
radiation for ``mind control'' and other weapons applications.
   _Significant questions remain over the validity of an
epidemiological study of Moscow embassy personnel carried out in
1976-78 by Johns Hopkins University under contract to the State
Department. The study found no adverse health effects among embassy
workers.
   _Shielding of the embassy against the Soviet beams was first
recommended 11 years before protective screening was finally
installed.
   _Certain U.S. personnel in Moscow apparently were exposed to
significant amounts of electromagnetic radiation from sources
within the embassy, posing the risk of possible ``synergistic''
effects from combined exposure to such radiation and the Soviet
microwaves.
   Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a
frequency range from 300 megahertz (300 million cycles per second)
up to 300 gigahertz (300 billion cycles per second). The main uses
of microwaves are in radar, UHF (ultra-high frequency) television,
long-distance telephone links, satellite communications, cooking,
medical treatment and a variety of industrial processes.
   The State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security said in a
recent statement that ``microwave signals ... continue to be
detected at the Moscow embassy chancery.'' It said the Soviet
signals cover a broad frequency range, from 5 to 11 gigahertz; are
``usually on for a couple of hours a day'' and typically have a
power level of 0.1 microwatt per square centimeter outside the
building.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said: ``We are, of course,
concerned about this situation. In the past, we've protested when
(microwave power) levels have exceeded those we consider safe.
We're prepared to do so again, should we determine that they pose
any threat whatsoever to our staff, however remote.''
   The declassified documents disclose that the bombardment of the
Moscow embassy drew expressions of serious concern in the mid-1970s
from two CIA directors _ William E. Colby and George Bush.
   They also reveal that this concern came years after experts had
initially recommended installing shielding to protect Americans
working inside the embassy from the radiation being beamed by the
Soviets.
   Eleven years passed between when scientific advisers proposed
shielding of the embassy and when the protective screening actually
was installed.
   In an April 3, 1965 memorandum, a CIA scientific consultant,
whose name was deleted from the document, called for ``selection of
suitable copper screening and mandatory coverage of all window
openings'' at the 10-story embassy.
   Installation of aluminum screening was finally started on Feb.
6, 1976 _ at the same time that special briefings were held to
inform embassy personnel about the microwave radiation, which until
then had been kept secret from all except a handful of senior
officials.
   Ten days later, the CIA's concern over the Moscow problem was
reflected in a ``Dear Larry'' letter from Bush to Lawrence S.
Eagleburger, deputy undersecretary of state for management.
   Bush wrote that while he had been told by a CIA expert that data
from biomedical research were insufficient to prove that the Soviet
beams posed a health hazard, ``the clinical evidence pertaining to
several embassy staff members, recently obtained by the State
(Department) Medical Services, makes it prudent in our judgment to
consider MUTS signal emanations as potentially hazardous.''
   ``MUTS'' was the code name for the Soviet beams.
   Colby's expression of concern, in a Nov. 26, 1975 letter to
Eagleburger, came five weeks after the Soviets put into operation a
second microwave transmitter _ code-named MUTS-2 _ atop a building
just south of the embassy. This was in addition to a microwave beam
_ known as MUTS or MUTS-1 _ aimed at the chancery from the roof of
an apartment building east of the embassy, across Tchaikovsky
Street.
   Colby wrote that ``the increased probability of health injuries
to personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow ... (CIA deletion) ...
warrant our immediate attention.''
   ``I have been briefed on the implication that the MUTS and
MUTS-2 signals are a possible cause of recent serious health
problems of the embassy,'' the CIA chief said.
   Colby told Eagleburger that Donald A. Myers, a CIA specialist on
biological and health effects of non-ionizing radiation, would be
available to assist the State Department in evaluating microwave
radiation levels in Moscow.
   Myers already had spent a week in Moscow in July 1975 working
with State Department security officers. He returned to the Soviet
capital for a 16-day visit in December 1975 to re-analyze the
situation in the wake of MUTS-2 going into operation.
   Three days after Myers arrived in Moscow, a CIA memorandum
summmarized Myers' initial observations: ``The CW (continuous wave)
signals which were active during October and then again since 30
November are a cause for increased concern, because the power
density of the emanations is often concentrated within one or
several narrow bandwidths at frequencies that can produce
undesirable biological effects.''
   ``Perhaps the most distressing observation is that the signal
composition and orientation continue to change, and that the
general trend of such change since July would appear to be in the
direction of an increased health risk,'' it said.

   The memorandum added: ``Since some recent health problems among
embassy staff appear similar to EMP (electromagnetic pulse)
researchers at Boeing, at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology), and possibly at the Naval Special Weapons Center,
comparison of details of exposure and later-occurring pathologies
appears warranted.''
   Health problems which have been reported among personnel working
with electromagnetic pulse equipment include an unusually high
incidence of brain tumors and liver diseases.
   A memorandum prepared by Myers following his 1975 visit to
Moscow said, ``Dr. Herbert Pollack, a State Department consulting
physician, has found that several members of the embassy display
symptoms that are non-specific but have been reported frequently in
patients chronically exposed to non-ionizing radiation.''
   Such symptoms include headaches, inability to concentrate and
fatigue, as well as physiological effects including shifts in the
ratios of various blood cells.
   Soviet intentions remain the foremost unanswered question
surrounding irradiation of the embassy.
   Attempts to figure out the purposes behind the microwave beams
have involved specialists at the State Department, CIA, Defense
Intelligence Agency, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and
National Security Agency.
   The difficulties posed by this task were reflected in a June 6,
1975 letter in which the CIA's Colby told Eagleburger at State:
``We hope that by working together State and CIA technical officers
can come up with satisfactory answers to this perennial enigma.''
   Three theories have been put forward as possible explanations:
   _The Soviets were trying to interfere with U.S. electronic
intelligence-gathering operations;
   _The microwaves were used to interact with Soviet eavesdropping
devices planted within the embassy;
   _Or the Soviets were trying to induce psychological, behavioral
or physiological effects among American personnel.
   Mark Garrison, who served as head of the State Department's
Soviet desk and then as the Moscow embassy's No. 2 official before
retiring in 1980, said in an interview, ``We never did really
figure out to my satisfaction what the purpose of the microwaves
was. I've got hunches about it, but there was no final, formal
finding that was passed down from the technicians.''
   ``It's extremely difficult for people running the political side
of the (U.S.-Soviet) relationship and the management side to get a
good handle on high-tech electronic stuff,'' said Garrison, now
director of Brown University's Center for Foreign Policy.
   Garrison leans toward the electronic jamming theory.
   However, that explanation has been challenged by Moscow veterans
familiar with the military-run electronic intelligence-gathering
operations.
   Retired Army Brig. Gen. R.E. Barber said he ``absolutely cannot
accept'' the jamming hypothesis because when he was in Moscow
during the mid-1960s the microwaves ``had no effect whatsoever on
our activities.''
   Samuel Koslov, a non-ionizing radiation specialist who has
helped investigate the radiation, believes the beams probably were
been intended to interact with Soviet listening devices.
   ``They (U.S. debugging specialists) still haven't satisfied
themselves that they've found all the devices that may have been
interacting with that signal. They may have found some of them, but
they certainly haven't found all of them,'' said Koslov, a
biophysicist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics
Laboratory in Laurel, Md.
   He added, however, that ``there could have been different
purposes at different times'' over the 35-year history of the
microwaves problem.
   Regarding possible anti-personnel uses of microwave radiation,
Koslov said, ``I wouldn't say that it is impossible to produce
psychological effects, but you would have to do it with very
different kinds of signals, much higher power than what you have
there.''
   Other American specialists involved in the investigations have
raised the ``mind control'' and weaponry possibilities.
   Among them was Richard S. Cesaro, who in the mid-1960s was
serving as deputy director for advanced sensors at the Pentagon's
Advanced Research Projects Agency. Cesaro helped run the classified
Pandora Project, in which monkeys were exposed to a ``synthetic
Moscow signal'' in a laboratory at Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research.
   Initially, Pandora researchers believed that the irradiation had
caused subtle behavioral effects in the test animals. By mid-1969
consideration was being given to expanding the project to include
human subjects. Later, however, re-analysis of the experimental
data raised doubts about its validity. A scientific review panel
decided in 1970 that the project should be disbanded.
   Nevertheless, Cesaro, in an interview prior to his death two
years ago, contended that ``in our experiments we did some
remarkable things. And there was no question in my mind that you
can get into the brain with microwaves.''
   Arguing that the Soviet bloc's investment of funds, personnel
and laboratory facilities in research on non-ionizing radiation
bioeffects has far outstripped the West's, he said, ``I look at it
as still a major, serious, unsettled threat to the security of the
United States.''
   ``If you really make the breakthrough, you've got something
better than any bomb ever built, because when you finally come down
the line you're talking about controlling people's minds,'' Cesaro
said.
   Another research effort whose results proved highly
controversial was the State Department's secret genetic testing
program, carried out from 1966 to 1969 under the cover name of the
``Moscow Viral Study.''
   This project involved taking blood samples from embassy
personnel exposed to the Soviet microwaves and from a control group
and analyzing the white blood cells for possible chromosomal damage.
   Those who were tested were not told the actual purpose, but
instead were given the cover story about checking for a viral
condition.
   By late 1968 concern about results of the cytogenetic testing
had mounted among senior officials privy to the findings, and the
university contractor, Dr. Cecil Jacobson, urged that the study be
continued and expanded. In mid-1969, however, the State Department
abruptly decided to terminate the study, after having test slides
re-examined by four outside consultants.
   Nicholas H. Steneck, a University of Michigan history professor
and author of a book, ``The Microwave Debate,'' said the
cytogenetic testing program ``was set aside on the shoddiest and
shakiest of grounds.''
   ``At the very least there was scientific ambiguity, because
there were some researchers who said the techniques were very good
and that they did see effects,'' Steneck said. ``If nothing else,
on the basis of that you do a follow-up study _ you don't just
crank it down.''
   Asked about Steneck's remarks, Dr. Charles E. Brodine, State
Department assistant medical director for environmental health and
preventive medicine, said he had not been with the department at
the time of the genetic testing program and would prefer not to
comment.
   Government officials and outside experts say one of the biggest
lessons learned from the microwave problem was that it was a
mistake to keep the radiation secret from most employees until
February 1976, when the State Department began briefing current,
former and prospective Moscow personnel.
   ``The main lesson is to be upfront with employees about things
that they might consider to affect their health and well-being,''
said Garrison, the former State Department official.

   Koslov was stronger in his criticism of the secrecy. ``I think
it was handled very badly. There was no reason why they couldn't
have informed the embassy personnel early on. ... The lesson
learned is to treat your people as though they have some
intelligence.''
   After the radiation problem became publicly known in 1976, the
State Department denied press reports _ including a story in the
Soviet government newspaper Izvestia _ that the problem was
exacerbated by radio-frequency and microwave emissions from U.S.
equipment.
   But a Dec. 5, 1975 CIA memorandum dealing with the Soviet beams
said: ``Some embassy staff members probably have received much
larger exposures of electromagnetic radiation due to leakage in
coaxial cable shields for cables running through the embassy
interior from transmitters to antennas. This problem may not be
limited to the embassy in Moscow.''
   In other documents, the CIA's Donald Myers also expressed
concern over high-frequency radio radiation induced in telephone
and other wiring leading into the ambassador's ninth-floor office,
due to spillover from a miniloop antenna mounted outside.
   The antenna was subsequently moved to a different location on
the embassy roof.
   Paul Brodeur, author of ``The Zapping of America,'' a book
dealing with the Moscow embassy affair and other cases of microwave
exposure, said he had been told by intelligence sources, whom he
declined to identify, that ``there was always a question whether
our own electronic countermeasures within the embassy were
responsible for some of the irradiation of the employees.''
   ``A good many of the biological-medical problems at the embassy
may well have been caused by our own efforts to jam the low-level
incoming Russian signals,'' Brodeur said.
   The belated disclosure of the microwave bombardment prompted a
series of administrative claims and lawsuits against the U.S.
government by employees and dependents who alleged that they had
suffered health injuries because of exposure to the Moscow beams.
   To help defend itself against such legal actions, the State
Department in 1976-78 funded a $1 million epidemiological study of
Moscow embassy personnel, carried out under contract by the Johns
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.
   Dr. Pollack, the State Department medical consultant, said that
``without that Hopkins study, State would be sitting in the soup,
because there were about $250 million in tort actions on the books.
And every one of those has been withdrawn without a penny being
paid.''
   ``There were about 100 some-odd actions,'' Pollack said.
   A Virginia woman whose son was born with spina bifida, a serious
birth defect, declined to comment in detail on the status of an
administrative claim she brought against the State Department in
1977.
   The woman, who asked that her name not be used, said regarding
the possibility that her son's birth defect may have been linked to
microwave exposure in Moscow: ``The only thing I can say is that
it's impossible to know. ... There's no way we'll ever, ever know.
That's the one thing I have learned.''
   Another case involved a $1.75 million suit brought against the
government on behalf of a boy born in 1973 with severe
hydrocephalus, a birth defect of the brain and central nervous
system. The boy's father had served in Moscow as a Marine security
guard.
   Peter A. Danelo, a Seattle attorney, said the suit brought in
federal court in Los Angeles alleged injury due to microwave
radiation as well as medical malpractice at Navy hospitals.
   The microwave part of the suit was dismissed by the trial court.
The court cited what is known as the Feres doctrine, under which
the federal government cannot be held liable for injuries suffered
by active-duty military personnel _ or, in this case, for a child's
physical injuries derived from his father's active-duty injury.
   Danelo said the malpractice part of the case also proved
unsuccessful.
   H. Rowan Gaither, an official at the State Department's Office
of the Legal Adviser, said, ``we had a group of Moscow microwave
files and they were all retired because they were not being
actively pursued.''
   He said he was unable to confirm Pollack's figures on the total
number and dollar amount of the claims because the files have been
sent to a federal records storage center in St. Louis.
   The Johns Hopkins epidemiological study, released in November
1978, concluded that ``no convincing evidence was discovered that
would directly implicate the exposure to microwave radiation by the
employees at the Moscow embassy in the causation of any adverse
health effects as of the time of this analysis.''
   Critics of the study, however, have voiced concern over the use
of employees and dependents from U.S. embassies and consulates in
Eastern Europe as a control group for comparison to the health
experience of Moscow embassy personnel.
   A confidential draft version of the study report itself noted
that some of the members of the control group could have been
exposed ``to microwave surveillance.''
   ``This was of concern, especially since several participants in
the study informed us that there indeed was surveillance using
microwave technology at some of the comparison posts,'' the draft
document said.
   This section was deleted in the final version of the report.
According to the minutes of an Oct. 17, 1978 meeting of Dr. Pollack
with members of the study staff, it was deleted because it was
``really heresay.''
   At the recommendation of the health study team, the State
Department contracted with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory for preparation of a retrospective technical analysis of
the complex microwave radiation fields monitored within the Moscow
embassy.
   The findings of this technical analysis were evaluated by the
Electromagnetic Radiation Management Advisory Council, known as
ERMAC, a now-defunct scientific panel that operated under the aegis
of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and
Information Administration.
   In June 1981, a report issued by NTIA said the 14-member
advisory panel ``agreed that there is no scientific evidence, nor
are there any theoretical grounds to suggest that biological
effects would be expected to occur from the type and low levels of
exposure presented. Consequently, ERMAC concluded that no
deleterious biological effects to personnel would be anticipated
from the microwave exposures at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.''
   However, several experts on non-ionizing radiation say they
believe the State Department and ERMAC may well have jumped to
scientifically unwarranted conclusions in seeking to rule out
possible health effects on personnel exposed to the Moscow
radiation.
   Among them is the University of Michigan's Steneck, who cited a
variety of studies that have been done over the past few years _
since the 1976-78 Johns Hopkins epidemiological survey _ finding
significant effects at very low radiation power levels.
   ``I can see no reason why I would rest easier today than I would
have 10 years ago,'' he said. `` ... As we learn more and more
about the ways in which this radiation can interact with the body,
we find that there are more subtle ways than we initially
suspected.''

   Here is a chronology, from public records,
declassified documents and interviews, of major developments
concerning the Soviet microwave bombardment of the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow:
   October 1953: Embassy security officers initially detect
intermittent Soviet-source microwave transmissions.
   Late 1962-early 1963: Electronic measurements confirm that the
signal, code-named TUMS (Technically Unidentified Moscow Signal),
is a directional microwave beam aimed at the back of the embassy
from a fifth-floor window of an apartment building 100 yards to the
west. TUMS is a mix of frequencies ranging from 2.5 to 4.1 GHz
(gigahertz) and operates at typical maximum power levels of 1 to 3
microwatts per square centimeter.
   April 4, 1965: The State Department asks doctors at the Naval
Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., to conduct special eye examinations
and electroencephalogram tests on personnel departing for and
returning from Moscow.
   April 16, 1965: The U.S. Intelligence Board Technical
Surveillance Countermeasures Committee meets to discuss the
microwave problem. It requests all member agencies to review
medical records of personnel assigned to Moscow since 1953 for
``possible clinical changes'' that may be linked with exposure to
the radiation.
   March 29, 1966: The State Department signs a contract with
George Washington University for cytogenetic testing of blood
samples from Moscow and control group personnel. The program is
conducted under the cover story of a ``Moscow Viral Study.''
   June 23-25, 1967: Secretary of State Dean Rusk lodges a protest
over the Moscow radiation with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko during a summit meeting in Glassboro, N.J.
   Dec. 20, 1968: A scientific review panel begins to evaluate
results from the Pandora Project, a secret research effort
involving irradiation of monkeys with a ``synthetic Moscow signal.''
   April 21, 1969: The Pandora review panel recommends that the
experimental program be expanded to include testing of human
volunteers exposed to low-level microwaves for six to eight months.
   June 27, 1969: The State Department decides to terminate the
cytogenetic testing program, on the grounds that the test results
were not confirmed by outside medical specialists.
   Jan. 12, 1970: The Pandora review panel recommends that the
research project, conducted primarily at Walter Reed Army Institute
of Research, be phased out because re-evaluation of the
experimental data showed ``no clear and strong effects.''
   March 1972: Another signal, code-named SMUT, goes on the air at
power levels of less than 1 microwatt and operates intermittently
until June 1975. With frequencies of 3.2 to 3.7 GHz, it is beamed
from a transmitter about one-half mile northeast of the embassy.
   May 26, 1975: TUMS ceases operation.
   May 28, 1975: A Soviet signal code-named MUTS-1 begins daily
operation from a transmitter on the roof of an apartment building
80 yards east of the embassy. It is a complex, broadband signal
with frequencies in the range of 0.6 to 9.6 GHz and typical maximum
power levels of 10 to 12 microwatts.
   Oct. 16, 1975: Another microwave beam, dubbed MUTS-2, is
detected coming from the top of a building 80 yards south of the
embassy, with a frequency range comparable to MUTS-1 but lower
power levels of 1 to 2 microwatts. While TUMS had operated for
about five to eight hours a day, MUTS-1 and MUTS-2 are in operation
for up to 14 hours daily, with one or both the signals irradiating
the embassy for a total of 18 to 20 hours a day.
   Jan. 26-30, 1976: A team of U.S. experts meets with Soviet
officials in Moscow in an effort to persuade the Russians to cease
irradiating the embassy. The talks prove fruitless, with the
Soviets contending that the microwaves detected at the embassy are
simply background radiation from broadcast and industrial sources.
   Feb. 6, 1976: Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel begins a series of
classified briefings on the microwave problem for Moscow embassy
employees and dependents. Word of the briefings leaks to American
correspondents. Security officers and military personnel start
installing window screening to reduce penetration of the microwave
beams into the building.
   Feb. 12, 1976: Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger tells a
news conference that ``this issue is a matter of great delicacy
which has many ramifications.'' He declines to go into detail.
   Feb. 19, 1976: Members of the American Foreign Service
Association (AFSA), a union representing Foreign Service officers,
express concern over the problem and the State Department's failure
to brief personnel earlier.
   July 7, 1976: The State Department announces that the intensity
of the microwave radiation beamed at the embassy has been ``greatly
reduced,'' down to 2 microwatts per square centimeter outside the
building and a fraction of a microwatt inside. Also announced is
the signing of a contract with Johns Hopkins University for an
epidemiological study of personnel assigned to Moscow and other
posts in Eastern Europe.
   Jan. 4, 1977: A notice posted at the Moscow embassy discloses
that about one-third of individuals tested have shown abnormally
high white blood cell counts. It says the cause for this
lymphocytosis condition is unknown.
   Nov. 20, 1978: Results of the Johns Hopkins epidemiological
study are released and come under criticism by AFSA. In a report
with numerous caveats and limitations, the study team says ``no
convincing evidence'' was found that would directly link exposure
to microwave radiation in Moscow with adverse health effects.
   April 1979: The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation issues a report criticizing the State Department's
handling of the microwaves affair _ particularly its failure to
inform employees from 1953 to 1976.
   June 1981: A 14-member panel, the Electromagnetic Radiation
Management Advisory Council, concludes ``there is no scientific
evidence, nor are there any theoretical grounds to suggest that
biological effects would be expected to occur from the type and low
levels of exposure presented'' in Moscow.
   Nov. 10, 1983: Ambassador Arthur Hartman tells reporters in
Moscow that he made a protest to the Soviet Foreign Ministry over a
microwave beam aimed at the embassy between July 14 and Oct. 19,
with a power level of 2 microwatts.
   March 3, 1988: A statement released by the State Department's
Bureau of Diplomatic Security says that ``microwave signals in the
5-11 GHz range continue to be detected at the Moscow embassy
chancery.'' Typical power levels, it says, are 0.1 microwatt per
square centimeter outside the building and 0.01 microwatt inside.

   Public disclosure of the Moscow embassy
problem in the mid-1970s spurred a substantial increase of interest
among U.S. scientists in the controversial area of low-level
microwave biological effects.
   ``It had an enormous impact on the microwave research field,''
said Nicholas H. Steneck, a University of Michigan history
professor who spent six years studying the field for his book,
``The Microwave Debate.''
   For years, most American researchers had assumed that any
significant biological effects were thermal _ caused by heating of
body tissues. This viewpoint is reflected in the safety limit of
5,000 microwatts per square centimeter set in the current U.S.
voluntary guideline adopted by the American National Standards
Institute.
   The Soviet Union, however, has a much lower safety limit of only
10 microwatts, stemming from concern with subtle behavioral and
physiological changes as well as subjective symptoms which Soviet
researchers have reported with chronic exposure at low power levels.
   Over the past decade more U.S. scientists have started paying
serious attention to athermal effects, particularly effects on
brain tissue of low-intensity microwaves modulated at extremely low
frequencies.
   Since the early 1980s, however, federal government support for
non-ionizing radiation bioeffects research has declined markedly.
   W. Ross Adey, a leading researcher based at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Loma Linda, Calif., told a House
subcommittee last Oct. 6 that current levels of government funding
_ now about $7 million a year _ are ``disastrously low.''
   ``There is reason to believe that this situation has arisen in
part through a well-organized activity on the part of major
corporate entities from the consumer and military electronic
industries to discredit all research into athermal biological and
biomedical effects,'' Adey said.
   Also expressing strong concern over the funding cutback was
Janet Healer, a non-ionizing radiation specialist at the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, a unit of the
Commerce Department.
   ``Unfortunately, this well has dried up at a time when ... there
are some directions to follow that are very, very interesting,''
she said, adding: ``We're quitting at the wrong time.''
   Meanwhile, the Soviets continue to devote substantial and
expanding resources to their own research program.
   Louis Slesin, editor of Microwave News, a newsletter covering
the non-ionizing radiation research field, said that ``what is
clear is that Soviet researchers are extremely interested in the
effects of this kind of radiation.''
   ``Everybody who's come back after looking at (Soviet)
laboratories has been virtually green with jealousy on seeing what
the Russians have in terms of equipment, in terms of their budgets
and staff working in this area,'' Slesin said.

<HEAD>Milk Producers Seek New Solution to Production Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Milk Producers Federation says
dairy farmers have been squeezed enough by the administration's
price strategy to trim surplus production.
   It's time to try an alternative short-term remedy such as
another dairy termination program (DTP), or a diversion program, at
least until some basic changes in the dairy program can be worked
out with Congress, the federation says.
   A DTP could be designed to offer dairy farmers another chance of
selling all or part of their herds, thereby reducing U.S. milk
production. Or a diversion program could provide payments for
reductions in milk sold on the market.
   Both programs have been tried in recent years, but neither has
provided permanent solutions to the surplus problem. Indeed,
according to the Agriculture Department, milk production probably
will rise to another record level in 1988 after declining slightly
last year.
   Tom Camerlo, a Canon City, Colo., dairy farmer, is president of
the 72-year-old federation, which represents virtually all of the
nation's dairy farmer cooperatives and their members.
   ``Enough is enough,'' Camerlo said here last week. ``Dairy
farmers are tired of suffering continual price reductions after
having done more to address federal policy concerns than any
segment of U.S. agriculture.''
   Camerlo referred to a string of reductions in the national price
support level of milk since it rose to a peak of $13.10 per 100
pounds in 1983. In January, under a formula provided by the 1985
farm law, the support was reduced again by 50 cents to the current
level of $10.60 per hundredweight.
   The law also provides for an additional 50-cent cut to $10.10
next Jan. 1 if USDA again projects that it will have to buy the
equivalent of more than 5 billion pounds of surplus milk in 1989 to
prop up prices.
   If the surplus continues beyond next year, the law provides for
another 50-cent reduction to $9.60 on Jan. 1, 1990.
   Last year, when milk output was 142.5 billion pounds, the
department's Commodity Credit Corp. bought butter, cheese and
non-fat dry milk equivalent to more than 6.7 billion pounds of
milk. That was down dramatically from CCC purchases, or
``removals'' from the market in 1986 of 10.6 billion pounds out of
the year's production of 143.4 billion pounds.
   Milk production in 1988 is expected to rise 2 percent to 3
percent this year, according to USDA's revised estimates, and net
removals by CCC are expected to be in the range of 7 billion to 9
billion pounds, milk equivalent.
   Camerlo and other federation officials want to head off the
further reduction in milk supports on Jan. 1, 1989, by pressuring
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng to design an alternative,
which is also authorized by the 1985 farm law. And that could be
another DTP, also called a whole-herd buyout, or a diversion
program.
   In the past programs, dairy farmers were helped finance their
own payments through assessments on milk marketed. In the case of
the $1.8 billion in whole-herd buyout payments, for example, about
38 percent was provided by assessments.
   But Lyng has been steadfast in opposing another buyout or
diversion program, federation leaders say. Therefore, dairy farmers
are being asked to put pressure on members of Congress, as well as
on Lyng, to avoid the next 50-cent cut in supports.
   One of the arguments used by the federation is that part of the
recent slide in dairy supports has been accompanied by an easing of
production costs, mainly lower feed prices. But now, with grain
exports and the economy rebounding, costs are going up again.
   Thus, the federation says it makes sense to put brakes on the
slide in milk supports, or else see thousands of dairy farmers hurt
economically.
   According to USDA economists, the price of ``manufacturing''
milk used to make butter, cheese and other products averaged $12.27
per hundredweight in the first three months of 1988, down 63 cents
from a year ago.
   The department's Economic Research Service said in a new outlook
report that milk prices paid to farmers ``probably will remain
below a year earlier and average 5 percent to 7 percent lower for
all of 1988.''
   But the report also noted that the average value of dairy feed,
or concentrate, was $7.09 per 100 pounds as of April 1, up about 40
cents from a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, the cow ration value may average 25 to 45 cents
higher than last year's $6.75 per hundredweight, the report said.
   Alfalfa hay prices also are higher, averaging $69 per ton at the
farm in the first quarter, compared with $61 a year ago.
   Meanwhile, consumer prices of dairy products ``continue to show
smaller year-to-year increases'' than the government's all-food or
all-item index of retail prices, the report said. Dairy prices will
probably decline through midyear, followed by some seasonal
increase in the second half.

   The banks, pressured by increased costs of borrowing money
themselves, raised their prime lending rates Wednesday to 9 percent

   Unleaded gasoline futures prices have moved
higher in a mixed market, following a report showing heavy stock
drawdowns last week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June contracts for
wholesale unleaded gasoline closed up 0.63 cent at 52.25 cents per
gallon Wednesday, while June wholesale heating oil dropped 0.28
cent to 47.46 cents per gallon.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude grade, closed at $17.49 per barrel, up 3 cents from
Tuesday's close.
   Trading was extremely light, said Peter Beutel, assistant
director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. He said many
traders were reluctant to get too involved in the market until the
June 7 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The cartel scheduled the meeting after failing several weeks ago
to reach agreement on a proposal by several major non-OPEC
producers for joint production cuts.
   Unleaded gasoline moved strongly higher because of weekly
statistics issued late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute,
a Washington-based trade organization, Beutel said.
   The figures showed domestic gasoline production dropping by a
half-million barrels, inventories slipping by 3 million barrels and
imports dropping by 344,000 barrels in the week ended Friday.
   The shrinkage of supplies encouraged traders to buy in
anticipation that shorter supplies might lead to higher prices,
Beutel said.

<HEAD>Tisch Says Goal Is Making CBS a Ratings Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief executive of CBS Inc. says the company
is trying to come up with programming that will regain the CBS
Television network's leadership of the prime time audience ratings.
   But Laurence A. Tisch was criticized Wednesday by some
shareholders, one of whom said Tisch had destroyed a company that
was the ``class of the industry'' by selling off several of its
major businesses.
   Tisch responded by telling the company's stockholders at their
annual meeting that the recent sales of the CBS magazine and music
businesses had produced ``excellent returns'' and allowed the
company to focus on its core broadcasting business.
   Tisch also said he was looking for opportunities to use some of
CBS' $3 billion cash hoard to buy television or radio stations.
   CBS has four TV stations that cover about 20 percent of the
country and, under federal rules, can buy additional stations
extending that coverage up to 25 percent.
   Tisch also repeated earlier assertions that neither the CBS
television network nor Loews Corp.'s 24.9 percent stake in the
company were for sale. In addition to heading CBS, Tisch is
chairman of Loews, which has interests in insurance, tobacco and
hotels.
   He said CBS had no plans to sell its New York headquarters
building, nicknamed Black Rock, a move that had been rumored for
weeks.
   Since the last shareholders meeting, CBS sold its magazine group
for $650 million and its CBS records operation for $2 billion. The
CBS television network finished in third place in prime time
ratings for the first time during the season that just ended.
   Tisch noted that asset sales had boosted the company's capital
and that net interest income reached $51.7 million in the first
quarter in contrast to net interest expense of $9.3 million in the
same period of 1987.
   But Ralph Colin Jr., a longtime CBS shareholder and an executive
with the Columbia House division that was sold as part of the CBS
records group sale, told Tisch he seemed more interested in
``running a closed-end mutual fund with the revenues derived from
CBS assets'' than in broadcasting.
   He said the asset sales might have pleased Wall Street, but had
demoralized remaining CBS employees and ``effectively destroyed
something that was very near and dear to many of us _ a once great
company, a company that many considered to be the gem, the class of
the industry.''
   Colin is among a group of CBS records executives who have sued
CBS, claiming they were wrongfully denied more than $1 million in
bonuses for 1987.
   While Tisch did not comment directly on Colin's statement, he
said later in the 2{-hour meeting that the network had some
``exciting new programs'' for the next TV season and that employee
morale was ``very high.''
   ``We are ready to take on the world in the battle to regain the
No. 1 position,'' he said.
   William S. Paley, CBS chairman, didn't attend the meeting, but
sent remarks in which he said he had reviewed the pilots for next
season and found them ``imaginative and exciting. I believe that
they represent the first step in our recovery of our premier
position in the industry.''
   Assessing the outlook for broadcast advertising, Tisch said the
first half of 1988 has ``not proved to be as strong as originally
estimated, and the industry outlook for the third quarter is less
optimistic than anticipated.''
   He said this and the delay in the start of the fall television
season due to the Writers Guild strike made it impossible to
estimate CBS earnings for the year. But he added the company did
not anticipate a severe drop in profit.

<TEXT>
   Computers and robotics that slash the
time it takes to make a sailboat mast have helped a Charlotte
company become the world's largest automated maker of aluminum
masts.
   Isomat U.S. Inc., has reduced mast production time for the
average 35-foot sloop-rigged sailboat by nearly 90 percent _ from
75 hours to about eight _ says Mike Vaught, general manager of
Isomat's Charlotte plant.
   The company is a subsidiary of International Marine Industries,
Inc., which through its Sparcraft unit supplied the masts for the
12-meter contenders in the last America's Cup yacht challenge,
including the Stars and Stripes and Australia's Kookaburra II.
   Since opening three years ago, the Charlotte plant, which
employs about 50 people, has captured about 70 percent of the U.S.
market and 85 percent of the Canadian market, company officials
said.
   Isomat U.S. manufactures 15 to 20 aluminum masts per day with
its unique automated system.
   ``We're set up to run 30 a day,'' said Vaught. ``Most shops
can't do that many in a month.''
   Isomat U.S. had about $3 million in sales last year. Its masts
range in price from about $600 to $4,000, depending on the size and
options.
   ``Ninety-nine percent of our business is with boat builders, who
are as price-conscious as anybody,'' Vaught said during a recent
tour of the facility.
   Isomat officials don't anticipate a time when all sailboat masts
will be manufactured by an automated system. Some sailboat builders
manufacture their own masts and other ``Mom and Pop'' companies
will continue to sell enough masts to stay in business.
   Another IMI subsidiary _ Kenyon Marine _ sells between 80 and
100 masts a month, although its masts take five times as long to
manufacture and therefore are more expensive, Vaught said.
   IMI recently moved its Kenyon operations from Connecticut to
Charlotte to take advantage of some of Isomat's automated processes.
   ``They (Kenyon) are after a different market,'' Vaught said.
``There are people who spend $40,000 on a 40-foot sailboat, and
people who spend $140,000.''
   Isomat engineers, designs, finishes and assembles sailing
systems with extrusions produced in New York and aluminum castings
shipped in by its sister facility in France. Using its automated
system, the company can handle custom orders from about 40
different boat builders, Vaught said.
   Isomat uses computer-assisted machines to taper the masts and to
cut them for attachment of the various fittings and other hardware.
Sailboat masts are tapered at the top to reduce weight and minimize
air turbulence.
   After tapering, the mast is coated with a special anodizing film
to prevent abrasion and corrosion in the marine environment.
   ``The biggest advantage aluminum has over wood is that it
doesn't rot,'' Vaught said. ``This process adds 10 years to the
life of an aluminum mast.''
   To treat the long masts, Isomat designed its own tanks. The 11
tanks are 70 feet long and capable of coating masts up to 69 feet
long. Vaught said the company also can finish items such as light
and flag poles, stadium seating, and other architectural components.
   The system was designed with production and flexibilty in mind
because the market for sailboats is widely varied.
   ``There's a lot of custom-ordering and we have to be able to
supply it,'' Vaught said.

<HEAD>Toronto Market Weathers Drop, Seeks New Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Still trying to rebound from October's world
stock market crash, the Toronto Stock Exchange has set its sights
on grabbing business from U.S. markets.
   Exchange officials hope their advanced automated trading system,
which has been licensed to several foreign exchanges, proves a key
advantage in luring Canadian companies that now trade primarily in
the United States.
   The exchange, which lists 1,600 stocks and accounts for 77
percent of Canadian trading, got a jolt on Wednesday when share
prices tumbled in the biggest one-day decline in four months,
raising fears of an impending economic recession.
   The exchange's 300 stock composite index closed down 63.82
points at 3,228.68 on Wednesday, the largest drop since a 118-point
tumble on Jan. 8.
   The drop, which mirrored a sharp decline on Wall Street caused
by rising interest rates and recessionary jitters, was the latest
setback for a market where activity has slackened significantly
since the Oct. 19 crash. Since then, the number of investors has
declined by 10 percent and the dollar value of trading has dropped
41 percent.
   In light of that trend and the increasingly global nature of
securities trading, the agenda for exchange President Pearce
Bunting and other officials is to use their market's technological
assets to drum up business.
   The Toronto Exchange almost exclusively lists Canadian
companies, but about 55 major players trade the bulk of their
shares on the New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange.
   Bunting plans to promote his exchange via the Computer Assisted
Trading System, known as CATS, that it pioneered and now licenses
to the Paris, Brussels and Madrid stock exchanges.
   ``We will set up an electronic central order book system,'' he
said. ``All bids and offers will meet electronically in the middle.
In the end, you can envisage thousands of terminals around the
world that would be connected with our system.
   ``It will give us the opportunity to be one step up on New
York.''
   The push for more business comes with the the October crash
still fresh on the minds of local traders, especially during
Wednesday's decline.
   ``There's a lot of nervousness out there and investors will jump
on any bit of information,'' said analyst Laird Grantham of the
firm Davidson Partners. ``They're worried about a recession.''
   Canada led major developed countries last year with real growth
of 3.9 percent. The strong economy, and the Bank of Canada's policy
of maintaining a 2.5 to 3 percentage point interest rate spread
over rates in the United States, helped boost the Canadian dollar
to an exchange rate of 81 U.S. cents from 69 cents since 1986.
   But government figures for January and February showed growth
and job creation at a standstill.
   In six weeks, the leaders of the Group of Seven countries and
the European Economic Community will gather in Toronto for an
economic summit to discuss how to avert another market crash and
recession.
   But with President Ronald Reagan in his final months in office,
local traders were not confident the summit would tackle what they
see as the epicenter of economic unrest: the huge U.S. budget and
trade deficits.
   Don Bainbridge, an equity trader for Gordon Capital Corp., one
of 75 members on the exchange, also said: ``Historically, after
every American presidential election the market goes down for two
years.''

   Procter & Gamble Co. proposes to paper
posteriors with pastel Pampers.
   The consumer products company said Wednesday it plans to
market-test blue disposable diapers for boys and pink ones for
girls in several states to see if parents prefer the colored
versions on their children.
   The diapers, which actually will bear the Luvs Deluxe brand
name, include extra padding in the front for boys diapers and in
the middle for the girls version, as part of a patented system
aimed at better absorption, P&G spokeswoman Carol Boyd said
Wednesday.
   The idea to add color came from parents' suggestions to the
company.
   ``It was a fashion decision,'' she said. ``Parents told us
that's what they wanted.''
   Ms. Boyd said she believed at least one other company has tried
colored diapers, but this was the first time for Procter & Gamble.
   The diapers will be market tested in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri,
Arkansas and Evansville, Ind., before the company decides whether
to sell them nationally, Ms. Boyd said.
   Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble is fighting Kimberly-Clark
Corp., of Dallas, for the lead in disposable diaper sales. P&G held
two-thirds of the $3 billion U.S. retail market at the start of the
decade, but its Pampers brand slipped behind Kimberly-Clark's
Huggies in 1985. Good sales by the Luvs brand helped P&G maintain
the overall lead.
   P&G had recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with
aggressive marketing and product changes.
   Procter & Gamble had overall sales of $17 billion in fiscal
1986-87. It makes and markets laundry and cleaning products,
personal care products, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage
products, and other items for business and industry.

   Prime Computer Inc. is laying off about 700
employees because of job redundancies and attrition following its
February acquisition by Computervision Inc., the company has
announced.
   The reduction amounts to about 5 percent of Prime's worldwide
workforce of 13,500, the company said Wednesday in a prepared
statement. The layoffs will occur over the rest of the year.
   Prime attributed the layoffs to the conclusion of its
integration with Computervision, including a new management
structure, new product strategies and excess production capacity.
   Prime jumped to second place in the computer-aided design and
computer-aided manufacturing market behind International Business
Machines Corp. after its merger with Computervision.
   The company reported first quarter net income of $14.5 million
on revenue of $363.7 million, including Computervision operations.
   Prime reported a profit of $64.8 million last year, a 38 percent
increase over 1986, on revenue of $960.9 million.

<HEAD>USG Appears to Win Proxy Battle, But Takeover War May Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. appears to have the won the proxy
battle, but Desert Partners L.P. isn't ready to concede the
takeover war.
   ``We believe our slate has been elected,'' USG Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Robert Day said Wednesday, claiming
shareholders had supported a management-backed slate over a rival
one supporting Desert Partners' hostile takeover bid.
   The vote for six seats on the Chicago-based company's 15-member
board of directors was seen as a turning point in the nearly
eight-month battle for control of USG, a building-materials
producer.
   Official results won't be announced until May 20. But Day told
reporters after the annual shareholders meeting that proxies
received before the close of balloting indicated the
management-backed slate would get more than 50 percent of the votes.
   The proxy battle pitted a slate led by Desert Partners' two main
investors, Texas oilmen Jack E. Brown and Cyrus Wagner Jr., against
the USG slate that included three members of the current management.
   ``We're going to continue to pursue our acquisition,'' said Joel
L. Reed, Desert Partners' chief financial officer, maintaining it
was too early to predict the election's outcome.
   Day said the vote reflects ``stockholder confidence in
management's ability,'' adding that USG would not pay out any
``greenmail'' to the Midland, Texas-based investment group.
   Greenmail is a premium price paid by a company for the stock of
a would-be acquirer that is not offered to other shareholders.
   Some investment analysts have predicted Desert Partners might
start selling off its nearly 10 percent stake in USG if it
decisively lost the proxy battle. But Reed said, ``We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.''
   In the takeover battle marked by lawsuits on both sides, USG
executives have contended Desert Partners launched its bid only to
recoup losses in their USG holdings following October's stock
market crash.
   ``We've thought all along that Desert Partners wanted to recover
the investment they made at a bad time,'' Day said.
   Desert Partners has accused USG executives of trying to entrench
themselves with a ``poison-pill'' defense designed to hinder the
takeover bid.
   Earlier this month, USG announced a defensive recapitalization
plan and business restructuring plan to counter the Texans' offer.
   The USG plan, to be submitted to a shareholders' vote June 24,
will pay stock owners $37 in cash, debentures with a face value of
$5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each
of the 51.5 million common shares. The company would sell off two
subsidiaries to finance the deal.
   In March, Desert Partners offered $42 per share in a hostile
tender offer for 39 million USG shares, or a 76 percent stake in
the company. That bid has a value of about $2.2 billion and remains
in effect.
   Desert Partners subsequently indicated it was willing to pay $45
per share, and Reed told the shareholders' meeting the Texans might
be willing to pay up to $50 a share.
   USG stock, which dropped below $30 per share after the market
crash, is currently selling in the $44-$46 per-share range.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced it has formed a new
company, Del Monte Foods, to combine the operations of its
worldwide Del Monte operations and other portions of Nabisco Brands
Inc.
   The new company will be headquartered in Coral Gables, Fla., and
will stand as a separate major operating unit of RJR Nabisco, the
Atlanta-based consumer products giant said Wednesday..
   RJR Nabisco Vice Chairman Robert J. Carbonell, who is also
chairman of the American Trade Consortium, will serve as chairman
and chief executive officer of Del Monte Foods.
   ``Through Del Monte Foods, RJR Nabisco will be positioned to
fully leverage the value of the Del Monte name as a global brand,
covering both fresh fruit and processed fruits and vegetables,''
Carbonell said.
   The consolidation also will allow the company to increase its
presence in Latin American countries, he said..
   Del Monte Foods will provide management for four operating
divisions: Del Monte Tropical Fruit Company; Del Monte Foods USA;
Del Monte Foods Latin America; and Del Monte Foods Europe.
   The operations of the combined division had 1987 sales of about
$2.5 billion and net income of about $1.3 million.
   Del Monte Foods' worldwide operations include food processing
facilities in the United Sates, central and South America, the
United Kingdom, Europe and Africa. Del Monte Tropical Fruit has
production operations in Cameroon, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Hawaii,
Kenya and the Philippines.

<HEAD>Casey Says `Workout Bank' Will Be Used In Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First RepublicBank Chairman Albert V. Casey said
he does not plan to remain at the troubled holding company after
its restructuring begins, and said a search for his replacement has
already begun.
   Casey said Wednesday one of the candidates for the chairmanship
is RepublicBank President Joseph R. Musolino, who is not seeking
re-election to the board of directors at the company's annual
meeting next month.
   The company's restructuring is not likely to be completed before
a review of First Republic's loan portfolio is finished in late
June.
   He also said the Dallas-based bank holding company, Texas
largest, hopes to present a restructuring plan by mid-July that
will include creation of a ``workout bank'' containing troubled
loans.
   In a meeting with reporters, Casey said officials believe the
$1.5 billion loss the bank holding company suffered in the first
quarter of this year should prevent any further huge writedowns.
   ``The big body blow is over,'' Casey said, while adding that the
company ``will continue with some loan losses.''
   First Republic is working with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to
establish the workout bank. That bank would be secured by junk
bonds sold to investors.
   The workout bank would repay notes from the disposition of its
holdings, and could include a mechanism that would allow investors
to share in an appreciation of real estate holdings from their
current market value.
   Casey's comments came a month after he took over from Gerald W.
Fronterhouse and almost two months after the company received a $1
billion cash infusion from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The chairman said the institution has heard two expressions of
interest from investors. The FDIC, which is handling other
inquiries, said it also has heard from several possible investors.
   First RepublicBank's asset base shrunk from $33.2 billion at the
end of 1987 to $28.4 billion as of March 31.
   Holders of First Republic's $1.3 billion in long-term debt will
likely settle for a fraction of face value in the form of new debt
that will be issued by the restructured company, Casey said.
   ``If you look at the balance sheet, (small holders) have been
wiped out,'' Casey said.
   First Republic, whose non-performing assets totaled $4.5 billion
as of March 31, has stopped making real estate loans ``even with
the biggest and the best in the real estate business,'' Casey said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were broadly higher, at the day's
best levels, at midday Thursday in what dealers called a technical
reaction to the previous day's abrupt drop.
   But trading volumes remained low. Other than a ``little dribbly
buying,'' most of the gains came from price mark-ups, a dealer
said. An absence of selling also underpinned prices, he said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 15.3
points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,772.1 at about 12:30 p.m. (1130 GMT).
The index fell 35.8 points on Wednesday.
   Volume was light at 191.1 million shares compared with 355.7
million at the same time Wednesday.
   The market also was helped by belated response to some some
favorable corporate earnings reports. Shares in some companies that
reported their results on Wednesday were initially unmoved amid
general market preoccupation with the near-term course of
international interest rates. But the results were reflected in
share prices on Thursday.
   Elsewhere, shares in Rowntree PLC fell 19 pence, or 36 cents, to
885 pence, or $16.64, below the effective price of 901.5 pence, or
$16.95, being offered by Nestle S.A. in a hostile takeover bid. It
was the first time the British confectioners' shares have fallen
below Nestle's offer price since the Swiss company launched its bid
last month.
   Dealers said the price decline reflected increased market
speculation that the bid could be investigated by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission, amid mounting political pressure for such
an inquiry.

<HEAD>Question of Corporate Responsibility May Be Decided in Wisconsin
Steel Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 11 years after its ill-fated sale of
Wisconsin Steel, Navistar International Corp. is being sued in a
case that could answer the far-reaching question of how much a
company can be obligated to pay retired and laid-off workers.
   Navistar is accused of selling the money-losing steel unit in
1977 to Envirodyne Inc. _ a Los Angeles-based engineering company
with no steel-making experience _ in a bid free itself of
multimillion-dollar pension payouts and other employee-benefit
obligations.
   In a trial scheduled to begin today before U.S. District Judge
James Moran, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal
insurer of pensions, is seeking $145 million _ $63 million in
unpaid benefits for the laid-off or retired steelworkers, plus
interest.
   In the second lawsuit, Wisconsin Steel creditors _ including an
Envirodyne unit, the EDC Holding Co. _ are seeking $177 million
from Navistar, charging fraud and racketeering in the 1977 sale of
the steel company.
   Navistar, known as International Harvester Co. in 1977, lent
Envirodyne $50 million to finance the $65 million acquisition of
Wisconsin Steel. Harvester's own investment bankers and lawyers had
cautioned against the sale.
   The trial's outcome could well determine whether _ and to what
extent _ the government and others can force corporations to honor
pension-plan obligations to workers.
   Navistar already has reached a $14.8 million out-of-court
settlement with 2,700 former employees of the steel company. The
workers had sought $86 million in claims for benefits lost when the
South Side Chicago steel mill was shuttered.
   The government and the workers filed lawsuits against Navistar
in 1981, little more than a year after Envirodyne, operating as EDC
Holding Co., filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court and
closed the plant.
   The filing came after EDC's key lenders, Navistar and the Chase
Manhattan Bank, called in collateral for past loans.
   EDC sued Navistar in 1982.
   The issue took on added significance last year when Dallas-based
LTV Corp. tried to unload $2.1 billion in pension obligations on
the federal government.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. already is stuck with $2
billion in underfunded pension liabilities from other companies,
and its responsibility could climb to $4 billion if it loses its
court battle with LTV.
   In its annual report, the federal pension insurer said ``a
company cannot escape financial responsibility for its pension
plans by transferring them to a weak third party that cannot
successfully continue the business or fund the pension plans.''

<HEAD>Griffin-Trump Deal For Resorts International Collapses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millionaire investors Merv Griffin and Donald
Trump resumed their battle over Resorts International Inc. after
the collapse of an agreement for Griffin to buy the hotel-casino
company Trump controls.
   The handshake deal, less than a month old, foundered Wednesday
amid a welter of accusations from Griffin and Trump, each blaming
the other.
   In a move recalling the bitter, month-long feud that preceded
the April 14 sale agreement, Griffin vowed to renew a $36-a-share
offer with the outside directors of the Atlantic City, N.J.-based
company.
   Trump responded that the one-time talk show host would never own
Resorts as long as he, Trump, retained control of 88 percent of the
voting shares.
   ``It's like going back to the day before Merv and Don shook
hands,'' Griffin spokesman Mark Gill said of the falling out.
   The failed agreement, which capped months of maneuvering by the
two high-profile businessmen, called for Griffin Co. to pay $207
million, or $36 a share, for publicly held Resorts stock. That
included all 5.7 million Class A shares and the 5.3 percent of
Class B shares that aren't held by Trump.
   It also called for Griffin to acquire Trump's Class B shares,
which give him 88 percent voting control of Resorts, and to sell
the massive, unfinished Taj Mahal casino back to Trump.
   Trump has refused to disclose the price offered for his stake in
Resorts, acquired last year from heirs of company founder James
Crosby for an amount estimated by analysts at $101 million.
   Trump's chief spokesman, Harvey I. Freeman, vice president of
Trump Organization, said Griffin had sought last-minute changes in
the agreement and had failed to prove he could obtain financing.
Freeman predicted failure for Griffin's new overtures to Resorts.
   ``Mr. Griffin can approach anyone that he wants to but it is Mr.
Trump's position that Mr. Griffin will be unable to purchase the
company in that way,'' Freeman said. ``Mr. Trump will resist any
action by Mr. Griffin in this regard.''
   In Los Angeles, Michael Nigris, president of Griffin Co.,
described his boss as ``surprised and disappointed that Donald
Trump was unwilling to proceed with the transaction.''
   ``Financing was never an issue in the negotiations,'' Nigris
said. ``Indeed, the impasse arose from Mr. Trump's refusal to abide
by the original terms of the deal and to accept the fact that the
existing Resorts hotel-casino would remain a viable competitor (to
the Taj Mahal).''
   The battle pits two of the nation's wealthiest entrepreneurs
against each other.
   Trump, who recently turned heads by offering to take over
repairs of a closed New York bridge from the city, is listed by
Forbes Magazine as worth at least $850 million.
   Griffin, 23-year host of the television talk show that bore his
name and creator of the hit game shows ``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' is listed as being worth $300 million.

<HEAD>IBM Introduces New Family of Wheelwriter Typewriters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE EMBRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. has
introduced a new line of high-performance products that allows
customers to turn their typewriters into modified word processors.
   The Wheelwriter Series II of four typewriters was unveiled
during a news conference Wednesday. IBM also presented an
entry-level Personal Wheelwriter, a new version of the Quietwriter
8 typewriter and two new ``Easystrike'' typewriter ribbons.
   ``It's a triumph of teamwork and technology,'' Charlie Rogers,
IBM's laboratory chief, said of the typewriters.
   The Wheelwriter 10, 30, 50 and 70 all include spelling aids
while the 50 and 70 have 25-line CRT display. They include options
to expand memory to 720,000 bytes with a diskette drive.
   They also allow customers to upgrade from one product in the
series to another by making relatively inexpensive additions as
they need them.
   The typewriters were developed and will be manufactured at IBM's
Lexington facility, said Kailash C. Joshi, site general manager.
   ``They are made in America and made in Kentucky,'' said Joshi,
adding that the products ``demonstrate IBM's commitment to the
typewriter.''
   The suggested retail prices for the typewriters range from $599
for the Personal Wheelwriter to $1,795 for the Wheelwriter 70.
   Wheelwriter 3 and 6 Series II are enhanced versions of earlier
models, with the main difference being the ability to upgrade to
30, 50 and 70 typewriters.
   He said during the past three years more than 1 million
Wheelwriters have been sold, indicating ``a strong customer demand
for office typewriters.''
   The 3, 6, 10 and 30 are on the market now, while the 70 will be
available in late May and the 50 in mid-June, the company said.

<HEAD>Report: Agreement To Keep Shoreham Closed Is Near</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HICKSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several ``agreements in principle'' that
would bring about the abandonment of the Shoreham nuclear plant
have been reached by the state and the Long Island Lighting Co., a
published report says.
   Under the agreements, which must be approved by Gov. Mario Cuomo
and LILCO, the state would gain control of Shoreham for $1 and shut
it down, marking the first time a completed nuclear plant would be
shut down before it began operating, the New York Times reported in
Thursday editions.
   LILCO has agreed to pay the estimated $400 million to $500
million costs of the shutdown, the newspaper said, quoting state
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Times said the agreements included guarantees to LILCO of
annual rate increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for the next decade
and the restoration of dividends to the company's shareholders
beginning in 1989.
   Also, LILCO would take a $2.5 billion tax write-off for the
plant, meaning it would pay no federal taxes for at least a decade,
the newspaper said.
   And the state would let the utility float $100 million in
tax-exempt industrial development bonds that could be used to
refinance more expensive debt, the Times reported.
   The $5.3 billion plant has been a rallying cry for opponents of
nuclear energy, politicians campaigning for office and the utility,
which contends the plant's energy was essential if the island was
to have enough energy into the next century.
   Although the plant was supported by state and local officials
when construction first began in the 1970s, opposition grew as
nuclear energy became less popular and more expensive and as the
completion of the plant fell behind 10 years and 10 times over
budget.
   State and local officials argued that Long Island could never be
quickly evacuated in an emergency and they refused to participate
in any emergency plans for the plant, located 55 miles east of New
York City.
   Meanwhile, the Long Island Power Authority, created to consider
a LILCO takeover, is continuing its proxy battle to elect three of
its nominees to LILCO's board of directors.

<HEAD>Electrolux Wants To Work With Murray Ohio Employees; Employees Say
`Nej'</HEAD>

   Although Sweden's AB Electrolux says it
wants good relations with Murray Ohio Manufacturing Corp.
employees, the workers plan to tell the king and queen of Sweden
they want no relations at all with Electrolux.
   Murray Ohio's directors have rejected a $182 million,
$48-a-share offer from Electrolux, a giant appliance manufacturer.
Murray Ohio, which makes lawn mowers and bicycles at Lawrenceburg,
Tenn., and is headquartered in Brentwood, Tenn.
   On Wednesday, Murray Ohio employees said they plan to send a
petition to the king and queen of Sweden opposing the takeover. The
petition will be signed by 5,000 residents of Lawrenceburg and will
accompany a letter to the president of Electrolux, Anders Sharp,
protesting the takeover effort, a spokesman said.
   The employees' news conference came a day after U.S. District
Judge Thomas A. Wiseman of Nashville refused to lift a temporary
restraining order suspending further action by Electrolux
concerning Murray.
   Meanwhile, Scharp issued a statement which said, in part,
``Electrolux has no plans whatever to close the Lawrenceburg
plant.''
   Scharp said Electrolux wants to own and operate the plant.
   ``We need a good relationship at Murray. We regret that the
understandable fears and concerns of Murray employees in this
situation appear to have been exploited,'' he said.
   However, Chuck Brewer, head of the employees' ``Just Say Nej''
committee, said committee members believe the takeover is a threat
to the Murray Ohio's 3,000 employees. ``Nej'' (pronounced ``nay'')
is Swedish for ``no.''
   A copy of the letter to Scharp in Stockholm was released at a
news conference, along with a copy of an advertisement that is to
appear in major U.S. newspapers and a Stockholm newspaper on May 13.
   The letter said, in part, ``We do not dislike you, your company
or the people of Sweden. ... Our relationship with Murray is that
of a family ... They've been exceptional as an employer, and
community leader and friend.''
   Among other things, the ads say, ``We've seen too many workers
lose their jobs, their identity and their self-respect as
independent firms fall prey to hostile outside interests. ... When
pushed, we can be hostile too.''
   Brewer said Wiseman's ruling was viewed as a victory, allowing
Murray more time to fight the takeover. Among other things, Wiseman
ordered the case moved from the state Chancery Court in
Lawrenceburg to his court in Nashville.
   Scharp says Electrolux is committed to purchasing Murray stock
even though it has run against initial roadblocks.
   Brewer released a list showing layoffs by Electrolux after
takeovers of plants in Grand Rapids, Greenville and Belding, Mich.;
Columbus, Ohio; Spain; Italy; Britain; and Ireland.
   As to whether there would be layoffs in Lawrenceburg, Brewer
said, ``It's an unknown. It scares everybody.''
   Bobbie Clark, who helped gather the signatures on the petition,
said, ``We like things like they are.''
   Brewer said the petition will be accompanied by a package
containing ``samples of Tennessee foods. That's the closest we want
them to get here.''
   The petition and package will be delivered today to Sen. James
Sasser, D-Tenn., in Washington, who will accompany employee leaders
to the Swedish embassy. Brewer said they will ask the ambassador to
deliver the petition ``to the king and queen of Sweden.''
   The proposed newspaper ad, signed ``The Working Men and Women of
Murray,'' also says in part, ``We will not stand by and see our
company, our economy and our values compromised. Because money may
buy our company's stock but not our loyalty.
   ``We, the workers of Murray, urge the management of AB
Electrolux to withdraw their bid immediately. Or we will never be
the same company again.''

<HEAD>Texas Will Appeal Federal Judge's Ruling On Florida Citrus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Department of Agriculture
will appeal a federal judge's ruling that blocks efforts to keep
fresh Florida citrus out of the Lone Star State, an official said.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela ruled Wednesday that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture did nothing wrong when it lifted a
3{-year ban on shipments of the Florida fruit to other
citrus-producing areas.
   ``We told the attorney general today that we'd like him to start
putting the paperwork together'' for an appeal, said TDA spokesman
Max Woodfin.
   The Florida fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus
canker in parts of Florida in August 1984.
   The USDA on Feb. 11 lifted the ban on shipments of fresh Florida
citrus into Texas and other citrus-producing areas.
   Texas officials had sought to have the quarantine reinstated and
claimed the USDA did not allow adequate time for comment when it
lifted the ban.
   Vela's ruling Wednesday was in response to a suit filed March 9
by the state of Texas, which was trying to stop shipments of the
Florida fruit to the state. The suit contends that the USDA
violated its own rules by failing to allow a comment period before
lifting the ban.
   ``With all the information put before me, I am satisfied that
the USDA followed the law'' in promulgating the rule, Vela said
Wednesday.
   The judge said the new protocol is so similar to one the USDA
proposed last fall but withdrew in January that there had been
plenty of time for comment.
   Canker, which comes in different strains, can damage the plants
and cause lesions on the fruit or make it drop prematurely from
trees.
   Texas citrus producers say an outbreak of canker would devastate
the state's $65 million citrus industry concentrated on 30,000
acres in Hidalgo, Cameron and Willacy counties in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley.
   ``We've maintained all along that the risk of our getting canker
is relatively small, but it's a risk we don't believe we ought to
take,'' said Ray Prewett, director of Texas Citrus Mutual, a
McAllen-based industry group.
   Florida officials have maintained that the canker is under
control.

   The stock market edged upward today, recovering
some of Wednesday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.13 to 1,971.98 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 532 up, 337 down and
502 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 42.43 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   More than half of that total took place in a single stock _ Avon
Products, unchanged at 24[ on turnover of more than 25 million
shares.
   Analysts said the activity reflected trading strategies based on
the company's impending quarterly dividend. At current levels Avon
shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative
buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid
increasing worries about rising interest rates.
   Rates moved up a bit again this morning, however, on continuing
talk that strength in the economy might increase inflationary
pressures.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that retail sales
fell 0.6 percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March
to a 1.7 percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8
percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.34 to 143.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .30 at 295.93.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.80 to
1,965.85.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about 7 to 1 on the NYSE.
Big Board volume totaled 176.72 million shares, up from 131.2

   A drain on U.S. stockpiles and drought
problems in Brazil are raising prospects for American soybean
farmers.
   Soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade jumped Wednesday
in response to Agriculture Department figures showing tighter
supplies of soybeans in the year ahead.
   The harvest forecast in Brazil, the main U.S. competitor in the
world soybean market, was reduced by more than 2 percent from
prospects a month ago, according to the latest department figures.
   In a supply-and-demand report issued on Tuesday, the USDA
projected that the nation's stockpile could decline to 145 million
bushels at the close of the next marketing year on Aug. 31, 1989,
from around 275 million bushels on Sept. 1, 1988.
   According to department records, the U.S. soybean inventory
carried over into the new marketing year on Sept. 1, 1989, would be
the smallest in at least five years and possibly longer.
   The Sept. 1 inventory was 436 million bushels in 1987, a record
536 million in 1986, and 316 million in 1985. The carryover had
dropped to 176 million bushels on Sept. 1, 1984, reflecting drought
losses in the 1983 harvest.
   In the 1983-84 marketing year, as a result of the tight supply,
soybean prices at the farm averaged an annual record of $7.83 per
bushel, up from $5.65 the previous year. But the upward spike was
temporary, and prices tumbled sharply as production increased
thereafter.
   The new projections, which USDA officials caution are ``highly
tentative,'' show that farmers can expect soybean prices to average
in the range of $5.75 to $7.75 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing
year, compared with a reported $5.75 this season and $4.78 in
1986-87.
   According to the projections, this year's soybean harvest _ the
crop is only about 14 percent planted _ could be around 1.88
billion bushels, slightly less than the 1987 harvest.
   Counting a Sept. 1 carryover of 275 million bushels, that would
mean a soybean supply of around 2.155 billion bushels for the
1988-89 marketing year. Of that, some 1.155 billion bushels are
expected to be crushed into high-protein meal and oil. Exports will
take an additional 760 million bushels, and seed, feed and other
uses will account for more.
   In all, 1988-89 soybean use is projected at 2.01 billion
bushels, meaning some of the Sept. 1 carryover will have to be used
to meet next season's demand. Thus, the soybean stockpile could be
a relatively skimpy 145 million bushels by Sept. 1, 1989.
   Historically, the U.S. soybean stockpile a times has been even
smaller _ and prices higher.
   In the early 1970s, for example, the Sept. 1 soybean carryover
dropped below 100 million bushels for three consecutive years from
a Sept. 1, 1970, inventory of 230 million bushels. Prices, which
averaged $2.85 per bushel in 1970, rose to an annual average of
$6.64 per bushel in 1974.
   After that soybean prices averaged in a range of less than $5
per bushel to a peak of $6.81 in 1976. In 1980, however, they
averaged $7.57 per bushel, a record until 1983 when the price went
to $7.83.

   China, the world's leading hog producer, has
ended pork rationing, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   ``A Chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork
rationing in Beijing had stopped being enforced,'' the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service said Wednesday. ``Other officials said
that pork rationing had ended throughout the country, though no
official announcement has confirmed this.''
   China began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in
response to shortages. Pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent
of the total animal protein in the Chinese diet.
   ``The pork shortages that led to the rationing did not, however,
affect China's ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets
(primarily Hong Kong),'' the report said. ``In fact, the country
has had a surplus of hogs for export to Hong Kong, but increases in
hog trade between the two countries has been limited by a Chinese
export quota.''
   An end to rationing ``shows that Chinese agricultural officials
believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved'' as
producers respond to lower feed prices, higher pork prices and
government incentives to promote larger production, the report said.
   ``It also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing
to pay more for the higher-quality, free market pork instead of
enduring the cheaper, fattier meat that has been sold at lower
prices in state markets,'' the report said.
   A USDA study last year showed that China had a 1983 year-end
inventory of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million in the
United States.
   But with more than five times the number of hogs, China's pork
production was less than double the U.S. output _ 13.2 million
metric tons to 7.6 million tons, the USDA study said. A metric ton
is about 2,205 pounds.
   The reason: It took only six months for an American farmer to
raise a 243-pound hog ready for slaughter, while a newborn Chinese
pig can take from eight to 18 months to reach a comparable
slaughter weight.
   Also, the study said, the average U.S. hog will produce a
dressed-out carcass of about 173 pounds, compared with the Chinese
carcass of about 140 pounds.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as scattered showers dampened parts
of the Corn Belt and weather forecasters predicted heavier
precipitation this weekend.
   Soybean futures posted the steepest early declines after five
straight days of sharp increases that were based on dry weather
conditions and an Agriculture Department report predicting
dwindling soybean stockpiles.
   ``The market is relatively quiet after all the excitement and
hoopla about Tuesday,'' when the USDA issued the report, said Jerry

starting things off on a little more of a so-so situation here.''
   Losses in wheat futures were limited by the USDA's offer late

Gidel said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.02\ a bushel; corn was

   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .13 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June at
73.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .45 cent higher
with May at 80.25 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent lower to .25
cent higher with June at 52.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .03 cent to .23 cent higher with May at 53.10 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures

<TEXT>
   If Panama's political crisis were
resolved tomorrow, it would take at least two years and a vigorous
recovery program for the devastated economy to return to the levels
of early 1987, according to five of the country's top economists.
   In the absence of a prompt solution to the crisis, which stems
from U.S. and local efforts to topple strongman Gen. Manuel
Noriega, Panama could be headed for collapse of its productive
apparatus, hunger and totalitariansim, the five said Wednesday.
   Economist Ruben Carles provided The Associated Press with a copy
of the report, entitled ``A Proposal for Economic Reconstruction.''
Carles is a director of a local bank and adviser to several major
multinational and Panamanian enterprises.
   The other authors _ bankers, consultants and academics _ are
Carlos Valencia, Marco Fernandez, Guillermo Chapman and Jose Galan
Ponce.
   They are all, in varying degrees, opponents of the
military-dominated government.
   But the government also recognizes the dire economic
consequences of the crisis. Treasury Minister Orvin Goodin said
Tuesday the gross national product would decrease by up to 20
percent this year.
   The Reagan administration has for the past 2{ months imposed
increasingly severe economic sanctions on Panama. Washington hoped
the measures would force Noriega to resign and leave the country,
but he has resisted the pressure and appears firmly entrenched.
   The general, who is commander of the Panamanian defense forces,
is the country's de facto ruler.
   In February, he was indicted in federal courts in Florida on
drug smuggling and money laundering charges. He denies the
accusations, contending they are part of an attempt to replace him
with a leader amenable to a strong U.S. presence in Panama into the
next century.
   The 1977 Panama Canal treaties oblige Washington to hand over
complete control of the waterway and U.S. military bases along it
by Dec. 31, 1999.
   The authors of the report say the crisis and resulting sanctions
have produced a more than 50 percent decrease in the amount of
money circulating in Panama.
   ``That allows for maintenance of likewise less than half the
production and transactions normally carried out in the country,''
says the report.
   Banks, which had been closed for nine weeks, reopened Monday,
but with severe restrictions.
   ``Economic activity is principally dedicated to liquidation of
stocks, given that imports are almost nil and it is extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to finance production,'' the report
says.
   The authors say that, in recent months, unemployment has risen
from about 12 percent of the workforce to approximately 20 percent.
They say that, even with a political solution in the coming weeks
or months, more than 40,000 more people stand to lose their jobs
because of the shrinking economy. That would raise unemployment to
26 percent of the workforce.
   Panama uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.
   The report's authors said one option open to the Panamanian
regime would be ``intervention or nationalization of the banking
system and the emission of a local currency with attendant
extremely grave economic consequences that would imply a transition
toward totalitarianism.''
   They propose a series of steps contingent on solution of the
political crisis, which would include abandonment of power by
Noriega.
   The report says extensive international relief will be needed to
alleviate hunger among the poor, who have been battered by the
crisis. It says international financial support totaling hundreds
of millions of dollars will be necessary.
   The U.S. Treasury would have to provide ample credit to
Panamanian banks and the foreign debt of $3.9 billion would have to
be renegotiated, according to the recovery plan.
   ``Our plan ... takes as a starting point the recognition that it
will take a period of no less than 24 months to return to the
levels of production and employment of the first semester of
1987,'' the report says.

<HEAD>The Market Is a Bigger Loser Than Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Day by day it becomes clearer that one of the
big losers in the stock market is the market itself.
   Business is off and layoffs are rising. The public is
disaffected with the way the market operates, especially its
volatility and seemingly senseless changes of direction.
   The publicity is negative. Various study groups complain, in
effect, that the market has become an assembly of institutional
sharpies who skim profits by means of technicalities and
sophisticated computer programs.
   The most devastating criticism comes from within the system
itself.
   Some of the biggest brokers have agreed to shut down their
in-house program trading operations, which seek almost automatic
profits on technicalities, because angry customers feel such
operations work against their interests.
   The head of a prominent small-investor brokerage house, Charles
Schwab, has referred to program traders as manipulators. And
Schwab's own operation has been criticized because investors
couldn't reach brokers on Oct. 19.
   George Ball, chairman of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said
a poll by his company showed individual investors, who generally
invest on the basis of a company's management and earnings, feel
cheated by market manipulators.
   Donald Regan, blunt-speaking former Treasury secretary, told the
Senate Banking Committee this week that the public has a right to
believe the marketplace is rigged. ``It is,'' he snapped.
   Regan's criticism is especially damaging because in his
pre-White House years he was one of the most promiment of all Wall
Streeters, head of Merrill Lynch and a leader in bringing
individual investors into the markeplace.
   Anger is also being directed at the Securities and Exchange
Commission and at the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, whose
jobs are to protect the public from shenanigans that inevitably
arise and must be squashed.
   The worst of these practices appears to be that of capitalizing
on gaps in prices of stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange
and stock index futures traded in Chicago. The players often are
brokerage houses themselves.
   When these gaps appear _ gaps that have nothing at all to do
with basic values _ they can produce wild price swings as money
jumps from one to the other in an attempt to skim off profits.
   Small investors cannot take such advantage. They have too little
capital, they have too little time, they have too little
sophistication. Gaps are discovered by those with immediate access
to data and instant communications.
   These automatic trading practices, mindlessly initiated by
electronic programs that spot opportunities, are believed to have
triggered, accelerated and reinforced the crash of last Oct. 19.
   Oddly, little comment and criticism has been heard from the
companies whose stocks are affected. But that criticism is sure to
come.
   Companies such as General Motors, for example, know that GM
investors are inclined to buy GM products, and they seek to exploit
that relationship with reminders in their quarterly reports to
shareholders.
   If these shareholders aren't protected from marketplace
shenanigans, it is fair to expect that they will lose their
enthusiasm for investing, hurting the value of the corporation's
stock and, quite likely, its sales as well.
   So pervasive are the negative comments about program trading
that it has, for the time being, overwhelmed concern about the
legal problems that had begun to unfold before the Oct. 19 crash
and are about to make headlines again.
   Investigations already have led to jail sentences for several
traders, including Ivan F. Boesky. But those investigations
continue; they are expected to bring in other promiment parties,
perhaps on criminal charges.
   Criminality, according to government investigators, is rampant
rather than existing on the periphery of the marketplace.
   In a pre-sentencing memo in the Boesky case, government
officials said they found ``criminal conduct is at the heart of a
substantial amount of market activity by established securities
industry professionals.''
   In short, the marketplace has an odor that drives away customers.

   The stock market turned upward today, recovering
some of Wednesday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 37.80 on
Wednesday, rose 10.11 to 1,975.96 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 780 up, 467 down and
521 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 83.18 million shares at
noontime, against 103.35 million at the same point Wednesday.
   A big chunk of today's trading took place in a single stock _
Avon Products, up [ at 24\ on turnover of more than 29 million
shares.
   Analysts said the activity stemmed from short-term strategies
based on the company's impending quarterly dividend. At current
levels Avon shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative
buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid
increasing worries about rising interest rates.
   Rates moved up a bit again this morning, however, on continuing
talk that strength in the economy might increase inflationary
pressures.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.6
percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March to a 1.7
percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8 percent.
   Norton Co. gained 1~ to 52~. The issue was added to Standard &
Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to track the performance of the 500.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose ] to 47[;
General Electric \ to 39; Exxon [ to 43}, and Texaco \ to 50].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.55 to 144.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .89 at 296.52.

   Retail sales, depressed by bad weather and an
early Easter, fell 0.6 percent in April, the first decline in six
months, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted $131.6 billion last month as sales fell $815 million from
March.
   The 0.6 percent drop was the first decline since a 0.8 percent
setback last October. The March performance was revised upward,
however, to show an increase of 1.7 percent, the biggest advance
since August and much stronger than the originally reported 0.8
percent gain.
   The swings in both months came from the fact that Easter came
early this year, meaning that consumers did their spring shopping
in March and siphoning off sales from April.
   In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the Northeast and West
dampened sales for spring apparel as well as for lawn and garden
items.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on the
report, said, ``Fortunately, the weakness in April may serve to
dampen inflationary expectations.''
   Given all the unusual influences, analysts said the weak April
sales report did not alter their general assessment that the
economy has been performing well so far this year.
   Total economic activity, as measured by the gross national
product, rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first three
months of the year, far better than the recession fears immediately
following the stock market crash last October would have indicated.
   The surprisingly strong growth has caused interest rates to rise
in recent weeks as investors have begun worrying about inflationary
pressures. Major banks boosted their prime lending rate on
Wednesday to 9 percent, the first increase since last October.
   The retail sales report showed widespread weakness in a number
of areas.
   Car sales fell for the first time since November, declining by 1
percent, to a seasonally adjusted $29.7 billion. Strong car sales,
propelled by sales incentive programs, have provided much of the
overall strength in consumer spending so far this year.
   Without the weakness in car sales, total retail sales would have
been a slightly lower 0.5 percent in April.
   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last at least
three years, dropped 0.6 percent. Sales of non-durable goods fell
an identical 0.6 percent.
   In the durable goods category, sales at hardware and building
supply stores were up 1 percent while sales at furniture stores
fell by 0.2 percent.
   In the non-durable goods cateogry, sales at department stores
dropped 0.5 percent, erasing part of the 2.1 percent jump in March.
Both months were influenced by the early Easter.
   Sales at grocery stores fell 0.3 percent in April while sales at
gasoline stations were off 1.3 percent and sales at restaurants
dropped 1.6 percent.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. workers ratified a two-year United
Auto Workers contract by a 54 percent majority, a slim margin UAW
Vice President Marc Stepp blamed on employee anger at the company.
   ``I thought it would be a little higher, but I understand the
concerns of the workers,'' Stepp said Wednesday night. He said
previous contracts have been ratified with majorities as small as
51 percent.
   The contract, approved Wednesday, covers 66,000 hourly and
salaried workers in 15 states and mirrors job-protecting pacts
signed last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. No
Chrysler signing date had been set.
   The Big Three contracts prevent layoffs except when production
is cut because of slow sales, forbid plant closings not announced
before the talks began and make it harder for companies to transfer
work to outside companies or foreign countries.
   The Chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lump-sum bonuses
in 1989 and 1990, a $1,000 signing bonus and, for the first time,
profit-sharing according to the formula that has generated
thousands of dollars for Ford workers.
   Chrysler union worker's base wage is now $14.43 an hour; the
contract does not provide for a raise in base pay but does provide
for cost of living adjustments.
   But unlike the Ford and GM contracts, the Chrysler pact prevents
executives from receiving bonuses in years when the profit-sharing
formula generates no payout for workers.
   The contract replaces a three-year agreement that would have
have expired Sept. 14.
   Stepp said Chrysler workers are more militant than workers at GM
and Ford and ``they're angry with (Chrysler Chairman Lee) Iacocca
and his high salary. They're really angry with Chrysler's attempt
to transfer the K-car to Mexico.''
   Iacocca earned $17.9 million in 1987, most of it by exercising
previously granted stock options. The figure came out the day after
the April 18 opening of early negotiations.
   Two days later, Chrysler confirmed it planned to halt U.S.
production of its venerable front-wheel-drive K-car and supply U.S.
buyers from a plant in Toluca, Mexico.
   Both issues nearly derailed negotiations until Iacocca announced
Chrysler would keep K-car production in Detroit through the end of
the year.
   Stepp said workers probably were disappointed with the $1,000
signing bonus because they received $2,120 for signing a three-year
contract in 1985.
   The contract was rejected at several large locals, including the
Detroit K-car plant, union officials said.
   But at Chrysler's 3,500-worker Warren Truck plant, it was
approved by 65 percent of those voting, said Local 140 President
Gil Wojcik.
   Two former American Motors Corp. locals in Wisconsin also
approved separate pacts Wednesday reached during the national
contract talks. Chrysler bought AMC in August. The pacts include
special payments to workers at former AMC plants in Milwaukee and
Kenosha that Chrysler says it will close.
   The Chrysler contract also protects 2,200 workers at four
closing Acustar Inc. plants from layoff. Acustar is Chrysler's
parts subsidiary. When the plants close, workers will be paid their
regular wages and placed in a job bank for future hire by Chrysler.

<HEAD>British Petroleum Says Its Quarterly Profit Sinks 43 Percent
^Eds: new throughout to CORRECT dollar figures to reflect quarterly
average of exchange rate differentials, sted of basing on Thursday
dollar-pound rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC, the world's
fourth-largest oil company, said Thursday its first-quarter,
after-tax profit sank 43 percent from a year ago because of lower
oil prices.
   BP said its profit fell to 263 million pounds in the first three
months of 1988 from 458 million pounds in the year-earlier period.
In dollars, that worked out to $473 million as opposed to $705
million in the 1987 first quarter, the company said.
   British companies' accounting method cannot be directly compared
to the method used by American companies, because of differences in
determining the value of inventories.
   Using the American method, BP's profit rose by 26 percent, to
408 million pounds, compared with 324 million pounds in the first
quarter of 1987.
   In dollars, that worked out to $734 million vs. $499 million in
the first quarter of 1987.
   First-quarter revenue fell 8.3 percent, to 6.49 billion pounds,
or $11.7 billion, from 7.08 billion pounds, or $10.9 billion.
   ``The first quarter of 1988 was characterized by a return to
lower oil prices as the market forces of excess supply prevailed,
despite continuing political tension in the Gulf,'' BP said.
   The fall in the crude price resulted in an inventory loss of 145
million pounds, or $261 million, in the first quarter, compared
with an inventory gain of 134 million pounds, or $206 million, a
year ago, BP said.
   In terms of operating profits, which do not include interest and
tax payments, the company said:
   _Exploration and production fell to 407 million pounds, or $733
million, from 462 million pounds, or $711 million, due to lower
crude oil prices and adverse exchange rate movements.
   _Refining and marketing earned 140 million pounds, or $252
million, down from 177 million pounds, or $273 million.
   _Chemical operations jumped to 133 million pounds, or $239
million, from 51 million pounds, or $79 million, largely due to
strong demand for petrochemical products.
   _Minerals earned 58 million pounds, or $104 million, up from 10
million pounds, or $15 million.
   BP ranks fourth after Royal Dutch-Shell Group, Exxon Corp. and
Mobil Corp.

   May Department Stores Co. announced Thursday its first-quarter
earnings fell 3 percent while Gap Inc. reported its earnings
tumbled nearly 73 percent.
   May, the nation's seventh-largest retailer, said that in the
quarter ended April 30, it had earnings of $62 million, down from
$64 million during the first quarter of 1987. The company reported
per-share earnings of 41 cents in both quarters.
   May said its first-quarter sales were $2.28 billion, down from
$2.34 billion for the same period last year.
   The company fell victim _ as did many other major retailers _ to
the sluggish consumer spending climate of the first quarter.
   ``For now, business continues to be slow, with most parts of
sportswear and juniors performing poorly,'' May Chairman David C.
Farrell said.``Expenses and inventories are being watched
carefully.''
   Gap, one of the nation's largest apparel store chains, also was
affected by the spending slump.
   Gap reported its earnings fell to $4.4 million, or 12 cents per
share, from $16.2 million, or 45 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago.
   The company reported it had a $4 million after-tax charge from
the restructuring of its Banana Republic segment.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $241.3 million, up from $211
million.
   Gap operates more than 840 apparel stores across the country.
   May's stores include May and Lord and Taylor department stores
and Venture and Caldor discount stores.

   Estimates of the nation's economically
recoverable but so-far-undiscovered offshore oil could be 27
percent lower than previous estimates, according to preliminary
figures released today by the Interior Department.
   The department released new estimates for offshore oil and gas
supplies and backup material for onshore estimates released in
March.
   By coincidence, the new material was released shortly after the
Energy Department said it believed the nation had a 35-year supply
of natural gas at prices under $3 per thousand cubic feet, and a $5
price would bring forth only another 10 years supply.
   Estimates of undiscovered onshore oil released by the Geological
Survey in March were down about 40 percent from previous figures,
in part because of drilling disappointments but also because lower
prices keep explorers from even considering high-cost pools.
   Today's numbers were broken down by area, and department
officials refused to supply totals, citing their desire to avoid
giving any impression the figures were unchangeable.
   But simple addition showed that the mean estimate _ that
estimate which there is a 50 percent chance of exceeding _ was 8.87
billion barrels of oil, down 27 percent, and 74 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas, down 18 percent. Expressed in terms of equivalent
energy content, the new estimates would be 22 percent below the old
ones.
   The same estimates in 1984 were 12.2 billion barrels of oil and
90.5 trillion cubic feet of gas.
   The decline, according to an Interior Department analyst who
spoke on condition he not be identified, can be attributed to
drilling disappointments, notably in Alaska, and lower prices.
   The new estimates assume oil costs $18 a barrel, about the
current price. The old estimates assumed oil costs of about $30 a
barrel.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington said in announcing the new
reserve estimates that ``natural gas has not taken its rightful
place'' in the nation's energy supplies and the department was
trying to allay public fears of short supplies left over from
pipeline curtailments in the severe northeastern winters of 1976-77
and 1977-78.
   If price were no object, current technology could recover about
1,029 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the Energy Department
study said. At $3 per thousand cubic feet or less, 583 trillion
cubic feet could be produced. An increase in price to $5 would
bring only an additional 174 trillion cubic feet.
   The nation uses about 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per
year. The average wellhead price last year was $1.83, which the
department's semi-independent Energy Information Administration
predicts will reach $4.02 in the year 2000.

<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis renewed his bid
for ailing television producer Lorimar Telepictures Inc. Thursday,
just two days after Lorimar agreed to become part of Warner
Communications Inc.
   Davis, who previously offered $17 per share for the maker of
such hit TV series as ``Dallas'' and ``Knots Landing,'' notified
the company he would pay $15 cash per share, or $679.5 million.
   Lorimar values the tentative agreement it made with Warner
Tuesday at $1.18 billion. That agreement includes assumption of
$550 million in Lorimar debt and financial penalties if Lorimar
backs out and merges with a third party.
   Pending review of confidential financial information, Davis said
in a letter released by Lorimar, ``we are prepared to consider
increasing our price in a negotiated transaction.''
   A spokesman for Davis, an oil man and investor who formerly
owned Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., declined to comment.
   Lorimar officials declined immediate comment on the impact
Davis' offer might have on the Warner transaction. That match was
seen as a way to solve Lorimar's cash problems and make Warner a
leader in television production as well as its present strength in
movies and music.
   The deal was conditional, but Lorimar Chairman Merv Adelson made
it clear at the time he saw the tax-free stock-swap deal with
Warner as the ideal marriage.
   Davis' $15-per-share figure for Lorimar matches the minimum
value placed on the stock swap that forms the basis of the Warner
deal.
   That merger, tentatively scheduled to close in September, would
trade .415 shares of Warner stock for each of the 45.3 million
outstanding shares of Lorimar common stock.
   In addition to the stock swap, valued by the companies at $630
million, Warner would assume about $550 million in Lorimar debt.
   Lorimar is allowed to back out if Warner's stock value does not
bring Lorimar shareholders at least $15 per share, a figure Lorimar
calculates would be met if Warner's stock price averages $36 a
share.
   If Lorimar cancels, the agreement commits it to pay Warner $10
million. If Lorimar is acquired by a third party, Warner has the
right to buy 18.5 percent of the outstanding shares at $15 a share.

<HEAD>Crop Evaluators To Examine Wheat Fields In Seven States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of evaluators will examine wheat
fields in seven states next week to check on the condition of the
crop as it approaches harvest.
   ``The wheat is starting to head out,'' said Jim Quinton, a grain
analyst for the AgriVisor marketing service in Bloomington. ``It is
in a very critical stage _ the reproductive stage.''
   Quinton has organized the wheat evaluation tour, which will
focus on the nation's key soft red winter wheat states of Missouri,
Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky and Arkansas.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture this week issued its first
estimates of the season for wheat production across the country
based on May 1 conditions. It said the harvest is expected to be up
4 percent for all winter varieties.
   ``We do feel it would be worthwhile to go out and get a
mid-course correction,'' Quinton said Wednesday.
   He said soft red wheat production is projected to be 426 million
bushels from this summer's harvest, up from 348 million bushels in
1987.
   ``This very likely is not so much a yield increase as an acreage
increase,'' said Quinton, noting farmers planted 1.7 million more
acres last fall than the previous year.
   The states in which evaluators will examine fields have nearly 7
million acres of soft red winter wheat out of a total of about 10.5
million in the United States, Quinton said.
   Evaluators will begin the tour Monday, covering several routes
and stopping about every 15 to 20 miles to check fields. The team
will include people from the grain trade, the milling industry, the
government, producer groups and the news media.
   In each field, participants will check the soil moisture
condition, the stage of development of the wheat, the size of the
stand, and the potential number and size of grain heads. They also
will look for any evidence of disease.
   Quinton said most of the soft red winter wheat seems to be in
good condition. Most was planted in a timely fashion last fall, and
cool, dry spring conditions have favored the development of much of
the crop.
   Soft red wheat is milled to make fine flours that are used in
things like cake, cookies and crackers. It is the hard wheat grown
farther west that is used for breads.

   The stock market swung upward today, recovering
some of Wednesday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 37.80 on
Wednesday, rose 12.60 to 1,978.45 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 837 up, 571 down and
495 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 122.58 million shares with an
hour to go.
   A big chunk of today's trading took place in a single stock _
Avon Products, unchanged at 24[ on turnover of more than 29 million
shares.
   Analysts said the activity stemmed from short-term strategies
based on the company's impending quarterly dividend. At current
levels Avon shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative
buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid
increasing worries about rising interest rates.
   Rates moved up a bit again today, however, on continuing talk
that strength in the economy might increase inflationary pressures.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.6
percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March to a 1.7
percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8 percent.
   Norton Co. gained 1| to 52|. The issue was added to Standard &

set up to track the performance of the 500.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose { to 47\;
General Electric ] to 39[; Exxon | to 44\, and American Telephone &

   Soybean futures closed sharply lower Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as rainy weather forecasts persuaded
traders to take profits. Grain futures also closed lower.
   A five-day rally that pushed soybean and soybean meal prices to
new contract highs on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday ended abruptly
Thursday as rain dampened parts of the Corn Belt and improved the
growing conditions for newly planted crops.
   Weather forecasters predicted more precipitation all the way
into next week, prompting traders to offset their long positions
and take profits, analysts said.
   ``After three straight days of new contract highs in the beans

Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It was an orderly correction,'' he said. ``It wasn't anything
unusual or out of the ordinary.''

<HEAD>Some Economists Question Big Scare About Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation paranoia has gripped the financial
markets, which only a few months back were preoccupied with the
threat of a recession. But some economists say the specter of
rising prices is highly exaggerated.
   These economists argue that unlike the 1970s, when price spirals
became ingrained, the economy of the 1980s has been reshaped by
fundamental changes that have restrained costs and wages, two key
components of inflation.
   Moreover, their reasoning goes, the highly competitive global
economy and higher U.S. productivity provide compelling evidence
that acute inflation will not revisit the United States in the
forseeable future.
   ``There's a very slow learning process in the markets,'' said
John Hekman, senior economist at the Claremont Economics Institute,
a forecasting firm in Claremont, Calif., that rejects the prevalent
thinking about inflation fear. ``We've had inflation scares every
year.''
   Unfounded or not, this anxiety has helped wrench down stock and
bond prices and raise long-term Treasury yields to the highest
levels of 1988. The Federal Reserve has been maneuvering to tighten
credit as a preemptive step to thwart inflation, and on Wednesday
banks responded by raising their prime lending rates.
   To some degree, economists say, inflation anxiety results from
the stock market crash seven months ago. After the collapse the Fed
used a mix of confidence-building public statements and big
injections of money into the banking system to quell fears that a
recession loomed.
   Since then the economy has shown surprising strength, but the
uncertainty raised by the crash has lingered. Many investors now
say they fear a rapidly expanding economy, because it would mean
higher wages, more demand for credit and too much money chasing too
few goods. That translates into inflation.
   The economists who dispute that view argue that wages have not
risen, despite the lowest unemployment in 14 years. On the
contrary, wages have fallen in some areas relative to inflation,
which last year totaled 4.4 percent and for the first three months
of this year ran at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.
   ``Labor costs have remained meek and mild,'' said Richard
Belous, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a
business-financed economic research group in New York. ``If
inflationary costs start getting imbedded in labor costs, then the
ballgame's over, but I don't think it's happening.''
   The primary reason for this, Belous and others say, is that the
labor market is radically different now. Many companies have
restructured into smaller, leaner operations with non-union
workers. Moreover, many Americans are employed in temporary and
part-time jobs that offer relatively low wages, little job security
and often no benefits.
   ``Management is now playing hardball with labor,'' Belous said.
``It can't just pass costs on to the consumer. Markets are
deregulated, there's more competition. We're part of a global
economy.''
   Richard Rahn, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
Washington, argues that inflation worriers are using outdated
economic formulas for assuming that lower unemployment translates
into rising prices.
   On the contrary, he said, higher employment means higher
production, which equals lower prices.
   ``This is logical when you think about it. If you produce more
of something, each unit tends to cost less. Rapidly growing
economies tend to have declining cost curves,'' Rahn said. ``Just
because the unemployment rate is coming down doesn't translate into
inflation. So I'm arguing the analysis is dead wrong.''
   Asked why inflation paranoia has afflicted the markets, Rahn
said: ``I think the experience of the late 1970s was very searing.
Clearly we don't want to repeat that.''
   Some economists argue that sharply higher factory utilization
rates portend inflation because they imply supply will not keep up
with demand, thereby pressuring prices up. But others say that is
also outdated thinking.
   ``The idea that a lot of industries are close to capacity is
just a measure of their improved efficiency,'' said Hekman. ``These
people are not about to let inflation get away from them.''

<HEAD>EEC Finance Ministers To Discuss Proposal for a Common Currency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance and economics ministers from
the European Economic Community meet Friday and Saturday to discuss
an idea which some key observers say may be an impossible dream:
creation of a single EEC currency.
   ``I doubt that the governments are prepared to make such a
far-reaching decision,'' Karl Otto Poehl, president of West
Germany's central Bundesbank, told reporters last week.
   The community's finance and economics ministers as well as
central bank presidents from the 12 EEC nations are to hold a
closed-door session in the Baltic Seas coastal resort town of
Travemuende, near Luebeck.
   Several key West European leaders, including West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, have proposed creating a common
EEC currency as well as a central EEC bank to manage it.
   In February, Genscher urged the EEC to appoint a team of experts
to come up with a definite plan.
   The proposals for a common currency are expected to be a major
topic of discussion at the Travemuende meeting, according to
finance ministry officials here.
   Other possible means of strengthening the EEC's exchange-rate
system, the European Monetary System, are also expected to be
topics at the meeting.
   Genscher, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and others
say a common EEC currency would strengthen West European unity and
help smooth the way for the creation of a barrier-free internal
market throughout Western Europe by 1992.
   But skeptics of the plan, including Poehl, say they don't think
EEC governments are ready to take steps that could lead to denting
their currency autonomy.
   Poehl and others have pointed out that many EEC nations
including Britain are not even full members of the European
Monetary System.
   ``At a time that most of the EEC countries are not even able to
fulfill their obligations to this very limited system, it's a
little premature to talk about something new,'' Poehl said.
   Only West Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland
are full members of the monetary system, which works to stabilize
currency exchange rates within the EEC.
   Poehl has also repeatedly warned that any steps towards creating
a central European Bank could infringe upon the constitutional
independence of the Bundesbank.

   The stock market eked out some scattered gains
today, steadying after Wednesday's broad decline.
   Trading was quiet.
   Analysts said investors did a little tentative buying in stocks
depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid increasing
worries about rising interest rates.
   Rates were mixed in the credit markets today as the Treasury
completed a three-day auction of $26 billion in bonds and notes.
   In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that
retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, but it also revised the
figure for March to a 1.7 percent gain from a previously estimated
rise of 0.8 percent.

   Assets of the nation's 426 money market mutual
funds declined $3.20 billion in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The drop, to $270.56 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $769.1 million gain in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 212 general purpose funds rose $217.1 million to $82.94
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds increased $237.6 million
to $115.19 billion, and assets of 117 institutional funds declined
$3.65 billion to $72.43 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.14 percent from 6.13 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 6.12 percent from 6.11
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
40 days, up from 41 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts as of
Wednesday was unchanged at 5.68 percent from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, also was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.92
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.86 percent
the previous week. Yields were 7.23 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
7.19 percent; 7.65 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.61 percent;
and 8.12 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.07 percent.

<HEAD>Irving Appoints Independent Directors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. said Thursday it set up a
committee of three independent directors to hold talks with its two
suitors, Bank of New York Co. and Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA.
   However, Bank of New York maintained it had no intention of
sweetening its hostile $1.08 billion bid, and was not holding any
negotiations with Irving.
   ``We have always said any time Irving will come to the table
with substantive negotiations we would listen. But we're not
prepared to talk to them in an auction environment,'' said Bank of
New York spokesman Owen Brady.
   Irving disclosed the special committee in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The company said
that while the directors were authorized to meet directly with the
Bank of New York and Banca Commerciale, ``there can be no
assurances that these discussions will result in any improvement in
either.''
   Irving's announcement came nearly a week after its annual
meeting, in which shareholders voted between a slate of 16
incumbent directors that back a restructuring and friendly merger
with Banca Commerciale and nominees from rival Bank of New York.
   The voting results are not expected to be released until a
reconvened meeting May 24, although both sides are claiming victory.
   Banking analysts generally have given Bank of New York an edge
in the proxy battle, mostly because it already has secured the
necessary regulatory approvals. Banca Commerciale, Italy's second
largest bank which is controlled by the government agency Instituto
per la Recostruzione Industriale, has just begun the lengthy
regulatory review process.
   Bank of New York, which owns a nearly 5 percent stake in Irving,
is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's common shares. The offer, which is scheduled to expire May
13, is valued at about $63 a share or $1.08 billion.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $75 a share for 9.5 million Irving
shares, or about 51 percent, valued at $707 million. In addition,
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price
from May 31 until the deal closes.

<HEAD>Textron Gets Contract for Work on New Airbus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Aerospace PLC acted Thursday to protect
itself from the pound's recent surge by contracting some of its
Airbus jetliner work to Textron Inc. of the United States.
   The $700 million agreement calls for Textron to manufacture wing
parts at its factory in Nashville, Tenn.
   British Aerospace said the contract was denominated in dollars,
which would reduce its risks from further rises in the pound making
its Airbus work too costly. Most orders for civilian aircraft
around the world are denominated in dollars, and the leading
aircraft builder, Boeing Co., is based in the United States.
   Textron's work on wing parts for 600 Airbus Industrie A330 and
A340 airliners accounts for about 15 percent of the total Airbus
work for which British Aerospace is responsible, the company said.
   British Aerospace is a partner in the four-nation Airbus
Industrie consortium, which also includes aircraft manufacturers
from France, West Germany and Spain.
   Textron will work as a ``risk sharing subcontractor'' to British
Aerospace, receiving the total amount specified in the contract
only if the full 600 aircraft are ordered from Airbus. And Textron
will meet all the start-up costs itself for the manufacture of the
wing parts, British Aerospace said.
   ``It means that Textron has to believe in the product as much as
we do,'' said British Aerospace spokesman Howard Berry.
   Airbus Industrie currently has commitments from customers to buy
145 of the new aircraft, with the A340 scheduled to enter service
in May 1992 and the A330 in September 1992.
   British Aerospace said it was negotiating several other
dollar-denominated contracts to further reduce its currency
exposure.
   British Aerospace announced in March that it had a pre-tax loss
of 159 million pounds last year after making a 320 million pound
provision for expected future losses on civilian aircraft
production. A pound is now worth about $1.84.

   Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, the
first setback in six months, with the decline blamed on an early
Easter, bad weather and a bigger federal tax bite for some people.
   The Commerce Department said consumers spent a seasonally
adjusted $131.6 billion at retail stores last month, a drop of $815
million from the revised March figure.
   Sales had not fallen since a 0.8 percent setback last October,
but economists said they were not particularly concerned by the
weakness, especially since sales in March were revised upward to
show an increase of 1.7 percent. That was the fastest sales advance
since last August and almost twice the originally estiated 0.8
percent gain for the month.
   Both the big jump in March sales and the April decline were
blamed on the fact that Easter occurred on April 3 this year,
meaning that consumers did their spring shopping in March,
siphoning off sales that would normally have occurred last month.
   ``The April retail sales figure is very misleading because of
Easter. Consumer spending is still holding up well,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Analysts said other factors that played a role in the April
decline were unseasonably cold weather in some parts of the country
that discouraged sales of such items as garden equipment and higher
tax bills some Americans faced at filing time this year.
   They noted in particular that sales at restaurants were down 1.6
percent, while sales at furniture stores were off 0.2 percent.
   ``Some people did get shocked by the new tax law. They may have
filled out their tax forms and decided they couldn't afford to eat
out for the rest of the month,'' said David Wyss, an economist with
Data Resources Inc.
   Tom Megan, an economist with Evans Economics, a Washington
forecasting firm, said he was not concerned by the April sales dip
because with unemployment now at a 14-year low of 5.4 percent,
consumers are confident about the future.
   ``With employment and incomes still growing, we expect consumers
will keep spending,'' he said.
   Total economic activity, as measured by the gross national
product, rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first three
months of the year, far better than the recession some people were
predicting immediately after the October stock market collapse.
   However, the surprisingly strong growth has raised inflation
concerns. Many economists believe the Federal Reserve Board has
moved in recent days to tighten up on interest rates as a way to
dampen demand and keep inflation under control.
   Major banks on Wednesday boosted their prime lending rate
one-half percentage point to 9 percent, reflecting the tighter
credit conditions.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the weak
report on retail sales ``may serve to dampen inflationary
expectations.''
   The April retail sales report showed that car sales declined 1
percent during the month, the first drop since last November.
Analysts said this reflected the phaseout of various sales
incentive programs that had lured consumers into showrooms in
earlier months.
   Without the weakness in car sales, total retail sales would have
been a slightly lower 0.5 percent in April.
   Sales at hardware and building supply stores were up 1 percent.
Analysts attributing some of this strength to a boom in home
remodeling as more homeowners choose to renovate rather than move
to bigger houses.
   Sales of non-durable goods dropped 0.6 percent overall. Within
the category, sales at department stores dropped 0.5 percent,
erasing part of the 2.1 percent jump in March. Both months were
influenced by the early Easter.
   Sales at grocery stores fell 0.3 percent in April, while sales
at gasoline stations were off 1.3 percent and sales at restaurants
dropped 1.6 percent.
   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last at least
three years, dropped 0.6 percent.

<HEAD>Proposal Seeks Higher North American Content in U.S-Canada Auto
Trade</HEAD>

   The Senate Finance Committee has tentatively
agreed to authorize the president to negotiate a higher North
American content for automobiles coming under the proposed
U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement, the staff of Sen. Donald Riegle,
D-Mich., said Thursday.
   The proposed treaty requires that U.S. or Canadian parts,
components and labor account for half the content of cars moving
duty-free across the border. Critics of the treaty, Riegle among
them, have said that level is too low.
   Riegle's proposal would authorize the president to negotiate a
higher domestic-content rule with Canada, in the hope of raising it
to 60 percent.
   If negotiations succeed, the president would be able to begin
the higher requirement through a proclamation, rather than
returning to Congress for consent, Riegle's staff said.
   Under the terms of the free-trade negotiations, both houses of
Congress must accept or reject the treaty as is, without amendment.
   However, Congress has the power to tie its acceptance of the
treaty to the fulfillment of certain conditions, or to pass other
legislation authorizing the president to try to renegotiate parts
of the agreement.
   ``My goal has been to improve the implementing language so that
the agreement is better,'' Riegle said. ``We are making some
significant progress.''
   The Finance Committee has not completed its work on the bill.
   The 50 percent North American content requirement has been
criticized by the United Auto Workers and parts suppliers. A level
that low would allow manufacturers to import engines, transmissions
and other major components.
   Another heavily criticized provision would allow Canada to
retain until 1996 agreements giving preferential duty treatment to
manufacturers outside North America who have Canadian production.
   Extending the preferential treatment will allow Canadian
suppliers and Japanese manufacturers to forge agreements that will
shut out U.S. suppliers from part of the market, critics have said.

   The stock market struggled to a small gain
Thursday in a sluggish bid to rebound from Wednesday's broad
decline.
   Trading was quiet.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 37.80 on
Wednesday, recovered 2.15 points to 1,968.00.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide New York Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 796 up, 637
down and 528 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 143.88 million shares, down from 176.72
million in the previous session. Nationwide, volume in NYSE-listed
issues totaled 164.82 million shares.
   A big chunk of the day's trading took place in a single stock _
Avon Products, down [ at 24 on turnover of more than 29.8 million
shares.
   Analysts said the activity stemmed from short-term strategies
based on the company's impending quarterly dividend. At recent
levels Avon shares sport an annual yield of 8.3 percent.
   Otherwise, analysts said investors were doing a little tentative
buying in stocks depressed by Wednesday's selloff, which came amid
increasing worries about rising interest rates.
   Rates were mixed in the credit markets Thursday as the Treasury
completed a three-day auction of $26 billion in bonds and notes.
   Brokers said traders remained concerned that persistent strength
in the economy would lead to upward pressure on interest rates and
inflation.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.6
percent in April, but it also revised the figure for March to a 1.7
percent gain from a previously estimated rise of 0.8 percent.
   The government's monthly report on the producer price index is
due out Friday. Advance estimates on Wall Street call for an
increase of about 0.4 percent in the index for April, after a 0.6
percent rise the month before.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose { to 47\;
General Electric \ to 39; Exxon ] to 44, and American Telephone &
Telegraph { to 27]. But International Business Machines was
unchanged at 108}.
   Dow Chemical picked up ] to 81. The company said it expects its
earnings this year to top the record set in 1987.
   Norton Co. gained 1| to 52|. The issue was added to Standard &
Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by index funds
set up to track the performance of the 500.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $5.64 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .30 to 143.78.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .39 to 294.17, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .54 at 253.85.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.99 to 370.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 296.61, up .98.

<HEAD>GAO Report Raps Big Banks on Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. banks are undercapitalized and
underregulated and have failed to write down approximately $28
billion in uncollectable foreign loans, the General Accounting
Office said in a report released Thursday.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, found fault with
federal regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. for creating a lenient classification system for
developing country debt.
   Using today's secondary market as a guidepost, the GAO
calculated that the average Third World loan is worth 54 percent of
its stated value. Under this criteria, the report estimated that
American banks have reserved $21.1 billion of foreign loans when a
more realistic figure should be $49 billion.
   In contrast, the criteria regulators developed only required
$2.3 billion in U.S. bank write-downs of uncollectable loans, the
GAO said.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who asked for the report, said, ``In
this `audit of the auditors,' it can be inferred that the record
first-quarter profits recently announced for banks engaged in
overseas lending are a shibboleth and that these institutions
should write off this year loans of a greater magnitude than they
did last year.
   ``Bank earnings are only as sound as their loan portfolios and
those portfolios, the GAO finds, are overvalued,'' Leach said.
   U.S. bank loans to developing countries decreased from $139.7
billion in June 1982 to $107.6 billion in December 1987, while U.S.
bank capital increased from $66.2 billion in June 1982 to $129.2
billion in December 1987.
   As a result, from June 1982 to December 1987 bank loans owed by
developing countries decreased from 211 percent of bank capital to
83 percent. During this time, developing country loans owed to the
nine largest money center banks decreased from 323 percent of these
banks' capital to 139 percent.
   ``While these figures reflect a prudential improvement in
circumstances for American banks, developing country loans are
still large compared with bank capital and are disproportionately
concentrated in a small number of money center institutions,'' said
Leach, a ranking Republican on the House Banking, Finance and Urban
Affairs Committee and its international finance, trade and monetary
policy subcommittee.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower in U.S.; Gold Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished slightly lower against most
other currencies Thursday in the United States after rising
marginally in Europe, and money brokers said there was little news
to influence trading.
   Gold prices rose in New York and London after falling in Hong
Kong. As of 4 p.m. EDT, Republic National Bank of New York quoted
bullion at $450.90 a troy ounce, up from $448.80 late Wednesday.
   ``It was another dull day in the currency market,'' said Graham
Broyd, vice president of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. in New York.
   Traders said the boost the dollar got Wednesday from rising
interest rates in the United States was partly eroded by an
assumption that other nations also would raise their rates,
negating the U.S. impact. Higher interest rates make a currency
more attractive to foreign investors.
   Others said remarks by Federal Reserve Board governor Wayne
Angell, who vaguely indicated the central bank may not necessarily
tighten credit further, had little impact on the dollar.
   But some money market economists said they saw long-term
weakness in the dollar because of the continually high trade and
budget deficits and the Fed's apparent reluctance to nudge interest
rates up too much.
   ``From an interest rate point of view, the foreign exchange
market assumes the Fed is constraied on how high interest rates can
go,'' said Michael Broder, an economist at Money Market Services, a
Chicago forecasting firm. ``You have the mere mention of higher
interest rates and the bond and stock markets go into the tank
pretty quick.''
   The dollar rose to 124.39 Japanese yen in Tokyo, vs. 124.24 yen
Wednesday. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 124.47 yen. By
the time trading concluded in New York the dollar was quoted at
124.53 yen, slightly higher than the 124.47 yen quoted late
Wednesday.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.8823 from $1.8870 late
Wednesday. Later in New York the pound fetched $1.8833, higher than
its $1.8815 value late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6816 West German marks, down from
1.6827; 1.3987 Swiss francs, down from 1.3995; 1.2300 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2314; 5.7005 French francs, down from 5.7037;
and 1,251.00 Italian lire, down from 1,251.50.
   Other late rates for the dollar in London, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6813 marks, up from 1.6773; 1.3987
Swiss francs, up from 1.3935; 5.7020 French francs, up from 5.6912;
1.8850 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8830; 1,250.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,249.50; and 1.2298 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2315.
   Gold bullion prices rose in London to $451.50 a troy ounce, vs.
$449.30 Wednesday. Zurich markets were closed for the Ascension Day
holiday.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $450.06, down from $451.68.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose $2.20 a troy ounce to $451.90
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.56 bid a troy ounce,
up from $6.55. On the New York Comex, the price was $6.574, up 2.2
cents.

<HEAD>Soybean Rally Stalls, Prices Plunge As Rain Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A five-day rally that pushed soybean futures prices to four-year
highs ended Thursday as rainy weather forecasts persuaded traders
to take profits.
   Grain futures also closed lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, pork futures continued to climb; cattle
futures were mostly higher; precious metals posted slight gains;
energy futures slipped a bit; and stock-index futures edged higher.
   Soybean futures prices had climbed more than 32 cents a bushel _
a gain of nearly 5 percent _ in the past week and set new contract
highs on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. But the rally stalled
Thursday as rain dampened parts of the Corn Belt, improving the
growing conditions for newly planted crops.
   Weather forecasters predicted precipitation all the way into
next week, prompting traders to offset their long positions and
take profits, analysts said.
   ``After three straight days of new contract highs in the beans
and meal, any market needs a pause to catch its breath,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It was an orderly correction,'' he said. ``It wasn't anything
unusual or out of the ordinary.''
   Buying interest dried up in the soybean meal market on a lack of
orders for Europe, where most businesses were closed for a four-day
holiday, said David Bartholomew, an assistant vice president at
Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   ``They were providing big support yesterday,'' he said of the
Europeans. ``Essentially what we had Wednesday was a condensing of
three days of potential activity into one day.''
   Analyst Jerry Gidel of G.H. Miller & Co. in Chicago, also noted
fairly heavy notices of intent to deliver corn and soybeans against
the May contracts, an indication of adequate near-term supplies.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.01\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1{ cents
lower with May at $1.96 a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3{ cents
lower with May at $1.55\ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents
lower with May at $7.07 a bushel.
   Strong cash hog markets helped boost pork futures for a second
day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The cash market is phenomenal,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``The daily
average price in Omaha two weeks ago was 40.93 cents (a pound).
Yesterday it was 46.23 cents. That's such a huge increase in a
couple of weeks that you've got everyone convinced that it's going
to keep going.''
   A reduction in the number of hogs coming to market supported
notions that the market has entered its seasonal downturn in
supplies, he said.
   Most cattle futures also advanced on strong cash markets and
indications of strong retail demand for beef, O'Hare said.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June
at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to .88 cent
higher with May at 80.40 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to
.45 cent higher with June at 53.12 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .92 cent to 1.65 cents higher with May at 54.60 cents
a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices rose in reaction to the
government's upward revision of its March retail sales figure,
analysts said.
   The Commerce Department revised the March figure to show a 1.7
percent increase, the biggest advance since August and a much
stronger gain than the originally reported 0.8 percent.
   ``That showed the economy continues to do well,'' which in turn
suggests an increase in inflation, said Peter Cardillo, an analyst
with Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   Gold settled $1.90 to $2.20 higher with June at $453.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2.8 cents higher with May at $6.574
a troy ounce.
   Most energy futures prices dipped lower in dull, featureless
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 3
cents higher with June at $17.48 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent
to .27 cent lower with June at 47.23 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to .33 cent lower with June at 51.92 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures edged higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .40 point higher at 253.80.

   Two broad measures of the nation's money supply
rose in late April and early May while a narrower measure fell, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $2,997 billion in the week ended May 2 from
$2,996 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $5 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,768 billion from $3,763 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $1.5 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $776.4 billion from a revised $777.9
billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $1.65 billion in
the week ended May 4 compared with a gain of $331 million the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings averaged

<HEAD>Skilled Trades Workers Reject Chrysler Pact; Leaders to Meet in
Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. skilled trades workers have
rejected a United Auto Workers contract ratified by other union
members, UAW officials said Thursday.
   The rejection does not change the overall ratification, but
could lead to new negotiations solely on skilled trades issues such
as apprenticeships, according to union officials.
   The union scheduled a meeting Friday in Chicago to review the
matter with its Chrysler skilled trades officials, who represent
more than 10,500 of the No. 3 automaker's UAW members.
   The two-year contract, covering 66,000 hourly and salaried
workers in 15 states, was ratified Wednesday by 54 percent of those
voting. Skilled trades _ such as machine tool makers _ and salaried
workers have additional, separate contracts covering issues unique
to them.
   The two groups vote as one on whether to ratify or reject both
contracts, which were approved by the salaried workers. UAW
spokesman Frank Joyce said he had no figures on the skilled trades
rejection or the salaried approval of the contract.
   There is at least one skilled trades delegate for each of
Chrysler's nearly 50 UAW local unions.
   If the skilled trades rejection was based on issues contained in
the main contract, such as economics, neither new negotiations nor
a new skilled trades vote would occur, union sources said.
   Part of the purpose of Friday's meeting is to determine whether
or not the rejection was based on issues unique to the skilled
trades.
   Union officials who asked not to be identified said they
believed the rejection was economic. If so, the meeting will be the
only action on the rejection and skilled trades workers will have
to live with the contract ratified by everybody else.
   The meeting was called by UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Marc Stepp and will include those delegates on the UAW's
140-member national Chrysler council who represent skilled trades
workers.

<BYLINE>Attorney Says Navistar Engaged In Sham Deal To Sell Off Wisconsin
Steel^
^By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp. sold off its
money-losing Wisconsin Steel subsidiary to avoid paying
multimillion dollar pension benefits to workers, the government's
pension insurance agency contended Thursday as trial began in its
suit against Navistar.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. asked a federal judge to
award it $140 million from Navistar to cover the unpaid benefits
plus interest.
   The long-awaited trial is considered an important test case to
determine whether _ and to what extent _ a company can be forced to
honor pension-plan obligations to workers.
   Navistar faces two lawsuits resulting from the ill-fated 1977
sale of Wisconsin Steel to Envirodyne Inc., a Los Angeles-based
engineering company with no previous steel-making experience.
   The South Side Chicago steel mill went bankrupt eight years ago,
putting 3,500 employees out of work and leaving the PBGC with the
tab for unpaid benefits.
   In an interview before presenting opening trial arguments
Thursday, Navistar attorney Donald G. Kempf said the company
welcomed its day in court.
   ``Navistar has wanted for a long time to vindicate itself in
this case and with this trial it will do so,'' Kempf said.
   In his two-hour opening statement before U.S. District Judge
James Moran, PBGC attorney William O. Bittman said company
officials ignored recommendations from investment bankers that the
sale was financially questionable because Envirodyne lacked the
experience and funds to turn the steel company around.
   Other steel companies showed no interest in buying Wisconsin
Steel, Bittman said.
   He said company officials were aware at the time the deal might
lead to lawsuits if the steel company went bankrupt, but went ahead
with the sale to Envirodyne in order to avoid $167 million in
losses it faced by liquidating Wisconsin Steel.
   ``I think Navistar sold Wisconsin Steel to a buyer that they
knew did not have the experience or the financial wherewithal to
run the steel division in an economic way,'' Bittman said in an
interview Thursday.
   ``The reason they did it, was because the other alternative of
liquidating the company would cost them too much money, even though
they recognized that bankruptcy would be inevitable,'' Bittman said.
   Navistar denies duping Envirodyne into buying the steel company
as part of a conspiracy to rid itself of the pension liabilities.
It maintains Wisconsin Steel went bankrupt due to a delay in
promised government-backed financing for modernization, a strike
against Navistar, and deterioration in market and economic
conditions.
   Also Thursday, the judge in the non-jury trial heard opening
arguments from attorneys for Wisconsin Steel creditors _ including
an Envirodyne unit, the EDC Holding Co. _ who have filed a separate
second lawsuit seeking triple damages of nearly $475 million from
Navistar. The lawsuit alleges fraud and racketeering in the 1977
sale of the steel company.
   Navistar, known as International Harvester Co., in 1977 lent
Envirodyne $50 million to finance the $65 million acquisition of
Wisconsin Steel.
   Navistar has already reached a $14.8 million out-of-court
settlement with 2,700 former employees of the steel company.
   The government and workers filed lawsuits against Navistar in
1981. EDC sued Navistar in 1982.
   Navistar attorney Kempf denied Bittman's argument that the
Wisconsin Steel transaction lacked a reasonable chance of success.
   He said the reason it did not succeed was ``because of
unforeseen factors that happened'' three years after the sale.
   The case adjourned late Thursday until Monday.

   Continental Airlines has entered into an

millions of miles to members of its airline's frequent flier club,
Attorney General Robert T. Stephan said Thursday.
   Stephan said that as recently as May 3 Continental advertised
minimum credits of at least 1,000 miles per flight segment while it
had been making minimum entries of only 750 miles since Jan. 1.
   Members of frequent flier clubs accumulate mileage credits that
can be used for free or reduced fare airplane tickets.
   Besides the mileage credit discrepancy, Continental advertised
that members of its ``OnePass'' club could receive frequent flier
award travel to Tokyo, but the airline did not make such trips
available, Stephan charged.
   Stephan said the brochures and in-flight magazine advertisements
were deceptive. He said the company attempted to save millions of
dollars worth of award travel tickets nationwide.
   In the agreement it signed with Stephan's office, Continental
denied it violated Kansas consumer protection laws, although it
agreed to pay $20,000 in costs and investigation fees.
   The Houston-based airline said that when it announced its triple
mileage program in a Jan. 21 letter to OnePass members, it clearly
stated the mileage minimum being tripled was 750 miles. The company
also said a March 1988 brochure used the 750-mile figure.
   Continental said in the agreement it depicted Tokyo as a
frequent flier award destination because members wishing to go
there could earn credits to make that trip by flying on sister
airline Air Micronesia.
   The airline agreed to credit OnePass members at the 1,000-mile
rate retroactively and keep the 1,000-mile rate in effect through
July.
   It also agreed to withdraw any remaining advertisements and
brochures using the 1,000-mile figure. The airline said it would
add Tokyo as an award travel destination through Dec. 31.
   Stephan estimated there are more than 2 million active OnePass
members. During the first 16 weeks of 1988, Continental enrolled an
average of more than 45,000 members a week, he said.

<HEAD>`Substantial' Layoff Announced at GE Defense Plant</HEAD>

   A substantial number of workers at a
General Electric Co. defense plant here will be laid off because of
a drop in orders from the Pentagon, the company announced Thursday.
   Arthur Glenn, vice president of GE's Defense Systems Division,
refused to say exactly how many workers would be laid off or when.
   However, GE officials informed the state it would lay off about
900 workers over the next 18 months because of a decrease in
defense-related orders, according to a state economic affairs
official.
   The first phase of the layoffs is scheduled for July, according
to the official, who asked not to be identified.
   The unexpected announcement by the company came only three
months after GE promised stable employment at its Pittsfield
businesses this year. The company had laid off 1,000 workers last
year when it closed its transformer plant.
   The ordnance division, which employs 4,700 people, makes
guidance systems for Trident submarine-launched nuclear missiles,
components of the Bradley fighting machine, which carries
infantrymen, various high-speed guns and other military products.
   ``The market we serve we thought, up to a year ago, to be at
least in a sustaining basis and somewhat of a growth basis,'' Glenn
said at a news conference.
   He blamed the sudden turnaround on government cutbacks in
ordnance contracts.
   ``As pressure gets tough on defense budgets, government
customers have to make difficult decisions,'' Glenn said.
   He said a government contract the company recently lost to
Northrup Industries had little to do with the layoffs.
   ``We had really planned our business based on not winning that
contract because there was so much controvery over whether the Air
Force wished to use our technology,'' Glenn said. ``Certainly if
that contract had come, I would not have had to take as severe an
action as we're going to have to take without it.''
   Glenn also said a decrease in orders would mean a slowdown in
Bradley fighting machine production, from 550 yearly to about 350.
   He said he told the company's 500 management employees Thursday
morning about the impending layoffs. Neither managers nor union
officials could be immediately reached for comment.
   GE now employs about 6,700 people in the ordnance and plastics
plants in the city, the number it had employeed in 1983, before the
company began expanding the ordnance systems division with 1,400
new employees by late 1986.
   Workers at the company were dealt a major blow in the fall of
1986 when GE announced it would close its transformer division in
Pittsfield.
   GE announced in August 1987 it was reorganizing the ordnance
division to eliminate the engineering and manufacturing department
and replace it with a Division Effectiveness Operation to improve
efficiency.
   ``The steps we are taking are usually taken by businesses in
trouble and we are not in trouble,'' division Vice President
Nicholas Boraski said at the time.

   Pan American World Airways and Aeroflot begin
the first nonstop service between New York and Moscow this weekend
under a joint venture, Pan Am announced Thursday.
   The first flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport will
leave at 5:45 p.m. EDT Saturday and arrive at Sheremetyevo Airport
at 10:55 a.m. Sunday morning, local time, Pan Am stated.
   The first flight from Moscow will leave Sunday at 1:20 p.m.
local time and arrive at JFK at 2:50 p.m. EDT.
   Under terms of the joint venture, which was approved at the
December summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, Pan Am and Aeroflot individually will market and
sell one-half of the passenger and cargo space and share equally in
the cost of operation.
   The flights will use Pan Am Boeing 747s, staffed by Pan Am
cockpit and flight service crews. Aeroflot may provide up to three
flight attendants for interpretation and marketing.
   There will be three flights a week in the summer, two in spring
and fall and one a week in the winter, Pan Am said.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Thursday it had
agreed to sell Midland International, an electronics division of
Western Auto Supply Co., to Glenayre Electronics Ltd. of Vancouver,
Canada, for $35 million.
   Sears acquired Western Auto, a Kansas City-based auto-parts and
hardware chain, earlier this year for about $400 million.
   The Midland sale was subject to a definitive agreement being
reached.
   Midland is a major supplier of equipment for the wireless
communications industry with facilities in the United States, the
United Kingdom, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, Sears stated.
   Midland is a significant supplier of land mobile radios and
associated equipment to Glenayre, according to L. Claude Simmonds,
Glenayre's chairman and chief executive.
   Midland's senior management will remain in place, Simmonds said.
