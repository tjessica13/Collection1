<HEAD>Sentence Review for Convicted Terrorists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government will
review the life sentences of dozens of convicted terrorist prisoners
in this British province, officials said Sunday.
   The Life Sentence Review Board will review the records of the
Special Category inmates over the next six months and report back to
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, his office reported.
   No reason was given for the review, but it appeared aimed at
reducing tensions.
   The Special Category laws for suspected terrorists in Northern
Ireland's sectarian warfare were introduced in 1972 after inmates
staged a hunger strike at Belfast's Maze Prison, demanding to be
treated as political prisoners.
   Their special privileges include political status and allow them
to avoid prison work, wear their own clothes, have extra visits and
food parcels and to live in isolated groups.
   In 1976, the Special Category status was ended for crimes
committed after that date and in 1980 no more prisoners were
admitted to the category.
   There are now 90 Special Category prisoners compared with 1,500
in 1975. There are 31 members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
27 of the mainly Protestant Ulster Defense Association and 32 from
the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force.
   All but five are serving life sentences or are detained on orders
of the secretary of state.
   The predminantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the Irish Republic, which is overwhelmingly Catholic.

   A 10{-foot alligator lunged from a
residential lake, seized a 4-year-old girl who was wading with her
brother and a friend and dragged her to her death.
   Game officers spotted the alligator on the bank of Hidden Lake
around midnight carrying the limp body of Erin Glover in its jaws.
The reptile was immediately shot to death with a .357-caliber Magnum
pistol, said Stephen Condit, Red Cross disaster services director.
   The girl's body was recovered, he said.
   Since 1948, there have been 95 unprovoked alligator attacks in
Florida, with five previous deaths, said game commission Lt. Jim
Farrior.
   ``An autopsy of the alligator was performed on the scene and
determined it to be the (alligator that killed her),'' Charlotte
County dispatcher John Kefer said Sunday. He did not know what
aspect of the autopsy identified the reptile as the killer.
   Erin was walking along the lake's south shore with her brother
Justin, 8, their dog, and neighbor Jason Kershanick, 9, at 6:30 p.m.
Saturday when the gator bolted from the water and snapped up the
girl in its teeth.
   Jason said Sunday that the children were walking in ankle-deep
water.
   ``The little girl was throwing rocks and kicking the water. While
she was kicking, she must have kicked the alligator. Right when she
stopped kicking, the alligator jumped up out of the water and
started biting her two times in the stomach,'' Jason said. ``Then he
dropped her and she crawled away, and then he got out of the water
more and grabbed her from the back and went in the water.''
   ``After it happened, then we ran,'' he added. ``It was pretty
quick. It seemed like a nightmare, a dream. But then the way she
screamed, when I saw the blood after he went in, then I realized it
was real.''
   Alligators tend to pull their prey underwater, drowning them and
stashing the body for later feeding.
   Wayne Kershanick went to the lake with a pistol after his son
alerted him.
   ``I saw it taking her off to the other side'' of the lake,
Kershanik said. ``I tried to track it through the weeds, but by the
time I got there he went under with her, and that was the last I
seen of him.''
   Neighbor Nolan Jesse said he had heard Erin's mother screaming
and took a rifle to the lake. He said he saw a large alligator
surface with a light-colored object in its mouth.
   ``It was within rifle range but I was afraid to shoot because of
the object,'' Jesse said.
   The gator was spotted after five divers had searched the lake and
weeds surrounded by the Gardens of Gulf Cove development while six
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission officers and several
deputies and emergency workers walked the land. The area is about 25
miles south of Sarasota on Florida's west coast.
   ``It was a shock. It will be a while getting over it,'' Erin's
stepfather, Ty Bowns, said outside the family's house.
   ``All the kids around here played around all these lakes. I don't
think anybody took the alligators all that seriously.''
   Justin was staying with neighbors after the incident.
   Kershanick's wife, Charlotte, said nothing had been done about
past alligator complaints.
   ``A lot of them are aggravated because they've complained about
the alligators being here, but nobody does anything,'' she said.
``They ought to have the ponds fenced in.''
   Alligators once were vigorously hunted and their population
dwindled in Florida. They were made a protected species in the
mid-1960s.
   But in the past few years, it has become clear that the species
is in no danger of extinction, said Farrior.
   State wildlife experts estimate there are 1 million alligators on
6.7 million acres of land.
   On Sept. 1, for the first time since 1962, the state will hold a
one-month gator hunt in which no more than 3,000 are to be taken.
   ``They occupy pretty much any body of water that would look like
an alligator lives there, and lots that don't,'' Farrior said.
   Last year, 3,853 gators were killed because they were declared a
nuisance, threatening children and livestock.
   The attack on Erin was the third gator attack on the Gulf Coast
in the past six months. Both previous victims survived the attacks.

   For 65 hours, six men were trapped deep
underground after a mine explosion in central Germany. Here, based
on interviews with the survivors, mine officials, rescue workers and
German news reports, is the story of their harrowing ordeal.

   Huddled in the depths of a coal mine,
six trapped miners take turns banging hammers together to signal
rescuers. Their colleagues keep as still as possible to save
precious air.
   ``Lie down, move as little as you can, drink the water in sips
and breath as regularly as possible,'' veteran miner Thomas Gepperth
barks to his five-man crew.
   Toward the end of their 65-hour ordeal, their oxygen almost gone,
the men hear a rescue worker screaming into his walkie-talkie: ``I
see a light! I see two lights, I see three lights! I see people
alive!''
   The drama begins at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, when a gas explosion
traps 57 men in the mine in this town 70 miles northeast of
Frankfurt.
   Gepperth and his five-man crew race toward the exit of the
500-foot-deep shaft.
   ``Maybe the blasting material storeroom blew up,'' the strapping,
36-year-old Gepperth says to himself.
   Out of the darkness, illuminated by the lights on the miners'
helmets, appears the figure of a colleague staggering toward them.
Gepperth instantly recognizes the symptoms of the miners' dreaded
foe _ carbon monoxide.
   He yells, ``Turn back, turn back!''
   Gepperth and his crew head in the other direction. Other men
nearby race toward the exit, into certain death from mounting levels
of carbon monoxide that filled the tunnels.
   Gepperth's crew, wearing emergency masks containing about 45
minutes' worth of oxygen, rush to a point more than a mile from the
blast site in the underground labyrinth of tunnels.
   Guided by the flames of cigarette lighters, they search for a
space free of the deadly gas.
   Finally, the group finds air _ and a chance for survival.
   ``Be quiet, so you use up less oxygen,'' Gepperth orders.
   Huddled in the dark are:
   _Egon Dehn, a bearded, 36-year-old father of two.
   _Helmut Gesner, 27, engaged to be married in August.
   _Heinz Roese, 33, married two years and the father of one.
   _Wilfried Doench, at 21 the youngest of the group. Just four
weeks earlier he'd walked away unharmed from a car wreck.
   _Ahmet Batkan, 33. The Turkish immigrant has two children and his
wife is expecting a third.
   The sixth man is Gepperth, who is married. He often sports a
diamond earring in his left ear.
   The men start shouting frantically into their walkie-talkies:
``One north 4-5, one north 4-5 six people.'' They hope to give
rescue workers their precise location.
   Radio contact is made. But a radio operator orders the men to
stop sending distress calls so he can try to reach other possible
survivors. They try using the walkie-talkies again later but can't
make contact.
   The miners sit in the dark _ having turned off their miners'
lamps to save batteries _ with their only nourishment a sandwich and
mineral water.
   Taking turns, they pound two hammers together in rhythmic blows
to try to catch rescuers' attention. The banging goes on for nearly
65 hours.
   Gepperth tells his men to remember the ``Miracle of Lengede'' _
in which 11 miners were pulled to the surface two weeks after water
flooded an iron mine in Lower Saxony in 1963.
   Some of the men start to make last wills and testaments, but
Gepperth gruffly tells them ``You don't have to do that.''
   Gepperth senses that the deadly carbon monoxide levels are
advancing toward them, and the group retreats into the furthest
recesses of the mine.
   Finally, their backs are against the wall. They can go no further
and must stay in a prison-like space 6{ feet high and 8 feet wide.
   After waiting in vain Thursday, the men hear drilling on Friday.
But it stops at mid-afternoon.
   Gesner says to himself: ``Have they forgotten us or something?
Maybe they figure it's not worth it.'' He starts imagining he sees
lights coming toward him, but there's no one there.
   They keep tapping, louder and louder. On Friday night, rescuers
above think they've heard something.
   Hours pass. Then one of the trapped men screams: ``They've
drilled a hole!''
   At 4:21 a.m. Saturday, the rescue worker calls that he's found
the men.
   A little more than an hour after they're discovered, the men are
hoisted to the surface.
   After all 57 miners had been given up for dead, the ``Miracle of
Borken'' had occurred.

<HEAD>Toronto Summit May Be More Informal, Focused On Narrow Issues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's final meeting with major U.S.
trading partners, coming just two weeks after the Moscow summit,
will focus on both macro and micro, from averting another stock
market crash to debating whether longer shopping hours might ignite
more economic growth in West Germany.
   Reagan will meet with leaders of six other major industrial
democracies _ Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan
_ plus the European Community in the downtown convention center of
Canada's biggest city, June 19-21.
   The economic summit will give Reagan an opportunity to brief his
partners on his May 29-June 2 talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. However, two of the participants, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita got
an early report from the president during his London stop last week.
   Toronto, hoping that a favorable impression will bolster its bid
to host the 1996 Olympic Games, is busy sprucing up for an expected
invasion of 1,400 summit delegates and 5,000 news media
representatives.
   The city has a graffiti squad scrubbing everything clean. A giant
parking lot is being converted into ``Summit Square'' where
reporters will be offered free food and drink around the clock.
   To guard against terrorist attacks, 3,000 police officers will be
deployed around the city and sharpshooters will be stationed on
rooftops along motorcade routes to prevent anyone from getting
within a bomb's throw of visiting foreign leaders.
   The security operation will cost an estimated $6 million, the
equivalent of $4.8 million in the United States.
   ``We are taking the precautions because of the history (of
terrorist attacks) at previous summit conferences,'' said police
Supt. Bernard Nadeau. Rockets were fired in downtown Tokyo at the
1986 economic summit and bombs were thrown at embassies in Rome
during last year's Venice summit.
   Mrs. Thatcher, in office since 1979, will be dean of the
summiteers. This will be Reagan's eighth such summit.
   Newcomers at the Toronto summit will be Takeshita and Italian
Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita. Also attending will be West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand, who
will bring his new premier, Michel Rocard.
   Host Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wants the 14th economic summit
_ the annual parleys began in 1975 at Rambouillet, France _ to be
less formal and more productive than its predecessors.
   Mulroney has ruled out the usual opening day festivities in favor
of getting right down to business. He plans to start with an
afternoon working session on economic issues, followed by a working
dinner on political matters.
   At the dinner, ``clearly the the overarching theme will be
East-West relations,'' says Mulroney.
   The second summit day will see an innovation _ a 90-minute
meeting without aides at which the leaders will toss around ideas
about prospects for the next decade. They are to discuss economics
on the final day before closing with a news conference.
   ``It's essential that this summit concentrate rather heavily on
economic issues,'' said Sylvia Ostry, Canada's multilateral trade
ambassador. ``The summit is the terminal day of what is almost a
continuing process of international economic cooperation.''
   Ms. Ostry said the two major summit issues will be:
   _How to manage the transition from huge trade deficits and
surpluses to balanced global trade.
   _How to prevent a repetition of the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   The crash did not result in a recession, as some experts had
predicted, but continued growth has raised fears of a new
inflationary spiral.
   To avert that danger, the Bank of Canada this week pushed
interest rates to a two-year high, with prime rates rising to 10.75
percent.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker is urging the seven summit
nations to adopt an index of 35 to 40 key commodities, including
gold, to help track inflation.
   Baker proposed last month that they also closely monitor growth
rates and trade balances to better coordinate their economies, in
addition to watching exchange and interest rates and fiscal policies.
   Canada and the United States are expected to press the 12-nation
European Community and Japan for progress in the farm subsidy war
that is crippling treasuries, driving down prices and restricting
markets.
   Summit leaders also are expected to consider options for solving
the Third World debt problem, in which 121 developing countries owe
a total of $1.25 trillion. Commercial banks want governments to
increase contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
   With monetary policies already being closely monitored, Canadian
officials said the summit emphasis may focus on ``micro-economic''
policies such as taxation, deregulation, land use restrictions in
Japan or extension of West German shopping hours to boost imports.

   The bedposts are artificial trees, and
the suite's private whirlpool is nestled in a crop of synthetic
rocks complete with a mini-waterfall. The walls are a deep-green
painted forest.
   Welcome to the treehouse suite, part of the new fantasy wing of
the Burnsville Royale Hotel.
   For $165 to $195 a night, guests also can retire to an igloo, a
whaling ship, a sheik's tent, a California beach, a 1973 Olds or any
of a number of settings at this latest addition to Roger Dehring's
growing chain of fantasy hotels.
   ``We're really just another hotel company that has a part of its
business that's a little unusual,'' said Dehring, 43, of Minnetonka,
owner of the refurbished Burnsville motel and similar outposts in
the Wisconsin towns of Antigo, Dodgeville, and West Bend.
   Before the fantasy wing opened here in May, the hotel had the
usual trappings for travelers: convention and meeting rooms, a
restaurant, swimming pool and 88 standard rooms for $42 to $50
per-night.
   ``In addition, we have this one wing that looks like any other
hotel wing _ until you open the (room) door,'' Dehring said.
   In the Moby Dick suite, guests are confronted with the wide-open
mouth of a whale. The whirlpool _ mandatory fare in the 12 fantasy
suites _ is inside the behemoth, ribs showing through a ceiling of
whale stomach.
   Then there's the car suite. ``Bring back the memories,'' bids the
promotion on the hotel fare sheet. ``The stars, the moon and young
loves' first kiss in the backseat.''
   The beach room, bedless, offers sleep on a beige carpet randomly
padded to give the impression of sand.
   ``Pharoah's Tomb'' puts you inside a pyramid with sand- and
cement-sprayed walls cracked to lend a more realistic look and feel.
   ``It's a very definite, authentic feeling. Whatever authentic is.
I haven't been there either,'' Dehring said.
   The story of Royale Hospitality Group Inc., the Bloomington-based
parent company of Dehring's four hotels, began at the Don Q. Inn in
Dodgeville. The Don Q. offers such oddities as a 120-year-old barn
for a restaurant and a steeple converted into a suite.
   Dehring bought it in 1979 and quickly learned that something out
of the ordinary is something in demand.
   ``We've kind of been expounding on it ever since,'' said Mike
Isabella, hotel group president.
   The two are full of ideas for more elaborate _ maybe impossible _
suites. They picture guests sleeping on a 27-foot boat floating in
real water, ``God and code willing,'' Dehring says.
   Another idea is a hot-air balloon. Such a suite probably would
have to be a three-story affair, they said.
   Expansion of the chain is more than a brainstorm. Contracts have
been signed for the purchase of new properties in Muscatine, Iowa,
and Greenwood, Ind.
   With the Burnsville specialty rooms already booked for the
summer, Dehring and Isabella think it will pay to build more of the
unexpected at their fifth and sixth hotels. They'll entertain all
ideas. In fact, they give guests ``suite suggestion'' cards that
solicit names and concepts for future rooms and promise a free night
for winners.

   James H. Gildea, a Democrat who represented
Pennsylvania in the U.S. House from 1935 to 1939, died Sunday of
cardiac arrest at age 97.
   Gildea, who died at the Manor Care nursing home in Arlington, was

   A huge blimp-like balloon floating
serenely in the southern Arizona sky is a new weapon in a widening
war, a radar-packed eye-in-the-sky searching for airborne drug
smugglers.
   When it becomes fully operational this month, the nearly $18
million balloon will scan the sky to the south, tracking low-flying
planes that try to evade regular radar, and helping U.S. Customs
Service aircraft chase smugglers within 80,000 square miles.
   The helium-filled, white balloon already has tracked planes
twice, leading to arrests and seizure of drugs, said Daniel Wiley,
senior engineer and site manager for the contractor, Westinghouse
Defense and Electronic Systems Co.
   It is the first of at least five balloons Customs officials hope
to position along the Southwest border to plug gaps in ground-based
radar surveillance that have allowed smugglers to enter the country
with impunity via Mexico.
   Some residents near the giant balloon's mooring on the southern
edge of the Fort Huachuca military reservation say they're worried
that it poses a danger to them.
   ``I'm sure the government's going to leave it there until it has
an accident, and then things will change. And it ultimately will
have an accident,'' said Harry Woodward, whose home is within the
radius of the balloon's 10,000-foot-long tether.
   Within the balloon's range are 1,000 homes, five churches and
Huachuca Mountain Elementary School, where Carol Southland, a
second-grade teacher, is among those who appreciate its deterrent
role in the war on drugs.
   ``I just don't think the risk is there,'' she said. ``I don't
think the balloon's gonna run away through the neighborhood and
carry off the children.''
   Army and Customs officials say the site was the best available
and fears of an accident are unfounded.
   The balloon has a rapid deflation device to allow operators to
lower it quickly while controlling where it lands if it were to
break from its tether.
   Sabotage would be the most likely cause of a breakaway from the
mooring, but it would be a difficult target for anything but a
rocket, Wiley said.
   Because of the helium's low pressure, ``you could put probably a
dozen (bullet) holes in this Aerostat out here and it would probably
take us days to even find out we had a leak,'' he said.
   The balloon goes by various names: Aerostat (for air stationary)
Borne Radar Surveillance System; SOWRBALL (Southwest Radar Balloon);
``Fat Albert,'' and even ``Little Shamu,'' after the whale of Sea
World fame.
   At 245 feet long and 72 feet in diameter, it dwarfs a Boeing 747.
It weighs 12,750 pounds, including the 3,500-pound down-looking
radar payload strapped to its underbelly.
   But its eight-layered skin is puff-pastry thin _ at 12 mils, or
12-thousandths of an inch, it's about twice the thickness of the
tape in an audio cassette.
   That high-technology skin has high-intensity strength: about 275
pounds per linear inch, Wiley said.
   The Aerostat is anchored at a maximum height of 10,000 feet by
another high-tech wonder: a tether less than an inch in diameter and
made of Kevlar, a lightweight material used in bulletproof vests.
The tether weighs 4,250 pounds but can handle tension of more than
75,000 pounds. Inside the Kevlar are three wires providing power for
the radar package and other computerized controls, all run by
ground-station crew in an around-the-clock command center.
   ``What we have here is the latest technology in aerostats,''
Wiley said. Comparing it with another Customs surveillance balloon
flying in the Bahamas or with two Air Force radar devices in Florida
is ``like comparing an F-16 fighter to a P-51 World War II
fighter,'' he said.
   Its radar range is estimated at 160 miles, which means it can
provide detection over 80,000 square miles. That's enough to
pinpoint planes within range of Hermosillo, the Sonora, Mexico,
state capital, or twice the distance from here to Tucson.
   The balloon is intended to operate except in snow or icy
conditions, thunderstorms or heavy winds, conditions likely to keep
smugglers grounded.
   ``These cats aren't gonna be flying through those thunderstorms
either,'' Wiley said.

<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government and
U.S.-backed rebels are closer than ever to ending their 6{-year war,
but the last few steps to halt the fighting will be the most
difficult.
   The final measures are particularly crucial for the rebels, known
as Contras, who may negotiate themselves out of existence in peace
talks scheduled to resume Tuesday.
   The rebels do not have the political structure to survive as a
separate organization on the Nicaraguan political scene. Their role
likely will be taken over by the political parties already
established in the country.
   Despite their rhetoric and posturing, the Contras and the
government have been getting closer to a permanent agreement and
have set a temporary truce that no one wants to break.
   The two sides signed a preliminary agreement on March 23 in
Sapoa, a small village on the Costa Rican border.
   A 60-day cease-fire, which expired last Tuesday, has been
extended until the two sides renew their discussions in Managua, the
Nicaraguan capital.
   During the last negotiating session, the government agreed to
discuss some political reforms the Contra leadership considers
essential. These include calls for political pluralism, equality
before the law, the right to strike and a pluralistic electoral
system.
   The reforms deal with definitions of ``democratization'' _
concepts that first led to the war, which has killed more than
26,000 people and ruined the country's economy.
   The Contra leadership feels the Sandinista regime is
undemocratic, repressive and based on Marxism-Leninism.
   ``When it comes to definition of freedom of the press, civil
rights, human rights, democracy, we are using the same words with
different meanings. We are talking about two interpretations of
reality based on different ideologies,'' said Virgilio Godoy, leader
of the opposition Independent Liberal Party.
   ``I am reasonably optimistic there will be an agreement,'' he
said. ``It is not a question here of defeating the government at the
negotiating table, but of finding a way to live together.''
   Luis Rivas Leiva, a Contra adviser, said, ``The government must
learn to live with what they term petite bourgeoisie. We can live
with some of their leaders.''
   Bayardo Arce, deputy coordinator of the political commission of
the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front, said, ``There are
some in the opposition who have realized that there is political
room for them here.''
   Arce rejected charges that the government is trying to impose a
communist state.
   ``We came to power talking about building socialism in
Nicaragua,'' he said. ``But as we developed our struggle, we
understood the national realities and we opted for a system of mixed
economy with private and government property.''
   Eric Ramirez, president of the opposition Social Christian Party,
called the Sandinistas ``pragmatic and opportunistic'' but said
there was little chance of a definite agreement on democratic
reforms.
   ``Democratization is utopian in a country like ours where there
has been no democracy for more than 60 years,'' he said. ``What we
need is a continued process of democratic practices to test the
political will of the government.''
   ``If we do not agree on this,'' he said, ``the government will
act unilaterally enacting electoral laws, and other changes that
will make it look good abroad, while still talking to a divided
opposition.''
   The Sandinista government already has announced plans for
municipal elections before the 1990 presidential elections.
   Opposition party leaders believe the Contras, as an organization,
served a purpose in forcing the government to the negotiating table,
but are at their weakest while negotiating an end to the war.
   Ramirez said they will have to return and rejoin one of
Nicaragua's 14 political parties or form another party, ``which is
the last thing Nicaragua needs,'' Ramirez said.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Crop Circles Caused By Whirlwinds, Not Flying
Saucers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mysterious circles of flattened crops in the
British countryside over the centuries have been caused by
stationary whirlwinds and not ghosts or UFOs, a scientist said
Saturday.
   About 50 of the circles, with diameters of 10 to 100 feet, show
up every summer usually in fields of long grass, barley, oats or
wheat near hills, said tornado expert Terence Meaden.
   Speaking at a conference in Oxford, he dismissed speculation the
circles were caused by flying saucers, helicopters flying upside
down, supernatural beings or even herds of rotating hedgehogs, a
small porcupine.
   ``Wind usually blows round both sides of a hill and merges
smoothly round the other side,'' Meaden said. ``However, sometimes
there is a gust on one side but not the other which creates vortices
or sudden whirlwinds. These sink to the ground and flatten crops in
a spiral.''
   Meaden said the Tornado and Storm Research Organization at
Bradford in northern England, where he works, investigated 150 crop
circles over the past eight years.

   An alligator grabbed a 4-year-old girl
walking along the shores of a pond and dragged her underwater
Saturday as two horrified playmates watched, police said.
   The girl, who was not identified, remained missing after an
extensive search, Charlotte County deputies said.
   She was walking at the edge of the pond at the Gardens of Gulf
Cove development at about 6:30 p.m. when the alligator lunged from
the water, said sheriff's Capt. Robert Miller.
   ``The child was forcibly dragged into the water by the
alligator,'' Miller said. ``Our rescue units and dive teams have
conducted an extensive search and the child has not yet been
located.''
   A neighbor, Debbie Triplett, said the girl's 6-year-old brother
and a friend who is about 7 witnessed the attack. The children were
walking a dog, she said.
   Another neighbor, Nolan Jesse, said when he heard the girl's
mother screaming he went to the lake and saw a 10- to-12-foot
alligator surface twice about 20 yards away but saw nothing in its
mouth. He said that the third time the gator came up, he saw a
light-colored object in its mouth.
   Deputies and neighbors said gator prints and the child's shoe
were found at the scene.
   Divers searched for three hours among the weeds in the freshwater
lake but failed to find the alligator, Miller said. Six Florida Game
and Freshwater Fish Commission agents and several deputies and
emergency workers also participated.
   The search was scheduled to continue Sunday, Miller said, adding
that the child is still listed as missing and is not presumed dead.

   A Navy rescue instructor yelled ``Get
him!'' before a panic-stricken recruit was forced back into the
swimming pool where he died, a classmate testified Saturday.
   The classmate, Airman Apprentice Gregory William Boos, was unable
to identify which instructors were among the four or five who pulled
Airman Recruit William Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., into the pool
March 2 at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Boos was the lead witness in an investigative hearing to
determine whether six sailors should face court-martial in the death
of Mirecki.
   Another one of Mirecki's classmates, Airman Recruit Gregory
Harkrider, testified that the panic-stricken recruit had shouted
``Leave me alone ... I quit,'' and indicated he was quitting the
rescue school.
   A heart specialist testified that heart failure most likely
caused by fear-induced stress apparently killed Mirecki. But Cmdr.
Richard Osborne, a cardiologist at the Naval Aviation Medical
Institute, said his assessment was only conjecture based on a review
of the autopsy report.
   The doctor said the heart problem, known medically as ventricular
fibrillation, also could have been caused by drowning,
hyperventilation or, less likely, by gastric juices coughed up by a
victim during resuscitation attempts.
   A third student, Airman Apprentice Paul Shiver, testified he
heard the command as ``Get Mirecki!''
   Seaman Apprentice Scott Riemer said he overheard someone say,
``Maybe we used too much force,'' during a meeting between two
instructors and Lt. Thomas Torchia, the school's commander, shortly
after Mirecki was taken away in an ambulance.
   Riemer, Shiver, Boos and Harkrider now are taking technical
training at the Memphis Naval Air Station in Tennessee.
   Prior to the testimony, Lt. Steven H. Cohen, the lawyer for one
of the accused, Petty Officer 1st Class Richard E. Blevins,
complained that information from an investigation by the Judge
Advocate General's office was being withheld on orders of the
Secretary of the Navy.
   Cohen and lawyers for other defendants made a motion that the
proceedings be suspended until that information is released.
Presiding Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio rejected the request, saying
administrative proceedings are separate from the criminal case and
that he lacked authority to release the information.
   Lt. Cmdr. Larry D. Wynne, the prosecutor, assured defense lawyers
the information would be made available before the conclusion of the
hearing, which is expected to last several days.
   Boos testified that Mirecki panicked during a drill known as
``sharks and daisies.'' The exercise pits instructors, playing the
role of panicky drowning victims, against trainees, who then are
supposed to drag them underwater to break their hold and rescue them.
   Mirecki was having difficulty and swam to the side of the pool.
He was pulled off the poolside, swam back to the side, climbed out
and held on to an equipment rack, Boos said.
   ``He was panicked,'' Boos said. ``He was scared.... He was
yelling.... It was obvious he didn't want to be back in the pool.''
   Boos said he couldn't understand what Mirecki was screaming.
   The next time he saw Mirecki, Boos said, the recruit was pulled
to the side of the pool by one of the defendants, Petty Officer 2nd
Class Michael Combe.
   A second class member, Petty Officer 3rd Class John T. Breeden,
said at one point he saw Combe trying to calm Mirecki down and run
through the drill with him. Mirecki then successfully accomplished
the escape and towed Combe, he said.
   But after that exercise, Breeden testified, he saw both Mirecki
and Combe go under and then Combe surface towing Mirecki. Breeden
said he didn't actually see Mirecki being forced back in, but felt
Mirecki was clearly panicked and would not possibly have returned
voluntarily.
   Five enlisted instructors are charged with involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. They are Blevins,
Combe, Petty Officer 1st Class David J. Smith, Petty Officers 2nd
Class Frankie D. Deaton and John W. Zelenock.
   Torchia, the school's commanding officer, is charged with
dereliction of duty.
   When the hearing ends, D'Alesio will make a non-binding
recommendation to Rear Adm. David R. Morris, chief of naval air
training in Corpus Christi, Texas. The admiral can drop the charges,
court-martial the defendants or impose a non-judicial punishment.
   If convicted at court-martial each of the six could be dismissed
from the service. The five instructors also face maximum penalties
of three years in prison on the manslaughter counts and six months
for conspiracy. Torchia could be sentenced to a maximum of three
months in jail.

   Negotiators for striking scriptwriters and
movie and television producers met for about seven hours Saturday
and agreed only to return to the bargaining table Sunday, a
spokeswoman said.
   The two chief negotiators for the Writers Guild of America and
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers met from 1
p.m. until 8 p.m. Saturday at the producers' headquarters, said WGA
spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   The two sides were scheduled to meet again Sunday in an effort to
end the 13-week-old walkout, she said.
   The substance of the talks was withheld, as were details of a
negotiating session on Friday. ``I can only say the discussions are
ongoing,'' Rhoden said Saturday night.
   The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute that centers on
payments, called residuals, for reruns of one-hour television shows.
Demand for one-hour shows in rerun, or syndication, is declining,
and the producers had sought to tie payments to a show's success in
reruns.
   Also at issue in the strike are writers' demands for more say
over changes made in scripts during filming and more credit on and
off screen for their work.
   The guild has signed other contracts with about 80 independent
producers, but the alliance maintains none of its larger members
have signed and that the producers who did defect employ only a tiny
fraction of the 3,000 active writers.

   A strong earthquake triggered
landslides, shattered windows and caused power blackouts in the
lower half of New Zealand's south island on Saturday, officials said.
   The quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, but damage was
limited because the quake was centered on the sparsely-populated
area of Lake Te Anau, north of the town of Invercargill, officials
said.
   There were no immedate reports of injuries.
   Murray Lowry of the Wellington Seismological Observatory said
Sunday that aftershocks could be expected to continue for as long as
a month.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 6.0 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage
and a 7.0 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread
heavy damage.

   Telephone technicians restored service just
after midnight Sunday to the last of 35,000 western suburban
customers whose phones were disrupted by a Mother's Day fire,
company officials said.
   ``It went very smoothly, and everything should be back to normal
now,'' Illinois Bell spokeswoman Pat Montgomery said early Sunday,
shortly after the final adjustments were made at the Hinsdale
switching station.
   By throwing the switch at midnight, Bell hooked up the last set
of subscribers in Hinsdale and five other west Chicago suburbs. The
customers would be switched to new state-of-the-art digital
equipment at the Hinsdale station, which was ravaged by fire May 8.
   ``Technically, this should be the end of it,'' said Hilary
Anderson, an Illinois Bell spokeswoman. ``We are putting everybody
back in service ... but there might be some little glitches that we
will have to work out.
   The switching station equipment connects local and long distance
calls.
   Half the Hinsdale customers were connected to the new equipment
at midnight May 26, but the other half continued to suffer impaired
phone service, including sporadic dial tones and static on the line.
   The company promised rebates to customers for the disruptions,
but several businessmen upset about their losses have filed lawsuits
charging the telephone company was negligent in failing to staff the
switching station at the time of the fire.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Awad Deported</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs of detail on deportation case and libel suit,
background on uprising.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday upheld a
government decision to deport Arab-American Mubarak Awad, an
advocate of civil disobedience toward Israeli rule in the occupied
territories.
   The court said it will delay the deportation until next Sunday,
apparently to give Awad time to appear in court for a civil libel
suit against the Israeli daily Maariv.
   Awad, 44, responded to the ruling by saying, ``I am not
disappointed. I will continue to fight for a Palestinian state
wherever I am.''
   The decison by the three-judge panel was read in a 10-minute
session only hours before U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
who protested the deportation order, was due to arrive in Israel to
pursue a peace initiative.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad deported May 6, after
the Arab-American was arrested the previous day and accused of
playing a role in inciting the six-month-old Arab uprising in the
occupied territories.
   The Jerusalem-born Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio,
has denied the charges.
   Awad describes himself as an adherent of the late Indian leader
Mohandas K. Ghandi's philosophy of civil disobedience. He has
authored a widely-circulated pamphlet called `Non-Violent
Resistance: A Strategy for the Occupied Territories.''
   In a statement from jail after he was ordered deported, Awad
said: ``For Prime Minister Shamir to say that I, a Christian, will
be forever prevented from returning to my city of Jerusalem to pray
in my holy places is totally unacceptable.''
   Awad was born in Jerusalem when the city was ruled by neighboring
Jordan. His appeal against the deportation was considered by his
lawyers to be a test case for the status of Palestinians under
Israeli rule in the city.
   Israel annexed east Jerusalem after capturing the sector of the
city from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Israel's grounds for deportation was that Awad failed to renew a
tourist visa that expired last year. Awad's attorneys, Jonathan
Kuttab and Avraham Gal contended he did not need a visa and should
be allowed permanent residence because he was born in Jerusalem.
   In issuing the deportation order, Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner
accused Awad on May 7th of helping to compile a series of leaflets
urging Palestinians to throw stones and firebombs at Israeli targets.
   According to U.N. figures, 201 Palestinians have been killed in
the uprising. Three Israelis have also died.
   Awad's American-born wife Nancy Nye responded by telling
reporters last month that her husband was committed to non-violence
but also to the ``intefadeh,'' which is Arabic for uprising.
   She said Awad supported measures such as merchant strikes and
boycotts of Israeli goods which matched Awad's philosophy of civil
disobedience.
   Awad's Israeli lawyer Avraham Gal won court approval to delay his
client's deportation, pending another hearing in a $100,000 libel
suit.
   In the suit filed last week, Awad challenged Maariv for claiming
in an article on May 13 that he dealt in drugs and channeled the
proceeds to the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   The half-brother of Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson was arrested in Greenville, S.C., and
charged with hiring someone to attack a murder witness, police said
Sunday.
   Noah Robinson, 45, was arrested late Saturday night and charged
with being an accessory to a felony, obstruction of justice,
intimidating a witness and criminal conspiracy, according to
Greenville Police Detective Keith Morton.
   Morton said Robinson, a small businessman in Greenville who has
also worked in Chicago, is suspected of hiring someone who slashed
and stabbed a woman who was a witness to the execution-style murder
of a man who had worked for Robinson.
   ``We think he was responsible for the solicitation of the act and
took part in the arranging,'' said Morton.
   Robinson, who gave police a home address in Chicago, and Jackson
have the same father. Jackson, who has spoken frequently on the
campaign trail of his beginnings, was born out of wedlock to a woman
who had an affair with the candidate's father, who was married at
the time.
   Jackson and Robinson have had a chaotic relationship over the
years, at times working together but also quarreling and staying
apart.
   Jackson had Robinson take control of the federally funded
Breadbasket Commercial Association Inc., an arm of Jackson's civil
rights group, Operation PUSH, that helped minority firms bid for
public contracts.
   But Jackson was quoted as saying in 1987, when Robinson was
reportedly being investigated for allegedly violating federal
bankruptcy laws, ``I have no connection with him.''
   Bob Borosage, a Jackson campaign spokesman, declined to comment
early Sunday.
   A duty officer at the Greenville, S.C., Detention Center said
Robinson was being held Sunday in lieu of $100,000 bond, although
Morton said prosecutors planned to seek a higher bond.
   The warrant filed late Saturday charges that Robinson ``did
advise, counsel, urge encourage or otherwise aid a co-defendant in
the commission of a felony, assault and battery with intent to kill
... and later rendered assistance to the co-defendant in absconding
the jurisdiction.''
   A man turned charged with assault and battery with intent to kill
in the attack turned himself in to authorities in January, according
to the Greenville News.
   Morton said Robinson was arrested after statements from
``co-defendants'' and that more arrests are expected.
   According to Morton, Janice Denice Rosemond was stabbed
repeatedly in December 1987, after she had testified before a grand
jury in Chicago about the slaying of Leroy Barber.
   Barber was shot to death in January 1986 outside a plaza in
Greenville Robinson owns.
   ``From what we understand, there had been several altercations
over the years between Barber and Robinson. He had been working for
Robinson in Chicago and come back to Greenville,'' said Morton.
``They'd gotten into a fight a couple of weeks before'' Barber was
shot.
   Morton said Barber was shot once in the head by an unidentified
assailant and ``Rosemond, unfortunately, was a witness to that.'
   No one has been charged with the Barber slaying, said Morton.

   Rescuers on Sunday found the bodies
of eight more miners killed in a powerful coal mine blast, bringing
the confirmed death toll to 45 in West Germany's worst mining
accident in 26 years.
   Six men who survived three days in an underground air pocket were
rescued Saturday after a microphone lowered into a shaft picked up
their voices and tapping sounds.
   Peter Carl Ruehland, a spokesman for Preussen Elektra, the
company that owns the mine, said rescuers were continuing the search
for six miners still missing since the blast Wednesday.
   Residents of Borken, 70 miles northeast of Frankfurt, were to
hold a service later Sunday to remember the victims of the tragedy.
   In an interview with the ZDF television network, surviving miner
Ahmet Batkan said he and the five other miners contacted rescuers by
radio just hours after the blast, but that the rescuers apparently
thought the six were with the search teams.
   Officials said the survivors were trapped about 500 feet
underground in an air pocket away from carbon monoxide estimated at
50 times the level fatal to humans.
   Officials said about 200 workers were involved in the search in
Borken, a town of 15,000 people.
   The Borken explosion is the worst West German mining accident
since 299 men died in 1962 at the Luisenthal mine in Saarland state
along the border with France.

   A freight car exploded as a train approached a
station east of the Soviet capital, killing more than 50 people,
injuring hundreds more and throwing cars and trucks into the air
like feathers, Izvestia reported Sunday.
   The government newspaper said the accident occurred at exactly
9:30 a.m. Saturday and the blast was so powerful it broke windows a
quarter-mile away.
   It said the cause of the explosion was as yet unknown, and gave
no hint of what the freight car that exploded might have been
carrying.
   The blast occurred as the train neared the station in Arzamas,
about 240 miles east of Moscow, Izvestia said.
   ``At its very epicenter were trucks and cars, which were waiting
for the train to pass,'' Izvestia said. ``They were scattered about
as though they were down.''
   As a result of the explosion, Izvestia said, ``more than 50
people were killed, and hundreds were wounded.''
   More than 80 doctors were airlifted by helicopter to the accident
site from the regional center of Gorky, Izvestia said.
   The explosion destroyed nearby homes and businesses, set off
small fires in many places, derailed other freight cars and damaged
the rails, Izvestia said. Driven forward by the blast, the
locomotive was flipped end over end and landed beside the tracks.
   Firefighters manning a dozen fire trucks managed to douse the
main blaze about a half-hour after the explosion, the newspaper said.
   A mobile hospital able to care for 230 people was quickly set up
near the accident scene, it said.
   A special government commission was created under the deputy
chairman of the Council of Ministers, Gennady G. Vedernikov, to
determine the causes of the explosion and deal with the
consequences. Vedernikov's high position indicated the seriousness
of the accident.
   He told Izvestia local residents instantly offered to help
victims of the explosion by donating blood and food.
   People left homeless by the explosion have been placed in
apartments, Vedernikov said.
   A special ``operations group,'' military units and the local
civil defense are directing relief work, Vedernikov said.
   The 14-member government commission includes representatives of
the Health Ministry, police, the Ministry of Defense, the
prosecutor's office and other agencies.
   ``A thorough investigation is being conducted into the causes of
the explosion,'' Vedernikov said. ``I cannot yet say anything about
the results.''

   A bus collided with a freight train at a
railroad crossing near the capital, killing 16 people and injuring
56, police said Sunday.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said nine
bus passengers died late Saturday when the bus smashed into the
train about 12 miles west of Harare.
   Seven others died at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare and 56
people were hurt in the wreck, nine of them seriously, he said.
   One railroad worker aboard the train was among the injured.
   On May 20, six people died and about 50 were injured in a similar
smash on the railroad line 60 miles east of Harare.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Sunday
urged Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and restore rights to Palestinians.
   ``Now is the time for further progress toward peace,'' Shultz
said at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv after he
arrived for a seven-hour visit to pursue his Middle East peace
initiative.
   ``The continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead end. To continue it
is an illusion,'' Shultz said.
   ``The United States has put forward a plan for negotiations. No
party has the luxury to turn aside a chance to negotiate.''
   Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the 1967 Middle
East war. Since anti-occupation unrest broke out in the occupied
lands on Dec. 8, Israeli soldiers have killed more than 200
Palestinians. Two Israelis have been killed.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres greeted Shultz. ``We look
upon you as a man with a message, a man who carries a message of
peace to all of us,'' he said.
   Peres said there was a choice ``between the continued arms race,
fanatacism, fundamentalism and other manifestations of extremism and
the tough decision required to block this trend and to offer the
Middle East Arabs and Jews alike a different future.''
   Before Shultz arrived, Peres, who heads the leftist Labor Party,
told Israel radio, ``I will do all I can to advance the peace
process. ... Let's say the peace process dies, then what's the
alternative?''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, however, who objects to parts of
Shultz's plan, told Israel radio Saturday he does not expect a
breakthrough.
   Shamir, who heads the right-wing Likud bloc, objects to trading
land for peace. He also opposes a proposed international peace
conference in which Western countries would mediate a settlement of
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   On Sunday, Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said the premier
``greatly welcomes the visit, the efforts Mr. Shultz is making to
advance the peace process.''
   Ahimeir also said Shamir will will raise Israel's concern about
the use of chemical weapons by Arab states and their newly-purchased
medium-range missiles.
   ``He (Shamir) feels that the whole free world should raise its
voice against the use of these weapons'' by Arab states, Ahimeir
said.
   Shultz is also expected to report to Israeli leaders on Moscow
summit last week and the talks he held in Cairo, Israeli officials
said.
   Peres told Israel radio he was encouraged by changes he said he
has detected in the Kremlin's approach to the Middle East.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the
1967 war, but gradually has resumed contacts over the last two years.
   After the Moscow summit, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also
said he would consider ``regularizing'' ties with Israel once an
international conference was underway.
   ``In the past the Soviet Union has been mostly a weapons supplier
to the Middle East,'' Peres said. Now ``they (the Soviets) support
compromise. This is a real change.''

<HEAD>Libya Denounces U.S. For Terrorist Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya on Sunday denounced the United States for
saying that groups supported by Libya were suspected in recent
attacks against Americans and U.S. facilities around the world.
   The official JANA news agency, monitored in Rome, said the
allegations were made to undermine Libya, hinder Arab unity and
force Libya to retreat from its ``support of the massive popular
revolution in occupied Palestine.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington on
Friday that groups that have received support from Libya were the
``prime suspects'' in recent attacks against U.S. and western
European interests in Europe, Latin American and Africa.
   She did not accuse Libya directly but said suspicion of its
continued support of terrorism was accompanied by ``concrete
evidence.''
   Mrs. Oakley referred to the seizure last November in France of a
shipment of Libyan weapons allegedly intended for the outlawed Irish
Republican Army. She also cited reports that suspected Libyan agents
were arrested carrying bomb-making materials in Senegal in February.
   JANA said the statements affirm again the U.S. government's
``reliance on the language of threat in international dealings.''
   ``We interpret this new threat by the U.S. administration against
Libya as a start of aggression ... without any justification but
hatred and the spirit of domination and racism,'' it said.
   For years, Libya has been one of a few nations identified by the
State Department as sponsors of terrorist groups. The Reagan
administration has accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of
fomenting terrorism.
   In April 1986, U.S. warplanes attacked his personal living
quarters in Tripoli. He was not hit.
   Around the second anniversary of the attack, there were several
terrorist attacks on installations and clubs owned or frequented by
Americans.
   Among the targets hit this year were U.S. Information Agency
offices in Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru and a club frequented by
American servicemen in Naples, Italy.
   Five people were killed in the Naples attack. Two Americans were
wounded in an attack on a club in Khartoum, Sudan, last month, and
the office of a U.S. bank in New Delhi was also targeted.

<HEAD>Sixteen Soldiers Killed In Rebel Ambush</HEAD>

   Communist rebels ambushed a platoon
of soldiers trying to retrieve a hijacked truck Sunday, killing 16
and wounding eight in one of the bloodiest rebel attacks this year,
officials said.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
troops managed to fight back and killed an undetermined number of
rebels during the hour-long battle on an isolated mountain road.
   Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus charged that unidentified
European governments were indirectly financing communist rebels.
Manglapus made the accusation on the third day of a conference among
representatives of 13 Asian, European and Latin American countries
that have won their freedom from dictators.
   A sketchy military report said 24 soldiers and militiamen were
traveling on foot when they came under fire from an unknown number
of New People's Army guerrillas outside Silay city, 300 miles
southeast of Manila and about 25 miles from Bacalod.
   The rebels fled when more troops backed by helicopter gunships
and armored personnel carriers arrived, the report said.
   Residents of nearby villages evacuated their homes as troops
continued to hunt the rebels after the battle, which began at 2
p.m., the officials said.
   Local radio reports said the ambushed soldiers were on their way
to retrieve a truck loaded with fertilizer that rebels abandoned
after hijacking it Saturday night. The truck belonged to one of the
biggest sugar producing companies on Negros island.
   The New People's Army is one of 12 Marxist groups that have been
waging a 19-year insurgency in the Philippines.
   The National Democratic Front is the umbrella organization for
the groups. The Philippine military estimates that the front
received $15 million in aid last year from groups in Europe, the
United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
   Manglapus said foreign aid to the rebels came from
non-governmental organizations but noted that such groups in Europe
are subsidized by some governments.
   ``This, of course, is practically an official flow of money, and
our armed forces and intelligence agencies tell us that this takes
place regularly in a systematic manner,'' Manglapus said.
   He said he has filed formal protests with the European
governments concerned but did not identify any of them. He said he
has not raised the matter with the U.S., Japanese, Australian and
New Zealand governments but did not say why.
   Earlier, Greece's representative in the conference denied claims
by the National Democratic Front that Greece's governing Panhellenic
Socialist Party was among its supporters.
   ``We have nothing in common with insurgents and, therefore, we
deplore such cheap and shameless lies,'' said George Lianis,
Greece's ambassador to Japan.
   Other countries attending the conference were Portugal, Uruguay,
Honduras, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Spain,
Argentina and the Dominican Republic.
   South Korea, the United States, Norway, Switzerland and were
represented as observers.

   Raymond Riha Jr. was worth between $6
million and $10 million before he was 45, had a successful company,
owned property in Alabama and Florida, drove expensive cars and was
married with two children.
   That life collapsed in less than two years after he began smoking
cocaine.
   He recently pleaded guilty to two cocaine trafficking charges and
one possession charge, and was sentenced to 15 years on each. A
hearing is scheduled June 17 to determine how much of the sentence
must be served behind bars. He also awaits trial on a fourth charge.
   During a recent series of interviews at the Jefferson County
Jail, Riha, 45, told the Birmingham Post-Herald about his downfall.
   ``That pipe, that person, that thing in my hand, it was very much
alive; it was a living thing to me,'' Riha said. ``I talked to it,
and it answered me. It came back with positive-plus reactions and
answers and made me work everything out in my mind. It lies all the
time.''
   His personal net worth is down to $100,000 by some estimates. The
company he founded in Pelham, Southern Resistance Welding, which
grossed about $6 million a year and employed 25 people, is bankrupt.
   He says he had never used any kind of drug until one day in
October 1986 when he walked into the home of a friend and walked out
about 12 hours later, hooked on cocaine.
   ``I said, `What is this? There is no such thing on earth that
could do that to me, that could take control of me,'' Riha said. ``I
took the pipe and smoked it so nonchalantly that first time.''
   The drug relaxed him. ``All my worries disappeared,'' he said.
   He had plenty of money and plenty of time, and gave himself over
to binge after binge.
   ``It is not unusual for a person to lose everything they have,''
said Dr. Joe Rice, clinical director of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham Center for Health Professionals in Chelsea. ``The unusual
situation here is that this individual had so much to lose.''
   The drug interfered with Riha's closest interests.
   A horse-racing fan from his childhood in Cleveland, he was one of
the first to invest in the new Birmingham Turf Club, purchasing
1,000 shares of stock and 51 limited partnerships. He signed up his
company to rent of one of the prestigious boxes at $25,000 a year.
   But when the horse track opened March 3, 1987, ``it took
everything I could muster to get there,'' he said. ``I almost didn't
make it through the evening. And I found myself leaving to go to my
car between the races to hit the pipe.''
   He fulfilled another lifelong dream by investing about $400,000
to put together a dragster and crew, but when the car was ready to
race in January 1987, it held no interest and Riha only made it to a
few races.
   ``It's amazing how the drug can take your interest in everything
away, from hobbies to your business, sex, love, everything, and
replace it with itself,'' said Riha.
   Riha was arrested on drug charges twice but returned to cocaine
use late last year after a month in a rehabilitation program.
   On Christmas Day last year, Riha said, ``I sat there looking at
bankruptcy papers, the suit my father filed against me for the
$400,000 I had borrowed from him over the years, divorce papers that
never went through and the criminal charges. `Well, merry Christmas,
Ray,' I said. But at least I had my pipe there, too.''
   Later he was arrested for allegedly giving cocaine to a minor,
the 17-year-old daughter of his mistress. He said she took it from
him. She testified she was working for the police and that he gave
her cocaine when she asked for it.
   ``I don't think I was meant to go sit in prison,'' Riha said. ``I
didn't go through all this to end this way.''

   Princess Diana's mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, said
Sunday she has separated from her second husband, wallpaper heir
Peter Shand-Kydd.
   ``I would like it to be known that my husband and I have
separated, which is a great sadness to us both. No one else is
involved,'' Mrs. Shand-Kydd, 52, said in a statement issued by her
lawyers.
   Buckingham Palace had no comment, and Mrs. Shand-Kydd said,
``Neither Peter nor I will be making any further statement.''
   The announcement followed a report in the Sunday tabloid News of
the World that the marriage was on the rocks and Shand-Kydd, 63,
wanted to return to his first wife, Janet.
   Diana, wife of British heir apparent Prince Charles, was 6 years
old when her mother left her father, the eighth Earl Spencer, in
1967. Spencer was granted a divorce two years later because of his
wife's adultery with Shand Kydd, and she was named the ``other
woman'' in the uncontested divorce of Peter and Janet Shand-Kydd.
   She married Shand-Kydd soon after both divorces were final.

   Television talk show host Oprah Winfrey
came home for the renaming of the winding gravel road that runs in
front of the house where she was born.
   The three-mile lane that is wide enough for two cars is now
officially known as the Oprah Winfrey Road.
   ``This is a real homecoming,'' Winfrey said to the 300 people
gathered Saturday for the ribbon-cutting ceremony in the rural
community of Buffalo, three miles outside Kosciusko in central
Mississippi. ``It is a deeply humbling experience to come back to
the place where it all started. No one ever goes very far in life
without remembering where they came from.''
   ``Hopefully, we can get it blacktopped,'' Don Hayes, chairman of
the ``Welcome Home Oprah'' day festivities, said of the road. ``Most
of her family lived in that community.''
   Winfrey, 34, spoke at the old, white, wood-frame Buffalo United
Methodist Church, where she said she made her first public
appearance at an Easter recital when she was 3 years old. A new
brick church stands across the road.
   Winfrey spent the early part of her childhood living with her
grandmother in the poor community before moving to Milwaukee with
her mother at age 6.
   ``We love you, we love what you are doing,'' said Northern
District Highway Commissioner Zack Stewart, who cut the ribbon with
Winfrey. ``We love what you stand for.''

   Like the yuppies they play on
``thirtysomething,'' Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig worry about
juggling careers, ambition, marriage and a home life.
   Olin, who plays the brooding, analytical Philadelphia adman
Michael Steadman, and Wettig, his real-life wife who plays the wife
of Steadman's partner Elliott, both admit in the June 11 issue of TV
Guide that active acting careers cause other aspects of their lives
to suffer at times.
   ``You've got kids and a marriage and work, all at the same
time,'' said Wettig. ``From my perspective all three things are
extremely important and I'm not willing to give up any of them, but
I find at different times one is always suffering.''
   ``Sometimes I feel like I'm in competition with her work,'' Olin
said. ``It's like being in competition with the children. I'm
competitive for her attention.''
   He also admits he fears being eclipsed by his wife. ``My fear is
that Patti will have all these opportunities and she will meet men
and work more interesting than I am ... and she will leave me.''
   But Wettig said she expects almost the opposite. ``I assume that
Ken, being a guy, being his age, and where he's sitting now, I kind
of assume that he will probably make more money than me and be more
famous.''
   Sound familiar? It should. Producer Marshall Herskovitz uses the
couple as a sounding board for scripts and plots on the nature of a
yuppie marriage.

   Rock singer Ted Nugent escaped injury when
he crashed on the cool-down lap after winning the Dodge
International Star Challenge celebrity auto race.
   Nugent rolled his Dodge Shelby Z after the race was over at
Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, but walked away from the accident
Saturday.
   ``I didn't have a brake to be found,'' Nugent said. ``I dragged
my foot, I started back peddling _ it didn't work!''
   Nugent beat RATT drummer Bobby Blotzer by 19.612 seconds in the
12-lap race around the 2.4-mile road course. He averaged 76.376 mph.
   The race was the second in a series of four races to highlight a
national public awareness campaign called ``TH!NK, Don't Drive and
Drink.''
   ``If people who drink and do drugs could ever get as high as I
did just driving that car, they'd realize what chumps they are,''
Nugent said.
   Fee Waybill, former lead singer of the Tubes, finished third, and
Alto Reed, Bob Seger's saxaphonist in the Silver Bullet Band, was
fourth.

   Palestinian merchants struggling for financial
survival in the occupied lands face threats from both sides in the
Arab uprising _ a fact driven home during Secretary of State George
P. Shultz's visit.
   Underground leaders of the uprising threaten to burn Arab stores
if they don't observe general strikes, such as the three-day work
stoppage ordered to protest Shultz's visit to Israel on Sunday.
   At the same time, the Israeli government uses taxes as one of its
major weapons for fighting the uprising.
   ``If I open, they will burn it,'' said grocer Sahli Sagari, 43,
standing outside his shop in east Jerusalem.
   Sagari already has tasted the other side of the equation.
   In May, he and 13 other merchants on the Street of the Prophets
opened at the specific hours ordered by uprising leaders. They were
shut down by Israeli police and charged with violating laws that
could mean two years in prison. They now await trial.
   Merchants say the government drive to enforce tax payments _
ordered boycotted by uprising leaders _ has disrupted some
businesses and forced others to close.
   ``There's no way any company can clear anything unless all taxes
are paid,'' said Serop T. Ohannessian, general manager of a paper
factory in Ramallah.
   A tax receipt must be shown for a marriage license or a birth
certificate. Merchants say they need to produce such receipts for
everything from export and import licenses to trucks and machinery.
   Tanus Abu Aitah has shut his Jordan Plastics Company near
Bethlehem, which employed about 300 workers. He complained he was
caught between the Palestinian strikes, which cut his production,
and the government's tax demands.
   ``I am losing my customers because I'm not producing all their
needs,'' he said. ``As for the taxes, I have to pay them whether we
are working full-time or not. If I don't pay, I will be arrested.
The best solution is to close the factory.''
   Israeli officials say some Arab merchants have begged the army to
force shops to open to relieve merchants of the threat of revenge
from young men behind the uprising or the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   But most merchants say they back the uprising's goal of ending
the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, which
Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
The merchants also don't want to lose customers who are making
sacrifices for the uprising.
   Ohannessian, the paper products man, said he has closed his
entire plastic diaper line, laying off about 70 of his 150 workers,
because of another problem.
   While Israelis are stopping his trucks from reaching the Gaza
Strip during the uprising, Israeli manufacturers are shipping paper
diapers to the West Bank under Arab-sounding product names, he said.
   ``What has happened is we're completely encircled,'' he said.
``They (Israeli competitors) can extend credit to stores at a time
when I have to ask for payment right away.''
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, the owner of a food products
factory who gave his name only as Abed said merchants trying to
bring goods into Israel also run into tax collectors at army
checkpoints.
   ``They stop any truck without a tax receipt. Then they confiscate
the product and the truck,'' he said.
   He said Hebron's merchants fear youths who have burned cars and
shops after owners were accused of breaking the strike.
   In the hillside Haret al-Sheikh section of Hebron, a group of
young men explained that it was rarely necessary to burn anything to
persuade people to strike.
   ``First we send them a threatening letter,'' said one of the
seven or eight present. ``If that doesn't work, we throw a `Molotov'
at the wall around their house, then set a tire on fire outside. The
fourth step is to burn shops and cars.''
   Some merchants find a way around orders in the underground
uprising's leaflets, such as the one that requires Palestinian
businesses to open only in the mornings.
   Jamal Tawil, 26, keeps his east Jerusalem supermarket shuttered
each afternoon, but cut a hole in the wall from his adjacent house
so customers can enter the store unnoticed.
   But even Tawil closes up the hole during general strikes.
   ``I don't want to lose the business,'' he said.

<BYLINE>Is the Gun Lobby Losing Its Clout?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Rifle Association political chief
Wayne LaPierre makes frequent visits to Capitol Hill, but his
meeting with Democratic Sen. J. James Exon on May 27 was anything
but routine.
   The NRA, long considered one of Washington's most influential
lobbying organizations, never apologizes for the harsh attacks it
makes on lawmakers opposing its positions. But here was LaPierre _
according to Exon's recollection _ admitting the group had gone too
far in attacking a senator who has been a longtime supporter of gun
owners.
   ``I think their influence has deteriorated some,'' said Exon. And
the conservative Nebraskan's view is shared by the NRA's traditional
opponents, like Handgun Control, Inc., and NRA's more recent
antagonists, the nation's major law enforcement organizations.
   Exon, who parted with the organization over a bill to ban plastic
guns that could escape detection at airport metal detectors, said
that what he saw as LaPierre's apologetic tone reinforced his
conclusion.
   But LaPierre, director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative
Action, denies his comments to Exon amounted to an apology, and
rejects any view that the pro-gun group has lost a step.
   ``Our base is as good as gold,'' LaPierre says. ``We're going to
be in good shape as long as there are 70 million Americans who own
guns and 25 million who hunt. There are 70 senators and 260 House
members who have never voted against us.''
   But Exon described a different mood: ``They indicated to me they
had fallen down badly in communications. They said they were going
to do everything they could to remedy that. They said they may have
over-reacted in the type of advertising and letter-writing to my
constituents.''
   While Exon believes the NRA has lost influence by attacking its
friends, the group's political opponents cite other reasons for
their view. Among them:
   _The NRA's switch from opposition to support of a bill to ban
undetectable plastic guns, legislation that is a top priority of gun
control and police groups and is sponsored by NRA nemesis Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   The NRA changed its mind after police groups successfully lobbied
Attorney General Edwin Meese III to support their version of the
measure.
   LaPierre says the NRA switched only after new language made clear
the bill would ban only still non-existent plastic handguns, not
existing metal pistols. ``A victory for the NRA,'' LaPierre says.
   _A stunning gun control triumph in Maryland, where Gov. William
Donald Schaefer, in a ceremony with some 200 police officers, signed
a bill May 27 to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday
Night Specials.
   LaPierre said the NRA's supporters have begun an effort,
successful in its early stages, to place a repeal referendum on the
ballot.
   _The Minnesota Senate Judiciary Committee's defeat of an
NRA-backed constitutional amendment proposal to clarify the right to
keep and bear arms. Also, the failure of the NRA in Wisconsin to win
passage of legislation that would have prohibited local governments
from passing any gun control law stricter than state law.
   LaPierre contends that state legislatures passed 18 NRA-backed
bills in 1986, 24 last year and 13 so far this year. ``There's only
one gun control bill that's gone through, and that's in Maryland,''
he says. ``It was our agenda being discussed in state legislatures,
not the other side's.''
   _In the 1986 congressional elections, not a single incumbent
targeted for defeat by the NRA lost his or her seat.
   LaPierre: ``It's very tough to defeat incumbents in Congress
these days. Most members of Congress who vote for gun control are in
safe districts and nobody's going to beat them. There are few
competitive districts left where the gun issue is the (major)
issue.''
   _In recent congressional battles and numerous state gun control
fights, the NRA and the organized police groups have clashed
bitterly. This has given state lawmakers and members of Congress a
political escape hatch, allowing them to oppose the NRA by
supporting their local police.
   ``I don't see their relationship with police as ever being very
good again,'' says Jerald Vaughn, executive director of the
International Association of Chiefs of Police.
   LaPierre says he held meetings recently with ``three or four''
members of Congress, ``people who we felt were confused'' over the
early version of the plastic gun bill. ``They're still friends of
the NRA.''
   LaPierre's view of his meeting with Exon: ``I view it as
informational. If information is fence-mending, and fence-mending is
information, I guess you could interchange them.''
   Vaughn says of the NRA, ``They are by no means out of the
picture, but there are signs their stranglehold on this
administration and Congress is starting to loosen a bit. There's a
growing recognition in law enforcement the NRA is an organization
out of control. But politically, they're a savvy organization. They
make sure they're never in a position of having to admit defeat.''
   N.T. ``Pete'' Shields, chairman of Handgun Control Inc., says the
entry of law enforcement groups into the fray has been crucial.
   ``The NRA used to call us bleeding-heart communists, soft on
criminals,'' Shields says. ``Now, whole law enforcement community _
the guys on the firing line on the street _ is behind it (the fight
to control guns). It's not credible to think of those people as
bleeding-heart, liberal communists.''

<HEAD>GOP Senate Candidates See Meese As Liability</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican Senate candidates, increasingly
concerned about political fallout from Edwin Meese's legal problems,
are beginning to call on the attorney general to leave President
Reagan's Cabinet.
   At least four GOP candidates have urged Meese to resign and
others have hinted they would like to see him go.
   Leading Republicans such as Vice President George Bush and White
House staff chief Howard H. Baker Jr. have conceded Meese's troubles
could severely damage GOP prospects this election year. But the
attorney general has insisted he has done nothing wrong and will
remain in office until he can ``set the record straight.''
   Independent Counsel James McKay is expected to issue his report
this month on Meese's conduct. Sources familiar with the probe said
the report would not recommend an indictment but would raise
questions about Meese's ethical conduct.
   In recent interviews Meese has refused to say when he might leave
office, but has ruled out a departure before his name is cleared
``because people would say there was something wrong.''
   Meese's strongest defender in the administration is Reagan, who
has said that ``only a complete change of (Meese's) character''
would prompt him to ask his old friend to resign.
   However, that view is not shared by many Republicans involved in
tough election campaigns.
   Bush said he met early last month with Meese, and the attorney
general assured him he would do nothing to jeopardize the vice
president's presidential campaign.
   In a recent interview, Bush also said that Meese has ``been made
aware by the polls and by a lot of public comment that there is the
danger that this matter, if it stays exactly the way it is, could
not only adversely affect me, but others as well.''
   During a recent television interview, Baker acknowledge Bush's
discomfort.
   ``It's a difficult situation,'' he said on the NBC show, ``Meet
the Press.'' ``It's an unfortunate situation. It's one that
obviously troubles the vice president. But in the final analysis,
the only person who can make a judgment on this is the president of
the United States, and the president has expressed his continued
confidence in the attorney general.''
   Pete Dawkins, battling to oust Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg
of New Jersey, told a college commencement audience recently: ``I
believe Ed Meese should step down as our nation's leading law
enforcement officer.''
   Mayor George Voinovich of Cleveland, the Republican challenger
trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, recently
declared that ``for the good of the country, the president, the
Justice Department and the Republican Party, Mr. Meese should
resign.''
   ``If Mr. Meese ever had any use to the administration, it has
long since passed ... he ought to go,'' said Slade Gorton, the
former Republican senator, trying to capture the seat being vacated
by Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash.
   A fourth GOP Senate candidate, Bill Anderson, who is running
against Democratic Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee, recently wrote
Meese to say, ``I urge you to step aside and resign as attorney
general to enhance the credibility of that office as well as the
credibility of the presidency.''
   Several Republican senators have stopped barely short of outright
calls for Meese to resign.
   Sen. David Karnes of Nebraska, fighting a challenge from
Democratic former Gov. Robert Kerry, recently said he did not think
Meese was a factor in his race. But then he added, ``I'm not going
to be writing any letters saying please stay.''
   Typical of one approach was that of Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. When
asked about Meese, the senator, who is up for re-election, said he
believes it is up to the president to decide but then adds that he
thinks Reagan might be better served by someone else.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., has said he expected McKay to issue ``a
very serious and condemnatory'' report. In that case, he said, if
Meese didn't resign, the report would go to the Office of
Professional Responsibility, which the senator described as ``a very
tough office.'' Heinz said he anticipated that office ``would
recommend that Meese either resign or be fired by the president.''

<HEAD>Environmentalist, Politician Pledge To Bring Wolves Back To
Yellowstone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental leader
and a Western politician have taken up the cause of the wolf,
calling for its return to the wilds of the nation's first national
park.
   They added their voices Saturday to that of the head of the
National Park Service, who said that the howl of the wolf is ``the
call, the music, of the West.''
   Lined up in opposition are the majority of cattlemen and sheepmen
in the West backed by Wymoning's two U.S. senators and one
representative.
   Speaking at the annual meeting of the Greater Yellowstone
Coalition, Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, and M. Rupert Cutler, president
of the Defenders of Wildlife, urged national support for restoration
of the wolf to Yellowstone National Park.
   The coalition, formed in 1983, consists of about 50 national,
regional and local organizations that monitor management of the 2.5
million-acre park.
   Nearly all of America's wolf population was wiped out earlier
this century by ranchers, farmers and bounty hunters. There have
been a few sightings of lone wolves in a few Western states. A pack
of wolves migrated across the Canadian border into Glacier National
Park two years ago, but left this year to go back into British
Columbia.
   Efforts to revive the wolf population in Minnesota have resulted
in about 1,200 wolves there. Efforts to restart the red wolf
population in Virginia and Mexican wolf colonies in the Southwest
also are under way.
   Noting that the reintroduction of the gray wolf into Yellowstone
is endorsed by the National Park Service, Owens said: ``I am always
offended when we politicians substitute our own value judgments for
those of professional land managers.
   ``There is a theory among the Wyoming and Montana congressional
delegations that they own Yellowstone,'' said Owens.
   Owens said he introduced a bill in Congress after discovering in
Yellowstone park last fall that ``the wolf recovery program had been
completely sidetracked by political interference.''
   The bill would order the Interior Department to implement the
Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan drawn up by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. It would re-establish wolves in the entire
northern Rocky Mountain region, including Yellowstone.
   ``It was clear to me when I introduced the bill that I could not
pass it,'' said Owens, ``but I hoped to expose the wolf to daylight.
There is no predation problem with wolves. It is psychological _ the
hatred of wolves.''
   Cutler, whose 80,000-member organization has reintroduction of
wolves into Yellowstone as a top priority, said, ``All Americans
have a right to influence the course of events in Yellowstone
National Park.''
   Cutler said restoring the wolves has ``enormous symbolic
importance as well as ecological importance. ... (It) will be viewed
as one of the major conservation accomplishments of the 1990s.''
   Park Service director William Penn Mott said Friday in an
interview with The Associated Press that he believes the
reintroduction is inevitable.
   ``When that happens, people may never see a wolf,'' said Mott,
``but they will hear them howl. That is the call, the music, of the
West. That quality is as important as a natural presence or a
structure (within a park).''
   Cutler and Owens urged the 300 people attending Saturday's
meeting to rally support to force Congress to hold hearings on the
wolf reintroduction plan.
   Cutler said the next step would be an environmental impact
statement on the proposal. He said a requested $200,000 federal
appropriation is in danger of failing to get through the budget
review process.

<TEXT>
   Three boxcars packed with 120 tons of explosives
blew up near a train station, killing 68 people, injuring 230 others
and throwing cars into the air like feathers, the official media
reported Sunday.
   The blast Saturday in Arzamas, 240 miles east of Moscow, carved a
crater 80 feet deep and 175 feet wide and destroyed or damaged more
than 400 buildings,Tass and the government newspaper Izvestia said.
   The reports, some of the most detailed Soviet accounts ever filed
so soon after an accident, said some of the injuries were serious.
They said the cause of the explosion was not known.
   ``Hospital personnel are doing their best to save the life of
every person,'' the Tass news agency reported. ``Despite the wide
scope of the tragedy, the situation in the city remains calm.''
   More than 80 doctors were flown to Arzamas, an industrial center
of more than 90,000 people. Nearby residents rushed to offer blood
and food for the survivors, the media said.
   The reports indicated that more deaths could result from the
accident, the most deadly on Soviet railways this year. They said
eight children were among the dead.
   The area was evacuated, but the local population was quickly
reassured that tests showed an ``absence of hazardous components''
in the atmosphere, Tass said.
   The three boxcars carried industrial explosives intended for
geologists, mineworkers and builders, Tass said. The diesel
locomotive pulling the cars flipped over in the blast, Izvestia said.
   Cars and trucks halted near the track, waiting for the train to
pass, ``were scattered about as though they were (goose) down,''
Izvestia said.
   The explosion set off small fires, derailed other freight cars
and damaged the track, the newspaper said. The fires were
extinguished within a half hour, it said.
   Transport and municipal services also were damaged. Tass said 600
families were left homeless but would get new apartments and
compensation for damages.
   It was the most serious train accident reported since August
1987, when Soviet media said scores of people were killed after a
freight train collided with a passenger train in southern Russia.
   It didn't say how many people died.
   Accidents were never reported in such detail before Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power in March 1985, but media stories of
incidents have become more common and specific, especially since the
Chernobyl nuclear accident in April 1986.
   Tass and Izvestia said a special government commission launched
an investigation into Saturday's accident.
   ``We are taking measures to help all those who suffered from the
accident,'' Izvestia quoted Gennady G. Vedernikov, head of the
investigating commission, as saying.
   The newspaper said military units and local civil defense workers
were directing the relief efforts. A mobile hospital unit was set up
near the accident scene, Izvestia said.
   Besides Vedernikov, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers,
the 14-member inquiry commission includes representatives of the
Health Ministry, police, the Ministry of Defense, the prosecutor's
office and other agencies.
   ``A thorough investigation is being conducted into the causes of
the explosion,'' Vedernikov was quoted as saying. ``I cannot yet say
anything about the results.''

<TEXT>
   A 34-year-old Australian woman Sunday
became the first woman to sail solo nonstop around the world when
she navigated triumphantly into Sydney harbor after a 189-day voyage.
   More than 10,000 people greeted Kay Cottee at the harbor. She
jumped out of the 36-foot sloop Blackmore's First Lady and onto the
dock for an emotional reunion with friends and family.
   Hundreds of small boats dotted the harbor to welcome her home
from a trip she undertook to raise money for Australian children's
charities.
   Ms. Cottee, a Sydney shipbuilder, told reporters that during the
23,000-mile easterly journey, ``I experienced real fear for the
first time ever at sea.''
   She said the worst seas came two days before she rounded Cape
Horn at the southern tip of South America on Jan. 20.
   ``It was in mountainous seas breaking in huge waves _ just
indescribable,'' she said. ``I thought the boat would roll right
over and go down.''
   But she said she enjoyed the experience.
   ``Who wouldn't be happy doing something they love for six
uninterrupted months?'' she said. ``It was a personal challenge. ...
I learned that I've got more endurance and determination than I ever
thought I had.''
   After leaving Sydney harbor last Nov. 29, Ms. Cottee had no
physical contact with other boats or people. She carried all the
dried and canned food she needed for the trip.
   Her journey also was the fastest sailing trip around the globe by
a woman.
   Ms. Cottee said she had not been lonely because she was regularly
in radio contact with family members and the Australian media.
   ``With the state of modern communications equipment, I made a lot
of friends along the way,'' she said.
   Ms. Cottee said she also had time to give up smoking, read books
and listen to music.
   Among those at the harbor to meet Ms. Cottee were Nick Greiner,
premier of New South Wales, and Hazel Hawke, wife of Australian
Prime Minister Bob Hawke.

   Sotheby's auctioneers racked up nearly $500,000 in
sales Sunday at their first auction in China, and organizers said
the profits would go to renovate half a mile of the Great Wall.
   ``It's super,'' said Julian Thompson, auctioneer and chairman of
Sotheby's International, after 73 Chinese and Western works of
modern art and rare objects brought in a total of 1.76 million yuan,
or about $475,850
   After auction costs of about $100,000 are paid, half the
remaining money is to go toward renovating the crumbling Great Wall
and half toward saving the Italian city of Venice, which is sinking
beneath the waters of the Adriatic Sea.
   Danial Vial, a Parisian public relations agent who organized the
auction as part of four days of events to benefit the Great Wall and
Venice, said enough money was raised to rebuild a kilometer of the
wall.
   Parts of the wall were built more than 2,200 years ago, and many
sections have been reduced by time and warfare to piles of stone.
   Some bids were made by telephone from New York and Los Angeles,
but most of the purchasers were among more than 200 wealthy
foreigners who paid $4,300 each to attend the benefit.
   The auction was held in the former imperial palace in a
15th-century hall where Chinese emperors once worshipped their
ancestors.
   Several said their purchases would be souvenirs of the unusual
benefit, which included a caviar luncheon on the Great Wall, boating
at an imperial palace and a gala performance by opera and ballet
stars at the Great Hall of the People.
   The painting that had been expected to bring the highest price _
``China Proverb'' by American artist Robert Rauschenberg _ went for
only $40,387, half its pre-sale estimate.
   A painted pottery jug by Picasso sold for $14,808, well below its
pre-sale estimated value.
   The cheapest item was a Sevres porcelain cup that went for 500
yuan, or $135, about half the annual salary of the average Chinese
factory worker.

<HEAD>Dukakis May Find Himself Depicted As Leftist on Defense Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis could find himself
depicted as far to the left on critical questions of defense and
military strength in the fall race for the White House.
   His opposition to many weapons systems already has drawn fire
both from Republicans and within his own party.
   Dukakis, rejecting characterizations of him as naive and
reluctant in the use of American power, says he wants to enhance
U.S. conventional forces while keeping defense spending stable and
wants to rely on the cooperation of allies in cases of potential
international threats.
   The likely Democratic presidential nominee does not shrink from a
foreign policy debate with the expected Republican nominee, George
Bush. He already has begun attacking him on the administration's
Iran-Contra affair and Central America policy.
   But while nationwide surveys give Dukakis an edge over Bush, the
one area in which voters continue to place more confidence in the
Republicans than the Democrats is military strength and dealing with
the Soviets.
   ``It's clearly an issue that's there to be exploited,'' said
Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute. ``I think this is potentially the soft
underbelly of Dukakis.''
   Will Marshall is issues director for the Democratic Leadership
Council, a group of defense-minded Democrats led by Georgia Sen. Sam
Nunn and others. Marshall said Dukakis' attitude on foreign affairs
questions gives some Democrats concern about Dukakis' ability to
project resolve and a willingness to intervene unilaterally, if
necessary.
   ``His strong stand on Europe and conventional forces makes him
obviously not a George McGovern, not an isolationist,'' Marshall
said.
   ``But on Third World, regional conflicts, and Latin America, he
tends to strike a very legalistic, moralistic posture that raises
questions about what is the best way to protect our national
interests and support the spread of democracy.''
   Bush has portrayed Dukakis' views on defense as akin to those of
McGovern, the Democrats' 1972 peace candidate who lost in a
landslide.
   ``Even Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale supported (weapons)
systems that Governor Dukakis opposes,'' Bush said. ``The governor's
views are naive at best, and if implemented would be dangerous to
the defense of this country.''
   Dukakis and his campaign parry the issue back at the vice
president.
   ``We feel strongly,'' said Dukakis communications director Leslie
Dach, ``that the real vulnerabilities on foreign policy are on the
Republican side. They've got to explain away (Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio) Noriega, Iran-Contra, and a failed and unpopular
policy in Central America.''
   Jesse Jackson, Dukakis' only remaining Democratic rival, has
accused Dukakis of avoiding specifics on many issues. But it is on
defense systems where the two may be closest, with Jackson also
opposing major new weapons systems and calling for cuts in the Star
Wars nuclear defense program.
   Dukakis held a meeting on defense issues last fall with a group
of Democratic defense specialists, including veterans of past
administrations and think-tank experts.
   One participant, speaking only on condition he not be named, said
Dukakis and the experts didn't seem to connect.
   ``There was certainly a kind of ships passing in the night
feature to it, to put it mildly,'' this Democratic defense
specialist said.
   He said Dukakis' remarks generated concern about an ``idealistic
view of rule of law in foreign policy _ that although the personal
styles and attitudes and demeanor are very different, that he's
really very similar to Jimmy Carter. I think that's what people are
worried about.''
   Not everyone who attended the meeting felt that way. Some have
come to be Dukakis campaign advisers.
   ``He seemed to be open minded, to be willing to listen, but not
to be terribly familiar with the issues,'' said Robert Komer, a
former undersecretary of defense who is now a consultant at the Rand
Corp.
   Dukakis has focused on beefing up the U.S. conventional military
forces _ taking a page from the book of Nunn. Dukakis wants to
enhance air and sea support, and supplies such as ammunition, for
U.S. troops, said Madeleine Albright, Georgetown University
professor of international relations and Dukakis' senior foreign
policy adviser.
   He believes ``some targeted new investments are necessary,'' but
will not estimate their price, she said. He does not call for cuts
in overall defense spending but would keep the Pentagon budget
``stable'' for several years, financing his projects from cuts in
Star Wars and other systems, she said.
   However, speaking to senior citizens in Massachusetts in mid-May,
Dukakis suggested services for the elderly could be paid for from
military cutbacks.
   ``Are we going to spend $6 billion on Star Wars and MX missiles
on railroad cars, or are we going to build affordable housing for
families of low and moderate income and the elderly?'' he asked.
   Dukakis opposes both the MX and Midgetman missile systems and is
against plans to add two more aircraft carriers and the support
ships that go with them. Although it is too late to stop the B-1
bomber program, Dukakis would not favor buying more B-1s if elected,
said Christopher Edley Jr., issues director for the Dukakis campaign.
   ``His point is we can't buy everything in the defense candy
store,'' Edley said, ``that we have to make choices that really do
advance our essential security needs. And he would emphasize our
conventional strength.''
   Ultimately, individual weapons systems may prove less important
in shaping voters' judgments than feelings about the candidates'
resolve and strength.
   ``I think there's some real unease out there about where Dukakis
would draw the line in the dust,'' Ornstein said.
   In both the Middle East and Central America, Dukakis cites the
need for agreement among other nations to stop hostilities.
   ``There's a feeling Governor Dukakis places too great a store in
the possibility of solving all conflicts through negotiated
settlement,'' Marshall said.
   ``He needs to reassure people that although a Dukakis
administration would be very vigorous and dogged in its exploration
of diplomatic avenues for achieving our national interests, in the
final analysis he's willing to act decisively to protect our crucial
interests.''

<TEXT>
   Real estate agent Nancy Jordan was burning
up the phone lines again Sunday and Becky Hector, expecting her
third child any minute, felt calmer knowing she could reach out and
touch someone in an emergency.
   Nearly a month after a May 8 fire damaged a switching station and
left 35,000 customers in six western Chicago suburbs without service
for varying lengths of time, the Great Phone Outage came to a quiet
end.
   At 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Illinois Bell officials transferred the
last 18,000 customers from the damaged, jury-rigged switch to a new,
state-of-the-art digital unit. With as many as 250 employees often
working around-the-clock, the company compressed what is normally a
50-week job into less than four weeks.
   ``It was a very good cutover, very uneventful,'' said Bell
spokesman Dick Hill.
   ``Thank goodness. Any more problems and I might have hit the
roof,'' said Mrs. Hector, whose exchange was among the last of six
to be transferred by Bell.
   ``Being without a reliable phone is like being without running
water,'' she said. ``You never realize how important it is until
it's gone.''
   Mrs. Hector said she had spent much of the month in her car,
running errands she normally would have taken care of by telephone.
   ``I couldn't reach the other mothers in my children's pre-school
classes for car pooling. I couldn't call to make doctor's
appointments for myself and then my own kids got sick,'' she said.
``I just started showing up at the (doctors') offices instead of
making appointments.
   ``And then when I was home, I was anxious because I'm so far
along (with the pregnancy). Even so,'' she added, ``I think I'm
going to miss some of those times when the phones weren't ringing
off the hook.''
   Not Ms. Jordan.
   ``The phone is my lifeline,'' she said from her downtown Hinsdale
office. ``When it went down, so did my livelihood. There's only so
much paperwork to catch up on, and that's how I justified the first
couple of days without the phone.
   ``Then I went knocking on doors, driving around and leaving
notes. But talk about inefficiencies. It was like a different
country just a few miles from here where people's phones were
working.
   ``I'd come over to show their house, and they'd tell me `You'll
have to come back later, we didn't have a chance to clean. Why
didn't you call us?' And I'd say, `No phones.' And they'd look at me
funny.''
   Since the Mother's Day fire, phone service had been sporadic at
best for Ms. Jordan and other Bell customers. About half were hooked
up to the new system on May 26.
   With the remainder hooked up Sunday, the utility said things
should be back to normal.
   ``Technically, this should be the end of it ... but there might
be some little glitches that we will have to work out,'' said Bell
spokeswoman Hilary Anderson.
   Although Illinois Bell promised rebates, several businesses were
angry enough to file lawsuits charging the utility was negligent in
failing to staff the switching station, which houses computerized
equipment to connect local and long-distance calls. Firefighters
reached the scene 82 minutes after an alarm registered at Bell's
Springfield monitoring station.
   And Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan filed a complaint
with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking to have Bell pick up
the tab for financial losses.
   But Sunday, at least, Bell was savoring its accomplishments in
returning the area to full service.
   ``We still have a lot of work to do, but it won't be the kind of
feverish work we've been doing,'' said Hill. ``It was an
extraordinary effort by all the people involved.''

   About 80 Soviets shouted ``Freedom, freedom!'' and
carried banners through downtown Moscow on Sunday in an
unprecedented march to demand the release of political prisoners.
   About 50 police officers courteously stopped the protesters from
advancing to Red Square but allowed them to gather across from the
Moscow Soviet, the white-columned headquarters of city government.
   The afternoon march along Gorky Street, a major thoroughfare that
leads to the Kremlin, was the first in the Soviet capital in memory.
Participants credited Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign
of ``glasnost,'' or openness on selected topics.
   ``This protest shows how our political freedoms are widening.
Today we are making history,'' declared Yuri S. Skubko, a member of
the Democratic Union, a fledgling opposition group.
   Sweating in the sun, the demonstrators gathered near a statue of
Yuri Dolgoruky, the Russian prince who founded Moscow, and shouted
in unison: ``Freedom, freedom for political prisoners!''
   It was the first time that chanting protesters carrying banners
marched along a Moscow street without police making obvious moves to
disperse them.
   In recent months, Moscow police have allowed some demonstrations
to proceed, but they sometimes seized banners and detained
participants.
   In December, police manhandled a dozen young people who gathered
outside army headquarters to protest the Soviet military role in
Afghanistan.
   Sunday's protest sparked reactions ranging from anger to
bewilderment from Soviets strolling down Gorky Street, one of
Moscow's most fashionable shopping avenues.
   ``Are they making a movie?'' asked Dmitri Kuchov, 12.
   A flushed woman shouted at the marchers: ``This is slander! Don't
you see that?''
   The protesters started at 3 p.m. at the base of the monument to
19th century Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Hundreds of Soviets
looked on.
   Different groups called for freedom for Armenian nationalist
Paruyr Ayrikyan; for leaders of Crimean Tatars who want permission
for Tatars to resettle in their Crimean homeland; and for political
prisoners in the country as a whole.
   ``We estimate that there are 300 to 400 of them,'' said Viktor
Kuzin, 35, a member of the Democratic Union's Central Coordinating
Council. ``Not all of them are imprisoned under political counts,
but some have been falsely accused and convicted of committing
common crimes.''
   A young man climbed a lamppost by the bronze statue of Pushkin to
lead the protesters in a chant calling for Ayrikyan's release.
   Demonstrators then marched down the sidewalk on Gorky Street,
past the Central Hotel and vendors selling apple juice and flowers,
on their way to Red Square and the Kremlin.
   Police on the sidewalk across from the Moscow Soviet blocked them
after they marched about 500 yards. The protesters then gathered at
the Dolgoruky monument.
   Uniformed police appeared to treat the protesters politely.
``Please stand over there with your banners,'' one lieutenant told a
protester after touching him on the shoulder.
   At 4 p.m., the protesters turned around and returned to Pushkin
Square. A group of Armenians then staged another rally outside the
headquarters of the Soviet news agency Tass.
   Ayrikyan, 39, was arrested by the KGB secret police in Yerevan,
Armenia's capital, on March 25. He is the founder of the Union for
National Self-Determination, an Armenian nationalist group.
   His wife, Yelena, 35, said that Ayrikyan, who has served 17 years
in prison, labor camp and internal exile for his political
activities, was being held in a KGB isolation cell while charges
against him were investigated.
   On March 19, Ayrikyan told a Moscow news conference that more
than 70 people had died in anti-Armenian racial riots in the
Azerbaijan city of Sumgait on Feb. 28.
   The Soviet government said 32 people were killed, and Mrs.
Ayrikyan said her husband had been accused of slandering the Soviet
state.
   The riots grew out of ethnic tensions between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis. Armenians have demanded that an Armenian-dominated
area of Azerbaijan be annexed to their republic.
   Mrs. Ayrikyan, her eyes red from crying, said there were reports
her husband had a heart attack while in jail, but she said officials
denied her any information about his health.
   Tass accused the groups of staging a ``concert'' for Western
reporters in Moscow to cover the 1,000th anniversary of the Russian
Orthodox Church and described Akrikyan as ``a dissident who has
declared against the policy of the Soviet state more than once.''
   ``The Criminal Code of the U.S.S.R. has no such notion as a
political prisoner,'' Tass said.
   It accused ``extremist-minded'' Crimean Tatars of calling for the
release of Sinaver Kadyrov and Rishat Ablayev and said they were
serving time ``for criminal offenses that have nothing to do with
human rights.''
   The Tatars, deported by dictator Josef V. Stalin as alleged
wartime collaborators with the Germans, have been petitioning for
years for the right to return to their Crimean homeland.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He Doesn't Mind If Jackson Keeps Campaigning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PATERSON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, driving toward the final
primaries and a Democratic delegate majority, said Sunday he had no
objections to rival Jesse Jackson's continued campaigning up to the
convention and expects Jackson to work for the ticket in the fall.
   ``It's not harmful at all,'' the Massachusetts governor said of
Jackson's reported intention to continue his campaign past the
primary season. ``He's a very strong person who's done an
extraordinary job of winning votes and winning support.
   ``I hope and believe we're going to have a good relationship. We
have in the past,'' he said. ``... I suspect he's going to be out
there campaigning hard for the Democratic ticket this fall.''
   Jackson, campaigning in California toward that big state's
primary on Tuesday that ends the delegate-selection season, has
indicated he intends to keep up a campaign schedule even after the
final primary and up to the Democratic Natioal Convention, pressing
his issues and seeking support from delegates already chosen.
   Dukakis holds a commanding lead in delegates, however, with more
than 1,800 delegates toward the 2,081 needed to nominate. His
campaign aides are confident that he will gain the remaining
delegates he needs to assure his nomination by Tuesday's primaris in
California, New Jersey, Montana and New Jersey, and hope to declare
a Dukakis majority has been secured.
   Dukakis campaigned in New Jersey a second day on Sunday before
flying to California in the afternoon for a final round of
campaigning in the state, where he will await the returns Tuesday
night. He planned a late rally at a Greek Orthodox church in Los
Angeles Sunday evening, and stops in several California cities on
Monday.
   He flew back home to Boston late Saturday to see his wife Kitty,
who is recovering from delicate surgery on her spine to repair two
herniated cervical discs. Dukakis said she is bothered by pain in
her hip, where they removed bone for grafting, and was walking with
the support of a walker.
   He was asked about Jackson's remarks at a news conference in
Paterson after addressing a Sunday morning crowd of about 300
people. Dukakis stood on rocks with the city's Passaic Falls
waterfalls crashing behind him.
   Dukakis said that while he expected Jackson's support, ``that
doesn't mean that he can't advocate for those causes and those
things he believes in.''
   ``I'll be doing the same. We'll all be doing the same. But I
don't see any deep divisions in the party at all. We're going to be
united as never before.''
   Appearing on ABC-TV on Sunday, Jackson campaign chairman Willie
Brown suggested Jackson should be offered the vice presidential
nomination.
   Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan, asked about Brown's remarks,
noted that Jackson himself has said the nominee should have the
choice of selecting a running mate.
   ``Dukakis isn't thinking about the vice presidency until the 7th
of June,'' Gearan said. ``In terms of Rev. Jackson, he isn't ruling
anyone in or anyone out.''
   Jackson himself said of Brown's remark: ``That's his point of
view.''
   Dukakis later addressed about 500 people at an outdoor rally in
Montclair, a leafy suburb of New York City, and attended a
neighborhood festival in Jersey City.
   Dukakis called for government investment to revitalize the
nation's cities, citing redevelopment projects he said were
discontinued in Paterson under the Reagan administration, and the
example of the economic rebirth of Lowell, Mass., in his state.
   ``That did not happen by accident,'' he said. ``It happened
because we invested in that community, and we've got to do that in
cities all over this country, including Paterson.''
   In New Jersey, Dukakis noted that the state has elected Democrats
statewide, including Sen. Bill Bradley, who campaigned by his side
on Saturday, and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who faces a tough
re-election battle and did not appear with Dukakis. Yet New Jersey
has not voted for the Democratic nominee for president since 1964.
   ``There is no reason the state that has given us Bill Bradley and
Frank Lautenberg can't get back in the Democratic column this year.
And we're going to make it happen,'' he said in Montclair.

<HEAD>Tiny Southern Illinois Town Capital Of Wild Albino Squirrels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OLNEY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Their likeness is everywhere: on the city flag
and the sides of city vehicles, on the uniforms of police officers,
firefighters and city workers. By law they have the right-of-way on
any street.
   Welcome to Olney, ``Home of the White Squirrels,'' the only town
in the United States to boast a large colony of wild albino
squirrels.
   ``It's our mark of distinction, to put it bluntly,'' said Mayor
Gail Lathrop. ``They're so darn cute.''
   ``A lot of tourists _ 'course we don't get a lot, being in the
middle of nowhere _ stop by the park to see the squirrels,'' said
Mike Belcher, supervisor of public works in the town of 9,000 in
southeastern Illinois.
   ``This is Olney's only chance for their claim to fame,'' said
Belcher, whose uniform also sports a white-squirrel emblem on the
sleeve.
   The squirrel also appears on the key to the city and on a Rotary
Club sign in the mayor's office. There's a stuffed white squirrel on
the wall of the City Council chamber.
   To protect the city's 150 squirrels, Olney enacted an ordinance
in 1925 that gave the animals with white fur, white skin and pink
eyes _ mutations from gray squirrels _ the right-of-way on any
street.
   Should a motorist break the law and kill one, he faces a $25
fine. Ditto for taking one out of town.
   ``The city goes crazy over them,'' Belcher said.
   John Stencel, a local zoologist, said the white squirrels have
inhabited Olney since the early 1900s.
   He said colonies of albino squirrels, which he described as
groups of about 25, are rare. Other states, including Minnesota and
Tennessee, do have them, he said, but none are the size of Olney's.
   ``It's one of those things that you claim it, and let somebody
else prove us wrong,'' Stencel said.
   The squirrels thrive because, in addition to being protected by
law, people feed them.
   On a recent day, a handful of townspeople sat around the city
park, waiting to give them a meal.
   Only three appeared. Belcher explained that during the summer
when the temperature is high and people splatter about the nearby
city pool, the squirrels stay in their hollow trees.
   ``I think they're wonderful,'' said Jo Ann Wiggins, who had
packed apples for the squirrels. ``They're our pride.''
   Marcia Hoagland brought her 2-year-old nephew, Robbie Wallace, to
see the white squirrels, though she forgot a bag of peanuts at home.
   Said the mayor: ``You really can't appreciate these little
animals until you see them.''

   A Yale alumnus was charged with arson
Sunday for allegedly torching makeshift shanties on the Ivy League
campus that were built by students to protest South African
apartheid, authorities said.
   Dr. Elwood D. Bracey, 56, of West Palm Beach, Fla., who
apparently was visiting the university for alumni weekend, was
stopped by a jogger near the blazing shanties, police said. He was
released on $50,000 bond pending a Monday court appearance, police
said.
   Dr. Michael L. Charney, a Boston psychiatrist and class of 1968,
said he saw a man running away from the fire as he was jogging
across the campus Sunday morning.
   ``I yelled fire and ran after him,'' said Charney. ``He was in a
tan suit, tie and his class button, which he took off as he ran.''
   Charney said he caught up with the man in the courtyard of one of
Yale's residential colleges, where the two had a political
discussion about South Africa, apartheid and Yale's investment
policies.
   ``In my opinion he acknowledged he had done it and he did it
because he had strong feelings on this and felt alumni should have
their say,'' Charney said. ``He also said he had given Yale a lot of
money.''
   The man told him he had worked in a hospital in South Africa for
three months, Charney said.
   Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr., who had defended the
university's decision to allow the shantytown to remain standing
during a meeting Saturday with visiting alumni, denounced the arson
as a ``lawless act of violence.''
   ``To destroy them by an act of impulse is the antithesis of
reason and order that is the essence of a university or any
civilized community,'' he said in a statement. ``Beyond that, to set
the shanties on fire furtively in the midst of an urban campus is an
extremely dangerous thing to do.''
   All that remained standing after the fire was a wooden shrine
draped in the yellow, green and black colors of the outlawed African
National Congress and pasted with sheets of paper listing the names
of 250 people who have been killed in the struggle against apartheid.
   ``It was a cowardly thing to do,'' said Michael Morand, a 1987
Yale graduate who helped build the shanties as a member of the
Coalition Against Apartheid and now works in the university
chaplain's office.
   The shanties were erected in front of the Yale administration
building in April 1986 to protest apartheid and Yale investment
policies in South Africa. Officials ordered the shanties dismantled
but allowed them to be rebuilt after students agreed to maintain
them.
   Yale owns stock only in companies doing business in South Africa
that subscribe to the Sullivan Principles, a set of ethical
guidelines aimed at improving the lives of South African blacks and
ultimately at dismantling apartheid, South Africa's policy of racial
separation.
   Walter Littell, a university spokesman, was unsure how much of
Yale's stock portfolio was invested in companies doing business in
South Africa. As of 1986, Yale had about $385 million invested in
such companies.

<HEAD>Missing Act Of Donizetti Opera Found in Cellar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The missing second act of an opera by Italian
composer Gaetano Donizetti has been found in the cellar of the Royal
Opera House, four years after an American musicologist discovered
its first and third acts there, the Sunday Times reported.
   The lost portion of the three-act ``Elisabeth'' was discovered
last week by Australian conductor Richard Bonynge. He is currently
leading his wife, Dame Joan Sutherland, in a production of
Donizetti's ``Anna Bolena'' at the Royal Opera House at Covent
Garden.
   The Times quoted him as saying he made the discovery ``absolutely
by chance, in an old stack of ballet rubbish (music).''
   Donizetti, who was born in 1797 and died in 1848, composed the
work in 1838. The opera, set in Russia, tells the story of a young
woman's walk from Siberia to Moscow to try to win her father's
freedom from exile.
   ``Elisabeth'' first surfaced four years ago when Will
Crutchfield, an American musicologist, found the first and third
acts. It isn't known how the score of the music got to Covent Garden.
   The fact that the pages are singed indicates it may have been
near a fire, possibly one that broke out at the opera house in 1856
or one 11 years later at Her Majesty's Theater, to which Donizetti
had unsuccessfully offered the work.
   ``We are now looking for the first possible opportunity to bring
this opera before the ublic _ it will probably be within 18 months
and initially in a concert version,'' said Paul Findlay, the
director of Covent Garden.

   With lots of milk and corn flakes,
Battle Creek retained its title as the breakfast capital of the
country by serving 32,697 people and beating the record set by
Springfield, Mass.
   It was the third straight year that the city beat the
Massachusetts town for the bragging rights.
   ``We placed 35,076 servings of cereal on the mall, and 2,379 were
returned for a total of 32,697 which leaves Battle Creek the
Breakfast Capital of the World,'' Breakfast Table Chairman Rick
Royal said Saturday.
   Battle Creek, home of Kellogg Co., and Springfield have swapped
claims to putting out the largest breakfast since 1977.
   On May 14, Springfield regained the title by feeding 31,279
people a pancake breakfast during its annual celebration of the
founding of the city.
   ``Congratulations to Battle Creek for topping us again,'' William
Sullivan, chairman of the Springfield event, said Saturday. ``I was
hoping for rain but we didn't get it. We feel we can outdo those
numbers and that will be our aim next year.
   ``We are not giving up,'' he said. ``We can do those numbers even
if pancakes are more difficult than pouring milk.''
   During the breakfast battles, the rules have changed. It started
out as a challenge to put out the longest table. But the Guinness
Book of World Records said a city in Spain once sat 6,400 people at
a table 7,908 feet long _ just shy of a mile and a half.
   That was more than Battle Creek or Springfield officials could
stomach, so they changed the name of their contest from the
``World's Longest Breakfast Table'' to the ``World's Largest
Breakfast Event.''

   This little piggy going to market wanted
to be the one that stayed home, and its break for freedom at a city
intersection caused a police chase aided by broom and lasso.
   The 250-pound pig, part of a load of hogs being taken to Granite
City Livestock Sales, jumped off the back of its owner's truck at a
busy street corner and trotted off to a residential area.
   ``He must have climbed on the backs of the other pigs in the
truck, then he leaped out,'' said Dan Herrmann, a witness who helped
capture the animal after its Thursday morning getaway.
   ``It's remarkable for a pig to walk away from a jump like that
without broken legs. He must have jumped about four feet,'' Herrmann
said.
   The pig ended up in the back yard of Herb Proell.
   ``He came down the alley and then wandered up to my fence. The
cop was right behind him,'' said Proell, who was watering his lawn.
   ``I figured I could guide him with a broom and keep him against
the fence,'' Proell said. ``I was talking to him, trying to keep him
in this corner.''
   After police officers failed to grab the hog, Herrmann managed to
lasso it and put it in his truck. He took it to the livestock market
and returned it to owner Robert Steffenhagen of Foley, who had
driven off unaware of his hog's exit.
   The athletic animal was sold at auction.

<HEAD>Four Tamils Found Slain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels slit the throats of four
Tamil civilians early Sunday and pinned notes to their bodies
claiming they were traitors, the military said.
   Officials of the Joint Operations Command, who could not be
further identified under briefing rules, said authorities found the
four victims near a bus stop in the northern port city of
Velvettituari.
   Notes written in the Tamil language and pinned to their
blood-stained shirts read: ``This is the fate that befalls
traitors.'' It indicated that the victims were believed to be
informants for Indian peacekeeping troops in Sri Lanka.
   Velvettituari, 15 miles northeast of Jaffna, is the hometown of
Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. The Tigers are the largest of the groups battling the Indian
soldiers, who are in Sri Lanka to enforce an accord aimed at ending
the Tamils' separatist war.
   The Indian-mediated accord, signed in July, calls for the Tamils
to lay down their weapons in exchange for some autonomy.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim discrimination by majority Sinhalese. India became involved in
the dispute because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils.
   In New Delhi, an official of another Sri Lankan rebel group
demanded the Indian government assure the safety of the Tamils.
   M.K. Eelaventhan, general secretary of the Tamil Eelam Liberation
Front, told the United News of India that there would be no one to
protect the Tamils once the guerrillas were disarmed.
   Eelaventhan said he did not want the Indian army to remain
permanently in Sri Lanka, but he expected it to help ``save us from
genocide.'' He said it would be unjustified to withdraw the
peacekeeping force immediately after the rebels were disarmed.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Federal Prosecutor Pressured Meese From Wedtech Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III withdrew himself
from the Wedtech investigation only after a prosecutor refused to
share evidence in the case with the Justice Department unless Meese
disqualified himself, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The New York Daily News quoted high-level sources as saying U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani wanted written proof that Meese would not
be supervising the case involving the New York defense contractor.
The now-defunct company is at the center of an influence-peddling
scandal regarding its efforts to obtain government contracts.
   Giuliani's refusal in March 1987 to forward evidence to the
Justice Department prompted top Justice officials to warn Meese in
early April 1987 of evidence linking him to the case, the newspaper
said.
   The Justice officials warned Meese to ``publicly distance
himself'' from the Wedtech case and ``stay away'' from his close
friend, E. Robert Wallach, then a key suspect in the case, the
newspaper said, quoting officials who spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   Wallach and Meese's financial adviser, Franklyn Chinn, were
indicted in December on charges they accepted bribes in exchange for
using their influence with Meese.
   Federal investigators were looking into Meese's links to Wedtech
in October 1986. But, five months later, Meese still had not
formally withdrawn from supervision of the investigation.
   One high-level Justice Department section told the News it was
``clearly improper, if not illegal'' conduct by Meese for failing to
quickly disqualify himself from the Wedtech investigation.
   Meese signed a recusal statement on April 8, 1987.
   However, the News said, Meese told his aides that he might have a
problem keeping his distance from Wallach. He had just offered
Wallach a $77,500-a-year job as counselor to the attorney general.
Meese's lawyers said Meese's consideration of Wallach for the post
was dropped as soon as he became aware of Wallach's status in the
Wedtech case.
   Sources told the News that Meese's actions in the case put
Justice Department officials in a delicate position and created an
appearance that the probe was subject to irregular pressures and
interference from the top.
   Department regulations forbid Justice officials to have any
involvement in criminal investigations ion which they or their
associates have a personal or political interest.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Patrick Korten, denied Meese
disqualified himself only after Giuliani refused to hand over
evidence.
   ``Mr. Meese recused himself the moment he was aware that Mr.
Wallach was a subject of Mr. Giuliani's investigation,'' Korten said
Sunday.
   Giuliani, who is prosecuting the Wedtech trial of Rep. Mario
Biaggi, D-N.Y., declined to comment on the matter.
   A Meese lawyer, Jim Rocap, said Meese was not aware of
conversations Giuliani had with Justice officials.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Panama's Roman Catholic
Church on Sunday criticized political restrictions and U.S. economic
sanctions, saying the crisis ``weighs heavily on the smallest
people.''
   Speaking at the traditional Corpus Christi Mass held this year in
an open field and attended by nearly 40,000 people, Archbishop
Marcos Gregorio McGrath urged Panamanian political leaders to
resolve the dispute. He said their actions ``will determine the
future of this country for generations to come.''
   The Reagan administration imposed economic sanctions against
Panama after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the Defense
Forces, was indicted in February by federal grand juries in Florifa
that accused him of drug trafficking.
   Noriega, who controls the civilian government, has rejected U.S.
efforts to make him resign and leave the country. Panama uses the
U.S. dollar as its currency and the sanctions have brought economic
stagnation and increasing unemployment.
   People attending the Mass stood under a multicolored cover of
thousands of umbrellas for the service by McGrath and other members
of the Panamanian conference of bishops.
   The archbishop pleaded for an end to what he called ``political
restrictions inside and economic restrictions from abroad.''
   He also said negotiations to solve the crisis ``must be in Panama
and among Panamanians with the respect among the parties that is
required by any dialogue.''
   U.S. officials have been in and out of Panama meeting with
Noriega and other leaders trying arrange the general's resignation.
   Mcgrath said it was the responsibility of the Panamanian
governemnt and the opposition to seek a solution.
   ``We beg them before God and their conscience to make all efforts
to find the road to reconciliation and justice and peace for all,''
he said.
   In another development, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Morton
Abramowitz met privately with some opposition leaders. Opposition
officials have criticized the Reagan administration, saying it
bypassed them in its negotiations with Noriega.
   One of the Panamanians at the talks, speaking with the condition
he not be identified, called the meeting a ``a U.S.gesture''
following the breakdown of negotiations between U.S. envoys and
Noriega.
   ``What can the U.S. offer now?'' he asked. ``This is just a
formality.''
   Washington purportedly has offered to drop the indictments
against Noriega if he would step down as head of the 15,000-member
Defense Forces.
   School officials said they did not expect any serious problems
Monday when nearly 700,000 elementary and high school students begin
the new school year that should have started in March but was
postponed because of the crisis.
   The national university suspended the semester and will resume
classes July 20.

   A group of Zimbabwe legislators asked the
government to officially register prostitutes to ensure they receive
regular medical checkups, it was reported Sunday.
   The parliamentarians, members of the 100-seat assembly, made the
request during a meeting to discuss health care services, according
to the state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper.
   Registration and regular medical examinations for prostitutes
would curb the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases and acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, the newspaper quoted the
parliamentarians as saying.
   AIDS, for which there is no cure, attacks the body's immune
system and prevents it from fighting infection. The majority of
those affected worldwide are drug addicts and homosexuals, but in
Africa, the disease is spread mostly though heterosexual contacts.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, with his eye on
California's environmental vote, took another step Sunday away from
Reagan administration policies by advocating a delay in a
controversial offshore oil drilling project.
   ``Before going forward with new lease sales, we must be assured
that the national treasure of the California coastline will not be
harmed,'' Bush said at a ceremony dedicating the nation's first
methanol pump at a commercial gasoline station.
   ``I have concluded,'' said Bush ``that the government ought to
defer Lease Sale 91 off the coast of Northern California.''
   Lease Sale 91 is bitterly opposed by environmentalists.
   The Department of the Interior has been pushing ahead with plans
to permit drilling off the California coast and Secretary Donald P.
Hodel planned to issue his report on sale 91 this summer, and it
could go forward by the end of the year.
   Bush advocated a delay two days before the California primary but
with more of an eye on the presidential election in November when
the state's 47 electoral votes are considered crucial to both the
Republican vice president and Democratic Michael Dukakis.
   Bush is a sure bet to sweep California's 175 Republican delegates
in the winner-take-all GOP primary on Tuesday.
   Dukakis is heavily favored to take a lion's share of the 314
Democratic delegates in his contest with Jesse Jackson.
   The Massachusetts governor has advocated an absolute moratorium
on offshore drilling.
   On the flight to California, Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff,
told reporters, ``George Bush recognizes the importance of
environmental and quality of life issues in California.''
   Fuller said Bush was advocating the delay ``until next year
giving his secretary of the interior an opportunity to study the
matter and determine whether or not to go further.''
   However, he said, Bush opposes ``an absolute moratorium'' like
the one called for by Dukakis.
   Bush spoke at the dedication of the methanol pump at an ARCO
station at Wilshire and Hobart boulevards.
   ``A strong domestic energy industry is essential to our national
security, and I am one who believes we've got strengthen the overall
energy base of this country and protect the environment at the same
time,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that ``sometimes these goals seem incompatible as
with the current concern about offshore drilling.
   ``I was one of the pioneers in the equipment end of offshore
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and I know it can be done safely. But
there are other considerations _ tourism, marine life, aesthetics _
and in some extraordinarily sensitive areas, those considerations
may prevail.''

<HEAD>Russian Orthodox Church Begins Celebrating Millenium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Russian Orthodox Church launched a yearlong
celebration of its 1,000 anniversary Sunday with a special liturgy
and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near
the Kremlin.
   ``We are glad that our jubilee coincides with this very
beneficial period in Soviet history,'' said senior church official
Metropolitan Filaret.
   About 500 religious representatives from more than 100 countries
_ including a high-ranking Vatican delegation _ crowded into the
large, stone Patriarchal Cathedral of the Epiphany to hear the
liturgy led by Moscow's Patriarch Pimen.
   ``The Russian Orthodox Church blesses wholeheartedly the good
developments in this country and calls on its flock to take an
active part in the process of restructuring,'' said Filaret.
   Soviet television showed Pimen and other Orthodox clergymen
officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled
the opulently furbished church, which has five domes and three
altars and dates from 1731.
   Several thousand worshipers crowded the cathedral, whose ancient
icons and relics that are associated both with the history of the
Russian church and the creation of the pre-Communist Russian state.
   Christianity was introduced by Prince Vladimir in Kievan Rus _
the ancient name of what is now the northern Soviet republic of the
Ukraine _ with a baptism ceremony on the banks of the Dnieper River
in 988.
   In a rare show of cooperation between church and state, the state
Ministry of Religion participated in organizing events linked to the
millenium.
   Cathedrals in the nation's oldest monastery _ in the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev _ will be returned to the Russian Orthodox Church
this week after 27 years of state ownership, according to church and
state officials.
   Filaret, speaking to a news conference Saturday, noted that the
state was also this year permitting the church to publish half a
million copies of the Bible in the Russian and Ukrainian languages.
   The millenium celebrations come as the Soviet government is
considering easing its religious restrictions. Since the repressive
era of dictator Josef Stalin in the 1920s, Soviet worshipers have
been required to register with the government and their church
activities have been severely restricted.
   Pope John Paul II did not attend the ceremonies, although he has
often expressed the desire to visit the Soviet Union. But the
Vatican said earlier that the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend
an invitation to the pope. Russian Orthodox churchmen have said John
Paul was invited.
   The pontiff has said he would go to the Soviet Union only on
condition that he be allowed to visit the heavily-Catholic Soviet
republics. But John Paul has said he has been twice denied
permission to visit Lithuania, one of the country's Catholic
heartlands.

<HEAD>Dredge Spill Threatens Environmentally Fragile Marshes, Closes Sub
Channel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Diesel fuel from a dredge that sank
in the St. Marys River channel on the Florida-Georgia border is
threatening sensitive marshes and disrupting Navy traffic, federal
officials said Sunday.
   The channel remained closed Sunday, blocking both commercial
traffic from the Port of Fernandina and military traffic from Kings
Bay Naval Submarine Base, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Henry Rohrs in
Jacksonville.
   The dredge, which had been working to deepen the channel to
accommodate the Navy's mammoth Trident nuclear submarines, foundered
and sank in high winds and heavy seas Saturday morning.
   While most of the leaking diesel oil from the 168-foot-long Crest
floated into the Atlantic Ocean, some drifted inside the channel.
Containment booms were erected to protect up-river creeks.
   Seven crew members from the Crest, owned by the Great Lakes
Dredging and Dock Co., were plucked from the water as it sank in the
50-foot deep channel. A barge alongside broke away and drifted
several miles south along Fernandina Beach before it was secured.
   Officials hoped the containment booms would keep the pollution
from the tidal marshes of Cumberland Island, part of the federal
park system.
   ``What's made this one more severe is not so much the oil, ...
but it's spilled in a critically sensitive area,'' said Rohrs. ``And
of course you're blocking a channel. You've got the Navy and
commercial traffic.''
   He said no oil had hit the marshes. Also, no commercial traffic
was scheduled to enter the channel until Monday or Tuesday. A sonar
survey of the channel has been planned to see if ships can navigate
around the dredge.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert O'Pezio, on-scene coordinator, said the
sunken dredge contained 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel. He estimated
that at a rate of 500 gallons an hour, the fuel would leak for three
days.
   ``The wetlands here are sensitive, we're prepared to physically
protect those wetlands,'' O'Pezio said Saturday.
   He added they are not planning to clean up the fuel drifting in
the Atlantic Ocean because it has not reached beaches.
   The Great Lakes Dredging and Dock Co. will have to pay for
cleaning up the spill, O'Pezio said. Bill Moore, the company's
project superintendent, said he did not know what it would cost.
   To assist in the clean up, the Atlantic Strike Team, a federal
environmental pollution response unit, was dispatched to Fernandina
Beach Saturday. A member of the Florida Department of Environmental
Regulation's hazardous waste response team also was there to monitor
the spill.
   Also alerted was Cindy Mosling, the founder and director of
BEAKS, Bird Emergency and Kare Sanctuary. Ms. Mosling said she was
prepared to help whatever birds may be suffering affects from the
oil spill.
   ``Diesel is very poisonous to birds,'' she said. ``Not only does
it burn their skin, but inhaling it burns their lungs.''

   A car bomb exploded near a police station in
this northwestern city early Sunday, slightly damaging the station
and six cars but causing no injuries, police said.
   The explosion occurred at 6:28 a.m.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the incident,
police said.
   Police believe the explosion was the work of the separatist
Guerrilla Army of the Galician People because the explosives used
were similar to those in past incidents attributed to the same group.
   The group is fighting for independence from Spain for the
four-province Galicia region.
   It has carried out a dozen attacks on electric plants, bank
offices, police cars and industries in the region in the past eight
months, police said.

<HEAD>Jackson Vows To Launch Voter Registration Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Sunday that he will fight
at the Democratic convention this summer for a party commitment to
change practices that impede voting rights.
   Jackson, campaigning in advance of Tuesday's primary here, also
said he intends to push hard at the convention on a range of issues
he considers important, including shifting defense spending to
health care and housing, changes in party rules on delegate
selection, and campaign finance reform.
   Although he used the word ``fight'' in his speech, he modified
that in talking to reporters later, saying his quest ``for fairness
must not be seen as a fight.''
   ``Fights come when you fail to negotiate ... when people have
made a decision to go in opposite directions,'' he said.
   While putting the party on notice that he will demand a say on
several issues at the Atlanta convention, Jackson also pledged
Democratic solidarity, announcing his Rainbow Coalition would
sponsor a massive voter registration drive beginning Aug. 1.
   The drive will focus on women, minorities, young people and
laborers, he told a church congregation here.
   ``But we will go further than that,'' he said. ``In Atlanta the
Democratic party must make a commitment to empowerment _ in the
platform, in the party on the ticket.''
   He did not specify whether his reference to the ticket meant he
should be given a major say in who the Democratic vice presidential
candidate will be.
   Jackson's comments came as top campaign officials indicated a
growing sentiment that he should be offered the vice presidential
nomination if Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis becomes the
nominee, as expected.
   Campaign chairman Willie Brown, the California assembly speaker,
and state co-chairwoman, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, both voiced
that opinion on Sunday, going beyond Jackson's own statements.
   Jackson has said he has earned consideration as a running mate,
and that he likewise would consider Dukakis if he himself should win.
   ``A lot of us around him feel he should be'' offered the vice
presidential spot, said Waters.
   Of Dukakis' contention that Jackson be weighed as a potential
running mate but will get no special consideration, she said: ``We
all know games when we see them.''
   Brown, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
said considering Jackson should mean actually offering him the No. 2
spot on the ticket.
   ``I think consideration means literally extending the opportunity
to go on the ticket, and then it will be up to Mr. Jackson to
determine whether or not he wishes to accept it,'' Brown said.
   Asked about Brown's comment, Jackson said: ``That's his point of
view.''
   Told that Waters had said she would stay away from the polls in
November if Jackson is not treated fairly by the party, Jackson
said, ``I hope everybody will be at the polls in record numbers.''
   Jackson also said his voter registration plans will go ahead
regardless of whether he gets his way at the convention.
   In a day of appearances around the Los Angeles area, Jackson
repeatedly invoked the memory of the late civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., and former Sen. Robert Kennedy, assassinated 20
years ago Sunday on the night of his presidential primary victory in
California.
   Jackson said party rules must ``reflect the example of Dr. King,
the inspiration of Robert Kennedy.''
   Jackson also said ``it is shameful 20 years after the death of
Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy _ that we continue to deprive
many citizens of the right to vote.''
   He said he will fight for party rules changes in current
practices of dual priamries, winner-take-all threshholds, unelected
super delegates ``and other party impediments to one person, one
vote.''
   He cited studies that have found registration and voting is
effectively shut off for people in some parts of the country due to
short or inconvenient registration hours, inconvenient and far-away
locations of registration offices, and registration cutoff deadlines
a month or more before the election, before many people start
focusing on the campaign.
   Such practices are controlled at the local and state level.
Jackson urged passage of legislation in Congress that would allow
registration on election day.

   A bus was struck by a train at a railroad
crossing near Harare, killing 11 people and injuring 56, police said
Sunday.
   A police spokesman said nine bus passengers were killed instantly
and two died later at a hospital. All but one of the 56 people
injured were aboard the bus. Nine of the injured were hurt
seriously, he said.
   The spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with police
practice, said an earlier police report that 16 people were kiled in
the crash was incorrect.
   The collision occurred Saturday night about 12 miles west of
Harare.
   On May 20, six people were killed and 50 were injured in a
train-bus accident at a crossing 60 miles east of Harare.

   Guerrillas loyal to PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat fought Syrian-backed Palestinian dissidents with mortars and
grenades in a Beirut refugee camp Sunday. Police said two people

   They said the fighting between Arafat's Fatah faction, the
largest group in the Palestine Liberation organization, and Col.
Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising began shortly after midnight Saturday
in the Bourj Barajneh camp in Moslem west Beirut.
   Exploding shells shook Beirut through the night as both sides
pounded each other's positions in the camp's alleyways with 82mm and
60mm mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.
   It was not known what touched off the latest fighting. The two
factions have repeatedly clashed in Bourj Barajneh and the nearby
Chatilla refugee camp for control of the shantytowns since May 1.
   The fighting dwindled into sporadic sniping before dawn after
representatives of both factions intervened.
   Police said the two fighters killed in Bourj Barajneh were from
Fatah-Uprising. Most of the wounded were civilians, they added.

   Jesse Jackson's campaign chairman said Sunday the No. 2 spot on
the Democratic ticket should be his to turn down if front-runner
Michael Dukakis ends up with the party's presidential nomination.
   But Jackson, when asked about the remarks by campaign chairman
Willie Brown, said: ``That's his point of view.''
   Later, campaigning in California, Jackson told an audience at a
church, ``In Atlanta, the Democratic Party must make a commitment to
empowerment _ in the platform, in the party, on the ticket.''
   He did not elaborate on his reference to the ticket.
   Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan, asked about Brown's remarks,
noted that Jackson himself has said the nominee should have the
choice of selecting a running mate.
   ``Dukakis isn't thinking about the vice presidency until the 7th
of June,'' Gearan said. ``In terms of Rev. Jackson, he isn't ruling
anyone in or anyone out.''
   Brown, the California House speaker, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week
with David Brinkley'' that Jackson has earned the right to be
considered as a running mate for Dukakis _ and that, he said, means
the offer must actually be extended.
   ``I think consideration means literally extending the opportunity
to go on the ticket, and then it will be up to Mr. Jackson to
determine whether or not he wishes to accept it,'' Brown said.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis was conciliatory in his reaction to reports
that Jackson would continue campaigning after the round of primaries
in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico on Tuesday, when
the Massachusetts governor hopes to pick up the delegates he needs
to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``He's a very strong person who's done an extraordinary job of
winning votes and winning support,'' Dukakis said in Paterson, N.J.,
before heading for California later Sunday.
   ``I hope and believe we're going to have a good relationship. We
have in the past,'' Dukakis said. ``I suspect he's going to be out
there campaigning hard for the Democratic ticket this fall.''
   Dukakis was within 270 delegates of locking up the presidential
nomination, while Jackson did not yet have half of the 2,081
delegates needed to win. In all, 466 Democratic delegates are at
stake in Tuesday's four primaries.
   Vice President George Bush, who has had the Republican nomination
locked up since April 26, was heading for California on Sunday as
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a close political ally, again
denied that he was preparing to take over management of the campaign.
   ``No, I'm not poised to go over there. For now I think that my
job is at the Treasury Department,'' Baker said on CBS-TV's ``Face
the Nation.'' ``I can only tell you that there is no agreement, no
arrangement, no deal.''
   Bush, campaigning in Los Angeles on Sunday, courted
environmentalists with a call for a delay in a controversial
offshore oil drilling project that the administration has been
proceeding with.
   The Department of the Interior has been pushing ahead with plans
to permit drilling off the California coast. Secretary Donald P.
Hodel planned to issue his report on a lease sale off Northern
California this summer, and it could go forward by the end of the
year.
   ``Before going forward with new lease sales, we must be assured
that the national treasure of the California coastline will not be
harmed,'' the vice president said.
   He also attended the opening of the nation's first methanol pump
at a commercial gasoline station.
   Bush has had the Republican nomination locked up since April 26
and has been running alone since television evangelist Pat Robertson
suspended his candidacy on May 16.
   Nevertheless, there are pockets of lingering bitterness within
the party.
   Robertson supporters stormed the podium at the Snohomish County,
Wash., GOP convention on Saturday, where there were shoving matches
and microphone cords ripped out of the wall.
   The meeting, controlled by Robertson forces, erupted over a rule
allowing individuals to cast multiple votes for a single candidate
for state convention delegate.

   A journey north to look for work by 36
Mexican nationals became a struggle for survival when they
encountered weekend temperatures estimated at 110 degrees in a
remote Arizona desert.
   ``I didn't know about the desert,'' said Carlos Enrique, 30,
after he and 35 others were found wandering without water northwest
of here.
   ``There is water in Oaxaca,'' he said, referring to his native
state in southern Mexico, near Guatemala.
   Most of the group, which included one woman, were in generally
good condition when found Saturday afternoon, despite having been
without food and water for nearly a day.
   Three were given intravenous fluids for dehydration at Northwest
Hospital in Tucson, a nursing supervisor said.
   ``We're glad nobody died. With this soaring heat, we responded
with everything we had in an attempt to save lives,'' said Ronald
Dowdy, chief patrol agent for the U.S. Border Patrol's Tucson sector.
   The high temperature in Tucson Saturday was 108 degrees, one
degree higher than the previous record high set in 1946.
   Officials estimated it was at least 2 degrees hotter on the
desert floor in the area in which the group was found.
   About 70 bodies have been found in the same general area since
1980, according to figures released last summer by the Border Patrol.
   The group crossed the U.S.-Mexico border apparently by jumping
the international fence about 60 miles southwest of Tucson. A
massive search was launched by U.S. officials after two men left the
main group and stumbled onto a remote ranch Saturday afternoon.
   Several members of the group said they had given up their ideas
of finding work in this country and concentrated on staying alive
after they ran out of food and water.
   Just before they were found, the group came upon a small,
stagnant pool of water.
   ``We thought, `At last, life has returned.' Even though it was
pretty ugly (the water), we drank it. The thing was to cool our
parched throats,'' said Perez Gutierrez.
   The only woman in the group, Dominga Hernandez, 18, was wearing a
printed T-shirt with a Washington, D.C., logo, but would not say
where she got the shirt.
   ``I'm looking for work,'' she said.
   Roberto Lopez, 40, said he left his wife and six children in
search of work in the United States.
   ``There is work there, (in Mexico) but the pay is real cheap,''
he said. He said he was not aware that it is illegal in the United
States for employers to hire illegal aliens.
   Lopez said his work as a laborer earned him 10,000 pesos daily,
roughly $4.34.
   Jorge Reyes Vasquez, 36, said the large group actually formed
over the course of days as several smaller groups converged by
accident in the Arizona desert.

Colorado and southeastern Wyoming.
   Showers were widely scattered over northern New England and
Oregon.
   Temperatures fell to chilly record levels from Missouri to the

   In the West, Sacramento, Calif., tied a record of 47 degrees that
has been on the books since 1887.
   But while people in the South may have looked for sweaters or
jackets, the northern Plains sizzled with its third straight day of
record highs, including 97 at Billings, Mont.; 98 at Williston,
N.D.; 100 at Glasgow, Mont.; and 101 at Miles City, Mont.
   And on the shore of Lake Superior, Marquette, Mich., hit a record
high of 88.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Klamath Falls, Ore., to 101 at Miles City, Mont. The low
for the day was 31 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the
central Gulf Coast region through Florida. Scattered showers were
forecast from the northern and central Pacific Coast into the
northern Rockies.
   Highs in the upper 50s and 60s were predicted along the Pacific
Coast, west of the central Rockies, and across parts of Maine; in
the 90s from southwestern Texas and New Mexico to the northern
Plains and Minnesota; in the 90s to near 105 over southeastern
California and southern Arizona; and in the 70s or 80s over most of
the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Former Patients Celebrate National Cancer Survivors Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Athletes and entertainers who haven't let cancer stop them helped
people celebrate National Cancer Survivors Day around the nation
Sunday.
   ``I've tried to let people know there is life after cancer,''
said Olympic gold medalist Jeff Blatnick. ``I've dedicated myself to
showing what a person can do, and helping other people believe they
can do the same.''
   The observance was organized by the American Cancer Society and
``Coping,'' a national magazine for cancer patients.
   Blatnick, who won his gold medal for wrestling at the 1984
Olympics, joined about 150 cancer survivors and 400 patients at the
Regional Cancer Center in Erie, Pa.
   Blatnick overcame two bouts with Hodgkins Disease in 1982 and
1985. With radiation therapy, Blatnick recovered from his first
battle with cancer while training for the Los Angeles games. His
second bout was fought with chemotherapy and he is now in remission.
   Doctors said his fine physical condition helped in his fight
against the disease, according to A.J. Drexler, spokeswoman for
Hamot Health System Inc. and the St. Vincent Foundation, two
hospitals in Erie.
   Skier Diana Golden, an Olympic gold medalist and amputee, was the
star attraction at a observance at Norfolk, Mass.
   ``So many people equate the word `cancer' with death,'' said Miss
Golden, 25, who lives in Lincoln when she isn't on the road as a
full-time amateur skier. ``What we (survivors) are saying is, that's
not necessarily so.''
   Miss Golden, who prefers crutches to a prosthesis, lost her right
leg above the knee to bone cancer when she was 12.
   She won a gold medal in the giant slalom in the disabled division
demonstration event at the Winter Olympics in Calgary this year.
   Comedian Steve Allen, also a former cancer patient, agreed to
address an observance at the Rush Cancer Center in Chicago.
   ``There are over 100,000 cancer survivors in the Chicago area,''
said Dr. Jules Harris, the Rush center's director.
   Allen was diagnosed as having colon cancer in 1985, said his
spokeswoman, Christine Cody.
   ``He is in the same fortunate category as President Reagan in
that they had the same kind of surgery for the same kind of cancer,
with, happily, the same results,'' she said. ``Neither man seems to
have suffered any subsequent ill effects.''
   More than 600 people, more than half of them cancer survivors,
turned out at a five-hour picnic at Florham Park, N.J., said Lois M.
Gannon, chairman of the New Jersey division of the cancer society.
Three bands volunteered their time, the Great Adventure Amusement
Park donated clowns, cartoon characters and a robot for children,
and the Army donated a tent.
   ``It was wonderful,'' Ms. Gannon said. ``I have never talked to
so many upbeat people in my life.''

   The numbers game turned into a waiting
game Sunday as California Lottery officials waited for holders of
two winning tickets to claim a $51.2 million jackpot, the biggest
ever in a North American lottery.
   The holders of the winning tickets cannot claim their share of
the prize until the start of business Monday. Each winning ticket in
Saturday's Lotto 6-49 drawing is worth $25,618,116, payable over 20
years, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   The lottery's computers determined that the two winning tickets
were sold at a liquor store in Fairfield, about 45 miles east of San
Francisco, and at a supermarket in the Sacramento suburb of
Carmichael. The computers cannot identify the owners of the tickets,
though.
   The winners will be announced when they present their tickets at
lottery offices for verification.
   A small crowd of reporters and store employees gathered at the
Carmichael supermarket, hoping the winning ticketholder would come
in to announce the win.
   ``They usually show up at the retail outlet,'' said lottery
spokeswoman Susan Kossack, who was waiting at the store. ``We've had
big, big winners never surface ... but with jackpots this size, I
don't think that will happen.''
   ``It's just crazy right now,'' said store clerk Sheri Routh. ``So
far we don't know who the customer is, but we have all the news
stations here.''
   The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in
14 million, said lottery officials. The winning numbers were 48, 42,
9, 14, 19, 31. Tickets cost $1 each.
   The waiting game capped three days of frenzied Lotto playing.
   At the peak, sales hit $4 million an hour. Sales on Saturday
alone totaled more than $33 million, a one-day record, spokesman Bob
Taylor said. Weekly sales normally average about $23 million,
officials said.
   Lotto players clutching $20 bills were lined up 40 deep by 6 p.m.
Saturday at a bakery in Oakland.
   ``We've had people buying $1,000 worth of tickets, $400, $600 ...
$50 is nothing. There are $50 buyers all over the place,'' said
bakery president Walter Harmon.
   The late rush pumped millions of extra dollars into the grand
prize pot before sales were halted at 7:45 p.m. Saturday, 13 minutes
before the drawing.
   ``At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the Lotto prize past $46
million, past the Pennsylvania record,'' previously the biggest
North American lottery prize, Taylor said Saturday.
   That Pennsylvania jackpot was awarded in October. The biggest
previous California jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two players
in October.
   The lottery drew players across state lines and from Mexico. At
Tahoe Tom's in South Lake Tahoe, the fat pot drew Nevada residents
away from casinos across the border, three blocks away.
   ``We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the
(ticket) line up to the state line and have the casino executives
wonder what's going on,'' said owner Tom Erickson.

   Separatist rebels killed seven soldiers
in Nagaland and another dissident group was blamed for setting a
land mine that killed three people in West Bengal, officials said
Sunday.
   In Punjab state, security personnel fatally shot four Pakistanis
and a suspected Sikh terrorist in a series of clashes, according to
reports Sunday.
   In the Punjab city of Amritsar, 260 miles northeast of New Delhi,
Sohan Singh took over Sunday as head priest of the Golden Temple,
the Sikhs' holiest shrine.
   Singh indicated he would not align himself with Sikh militants
who took over the temple complex last month and battled with police,
leaving at least 48 people dead before police gained control.
   Militant Sikhs have been waging a violent campaign since 1982 for
a separate Sikh state in Punjab. Sikhs comprise just 2 percent of
India's 800 million population but are a slight majority in Punjab.
   Suspected members of the outlawed Nationalist Council of Nagaland
late Saturday ambushed a convoy of the Assam Rifles, an
anti-guerrilla force, near Faluni in Tuensang district. Nagaland is
a remote northeastern state.
   A junior officer and six other soldiers were killed, United News
of India reported. It had no details of the battle.
   In the Darjeeling area of West Bengal, about 185 miles north of
Calcutta, a land mine believed planted by the Gorkha National
Liberation Front blew up a vehicle on the outskirts of town, killing
three civilians and seriously wounding two, UNI said.
   Gorkha militants also hurled bombs at police posts in two nearby
towns Saturday and exploded four bombs in a third town, but no one
was hurt in any of the incidents, the news agency said.
   Police on Sunday fired on five Pakistanis trying to illegally
cross the border into India in the Dera Baba Nank area, about 250
miles northeast of New Delhi, and killed three of them, news reports
said. They said the other two fled back into Pakistan.
   Saturday night, police fatally shot a Pakistani trying to cross
into India near Ferozepore, some 170 miles northeast of the capital,
the reports said.
   The United News of India also reported police killed Jagmel
Singh, a member of the outlawed Khalistan Commando Force, early
Sunday in Ludihana district, 190 miles northeast of New Delhi.
   Jagmel and a companion on a motorscooter fired on security
personnel at a road checkpoint and the officers fired back, killing
Jagmel, police said. His companion escaped.

   The Russian Orthodox Church launched a yearlong
celebration of its 1,000 anniversary Sunday with a special liturgy
and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near
the Kremlin.
   ``We are glad that our jubilee coincides with this very
beneficial period in Soviet history,'' said senior church official
Metropolitan Filaret.
   About 500 religious representatives from more than 100 countries
_ including a high-ranking Vatican delegation _ crowded into the
large, stone Patriarchal Cathedral of the Epiphany to hear the
liturgy led by Moscow's Patriarch Pimen.
   ``The Russian Orthodox Church blesses wholeheartedly the good
developments in this country and calls on its flock to take an
active part in the process of restructuring,'' said Filaret.
   Soviet television showed Pimen and other Orthodox clergymen
officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled
the opulently furbished church, which has five domes and three
altars and dates from 1731.
   Several thousand worshipers crowded the cathedral, whose ancient
icons and relics that are associated both with the history of the
Russian church and the creation of the pre-Communist Russian state.
   Christianity was introduced by Prince Vladimir in Kievan Rus _
the ancient name of what is now the northern Soviet republic of the
Ukraine _ with a baptism ceremony on the banks of the Dnieper River
in 988.
   In a rare show of cooperation between church and state, the state
Ministry of Religion participated in organizing events linked to the
millennium.
   Cathedrals in the nation's oldest monastery _ in the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev _ will be returned to the Russian Orthodox Church
this week after 27 years of state ownership, according to church and
state officials.
   Filaret, speaking to a news conference Saturday, noted that the
state was also this year permitting the church to publish half a
million copies of the Bible in the Russian and Ukrainian languages.
   The millennium celebrations come as the Soviet government is
considering easing its religious restrictions. Since the repressive
era of dictator Josef Stalin in the 1920s, Soviet worshipers have
been required to register with the government and their church
activities have been severely restricted.
   Pope John Paul II did not attend the ceremonies, although he has
often expressed the desire to visit the Soviet Union. But the
Vatican said earlier that the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend
an invitation to the pope. Russian Orthodox churchmen have said John
Paul was invited.
   The pontiff has said he would go to the Soviet Union only on
condition that he be allowed to visit the heavily-Catholic Soviet
republics. But John Paul has said he has been twice denied
permission to visit Lithuania, one of the country's Catholic
heartlands.

<HEAD>Waldheim Receives Saudi Arabia's Highest Decoration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim of Austria,
shunned by many nations because of allegations about his actions as
a German army officer, met with King Fahd Sunday after receiving
Saudi Arabia's highest decoration.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
two leaders discussed efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war and the
Arab-Israeli conflict and also bilateral relations.
   Fahd gave Waldheim, a former secretary-general of the United
Nations, a red carpet welcome when the Austrian leader arrived for a
three-day state visit on Saturday. Fahd later hosted a banquet at
which he decorated Waldheim with the Cordon of King Abdel-Aziz, the
nation's highest decoration.
   Saudi Arabia is the fourth nation that Waldheim has visited since
being elected president in June 1986. He has been to the Vatican,
Jordan and Pakistan and has an invitation to visit Iran.
   But he has been shunned by many countries, including the United
States, which barred him from entering the country because of
allegations about his actions as a German army lieutenant in the
Balkans from 1942 to 1945.
   A historians' commission in Austria that investigated the
allegations said in February that Waldheim was ``in close
proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew they were
going on and made no attempt to prevent them.
   But it did not support allegations that Waldheim was involved in
committing atrocities.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing. Saudi Arabia and some other
Arab countries have claimed that a campaign accusing Waldheim of
complicity in World War II atrocities is being directed by Zionists
because of the Austrian president's stand toward Arabs.
   Waldheim canceled visits to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
after leaders of those countries were called to an emergency Arab
summit on Tuesday.
   Representatives of all Arab nations except Egypt will meet in
Algeria to express their support for the Arab uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The uprising, which began
in December, is the only item formally on the agenda of the
three-day summit that opens in Algiers under the chairmanship of
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid.
   The official Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday night that
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq will remain in Baghdad to direct
the war against Iran. The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said Hussein
appointed Taha Yassin Ramadan, first deputy prime minister, to head
the Iraqi delegation to the summit.
   Waldheim is seeking to bolster political and economic cooperation
with Saudi Arabia and the oil-rich Persian Gulf in general. Saudi
Arabia ranks as Austria's third non-European trade partner after the
United States and Japan.
   Waldheim has urged an early end to the Arab-Israeli conflict and
the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war on the basis of United Nations
resolutions.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
arrived here Sunday to address a special U.N. session on disarmament
later this week.
   ``We have brought what we believe to be interesting and good
ideas and proposals to this special session and we will set forth
these ideas and suggestions in our statements,'' he told reporters
at Kennedy International Airport, where he arrived on a flight from
Moscow.
   He did not say specifically what he would propose when he
addresses the special four-week session at the United Nations on
Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze said, ``The entire agenda of the special session was
discussed'' last week at the Moscow summit meeting between Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   Progress made on arms treaties during the Moscow summit ``shows
that we've come to the special session not empty-handed,'' he said.
   Soviet leaders ``attach great importance'' to the special U.N.
session, said the foreign minister who spoke through an interpreter.
   At least 25 presidents and prime ministers are scheduled to
attend the General Assembly during the special session, but no
breakthroughs are expected.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Bishop Says Duarte's Absence Could Encourage Peace
Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The auxiliary archbishop of San
Salvador called on his followers Sunday to pray for President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, but said the president's absence may help end the
8-year-old civil war.
   Duarte went last week to Washington for treatment of cancer.
   ``The absence of the president permits political antagonists to
not think so much about demolishing their enemy,'' Roman Catholic
Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez told reporters after Mass at the
Metropolitan Cathedral.
   ``The political debate will have less passion, and that is
favorable,'' he said.
   Duarte, 62, has been in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center since
Tuesday night. He has cancer of the stomach and liver.
   It is widely presumed in El Salvador that Duarte, who is in the
final year of a 5-year term, will not be able to resume the
presidency. Vice-President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount is the acting
chief executive.
   Before discovering his illness, Duarte began talks with the two
parties beside his centrist Christian Democrats that are represented
in the legislature.
   Castillo said last week he planned to continue and broaden that
initiative with the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance and
the conservative National Conciliation Party in an effort to draft a
consensus to be presented to leftist rebels.
   In three fruitless rounds of talks since 1984, the rebels have
demanded a role in a broadly based transition government. Duarte has
rejected the demand, insisting that the rebels must lay down their
weapons and compete in elections.
   In his homily, Rosa Chavez referred to an all-night prayer vigil
on behalf of Duarte at the cathedral. The facade of the building was
draped with banners reading ``Duarte Lives, Today and Forever,'' and
``Duarte: God and the people are with you.''
   But only about 150 people were taking part in the visil as of
midnight.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Justice Department Probes Hollywood Friend of Teamsters
Boss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential Hollywood figure who reportedly
stands ready to step in and resolve movie and television industry
labor disputes is the subject of a federal racketeering probe, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   Martin Bacow, 66, has been under investigation for about 18
months by the Justice Department's Organized Crime Task Force, the
Los Angeles Times reported.
   The department has used telephone wiretaps, among other means, to
determine if he and his associates have been coercing production
companies into hiring them to guarantee labor peace, the newspaper
said.
   Bacow said the allegations are groundless and that his success at
ending costly labor problems is a natural talent. He also said he
has never been paid for his help, except for serving as a paid
consultant on the film ``Rhinestone.''
   ``If people come to me, and they believe me, and they trust me,
is there something wrong with that?'' Bacow said. ``If they want to
convict me for my God-given talents, they better bring God into
court.''
   Strike force attorney Richard Stavin, who is reportedly directing
the inquiry, refused to discuss the case or confirm that Bacow is
being investigated.
   Bacow has played a quiet role in solving labor impasses in many
productions, including such TV shows as ``Miami Vice'' and ``Magnum
P.I.,'' and on the films ``Rhinestone'' and ``Foul Play,'' the Times
said.
   Bacow says he was told by the Teamsters union that the FBI
listened in on telephone conversations between him and union chief
Jackie Presser.
   The Times also said it learned the Justice Department's organized
crime unit tapped calls between Bacow and a Los Angeles police
detective who allegedly tipped him about the federal probe.
   That detective, John J. St. John, 53, recently took early
retirement after his alleged information leak became public. Fellow
Detective Louis W. Graham, 45, received a month-long suspension for
failing to report St. John's activities, the report said.
   The racketeering probe is investigating alleged Teamsters union
involvment in film industry labor dealings and resulted in grand
jury subpeonas being served on Sylvester Stallone's film studio,
White Eagle Productions, the Times said.
   Stallone, who was introduced to Presser by Bacow and went on to
work in the union's 1986 anti-drug campaign, was not served with any
personal subpoenas.
   Subpoenas have also gone out to some entertainment industry labor
unions, including the Screen Extras Guild and the Teamsters' primary
bargaining unit in Hollywood, Local 399, according to the report.
   Bacow described himself as a retired scriptwriter and producer,
and claimed to have no affiliation with the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, a contention supported by union officials.
   Presser couldn't be reached for comment because he is
recuperating from surgery for brain cancer.

<HEAD>Howe Says Iranian Talks Not Part Of A Hostage Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Sunday
that talks with Iran this week on compensation for damage to
diplomatic property are not designed to help win the release of
British hostages in Lebanon.
   But his deputy, David Mellor, said the talks could ``warm up''
relations between Iran and Britain, which worsened after expulsions
last year left only one Iranian diplomat in London and one British
diplomat in Tehran.
   The Foreign Office said on Saturday that a four-man Iranian
delegation will arrive on Tuesday for talks with Britih officials on
damage to the Iranian Embassy in London and damage to the British
Embassy building and other British diplomatic property in Iran.
   If an agreement is reached under the British proposal, the
Foreign Office said, Britain will pay Iran $3.24 million for damage
to its embassy in London and give London's Westminster Council
$360,000 to maintain the building. Iran would pay Britain $1.6
million for damage to British buildings in Iran.
   There are 18 foreign hostages held by Moslem extremists in
Lebanon, including nine Americans and three Britons. The longest
held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   It is believed the hostages are held by members of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, organization.
   David Young, a lawmaker from the opposition Labor Party and
vice-chairman of the British-Lebanese Parliamentary Group, said on
Sunday a compensation deal could mean that Britain was moving toward
paying for the release of the British hostages.
   ``It now seems that the government is following the route of the
Americans and the French in buying out their hostages,'' he said.
   But Mellor, in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. radio,
dismissed Young's contention as ``absolute rubbish, irresponsible
rubbish.''
   In an interview on TV-AM, Howe insisted the talks with the
Iranians had nothing to do with the British hostages who include
Terry Waite, the archbishop of Canterbury's special envoy who
disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987.
   ``There is an argument about the damage done to the Iranian
Embassy premises here and the damage done to our embassy premises
there,'' Howe said. He added: ``That is what it is about. There is
nothing of wider significance. Our policy on hostages is absolutely
clear _ no deals.''
   Mellor said Britain had always been prepared to hold talks with
Iran ``and to warm up relations.''
   ``If we can sort out these questions of damage to diplomatic
properties in both of our countries, well, from an acorn grows an
oak,'' he said.
   From time to time, Britain has raised the question of Iran
assisting in the release of the hostages on a purely humanitarian
basis, ``not as a bargaining chip in some rather squalid deal,''
Mellor said.
   Such a deal would almost certainly make it more likely that other
hostages would be taken and ``drag the name of Britain through the
mud,'' he added.
   The Foreign Office said the compensation talks will focus on
damage to the Iranian Embassy building at London's Princes Gate,
which caught fire when British commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a
hostage siege, and on damage to British diplomatic buildings and the
British Embassy in Iran. The British properties were damaged by mobs
in 1978, 1979, and 1980.
   ``We want compensation for the damage to our property in Iran and
we want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the Princes
Gate property, which is a health hazard and an eyesore,'' said a
Foreign Office spokesman Saturday.
   Following the release last month of the last three French
hostages in Lebanon, families of the missing Britons have been
pressing the government to help secure their release.

   A panel of former judges on a commission of inquiry
arranged by two television companies said Sunday there was
insufficient evidence to determine if Kurt Waldheim committed war
crimes as a German army officer.
   The panel issued its decision on the Austrian president and
former U.N. general-secretary after hearing nine days of testimony
in London in April.
   Witnesses included officers who served with Waldheim in the
German army in World War II and survivors of concentration camps and
civilian massacres.
   The inquiry was paid for by America's Home Box Office and
Britain's Thames Television, both of which screened a 3{-hour
program program Sunday night that included some of the testimony and
the decision by the jurists.
   ``We conclude unanimously that the evidence which has been put
before us is not enough to make it probable that Lt. Waldheim
committed any of the war crimes alleged against him in this
inquiry,'' the panel said.
   The five judges also found ``lapses and aberrations of memory
such as Dr. Waldheim seems to have had about his services in Greece
and the Balkans are not in themselves evidence of guilt.'' But the
commission said Waldheim ``must have known'' about German plans to
shoot captured Italian officers.
   The former judges who participated in the inquiry came from the
United States, Britain, Canada, West Germany and Sweden.
   Waldheim has been shunned by many countries, including the United
States, which has barred him from entering the country, because of
allegations about his actions as an army lieutenant in the Balkans
from 1942 to 1945.
   A historians' commission appointed by the Austrian government
that investigated the allegations said in February that Waldheim was
``in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew
they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them.
   But it did not support allegations that Waldheim was involved in
committing atrocities. Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing.
   The panel that participated in the television inquiry was headed
by a retired British Appeal Court judge, Sir Frederick Lawton. Other
members were Shirley Hufstedler, a former circuit judge for the U.S.
Court of Appeals, and West German Walter Hubner, Swede Gustav Petren
and Canadian Gordon Cooper _ all retired appeals court judges.

<HEAD>American Women Beat Soviets In World's Largest Card Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Pennsylvania women overcame a challenge from the
Soviet Union to win the largest global card game ever played, the
World Bridge Federation announced Sunday.
   It said Jan Horwitz and Barbara Norante of Butler, Pa., won the
bridge contest beating 84,356 rivals who played simultaneously in 94
countries beginning at 8 p.m. Friday and ending Saturday morning.
   Results, tabulated Saturday, were released Sunday by the
federation, which organized the event.
   Their winning score on 24 bridge hands was 76.33 percent. The
same hands, which took an average of 3.5 hours to complete, were
played at each location in 2,500 cities.
   The Soviet Union, competing for the first time, held a
comfortable lead until North America, the last to join the
elaborately timed schedule, turned in its results.
   Names of the Soviet players, who scored 75.92 percent, were not
given.
   ``We got a call with the results from the official bridge league
in Moscow, but the line was bad and we were cut off before we got
the names or where they had played,'' said Albert Dormer, spokesman
for the bridge federation.
   He said the Epson Worldwide Bridge Contest will take a place in
the Guinness Book of World Records as the biggest bridge contest
ever played, beating out a record set last year by the same contest
in which 73,256 people participated.
   Dormer said the contest also holds the record for the largest
number of people competing simultaneously in any sport.
   By coming in second worldwide, the Soviet pair will be recognized
as the European champions.
   Dormer said that although 50 million people worldwide play
bridge, it had been frowned on in the Soviet Union as a frivolous,
capitalist game. However, he said, it has gained greater acceptance
since Soviet world chess masters Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov
have been seen playing it between chess rounds.
   Third place winners were from Peru and were identified only as
Garcia and Rane. They scored 75 percent.

<HEAD>Instructor Says Others Forced Mirecki into Pool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several Navy rescue swimming instructors
forced a recruit into a swimming pool shortly before he collapsed
and died, despite his protests that he wanted to quit, two
instructors testified Sunday.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Raymond W. Jablonowski, a safety observer
at the time of the March 2 death, said the instructors ``more or
less tossed'' Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki into the pool at Pensacola
Naval Air Station.
   ``They put him back in the water,'' said Petty Officer 2nd Class
Bennie T. Giles, an instructor. ``He wasn't thrown into the water.
He was more or less slid into the water.''
   The two men testified during a Navy investigative hearing here on
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery charges
against five instructors and a dereliction of duty count against the
school's commanding officer, Lt. Thomas A. Torchia.
   The hearing, scheduled to continue Monday, is to determine
whether the six should be court-martialed.
   A doctor testified Saturday that Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.,
died of apparent heart failure most likely induced by fear.
   ``I remember him saying, `I can't do it, I can't do it,' '' Giles
said. ``I remember him saying he didn't want to go back in the
pool.''
   Giles said he could identify only one of the defendants, Petty
Officer 1st Class David J. Smith, as being among a group of
instructors who forced Mirecki back into the pool.
   Jablonowski said he could remember another defendant in the
group, Petty Officer 2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton.
   Giles said Petty Officer 1st Class Richard E. Blevins, another of
the defendants, took charge of the instruction session when Mirecki
first left the pool. Jablonowski said Blevins was known around the
school as ``the Antichrist.''
   Neither Giles nor Jablonowski were charged.
   After Mirecki was back in the water, Giles said he talked to him
and the recruit calmed down. But he said that within minutes, Petty
Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe dived in and put Mirecki into a head
hold. The exercise called for recruits to extricate themselves from
such holds.
   Earlier testimony indicated that after he was forced back in the
water, Mirecki grabbed on to a rope dividing the shallow and deep
ends of the pool but Combe and Petty Officer 2nd Class John Zelenock
pulled him loose. Combe and Zelenock were the other instructors
charged.
   Giles and Jablonowski both said Mirecki apparently escaped from
the hold by Combe just before collapsing.
   Jablonowski said he signaled to end the exercise when he noticed
Mirecki getting weaker.
   Combe then brought Mirecki to the side of the pool where
instructors and corpsmen tried to revive him, Giles said.
   Giles said there was no formal policy requiring one or more
instructors to remain out of the water as safety observers, but that
they took turns observing during the drill, he said.
   Under questioning by Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio, the investigating
officer, Giles said there was no release signal for students to give
if they were in trouble while in an instructor's grasp and that
there was no formal safety indoctrination as part of the course
taken to become an instructor.
   Under questioning by lawyers for the defendants and government,
Giles denied that Zelenock punched Mirecki and said he was unable to
recall when during the series of events students were told to turn
away and sing the national anthem.
   Students had testified they were told to sing when Mirecki
allegedly was being forced, screaming, back into the pool.

   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe gave cautious
backing Sunday to Vice President George Bush's campaign for the
presidency.
   Interviewer David Frost asked Howe on TV-AM if Britain would
prefer Republican Bush to his probable Democratic opponent
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``One has to be very cautious about expressing opinions on
elections in other countries because it is part of the democratic
process. One works with the leader who emerges at the end of the
day,'' the foreign secretary replied.
   ``But at this stage it would be less than human if we did not
recognize the value of working with George Bush, with whom we have
worked for a long time,'' Howe said.
   ``If there is anything in the over-simplified left-right divide
in politics, he is on the right in politics and so are we in this
country.''
   The relationship between the United States and Britain has
flourished during the 1980s under their two conservative leaders,
President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

   An S-3 Viking anti-submarine

China Sea, killing at least two crewmen, the U.S. Navy said.
   One of the plane's four crew members was rescued and another was
missing, Navy spokesman Lt. Robert Anderson said Monday. He said the
surviving crewman was in ``stable but guarded'' condition.
   Search operations were under way Monday for the missing crew
member, he added.
   Anderson said the crash occurred during routine training
operations about 200 miles southeast of Hong Kong. The cause of the
accident has not been determined, and names of the crew were
withheld pending notification of relatives, he added.

   Merv Griffin and Eva Gabor, after
years of dating, will soon marry, says sister Zsa Zsa Gabor.
   ``Eva is going to marry Merv Griffin,'' Zsa Zsa gushed Saturday
night during a reception. ``They are just coming back from the
Bahamas. I'm not supposed to tell, but I just can't shut up.''
   Griffin, a former talk show host who had parlayed his production
company profits into a real estate empire, refuses to discuss his
private life, according to his publicist Warren Cowan.
   Cowan said Sunday night that he could not confirm any wedding
plans, and added, ``I'd be very surprised.''
   Zsa Zsa revealed her younger sister's nuptial plans after South
Pasadena Mayor Jim Woolacott mistakenly called her ``Princess Eva''
during a centennial celebration.
   As the abashed mayor blurted out apologies, Zsa Zsa launched into
a series of observations on her sibling.
   ``She's one year younger than me, but she's 10 years older,''
said Zsa Zsa. ``She's the one who was on `Green Acres.' You know,
the little innocent one, but she's not that innocent.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Sunday the
United States would be to blame if peace talks with Nicaraguan
rebels scheduled to begin on Tuesday fail to produce a permanent
cease-fire.
   ``We hold the United States government responsible for what
happens in these meetings'' with the Contras, Ortega said after
meeting with agricultural, industrial, health and education workers.
   Leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella
organization, are scheduled to hold talks with government officials
June 7-9 in Managua. It would be the fourth session held in the
Nicaraguan capital to negotiate terms of a permament truce to the
6{-year-old civil war.
   Ortega also said the Reagan administration would be at fault ``if
in this meeting the Contras do not agree to lay down their arms.''
   The rebels, trained, funded and supplied by the United States,
began their war to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in
1981.
   Ortega said in an interview after his speech that his government
would offer ``no variations'' to its peace proposal submitted during
the last round of negotiations held May 26-28.
   The Contras turned down a government proposal for a 30-day
cease-fire extension and a plan for delivering humanitarian aid to
rebel units athered in truce zones.
   Both sides have agreed to hold their fire at least until the end
of this week's talks.
   The government agreed to discuss some of the Contras' demands for
political changes they say would bring about democratization in
Nicaragua. Those include freedom of the press, the lifting of all
political restrictions, separation of the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front from the army and the government, constitutional
changes and electoral and judicial reforms.
   Ortega said on Sunday the rebel delegation would be permitted to
visit leaders of the internal opposition and the Roman Catholic
Church during its stay in the capital.
   The Contra delegation planned to travel to San Jose, Costa Rica
on Monday to prepare for the talks, said a rebel spokesman in a
telephone interview from Miami on Sunday. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz failed on
Sunday to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept
terms set by King Hussein of Jordan for holding Mideast peace talks.
   ``I think on the whole we had a good discussion about this,''
Shultz said before flying back to Egypt from Israel. ``As far as any
major shift in anybody's position, I cannot report that.''
   Shultz said at Israel's Ben Gurion airport, ``We are going to
stay engaged and do everything we can for the balance of this
(Reagan) administration to accomplish as much as we can and leave
for our successors as constructive and positive situation as we
possibly can.''
   Shultz had two meetings with Shamir in Jerusalem in an effort to
persuade him to agree to negotiate with Jordan with a commitment for
Israel to exchange land in the occupied territories for Arab
recognition. Shultz also met in Israel with Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and members of the
Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense committees.
   He told Israel in a public statement that ``the continued
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustation of
Palestinian rights is a dead-end street.'' He added: ``The belief
that this can continue is an illusion.''
   He also spoke of the prospect of another war in a region where
long-range missiles and chemical weapons have proliferated.
   The next war, Shultz said, ``will be unlike any conflict we have
seen before, involving more casualties and proving harder to
contain.''
   King Hussein, in talks Saturday with Shultz in Amman, insisted on
an Israeli commitment to withdraw as a precondition for accepting
the U.S proposal for peace talks. Shultz said he had emphasized to
Shamir ``the need for King Hussein's side to feel there is something
to negotiate about.''
   Jordan lost the West Bank, which it controlled from 1948 until
1967, in the six-day war with Israel.
   Shultz said despite his failure to persuade Shamir, ``I can
report what seems to me a very genuine desire to be engaged and to
be involved, not just for the sake of being able to say that, in a
genuine search for peace.''
   Shultz, who is based in Egypt during his Middle East shuttle
effort, will go to Syria Monday for talks with President Hafez Assad
about the faltering U.S. peace plan and the Arab summit meeting that
opens Tuesday in Algeria. Shultz hopes to persuade the Syrian leader
to take a moderate position. The secretary of state will then go to
Luxor to visit ancient Egyptian sites.
   A Shamir adviser said the prime minister and Shultz discussed
peace options but he did not elaborate. He said Shultz ``ensured
Shamir that the relations between Israel and the United States will
be strengthened in the future.''
   The adviser, Yossi Ben Aharon, accused King Hussein of attempting
to negotiate the disposition of the West Bank through the United
States. ``We prefer him to say this to us directly,'' the Israeli
official said.
   The occupied lands were virtually shut down Sunday for the third
day of a strike called by leaders of the Arab uprising to protest
Shultz's visit. It was Shultz's fourth trip to the region this year
to promote the peace plan.
   Two Israelis and more than 200 Palestinians have died since
December as a result of violence in the West Bank and in the Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   Shultz also called on Arabs to accept Israel's existence. ``The
belief that this can be avoided or that violence can end Israeli
occupation is an illusion,'' Shultz said.
   Peres, who backs the U.S. plan, said Shultz's mission ``sends a
loud and clear message to all listeners, a message of a hope and
choice.''
   The plan calls for an international peace conference in which the
United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France, as the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, would serve as
hosts. The negotiations would be aimed at self-rule for 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, but not a separate
state.
   In a second stage, Israel and the Arabs would try to find an
overall settlement to their conflict.

   He did not say specifically what he would propose when he

   Shevardnadze said, ``The entire agenda of the special session was

   Progress made on arms treaties during the Moscow summit ``shows
that we've come to the special session not empty-handed,'' he said.
   Soviet leaders ``attach great importance'' to the special U.N.
session, said the foreign minister who spoke through an interpreter.
   At least 25 presidents and prime ministers are scheduled to
attend the General Assembly during the special session, but no

   The Socialists and conservatives virtually split the
popular vote in Sunday's first round of elections for the National
Assembly. French television projected President Francois
Mitterrand's Socialists will win the most seats.
   Based on 97 percent of the ballots counted, the Socialists had
37.4 percent of the vote when the counting was stopped late Sunday.
The conservative Rally for the Republic and center-right Union for
French Democracy, which backed the same candidates, garnered 37.7
percent.
   The Communists took 11.2 percent and the rightist National Front
9.7 percent, with the rest going to minor parties.
   Counting was to resume Monday.
   State-run Antenne 2 network's projections gave the Socialists
between 310 and 330 seats in the 577-seat assembly. It said the
Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy would win
230-250 seats and the Communists 10-20, with the National Front shut
out.
   In predicting the makeup of the new assembly _ the lower and more
powerful house of Parliament _ the television network projected the
final outcome for all districts including areas that will have
runoff elections next Sunday.
   Candidates needed at least 50 percent of the vote in the first
round to win a seat in the legislature. In districts where there was
no winner in the first round, candidates had to receive at least
12.5 percent of the first-round votes to be eligible for the June 12
runoff.
   There is inevitable pressure on those coming in lower than second
to drop out and support one of the two frontrunners in the runoff.
   This system was expected to hurt the smaller parties but help the
Socialists. In 1986, before the new system was adopted, seats were
assigned on the basis of the percentage of votes won by lists of
candidates.
   Projections showed 65.5 percent of the 38 million people eligible
to vote cast ballots _ one of the lowest turnouts in recent years.
That compares with 78.5 percent in the March 1986 legislative
election and 81.4 percent in the first round of the presidential
election April 24.
   Polls had predicted a wider Socialist advantage.
   ``It's an encouraging result, but we have to consolidate it,''
said former conservative Finance Minister Edouard Balladur.
``Victory is possible if we unite. We have a week to convince all
those who do not want to give a majority to the Socialist Party.''
   Polls also predicted the Communist Party and the extreme-right
National Front _ which each won 35 seats in the last election _
would fare badly because of the winner-take-all voting system
reinstituted two years ago.
   The election came less than a month after Mitterrand defeated
former Premier Jacques Chirac, a conservative, with a solid 54
percent of the vote.
   Conservatives controlled the National Assembly from 1986 until
Mitterrand dissolved it after his re-election.
   Mitterrand had said during his presidential campaign he wanted to
work with the existing National Assembly and open the Cabinet to
non-Socialists from the political center.
   New Premier Michel Rocard formed a government with no notable
presence from other parties, however, and Mitterrand called the
election.
   The Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche noted in a front-page
editorial that despite the importance of the election for the
future, ``the campaign gave rise only to boredom or indifference.''
   Few issues were debated. The Socialists declared they were ready
to institute a guaranteed minimum wage, to be paid for in part with
a special tax on large fortunes. Such a tax was abolished by the
right in 1986.
   Socialists continued with Mittterrand's ``opening'' theme through
the campaign, but most politicians of the right and center-right
viewed the idea as little more than an invitation for them to become
Socialist.

   A panel of former judges on a commission of inquiry
arranged by two television companies said Sunday there was
insufficient evidence to determine if Kurt Waldheim committed war
crimes as a German army officer.
   The panel issued its decision on the Austrian president and
former U.N. general-secretary after hearing nine days of testimony
in London in April.
   Witnesses included officers who served with Waldheim in the
German army in World War II and survivors of concentration camps and
civilian massacres.
   The inquiry was paid for by America's Home Box Office and
Britain's Thames Television, both of which screened a 3{-hour
program program Sunday night that included some of the testimony and
the decision by the jurists.
   ``We conclude unanimously that the evidence which has been put
before us is not enough to make it probable that Lt. Waldheim
committed any of the war crimes alleged against him in this
inquiry,'' the panel said.
   The five judges also found ``lapses and aberrations of memory
such as Dr. Waldheim seems to have had about his services in Greece
and the Balkans are not in themselves evidence of guilt.'' But the
commission said Waldheim ``must have known'' about German plans to
shoot captured Italian officers.
   The former judges who participated in the inquiry came from the
United States, Britain, Canada, West Germany and Sweden.
   Waldheim has been shunned by many countries, including the United
States, which has barred him from entering the country, because of
allegations about his actions as an army lieutenant in the Balkans
from 1942 to 1945.
   A historians' commission appointed by the Austrian government
that investigated the allegations said in February that Waldheim was

   Radio psychologist Toni Grant, who helps
callers solve problems involving love and romance, married Indiana
industrialist John L. Bell at an outdoor ceremony Sunday.
   The couple exchanged wedding vows in view of about 150 friends,
including show business personalities Jane Meadows, Dick Van Patten
and Esther Williams.
   The bride, wearing a white gown, and the groom, wearing a black
tuxedo, stood beneath a gazebo in the tree-shrouded Swan Lake area
of the Hotel Bel-Air, said Michelle Bega, publicist for Miss Grant.
   The matron of honor was Los Angeles anchorwoman Kelly Lange, and
the bridesmaids were Miss Grant's two daughters, Courtney and
Kimberly, and Bell's sister, Alice Bell.
   The couple will honeymoon later in Hong Kong and will live in
Beverly Hills, Ms. Bega said.
   Miss Grant, 40, is the host of a live call-in radio program

   Three boxcars packed with 120 tons of explosives
blew up near a train station, killing 68 people, injuring 230 others
and throwing cars into the air like feathers, the official media
reported Sunday.
   The blast Saturday in Arzamas, 240 miles east of Moscow, carved a
crater 80 feet deep and 175 feet wide and destroyed or damaged more
than 400 buildings,Tass and the government newspaper Izvestia said.
   The reports, some of the most detailed Soviet accounts ever filed
so soon after an accident, said some of the injuries were serious.
They said the cause of the explosion was not known.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz left Israel
after a whirlwind visit Sunday saying he made no headway in his
peace initiative.
   Shultz extended a dinner and working session with Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir at the premier's home in Jerusalem for an extra hour
but told reporters at the airport later: ``I cannot report a shift
in (Shamir's) position.''
   Shultz said that U.S.-Soviet summit talks in Moscow last week
produced a long list of issues on which the United States and the
Soviet Union agreed but the superpowers still had a long way to go
in their talks.

   Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday upheld a
government order to deport Arab-American Mubarak Awad, an advocate
of civil disobedience against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories.
   The court turned down Awad's appeal and said the Jerusalem-born,
U.S. citizen ``harms the security and public order'' in Israel, does
not have a legal residence permit and is in Israel under an expired
visa in his American passport.
   The ruling came a few hours before the arrival of Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, who had protested the deportation order.

   The numbers game turned into a waiting
game Sunday as California Lottery officials waited for holders of
two winning tickets to claim a $51.2 million jackpot, the biggest
ever in a North American lottery.
   The holders of the winning tickets cannot claim their share of
the prize until the start of business Monday. Each winning ticket in
Saturday's Lotto 6-49 drawing is worth $25,618,116, payable over 20
years, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   The lottery's computers determined that the two winning tickets
were sold at a liquor store in Fairfield, about 45 miles east of San
Francisco, and at a supermarket in the Sacramento suburb of
Carmichael. The computers cannot identify the owners of the tickets,
though.
   The winners will be announced when they present their tickets at
lottery offices for verification.

made radio contact with some miners hours after a disastrous mine
explosion but ordered them to stop sending signals so they could try
to find trapped victims.
   The statement from the mine owner confirmed a report from one of
six miners found alive Saturday in an air pocket 500 feet
underground. It fueled allegations that searchers bungled their work
after Wednesday's blast that is believed to have killed 51 miners.
   One newspaper declared the incident ``a scandal.''

   The Sandinista government and

but the last few steps to halt the fighting will be the most
difficult.
   The final measures are particularly crucial for the rebels, known
as Contras, who may negotiate themselves out of existence in peace
talks scheduled to resume Tuesday.
   The rebels do not have the political structure to survive as a
separate organization on the Nicaraguan political scene. Their role
likely will be taken over by the political parties already

   California voters, who sparked a
nationwide taxpayer revolt with Proposition 13 a decade ago, are
being asked in a series of ballot measures whether they are having
some second thoughts.
   Although gloomy predictions of fiscal disaster remain largely
unrealized since the measure cut property taxes by $7 billion, or an
average of 57 percent, Proposition 13 has had its visible effects.
The public increasingly pays for services that once were free,
including parks and recreation programs. Public grounds look
scruffier than they did 10 years ago as officials have cut back on
maintenance.
   State bailouts and creative funding schemes are credited with
keeping most local governments afloat since the measure was approved
June 6, 1978, but many agree that schools and rural counties have
suffered under the cuts.

<HEAD>Company Makes Lethal Injection Machines, Electric Chairs, Gallows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The name masks the purpose: American Engineering
Co. is in the business of death.
   Lethal injection machines, electric chairs, gallows and gas
chambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built by
American Engineering, believed to be the only company in the United
States that exclusively makes execution equipment.
   Four years ago, it created the first computer-controlled machine
to regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection. Five states
have bought the $30,000 device, company president Norbert C. Lynch
said, from New Jersey in 1984 to Delaware earlier this year.
   In 1983, an engineer friend of Lynch's heard a disc jockey
mocking New Jersey because it advertised for executioners. The idea
was planted: how to automate lethal injection.
   ``The methodology that's used in the lethal injection on a manual
system is barbaric,'' Lynch said, who runs the company and a
financial consulting firm from a storefront here.
   The basic complications in lethal injection, both Lynch and death
penalty opponents agree, are ruptured veins, inaccurate dosages and
failure to immediately induce unconsciousness.
   Of the 37 states where capital punishment is legal, 16 prescribe
death by lethal injection. Some, like Delaware, haven't executed
anyone in decades and have electric chairs and gas chambers that
might not work if needed.
   According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 98 people have
been executed in the United States since the Supreme Court upheld
the death penalty in 1976, including five this year and 25 in 1987.
   More than 2,020 inmates populate death row, ACLU figures show.
   Delaware contracted for one of the machines last year after the
state changed its capital punishment law to lethal injection from
hanging, said H. Brooke Laggner, chief of administration and
operational support for the state Department of Correction.
   ``It takes away the element that you don't have any Hippocratic
oath problems because all you need is someone to set up an i.v.,''
Laggner said of the machine, which Delaware bought along with a
$60,000 execution trailer designed by American Engineering.
   Civil libertarians rail at that sort of thinking, saying there is
no ethical justification in making executions easier or more
efficient.
   ``The worst sin of all is to do that well which shouldn't be done
at all,'' said Henry Schwarzschild, director of the ACLU's capital
punishment project.
   ``The notion that a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely is
morally outrageous,'' he said.
   A 3-by-4-foot gray box with a row of switches and red lights,
Lynch's machine is mounted to the wall above the inmate's gurney.
Intravenous tubing inserted by a medical technician into the
inmate's arm runs through the wall to a computerized control module.
   Two executioners push one button each to start the machine, so
neither knows who actually activates the pistons that send the three
deadly drugs through syringes and into the inmate.
   A dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious. The
second drug is pancuronium bromide, or Pavulon, which in large doses
paralyzes body functions. The third, potassium chloride, ensures
heart arrest.
   The execution should take four to six minutes. Lynch said the
prisoner won't feel anything. ``He's going to go out and that's the
end of it. Over and out.''
   American Engineering, with assets of about $100,000, has a
limited market for its wares. But Lynch feels the condition of the
nation's execution devices and the lack of competition could mean
more contracts.
   For states that don't use lethal injection, American Engineering
also designs electric chairs, gas chambers and gallows.
   Lynch said he has sold three electric helmets at $5,000 apiece
and three sets of leg stocks at $2,000 each, and redesigned one
gallows for $15,000. Citing confidentiality, Lynch refused to
identify the states involved.
   Lynch said he opposes capital punishment, but noted that if it's
going to be done, ``it should be done right. If we're going to hang
this person then we should be using the proper rope. And you can't
blame the rope-maker for the hanging.''

<TEXT>
   The first instinct of thousands of investors
shocked by the almost instant evaporation of their money in the
October stock market crash was to sue their brokers.
   It was then that many got a second shock: They discovered they
had signed away their right to go to court.
   Fine print buried in most brokerage firms' paperwork requires
customers to settle disputes through an arbitration hearing
sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association
of Securities Dealers or other market organization.
   Arbitration, because it is cheaper and faster than suing, is a
good deal for many customers, particularly those who claim damages
of $50,000 or less.
   But there is only a limited right to appeal and some investors _
big losers and those whose brokers' actions were especially
egregious _ may be better off in court.
   And even investors likely to recover all or part of their losses
in arbitration may not want to give up the option to sue before they
know the nature of the dispute.
   Big institutional investors have always had the clout to
negotiate contracts with securities firms, but a survey earlier this
year by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission found
that individual investors have little choice.
   Of 65 firms, handling 90 percent of all customer accounts,
virtually all require arbitration, particularly for customers who
borrow money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky
stock options.
   Members of Congress and the SEC, concerned that mandatory
arbitration adds to the popular perception that the markets are
stacked against the individual, are hoping to restore customers'
right to choose.
   Three states _ California, Massachusetts and New Mexico _ are
also considering proposals to restrict arbitration clauses,
according to the North American Securities Administrators
Association, an organization of state regulators.
   The issue is becoming more acute as the number of arbitration
cases soars because of the crash and because the Supreme Court last
June upheld the legality of mandatory arbitration clauses. The
association said that the number of cases quintupled from 800 in
1980 to 4,100 last year and could climb above 6,000 this year.
   At a recent SEC hearing, Chairman David S. Ruder said that he
believes arbitration offers ``a fine opportunity for cost saving,''
but as a matter of fairness, firms ought to be barred from denying
service to a customer who doesn't want to sign an arbitration clause.
   ``I fail to see why we should deny access to the securities
markets to one who is unwilling to waive their dispute (into
arbitration) in advance,'' he said.
   Commodity brokers are already forbidden to force customers to
arbitrate.
   The commission, for two hours last Wednesday, debated whether to
ask Congress to extend the ban to securities brokers. But, after
last-minute lobbying by the securities industry, it postponed the
decision for a month to give firms a chance to press their
opposition.
   William J. Fitzpatrick, general counsel of the Securities
Industry Association, said that Congress and the SEC are trying to
craft a solution to a problem that does not exist.
   The system is fair; only a very small percentage of complaints to
the SEC are about arbitration, he said.
   And, he said, the market organizations are moving to put in place
a number of changes recommended by the SEC last September. They
include education for arbitrators and guidelines designed to keep
people with industry ties from serving in the ``public'' slots on
arbitration panels.
   Moreover, firms are not denying customers access to the market,
Fitzpatrick said. Most don't require customers with cash accounts to
sign arbitration clauses, he said, and customers who want to borrow
money on margin can go to banks or elsewhere.
   The proposal before government officials ``essentially says to a
broker-dealer you no longer have a right as a businessman to make a
judgment to control your legal expenses through the use of
arbitration,'' he said.
   ``It makes no sense to force disputes ... into a court system
where it takes five to seven years to get a case out and nobody wins
except the trial attorneys,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Ruder appears to have the backing of a majority of
his five-member commission. Aulana Peters is firmly in his corner
and Charles Cox said he would have to be persuaded to vote against
the proposal.
   In the meantime, Congress is proceeding on its own. The House
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on finance scheduled a hearing on
the issue for Thursday.
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., is preparing legislation that would
require firms to present arbitration clauses under a heading with
large type and on a separate sheet of paper. Firms would be
forbidden to reject customers who decline to sign the clause or
charge them an added fee for refusing.
   Boucher said he reviewed one form used by several firms and found
the arbitration clause in small print in a section with an unrelated
headline.
   ``Even a very careful reading of the form might not reveal the
binding arbitration language. I was looking for it and it took me
quite a while,'' he said.
   ``That to me is improper. If a person is going to surrender his
right to a trial in court, the person should do so with full
knowledge and, secondly, it should be a purely voluntary decision,''
he said.

   The health of the economy is at risk. The
federal debt is swelling, and the politicians are gridlocked.
   What's a nation to do?
   Call in the bureaucrat!
   That may sound a little odd, but a consummate Washington insider
was required to direct the new bipartisan National Economic
Commission in its mission to cut the deficit.
   The commission director not only needed a thorough knowledge of
the budget, but had to be trusted by both sides of the political
spectrum. And, perhaps most important, someone was needed with skill
in handling giant egos.
   Enter Dave Mathiasen of the president's Office of Management and
Budget.
   Described by a colleague as ``the quintessential staff person,''
Mathiasen first worked at OMB in 1961, before it was OMB, when it
was just the Bureau of the Budget.
   He's made a career of public service, mostly at OMB but also
overseas as an economist for the Agency for International
Development. At OMB, he has worked for Democrats and Republicans,
Bert Lance and David Stockman.
   Now Mathiasen has to use that experience to stay in the
background but still guide the commission members to a conclusion on
the deficit by their self-imposed deadline of December 21st.
   The common wisdom in Washington is that the commission would
provide political ``cover'' for a tax increase and some spending
cuts, leading George Bush already to pre-emptively say he won't
support it.
   But Mathiasen says predicting the commission's actions would be a
mistake, and he won't try to read the minds of members who include
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and former Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger.
   ``If you haven't decided what time you're going home tonight, I
can't forecast it. And if I do, I'm a fool,'' he said in an
interview last week.
   With the commission just starting up, Mathiasen's major effort is
to educate the members, most of whom have little exposure to the
federal budget. His staff is creating a computer game, where members
can try out different policies and instantly receive a computation
of their effect on the deficit.
   The co-chairmen of the commission are Robert Strauss, a
Washington lawyer and Democratic party power broker, and Drew Lewis,
President Reagan's former Secretary of Transportation who now heads
the Union Pacific Railroad. It will be their job to plead and cajole
the panel toward a consensus, with Mathiasen smoothing whatever path
they choose.
   The deficit commission is frequently compared in Washington to
the so-called Greenspan commission, led by now-Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan, whose recommendations led to the 1983
financial revamping of the Social Security program.
   The National Economic Commission has even moved into the
townhouse across from the White House where the Greenspan group was
based.
   However, Mathiasen says this mission is different.
   Social Security was facing a crisis, and there was the threat
that the checks would not go out unless action was taken. While most
economists agree that the federal deficit, $150 billion last year,
is bad for the economy, its effects are more difficult to single out.
   ``If we were able to say that on the 13th of March, 1989, the
stock market will drop (unless action is taken), then we've got a
deal,'' Mathiasen said.
   Mathiasen agrees that perhaps the most important factor in
whether the commission succeeds will be the attitude of the next
president-elect. Before taking office, the next president can
appoint two more commission members.
   The hope of the panel is to prevent its work from getting snarled
in presidential politics, but then quickly make its recommendations
to help build a consensus on how to reduce the deficit for the next
president and next Congress to enact.

   Shop owner Grant Burnett
plans to let a bull loose in his china shop this month _ literally.
   Spurred by constant bull-in-a-china-shop jokes cracked by
customers, Burnett said he will release a giant Hereford bull in his
shop on June 16 as a stunt.
   If the bull goes berserk, Burnett risks losing up to $60,000
worth of china.
   Burnett said the bull would not be drugged. It will be led into
the store by its owner, local farmer Bill Bly.
   An insurance company has agreed to cover the cost of broken china
for an undisclosed premium, Burnett said.
   ``This is something I've wanted to do for years,'' Burnett told
reporters.

<HEAD>Proposition 13 Still Being Felt 10 Years Later</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   California voters, who sparked a
nationwide taxpayer revolt with Proposition 13 a decade ago, are
being asked in a series of ballot measures whether they are having
some second thoughts.
   Although gloomy predictions of fiscal disaster remain largely
unrealized since the measure cut property taxes by $7 billion, or an
average of 57 percent, Proposition 13 has had its visible effects.
The public increasingly pays for services that once were free,
including parks and recreation programs. Public grounds look
scruffier than they did 10 years ago as officials have cut back on
maintenance.
   State bailouts and creative funding schemes are credited with
keeping most local governments afloat since the measure was approved
June 6, 1978, but many agree that schools and rural counties have
suffered under the cuts.
   So on Tuesday, voters in 26 of the state's 57 counties will
decide whether to raise sales and other taxes in their areas to pay
for highways, schools, libraries, jails and other services that were
threatened or eliminated by Proposition 13.
   At the same time, two rival statewide measures _ Proposition 71
and Proposition 72 _ will ask voters whether to ease a
constitutional spending limit and provide more money for schools or
highways.
   The spending limit, in the form of an initiative written by
tax-cut pioneer Paul Gann, was approved in a special election nine
months after Proposition 13. It requires that spending be strictly
tied to increases in population and the nationwide cost of living.
   The two new measures would alter that limit. Proposition 71,
whose main supporter is state schools Superintendent Bill Honig,
would permit additional funding for schools. Proposition 72, written
by Gann himself, would allow new money for highway construction.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, grappling with a $1.1 billion
budget deficit, opposes both measures.
   Other issues on Tuesday's ballot include a proposal to empower
the state to quarantine AIDS victims and local measures that could
close the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant and divide San Bernardino
County into two.
   California also is holding a U.S. Senate primary, along with New
Mexico, Montana and New Jersey. Montana, in addition, is having
primaries in both parties for governor.
   Proposition 13 _ whose war cry was quickly picked up by voters in
Massachusetts and other states _ decreed that property tax
assessments be rolled back immediately to 1975-76 levels. It limited
annual property taxes to 1 percent of the market value and
stipulated that assessed values, and thus taxes, could be increased
by only 2 percent annually until a property is sold. Then the new
owner's property tax bill starts at 1 percent of the purchase price.
   The measure also made it extremely difficult for local school
districts to raise property taxes, requiring that voters approve any
new taxes by a two-thirds margin.
   The year before Proposition 13 was approved, local governments
received $10.3 billion in property taxes, according to the state
Board of Equalization. In 1978-79, the first year after Proposition
13, that figure plunged to $4.9 billion.
   The immediate crunch was eased by the state, which contributed
$4.4 billion in 1978-79, but over the years that state support has
worn thin.
   Mary Anne Houx, president of the California School Boards
Association, said there is little money for vocational education,
after-school sports and fine arts programs for the state's 4.5
million students.
   ``It's not like it was before, when the Board of Education could
raise money locally, and for the big bucks we could go to the voters
and ask for approval with a simple majority,'' said Houx.
   Many school libraries have been closed or forced to curtail their
hours. More than $11 billion is needed for new school construction
throughout the state, and deferred maintenance costs are approaching
$150 million, Houx said.
   The city of Oakland's street repair unit faces $60 million in
deferred maintenance costs that built up in the eight years after
Proposition 13 passed. In 1986, residents approved a 15-year sales
tax increase to pay for street maintenance and repair.
   An increasing number of residents of Humboldt County, in the
northwestern section of the state, are driving on gravel as
officials give up on maintaining many deteriorating roads.
   Shasta County, with 125,000 residents, replaced a 73-bed public
hospital that also served several neighboring counties with a clinic.

<HEAD>Business School Seeks To De-emphasize Wall Street Careers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Harvard Business School is making it clear that
it wants a smaller proportion of its graduates to head for Wall
Street investment banking.
   The business school reported last week that 15 percent of its
current crop of graduates had been hired by major securities firms,
compared to about 30 percent in 1987.
   ``We don't want investment banking to be the be-all and end-all
of a Harvard MBA,'' said Margaret Lang, the business school's
director of placement.
   School officials said they began shifting the emphasis away from
investment banking even before last October's stock market crash.
   ``There was a real concern that we were being typecast as a
school for investment bankers and consultants,'' said Professor
Robert Hayes, a technology management expert. ``Our mission is to
train general managers. We were afraid of losing our heritage.''
   The changes at Harvard included improving its manufacturing
faculty, changing its admissions policies to de-emphasize financial
skills and choosing fewer people from Wall Street apprenticeship
programs.
   A decade ago, just 8 percent of Harvard Business School graduates
went into investment banking while consulting was the job of choice,
attracting 22 percent.
   But the bull market that began in 1982 and the
merger-and-acquisition binge that started soon afterward shifted the
balance.
   In 1978, Harvard students could expect to earn roughly the same
starting salary on Wall Street as in manufacturing. By 1987, Wall
Street salaries were about 10 percent higher than those in
manufacturing, but with bonuses figured in, the gap was closer to 50
percent.
   There were complaints that American manufacturing was being
shortchanged.
   ``We now have a group coming out of business schools, going to
Wall Street and contributing nothing to the efficiency of American
industry, nothing to its productivity,'' retired Harvard economist
John Kenneth Galbraith said in 1987.
   Last March, Harvard hired Steven Wheelwright, a specialist in
manufacturing, from Stanford University.
   But officials said the changes may still not funnel more bright
young graduates into the production sector.
   ``We can do all the pushing and cajoling we want,'' said
Harvard's Robert Hayes, ``but if companies do not offer jobs at
competitive salaries, the students will not go that way.''
   ``I tell students that tomorrow's chief executive officers will
be the ones who solve our production problems,'' said Lester Thurow,
dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   But Thurow said his message is not taking root yet and that the
business school students still consider manufacturing a second-class
profession.

   Rail labor, finding itself ``backed into a
corner,'' has softened its opposition to proposed random drug
testing of railroad workers, union officials said.
   The change comes as the Department of Transportation prepares to
hold hearings in Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Washington on its
proposal to mandate random drug testing for all train personnel
working with moving trains.
   As recently as last Wednesday, Federal Railroad Administrator
John Riley spoke in an interview of labor's ``uncompromising effort
to stop testing in any form.''
   He said some rail labor leaders seemed ``to care more about
protecting the employees who use drugs in the workplace than those
who don't.''
   But on Friday, Lawrence L. Mann, attorney for the Railway Labor
Executives' Association, which represents rail unions, said, ``There
has been a reconsideration of labor's position.''
   While the Department of Transportation's random testing plan
won't be finalized until sometime after the field hearings end, Mann
said, ``It may be that labor will be able to embrace it.''
   Still, he said he had constitutional questions about the plan, in
part because it seemed ``to assume that those who are tested are
guilty.''
   Mann also said the proposed program does not appear to do enough
to promote rehabilitation. ``There should be a cooperative program
encouraging people to seek out rehabilitation before a problem
occurs,'' Mann said.
   While RLEA represents some 20 unions, Mann said he did not
necessarily speak for all the members.
   Charles Fountain of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way
Employees said the best drug programs resulted not from legislation,
but from agreements between individual railroads and unions.
   But he said labor was ``backed into a corner'' by the
inevitability of congressional action on random testing.
   ``Lets face it, there will some kind of legislation passed one
way or another,'' Fountain said.
   The DOT hearings, which begin in Chicago on June 14 and end here
two weeks later, are designed to solicit public opinion and help
government lawyers shape the program.
   Transportation officials believe they have authority to implement
random drug testing even though Congress has not passed legislation
requiring such a program.
   Still, it would be a boost to the department's position if
Congress acted, according to Riley. ``It would clarify our
authority,'' he said.
   Riley said the current rules for testing based on reasonable
cause are limited because they are tied to a supervisor's ability to
detect symptoms.
   ``That is a severe limitation in the drug area because many of
the drugs in vogue in the workplace today can impair an engineer's
time or spatial perceptions without giving rise to a symptom that
would be recognized by even an educated laymen,'' Riley said.
   Even before proposing random drug testing on May 5, attorneys for
DOT were already in court defending mandatory drug testing for train
crew members involved in major accidents. That program has continued
while the department appeals a federal appeals court ruling on Feb.
11 that declared such testing unconstitutional.
   The court ruling stemmed from a suit filed by rail labor unions.
   A signal that labor has relaxed its opposition to random drug
testing came in the response by union officials Friday to new
legislation by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio.
   His bill would give DOT 90 days to set up procedures for
administering random drug tests. Significantly for labor, it
contains provisions mandating rehabilitation and education, and
protecting workers against inaccurate test results.
   ``We believe the bill is a constructive approach to substabce
abuse in the workplace if random testing is to become law,'' said
Richard I. Kilroy, chairman of RLEA and president of the
Transportation Communications Union.
   ``However, we still have serious constitutional concerns that we
will not abandon without adequate safeguards,'' he said.

<HEAD>Saudis Report Big Trade Surplus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia posted a $2.4 billion
trade surplus last year, more than seven times the 1986 surplus, the
Finance Ministry said in a report Sunday.
   The 1986 surplus totaled $360,000, said excerpts of the report
that were circulated by the official Saudi Press Agency.
   The big increase followed a major effort by the Saudis to
diversify their economy away from dependence on oil revenues. They
have developed agriculture, wheat and food products for export, as
well as domestic consumption.
   The ministry report said exports totalled $22.56 billion last
year and imports $20 billion.
   In 1986 exports totaled $19.24 billion with imports pegged at
$18.88 billion, the report said.
   The Saudi news agency did not provide any breakdown of export
figures and gave only a partial list of import statistics.
   The Finance Ministry report showed 81.2 percent of Saudi Arabia's
imports last year came from 15 countries, headed by Japan, the
United States, Britain, West Germany and Italy.
   Imports from Arab League states last year increased by 8.6
percent over the preceding year, while imports from non-Arab Islamic
states increased by 9.8 percent.
   The oil-rich kingdom's major import categories all rose last
year, at least in value. The agency report only cited import values.
   They were listed as foodstuffs and livestock, which increased by
7.2 percent in value, beverages and tobacco by 12 percent, raw
materials by 21.6 percent, vegetable oils and fats by 10.4 percent,
machinery and transport equipment by 2.1 percent, furniture,
clothing and shoes by 5.7 percent.
   Saudi Arabia sits on almost one-third of the world's proven oil
reserves, but has been hard hit by a weak world oil market since the
early 1980s.
   Saudi Arabia has a population of around 12 million, including an
estimated 3 million expatriate workers.

   Three years ago, Larry Bell set out to
grab a share of the retail beer market _ a very small share.
   Bell owns one of a growing number of micro-brewers _ small
companies that make small amounts of beer, mostly heavier brews.
   Sales doubled last year, and Bell, 29, hopes his Kalamazoo
Brewery will break even or even turn a profit this year.
   He began his business on $39,000 borrowed from friends in a
former plumbing supply store with a 15-gallon pot and stove. While
business has picked up a bit, everything still is done by hand.
   Bell once said his brewery was the smallest in the country. He
now produces about 1,400 barrels of ale annually, which may bring in
about $250,000 in sales this year, mushrooming from the $65,000 in
sales last year.
   The Association of Brewers estimates there are 80 micro-breweries
nationwide, up from 46 two years ago. Some speculate that the
popularity of the breweries increased as people began looking for
alternatives to light, highly carbonated U.S. beers.
   Despite the growth of these small operations, major brewers
aren't foaming about competition. Last year, less than 0.1 percent
of the 187 million barrels of beer were consumed in the United
States came from small brewers.
   ``That's not a number that one takes very seriously,'' said Jerry
Steinman, publisher of the Beer Marketers Insight newsletter. ``It
would take tremendous growth before the micro-breweries have any
effect on the industry.''
   One of the big problems for little breweries is delivery. Beer
that isn't pasteurized goes bad without refrigeration _ a problem
that drove Chelsea Brewing Co. of Ann Arbor, Mich., out of business
several years ago.
   The failure rate for small breweries is pretty high, said Jeff
Mendel, administrator of the Institute for Fermentation and Brewing
in Boulder, Colo.
   ``About one brewery in five closes down,'' he said. ``Some last
four or five years, and some close in a matter of weeks.''
   Meantime, Bell keeps pumping out his brew with an eye toward some
mechanization. He bought a bottling machine, but it is in need of
repair. He hopes to raise another $100,000 for more equipment.
   ``It's very difficult to make money when you're washing bottles
by hand,'' he said. ``We're just starting to get to the break-even
point, but it's been a real crap shoot.''

<HEAD>Professor To Present Study of Light Emitted By Wintergreen Candy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even party tricks can have scientific
interest, and a Towson State College chemistry professor will tell a
conference this week about the tiny sparks that appear when you bite
wintergreen candy in the dark.
   Linda Sweeting has been researching the phenomenon _ technically
known as triboluminescence _ for five years, crushing candies in her
laboratory and carefully measuring the dim flashes. She'll present
her findings at the third Chemical Congress of North America in
Toronto.
   She admits she also sometimes ducks into closets to crunch the
candy and watch the bluish sparks of ``mouth lightning.''
   Substances that flash when they're rubbed, crushed or broken
include sugar, salt, quartz and human bones.
   Triboluminescence, a name drawn from the Greek word ``tribein''
meaning ``to rub,'' was first reported by Sir Francis Bacon in 1605.
   Ms. Sweeting, 46, took advantage of recent technological advances
in highly accurate measuring instruments to confirm basic theories
about triboluminescence developed in the 1930s and to add more
accurate knowledge about the range of light emitted.
   She drew upon wintergreen candy studies conducted in the 1930s by
Princeton University researcher E. Newton Harvey.
   She said the tiny sparks are created because, when sucrose sugar
crystals fracture under pressure, positive and negative electrical
charges separate. Voltage builds up until electrons leap across the
fracture and the discharge makes nitrogen molecules in the air emit
a tiny burst of light.
   That light comes mainly in the invisible ultraviolet region of
the spectrum. But when wintergreen is added, the light becomes
visible as blue sparks because wintergreen molecules glow when
excited by the flash of the initial spark, a tiny reaction that ends
in milliseconds.
   Although he has not seen the results to be presented in Toronto,
Jeffrey Zink, a professor of chemistry at the University of
California at Los Angeles who furthered the research in the early
1980s, said he didn't find the mechanism to be quite as Ms. Sweeting
described it. He said its behavior could vary from crystal to
crystal.
   Ms. Sweeting said she stands by her research, which was ``very
carefully done on the same batch of crystals.''
   ``I guess most of the scientific community would think this is
not real important,'' she said. ``But it's fundamental knowledge of
crystals, how energy flows in and out of molecules, and there are
going to be practical applications down the road.''
   As an example, she suggested that a triboluminescent film could
could be used to coat parts of orbiting satellites so that
Earth-based instruments could detect any light emissions produced
when the materials are put under unexpected stress.

   The race is on to develop new tools that
can make the tiny silicon microchips that will run future
generations of computers.
   ``The prize will be the entire world electronics market of 1996
and beyond,'' said John D. Wiley, associate dean of the University
of Wisconsin's College of Engineering in Madison.
   With West German and Japanese electronics firms already jockeying
for position, an electronic storage ring may just be the best tool
American industry will need to keep pace.
   The special device can produce finely etched computer chips, the
guts of the electronics industry. But building a new one from
scratch could cost $15 million to $20 million, an hefty investment
even for a large company.
   Yet in a cluttered metal building overlooking Lake Kegonsa, the
University of Wisconsin is operating its own ring, dubbed Aladdin,
and is willing to make the device available for industrial research.
   Chips now are manufactured by a process known as lithography, in
which the myriad of components on a chip are printed on the wafer
through the use of light-sensitive films and etching chemicals.
   Aladdin, which is 80-feet in diameter and uses as much
electricity as a small town, can apply 800 million volts of spin to
electrons to produce the ``soft'' x-rays that will allow even finer
etching of computer chips than ultraviolet light can accomplish.
   The only other storage ring in the country that produces soft
x-rays is at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.,
and it is booked solid.
   Last week, only 17 of Aladdin's 36 available beam lines were in
use, and the University hopes industry snatches up some of those
still available.
   University scientists say it is time for Aladdin to do industrial
research as well as academic research in x-ray lithography.
   The Japanese have spent an estimated $1 billion to develop the
technology needed to build the new generation of smaller computer
chips, said University physicist David Huber, who is in charge of
Aladdin.
   In the United States, Congress appropriated $15 million for such
research last year and is expected to provide $35 million this year,
Huber said.
   Among private companies in the United States, only computer giant
IBM has invested significantly in the technology, and even it
realizes it cannot carry the research burden alone, he said.
   ``There are 15 new rings now under construction in Japan. There
is only one being built in this country,'' Wiley said. He said the
Germans have had a thriving applied research program in x-ray
lithography since 1978.
   ``If we don't play a role, it's unlikely this country is going to
embrace the technology,'' Huber said.
   ``Assuming the much earlier and larger Japanese and European
investments do not render our program irrelevant before it gets
started,'' Wiley said, ``the U.S. may actually have a chance to
regain a competitive position in this technology.''
