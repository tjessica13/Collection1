   The editor of a leading African magazine
has publicly apologized to Kenyan Moslems for an article alleging
Arabs introduced homosexuality together with the Islamic faith to
Kenya.
   ``It has been pointed out to the publishers of the magazine that
it is sacrilege to say that the practice of homosexuality is in any
way linked to Islam,'' Benjamin G. Bundeh said in a statement
published in Nairobi newspapers Thursday.
   The article, which appeared in June's issue of the monthly True
Love magazine, alleged that homosexuality is widely practiced for
money at the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa and other resort towns
along the coast.
   Moslem leaders and politicians in Mombasa reacted angrily to the
report as soon as the magazine hit the newsstands on June 2.
   ``Such reports are malicious and calculated to create disunity
and hatred between Christians and Moslems in the country,'' said
Said Hemed, a member of Parliament and an ethnic Arab.
   True Love is published in Nairobi, the capital, by Drum
Publications and bills itself as Africa's leading magazine.
   Arabs settled along the Kenyan coast more than 500 years ago.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran Agriculture Department narcotics
expert says he was forced out of his job because he declined to
recommend use of a powerful herbicide on cocaine-producing areas in
South America.
   Walter Gentner, 66, former national technical advisor on
narcotics, said Thursday he refused to be pressured into
recommending use of the herbicide ``Spike'' because of concerns
over its potential environmental impact.
   Eli Lilly & Co., based in Indianapolis, touched off a
controversy two weeks ago when it decided not to sell Spike, known
formally as Tebuthiuron, to the U.S. government for use in an
anti-cocaine campaign in Peru and other Andean countries.
   The State Department said last week the ``safety and
effectiveness'' of Spike has been confirmed and that the short-term
impact of Lilly's decision will be serious.
   But Gentner defended Lilly's position in a telephone interview
Thursday, saying, ``We need the facts before we go and do something
irreversible.''
   Gentner's former boss, Thomas Army, deputy administrator of the
agricultural research service, could not be reached for comment
Thursday. But he told The Washington Times that Gentner wasn't
aggressive enough in the war on drugs.
   ``You got to get after it with a sense of urgency,'' Army was
quoted as saying.
   Gentner, who said he visited 43 countries on drug control
assignments during his long government career, decided to retire
rather than accept a demotion.
   He said Spike is manufactured in the form of pellets and is
ideal for use along railroads and highways.
   But he said the herbicide might not be safe if it is applied to
wet soils which are later drenched by heavy rains. In that case,
the pellets could roll downhill and affect plants outside the
target zone, he said, adding that coca plant growing areas in the
Andes often have an inch of rain a day.
   Expressing sympathy for Lilly's position, Gentner said a
coca-eradication campaign in South America would represent only a
small part of the company's overall operation.
   But if the herbicide proved to be ecologically damaging, Lilly
could be faced with a wave of liability suits, which would give the
product a ``black mark,'' affecting its marketability in the United
States and elsewhere, he said.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the herbicide
is widely used in the United States and Brazil and noted that Lilly
stands by the safety of its product.
   But Lilly spokesman Ted McKinney said the herbicide is safe only
``when used according to labeled directions for approved purposes.''
   ``Lilly has not tested Tebuthiuron for use in controlling coca
nor has the company tested Tebuthiuron under the actual conditions
found in Peru,'' he said.
   The Washington Times reported in Thursday's editions that an EPA
report concluded that the toxic effect of Spike and two other
products under consideration in the anti-drug war have not been
fully evaluated.

<HEAD>Report Plays Down Federal Role In Adding To Outdoor Recreation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Reagan administration report urges state
and local governments to do more to provide outdoor recreation, a
recommendation that a Democratic lawmaker quickly criticized as
reflecting ``the administration's policy of no spending for
parkland or facilities.''
   The report Thursday by the Task Force on Outdoor Recreation
Resources and Opportunities also suggests that higher fees be
charged to cover the cost of operating and maintaining recreation
facilities in the national parks.
   But the report stops short of endorsing recommendations made
more than a year ago by a presidential commission to establish a
trust fund of recreation money to aid states and communities and to
create a network of ``greenways'' to tie together existing and new
trails, waterways and bike paths.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who heads the House Interior
subcommittee on national parks and recreation, contended that the
new report ``just reflects the administration's policy of no
spending for parkland or facilities.''
   The report, he said, is ``an example of this administration not
taking care to pass on these resources to future generations.''
   Vento said that he believes the task force ``was appointed to do
damage control, to push the commission's report under the rug. The
administration doesn't want new trust funds or to buy new land. But
the truth is that Congress is moving forward on both.''
   Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association, also faulted the new report, maintaining that ``it
does nothing but blur the original version.'' Pritchard said he
served as an adviser to the President's Commission on Americans
Outdoors commission that produced the original report.
   He said his group opposes any additional fee increases at
national parks, ``butanything further would be totally punitive on
the poor and the elderly.''
   The National Park Service imposed entrance fees at 73 parks,
monuments and other installations for the first time and raised
entrance fees at 61 other sites in February 1987. But it is
generally acknowledged that those fees fall short of what is needed
to cover maintenance and operations at the parks.
   The task force report says the new or higher fees do not appear
to have kept people away from national parks and adds, ``There are
indications that people are seeking more comfortable and convenient
facilities and a higher quality of services than in decades past,
and are more willing to pay for them.''
   In a statement issued Thursday, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
praised the task force's report and called it ``a blueprint for
future development of America's great outdoor recreation potential
in ways that will truly benefit all Americans.''
   Hodel said he was especially pleased that the new report
emphasized ``community action as the basis from which outdoor
recreation needs are determined and met.''
   Jacqueline E. Schafer, a member of the presidential Council on
Environmental Quality, said in introducing the new report that it
already has been sent to the Cabinet for implementation by federal
departments and agencies.
   She said the task force had focused on a finding in the original
report that Americans were looking for outdoor recreation
opportunities ``close to home.'' Therefore, she said, the task
force recommended that the federal government ``encourage all of
America's communities to make the most of their own recreation
resources and potential.''
   The report also emphasizes the role of private business in
developing recreation facilities on national parkland and on
reservoirs maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. And it points
to efforts by private industry to open up land to the public,
citing numerous instances of power companies providing land for
public fishing, hiking and boating.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has approved and sent to the White
House legislation to ban most uses by private employers of lie
detectors, described by one senator as ``inaccurate instruments of
intimidation.''
   The Senate voted 68-24 on Thursday to approve a compromise
version of a House-passed bill that would prohibit most polygraph
tests. Labor Secretary Ann Dore McLaughlin has said she will ask
President Reagan to sign the bill.
   The final version of the legislation, approved by House-Senate
negotiators last month, would prohibit most private sector
employers from requiring their workers or job applicants to take
lie detector tests. Exceptions would be made for drug companies and
those providing security services.
   The bill would prohibit an employee from being discharged,
dismissed, disciplined, discriminated against, or denied employment
or promotion solely on the basis of the test _ or solely because of
refusal to take the test. To take action against the worker, an
employer would have to have additional supporting evidence.
   The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
2 million polygraph tests were administered in 1987, with 90
percent given by private employers. Most of those were job
applicants, although they also were given to workers under
investigation.
   The accuracy of test results has been questioned, and so has the
competency of some examiners.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
Committee, called the legislation ``long overdue.''
   ``For too long, we have known the widespread and growing use of
these so-called lie-detectors was subject to misuse and abuse,'' he
said before the Senate voted. ``For too long, we have allowed
millions of employees and job applicants to be strapped to these
inaccurate instruments of intimidation.''
   Judy Goldberg of the American Civil Liberties Union said the law
will affect 28 states which have no regulation of polygraph
examinations or only regulate the examiners.
   States with no regulation of examinations include Colorado,
Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota,
Ohio and Wyoming.
   States regulating polygraph examiners only include Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.

<HEAD>$10.9 Billion Transportation Appropriations Bill Sent to House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the
Coast Guard would both receive large increases in their budgets
under the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations bill approved
by a House committee.
   The bill also would continue federal support for Amtrak, the
passenger rail line, against the Reagan administration's wishes.
   The bill was sent to the full House on Thursday by a voice vote
of the Appropriations Committee. It would provide $10.9 billion for
the government's transportation programs in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The legislation also would give the government authority to
spend an additional $16.9 billion from special accounts set aside
for various aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   It gives the Coast Guard a budget of nearly $3.1 billion, and
directs that at least $492 million of that amount be used for drug
interdiction programs. FAA spending would grow to nearly $6.7
billion, with enough money to increase the number of air traffic
controllers from 16,020 to 16,800 by Sept. 30, 1989.
   Both amounts are increases of about 16 percent over spending
levels this year.
   The appropriations bill would provide $3.3 billion for mass
transit, $1.8 billion more than proposed by the Reagan
administration, and $594 million for Amtrak. The administration had
sought to end all federal assistance to the passenger railroad,
which expects to carry 34 million passengers next year.
   Another provision of the bill would threaten the coffers of
Boston's Logan International Airport if it pursues plans to reduce
congestion by raising landing fees for small planes.
   Logan officials plan to increase charges for small aircraft on
July 1 in an effort to reduce the number of private planes landing
there and thus ease delays for commercial airliners.
   Groups representing private aircraft owners have filed federal
suits aimed at blocking the plan, claiming the fees discriminate
against small plane owners.
   In addition, the Transportation Department has opened an
investigation of the program and asked Logan officials to delay
implementing the new fees until the inquiry is complete, probably
in November. Airport officials have refused.
   An amendment to the appropriations bill, introduced by Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and adopted by a 19-15 vote, would withhold
federal assistance to Logan unless the courts and the
Transportation Department decide that the new fee structure is
legal.
   Logan spokesman Tom Champion said the measure would affect $11.2
million in federal money, to be used mostly for noise reduction and
runway improvement. The loss of the aid would have little effect on
the airport's operations, he said.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Virus Causing AIDS-Like Infection Without Killing
Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new strain of virus isolated from an African
blood sample by a California research team attacks with a lethal
AIDS-like infection that scientists say cannot yet be explained,
according to a report published Friday.
   Jay A. Levy, leader of the University of California at San
Francisco team that conducted the study, said the new isolated
virus strain is able to cause a fatal infection but does so without
killing cells in the human body.
   This suggests, said Levy, that the lethal mechanism of the virus
is different from the AIDS virus that is infecting and killing
Americans.
   Still another new virus strain from the family that causes
AIDS-like disease in Africa has been isolated by a team at the
University of Alabama, Birmingham. This new strain appears to be
less virulent than AIDS viruses identified earlier, said George M.
Shaw, leader of the Alabama research group.
   Both studies of the new virus strains are reported in Friday's
issue of the journal Science.
   The new isolates found by the researchers are both strains of
human immunodeficiency virus two, or HIV2. This virus is a subtype
of the HIV1 that is blamed for the AIDS epidemic in the United
States.
   Both HIV1 and HIV2 have been found in AIDS patients in Africa,
but only one patient has been found in the United States to be
infected with HIV2. That patient, who died in this country, is
believed to have been infected in Africa.
   Levy said his group isolated its strain of HIV2 from a blood
sample taken from a native of Mali who was hospitalized in Ivory
Coast, a West African nation. He said the patient suffered from
chronic diarrhea and weight loss and died last fall from neurologic
complications, all symptoms seen in AIDS patients.
   But Levy said the researchers are unable to say how the virus
caused these disease symptoms.
   In laboratory studies of U.S. AIDS cases, the HIV1 virus has
been found to infect cells in the blood, brain, bowel and bone
marrow, and to kill cells in the immune system. Levy said that
while the new strain of HIV2 will infect a variety of cells in
laboratory tests, it will not kill the cells.
   ``It doesn`t have to kill (cells) to cause disease,'' he said.
He suggested that the new strain may infect cells of the brain and
bowel and paralyze the cellular function, or force the cells to
make products that are toxic to the body.
   ``The key here is that maybe all HIV viruses do this,'' Levy
said. ``Maybe killing cells is something we see in the laboratory,
but it is not a major aspect in disease induction in a person. That
is where we're looking now.''
   Shaw said the HIV2 strain found by his group was isolated from a
blood sample taken from a healthy prostitute in Senegal, West
Africa.
   Shaw said his team now is looking at the genetic differences
that cause one type of HIV virus to kill infected cells, while
another strain does not.
   ``This will provide an important scientific tool to study the
cellular and biological basis for (cell-killing disease),'' he
said. ``All of this can be combined to better understand the
biology of the HIV family of viruses.''
   Levy said there are many strains of HIV viruses and scientists
will need to understand their diversity and commonality to develop
an antiviral medication that will work against all types of AIDS
infections.
   Howard Streicher, one of the leading AIDS researchers at the
National Institutes of Health, said isolation of the two strains of
HIV2 virus gives an important advance in the war against the killer
disease.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has been shown
among U.S. patients to kill by destroying the body's immune system.
This leaves the patient susceptible to fatal opportunistic diseases
and infections.
   AIDS is spread mostly through homosexual contact and from
needles shared by drug abusers. It also can be spread through
infected blood transfusions and from a birthing mother to her child.
   According to figures released Monday by the Centers for Disease
Control, AIDS has been diagnosed in 64,506 Americans, of whom more
than half, or 36,255, have died. No one is known to have recovered
from AIDS.

<HEAD>Dukakis Strategy: Touting Own Accomplishments, Questioning Bush's</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis plans a positive fall campaign
touting his own record as Massachusetts governor while questioning
whether George Bush has any real accomplishments of his own.
   At the same time, aides say, Dukakis is prepared to fend off
attacks from Bush on foreign policy issues by reminding voters of
Bush's ties to controversial Reagan administration actions
including the Iran-Contra affair.
   Dukakis, who clinched the Democratic nomination with a sweep of
the final four primaries Tuesday, says he is eager to debate the
Republican nominee-to-be.
   Dukakis will promote his management of the booming Massachusetts
economy and support of universal health care. He also will point to
the Reagan administration's failure to promote affordable-housing
programs, and to the president's veto of a trade bill that required
advance notice of plant closings, Dukakis aides say.
   On the international front, Bush has tried to depict Dukakis as
a novice whose views pose a threat to national security. Aides say
Dukakis will try to keep pressure on Bush by criticizing Reagan's
policies in Central America. Dukakis also will continue to demand
that Bush fully disclose his roles in the Iran-Contra affair and
administration dealings with Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, aides say.
   Campaign aides are working on speeches and ads that list
Dukakis' major campaign themes _ competent management and new
leadership for the 1990s _ while seeking to portray Bush as a
career politician without a true legacy.
   ``If we're talking about our record, it will remind people that
he doesn't have one,'' Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach said
in an interview. He suggested that Dukakis will avoid direct
attacks on Bush but force voters to question the vice president's
positions.
   ``If we talk about the tough stands Dukakis has taken, it will
remind people that Bush hasn't taken any positions,'' Dach said.
   Vital to any Dukakis fall strategy is a relatively smooth
resolution of differences with Jesse Jackson and adoption of a
strong but general platform that does not create the appearance
that Dukakis is beholden to special interests, the Dukakis camp
said.
   Planning for the fall campaign is still in the early stages, but
Dach said Dukakis may use an approach used by Kansas Sen. Bob Dole,
who sought the GOP nomination. The Dole campaign came up with an ad
that showed a man walking across a field of snow, but leaving no
footprints.
   In speeches, Dole questioned the vice president's record, saying
Bush had an impressive resume but few actual accomplishments.
   Some Dukakis aides already have adopted Dole's message in their
rhetoric.
   ``He can't tell us or won't tell us what his role in this
administration has been,'' said Dukakis issues adviser Christopher
Edley, a former Carter White House aide. ``He doesn't seem to leave
any footprints.''
   Dukakis also plans to counter Bush's effort to portray the
Massachusetts governor as a member of the ``liberal elite'' by
pointing to Bush's privileged background. Dukakis is the son of
Greek immigrants.
   ``I think it is very important to the American people that the
next president be someone who understands their problems and their
concerns,'' said Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich.
   While the Dukakis camp is uneasy over the prospect of convention
fights with rival Democrat Jackson, most Dukakis aides concede
those battles should help dispel Bush's characterization of Dukakis
as an ultra-liberal in the mold of Jimmy Carter or George McGovern.
   ``Bush's strategy seems to be to go out and attack somebody who
isn't even in the race,'' said Edley.
   One issue that could put Dukakis on the defensive is taxes.
   Dukakis has refused to rule out new federal taxes as a means of
reducing the federal deficit, while Bush has ruled out a tax hike.
Dukakis also will have to sign a new state budget that includes
some tax increases.
   Recent national polls have suggested Dukakis has a double-digit
lead over Bush. But Dukakis aides believe the race will tighten now
that the primaries are over and voters can focus on the nominees.
   Dukakis plans to campaign hard during the summer.
   ``We're not going to make the mistake of underestimating George
Bush or the Republicans,'' Estrich said. ``They've got some very
talented people and they are going to have a lot of resources.''

<HEAD>`Bureaucratic Petulance' Hurts NRC-Justice Probes, Lawmaker Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House chairman is urging the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the Justice Department to develop a
systematic way of handling atomic industry cases under
investigation by both agencies.
   The NRC's lack of cooperation combined with ``bureaucratic
petulance'' could have damaged a potential Justice Department case
involving Steven A. White, director of the Tennessee Valley
Authority's nuclear power program, said Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
   The Connecticut Democrat said Thursday that the NRC ``took
offense'' when the Justice Department did not object to a House
subcommittee request for commission officials to answer questions
about the White case at an April hearing.
   The NRC decided to go ahead with its own civil enforcement
proceedings ``irrespective of how this could affect a criminal
prosecution of the case by the Justice Department,'' Gejdenson
said. He called the NRC's action ``apparent retaliation'' for the
department's ``cooperation with Congress.''
   ``This reflects a lack of regard by the NRC both for the process
of congressional oversight and for the government's pursuit of
wrongdoing in the courts,'' Gejdenson said in a letter to NRC
Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr.
   A new policy spelling out procedures for investigations
involving the two agencies ``needs to be explicit and it must place
the need for tough enforcement over bureaucratic petulance,''
Gejdenson said. The two agencies have been negotiating for several
years to create an investigations policy, said Gejdenson aide John
Scheibel.
   NRC spokesman Robert Newlin said agency officials would not
comment because they had not seen the congressman's letter.
   Gejdenson also released an exchange of letters between Zech and
the Justice Department regarding the White case.
   Deputy Assistant Attorney General Victoria Toensing wrote to
Zech that the only reason the Justice Department did not object to
the April hearing was that the NRC had given to other congressional
committees ``substantially all of the investigative materials in
the White matter that had been provided to the department for
review for possible criminal prosecution.''
   ``Knowing of such wholesale public dissemination of these
investigative materials, we believed that it would be an empty
gesture to object to the April 21 hearing,'' she wrote.
   Zech, in an earlier letter to the Justice Department, said he
was going ahead with consideration of civil enforcement proceedings
``in view of the department's lack of objection to a full public
discussion'' of the case.
   White has been under investigation by the NRC for allegedly
misrepresenting safety conditions at TVA's Watts Bar plant in
Spring City, Tenn.
   The NRC's top investigator told Congress in April that White
deliberately misled the agency in a March 1986 letter in which he
assured regulators that there were no ``pervasive'' quality
assurance problems at the still-unlicensed reactor. An NRC review
group disagreed. No NRC action has been taken.
   White has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and TVA Chairman
Marvin Runyon has defended the program manager.
   The NRC referred the case to the Justice Department last year.

   A minister who drove a truck that lurched into a
crowd during a religious parade last year, killing a pregnant woman
and a 10-year-old girl from his church, has been acquitted of three
charges of vehicular homicide.
   The Rev. Etanislao Gonzales, 47, was found innocent Thursday by
Municipal Court Judge Herbert Hershfang of charges connected with
the August accident, which also left 29 people injured.
   The accident occurred as Gonzales was driving a year-old,
half-ton pickup bedecked with flowers down a narrow street packed
with about 2,000 spectators during the Children and Youth Christian
Parade.
   Idalia Cruz, 10, and Maria Otero Reyes, 21, were killed in the
accident. They were members of Gonzales' small congregation at the
Doors of Salvation Pentacostal Church.
   Because Reyes was seven months pregnant, a third count of motor
vehicle homicide was filed against Gonzales.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion foes are claiming victory from a
House committee vote to exempt abortion-inducing drugs and
contraceptive devices from a proposed shield against punitive
damages in liability lawsuits.
   The proposal was tacked onto a controversial product liability
bill by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on a 21-19 vote
Thursday, shortly after the panel had rejected a much broader
anti-abortion amendment.
   The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Thomas J. Tauke, R-Iowa, would
deny manufacturers of abortion-causing drugs and devices the same
protection against punitive damages that the bill would extend to
other drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
   The Tauke amendment would affect oral contraceptives,
intrauterine devices and new, experimental abortion pills now
marketed in several foreign countries. It would not cover such
contraceptive barriers as condoms, spermicides or cervical caps.
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, hailed the committee's approval of the Tauke
amendment as ``the most important pro-life victory in Congress in
the past two years.''
   Johnson said the vote ``sends a crystal-clear message to the
pharmaceutical industry that developing and marketing
abortion-causing drugs will be a risky and unprofitable business''
because Congress won't shield them from liability suits.
   But Bill Hamilton, chief lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Inc.,
predicted the anti-abortion provision will be stripped from the
bill by the House Judiciary Committee, which will consider the
measure next if the Energy and Commerce Committee approves it.
   In any case, Hamilton said, the bill has no chance of passing
Congress in this election year _ an assessment shared by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce panel.
   Approval of the Tauke amendment came as Dingell's committee
neared the end of drafting the compromise bill, which is intended
to pre-empt conflicting state liability standards with a uniform
but limited set of federal standards opposed by consumer groups.
   Pro-consumer lobbyists say the measure will make it harder for
victims of unsafe products to recover damages from manufacturers.
Business supporters of the bill say it will help ease the costly
burden of liability suits and make American products more
competitive on foreign trade markets.
   Hamilton scoffed at Johnson's claim that the Tauke amendment
effectively places abortion-inducing drugs and devices in the same
category with alcohol, tobacco and asbestos as dangerous products
under the bill.
   ``We think it's outrageous,'' Hamilton said. ``Basically,
contraceptives are a great deal safer than many other products
protected by that legislation, safer than penicillin, safer even
than driving a car.''
   The Tauke amendment, eagerly sought by anti-abortion lobbyists,
would cover any drug or device that interferes with the implanting
of a human embryo in the uterus, or subsequently aborts a pregnancy.
   The committee rejected on a 21-21 tie vote a broader proposal by
Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., that would have exempted all drugs
that might cause abortions or threaten a man or woman's ability to
produce children.
   Dingell, who opposed both amendments, protested that Sikorski's
proposal would unfairly penalize such necessary products as
aspirin, heating pads, eye drops and drugs necessary for treating
cancer and the AIDS virus.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said the real purpose of Tauke's
amendment was ``to drive contraceptive manufacturers out of
business.'' He and Dingell noted that such drugs must pass FDA
clearance procedures that are far stricter than those required for
other drugs.

   An amateur fossil hunter discovered the
fossilized remains of a 24 million-year-old sea turtle in a sand
pit, the Austria Press Agency reported.
   The remains, reported Thursday, were found at a construction
site in St. Georgen, about 90 miles west of Vienna.
   The area was once the floor of a huge sea which stretched along
the Alps covering what today is Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia and
Romania and reaching as far as the Caspian Sea in the Soviet Union.
   The fossil was 40 inches long. Previously only fragments of such
an animal had been uncovered, the report said.
   The fossil will be sent to the University of Vienna to be
restored. Similar finds in Austria include the skeleton of a bird
and the remains of a previously unknown species of dolphin.

<HEAD>Miami Judge Vows ``Donnybrook'' If He Is Impeached</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami
says a House subcommittee will overwhelmingly exonerate him of
bribery charges and predicts ``a donnybrook of a trial'' in the
Senate if he is impeached.
   ``We have seen a substantial amount of history made,'' Hastings
said Thursday after the House judicial subcommittee on criminal
justice ended its public hearings. ``I am personally relieved and
prepared to go forward if articles of impeachment are approved
against me.''
   The subcommittee will make a recommendation to the full House
Judiciary Committee on whether Hastings, who still sits on the
federal bench, should be impeached. If Hastings is impeached by the
House, the Senate will conduct a trial to determine whether he
should be removed from office.
   ``It will be a donnybrook of a trial,'' Hastings said. ``When
the dust settles, I'll be standing.''
   He said his best estimate is that the subcommittee will vote 7-1
against recommending that he be impeached, with Rep. Patrick L.
Swindall, R-Ga., probably casting the only negative vote against
him.
   He said, however, that ``the vote may go against me because
we're in a political situation here.''
   Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., said the panel's record would
remain open for another week for additional comments by Hastings'
attorneys. Conyers declined to predict when the subcommittee would
act, saying it depended on what Hastings' lawyers submitted.
   Conyers ended the public hearings after permitting Hastings to
call two witnesses against allegations he conspired to take a bribe
in exchange for modifying the sentences of two racketeers. Hastings
had requested that the panel hear more than 100 witnesses.
   Florreyn Joyette ``Joy'' Royals, a member of the Metro Miami
Action Plan, a civil rights organization, contradicted testimony
from Dade County Mayor Steve Clark that Hastings gave him
information which FBI agents have said caused them to stop three
major investigations because a wiretap had been compromised.
   Clark testified before the subcommittee that he talked to
Hastings after a speech on Sept. 6, 1985, and the judge told him to
stay away from Kevin ``Waxy'' Gordon, against whom Hastings had
approved an FBI wiretap. Gordon was the target of an FBI corruption
investigation.
   Miss Royals told the subcommittee that Hastings left the hotel
ballroom as soon as he completed making his speech and did not talk
to the mayor.
   The Rev. Bryan O. Walsh, a Catholic priest in the Miami diocese,
testified that he talked briefly with Hastings and Clark together
before the breakfast meeting.
   Hastings declined to testify before the subcommittee.
   In addition to the charge that he compromised the three
investigations by leaking the fact that the FBI had a wiretap,
Hastings also is accused of conspiring with Washington lawyer
William Borders to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the
sentences of two convicted racketeers.
   Borders, convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe for
Hastings, was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $35,000.
In a separate trial, Hastings was acquitted of the bribery
conspiracy charges.

<HEAD>Estimated Winter Wheat Production Down Amid Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's estimated winter wheat harvest
will be down 3 percent from last month's forecast because of
drought and disease, Agriculture Department economists say.
   ``Inadequate moisture and disease plagued winter wheat in the
central and northern Great Plains during May,'' the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report released Thursday.
   It estimated winter wheat production at 1.57 billion bushels,
slightly more than last year but still 3 percent below May's
forecast of 1.62 billion bushels. Last year's output was 1.56
billion bushels.
   Satellite photos reportedly show disease is taking a toll on
soft red winter wheat in Kansas and some USDA officials think that
drought could worsen the situation. But they say a healthy rainfall
could ease the problem considerably over much of the country.
   The report put this year's average yield at 39.4 bushels an
acre, down 0.4 bushels from the 1987 level and 1.3 bushels an acre
below the May estimate.
   The report said crop conditions vary through most of the country
but are mostly fair to good except in the Plains where they are
fair.
   Development of the crop was average or better except in the
Pacific Northwest and Colorado, it said. It said the wheat was
turning color in Illinois, Kansas and Missouri and that the harvest
had moved into Oklahoma and expanded across the Delta and Southeast.
   Harvested acres are expected to be 39.8 million acres this year,
the same same estimate that the department issued last month and 1
percent above the level for last season.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production.
   The report did not include 1988 production estimates for spring
wheat, corn and other spring-planted crops. The department will
make those forecasts later in the growing season.
   A separate supply and demand report from the Economic Research
Service said that flour and related food production would be lower
by perhaps 35 million bushels and the reduction should offset
somewhat the reduced supply of winter wheat. Thus it projected only
a slight reduction in the nation's wheat stockpile.
   The Kansas winter wheat crop, as usual the largest by far, was
estimated at 329 million bushels, down from 366.3 million in 1987.
The yield was put at 35 bushels per acre compared with 37 bushels
last year. The state's farmers also trimmed their acreage to 9.4
million acres from 9.9 million in 1987.
   Indicated production of winter wheat and average yields in 1988
by major producing states, based on June 1 prospects, included:
   Arkansas, 41,800,000 bushels and an average yield of 44 bushels
per acre; California, 35,640,000 and 81; Colorado, 86,950,000 and
37; Georgia, 19,780,000 and 43; Idaho, 56,880,000 and 72; Illinois,
61,600,000 and 55; Indiana, 34,300,000 and 49; Kansas, 329,000,000
and 35; Kentucky, 15,990,000 and 41; Michigan, 29,140,000 and 47;
Missouri, 65,800,000 and 47; Montana, 52,800,000 and 24; Nebraska,
86,100,000 and 42; North Carolina, 18,900,000 and 42; Ohio,
49,920,000 and 48; Oklahoma, 176,400,000 and 36; Oregon, 42,900,000
and 66; South Dakota, 46,500,000 and 30; Tennessee, 14,820,000 and
39; Texas, 92,800,000 and 29; Washington, 89,100,000 and 54.

   Agriculture Department economists are
estimating Soviet wheat imports for 1987-88 at 21.5 million tons,
down 500,000 from last month's forecast but still the second
highest on record.
   The department said Thursday that the pace of that nation's
imports has slowed in recent weeks, possibly a reaction to higher
wheat prices combined with the healthy outlook for the estimated 92
million-ton Soviet crop.
   The United States, with wheat sales of over 12 million tons thus
far this year, will account for more than 50 percent of the Soviet
market for foreign wheat, followed by Canada and the European
Community, the report said.
   It said the United States also is expected to be the largest
supplier of coarse grains to the Soviets, with 40 percent of this
year's market. Nearly three-fourths of the imports are expected to
be corn.
   Most of the remainder will be barley, primarily from Canada and
Western Europe, the report said.

   It takes more than presidents and painters to
keep the White House going.
   It also takes five calligraphers, one accountant, four florists,
two shifts of electricians and 39 domestic employees who serve
meals, greet visitors and keep house.
   The $5.7 million budget for the executive residence is now
working its way through Congress, and details are disclosed in
hearing records published by the House Appropriations Committee.
   They show a staff of 94 people working in a 132-room rabbit
warren of a building with floors badly damaged by 37 million people
who have walked on them.
   They also show that in the White House, as in many other houses,
things tend to accumulate and not get disposed of.
   Manus J. Fish Jr., director of the National Capital Region of
the National Park Service, outlined the budget before the
appropriations subcommittee on the Treasury, Postal Service and
general government appropriations.
   The budget request covers fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. It
is down $1.7 million from the amount appropriated for this fiscal
year.
   That amount, however, included $2.4 million for a major project
to remove between 30 and 50 layers of paint from the Pennsylvania
Avenue side of the building, and repaint it.
   After you subtract this amount, the new budget request is a 13
percent increase.
   A major share of the increase is requested to replace floors in
the State Dining Room and a private dining room next to it.
   ``An estimated 37 million visitors had walked on the floors
since they were installed during the 1948-1952 renovation,'' Fish
told the subcommittee.
   He brought along a piece of the floor which had been removed to
show how it had been worn almost to nothing at one end.
   ``High heels, that type of thing, you can see cause some
indentations in the wood,'' he told the lawmakers.
   Fish said the Park Service is asking for $65,000 to make the
position of curator full-time, bringing the full-time staff to 94.
The curator was a part-time job, shared with the State Department,
until recently. The present curator, Rex Scouten, works full time
but is paid by the White House Historical Association under a
temporary arrangement.
   The curator's job is defined as ``to assure proper preservation
of artifacts and objects of each presidency.'' There are plenty to
preserve.
   Fish told the subcommittee that the White House inventory fills
1,100 pages (it is also computerized) and contains information on
more than 50,000 ``museum objects and utilitarian objects that
belong to the Executive Mansion.''
   Many of them are in a warehouse. After the election, the new
president and his wife will probably go to the warehouse and pick
out the items they want in their new home, Fish said.
   Fish said $50,000 is requested for refurbishing the mansion for
the new family.
   When asked by Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., whether the Park Service
ever decides it can get rid of some of the material, Fish said,
``We do a once-a-year review, but there aren't too many items.''
   Fish outlined the staff as follows:
   ``A staff of 39 domestic employees accomplishes general
housekeeping, prepares and serves meals, greets visitors, and
provides services as required in support of official ceremonies and
functions. A staff of 33 tradespersons, including plumbers,
carpenters, painters, on a single shift; electricians on a double
shift; and operating engineers on a 24-hour basis, maintains and
makes repairs, minor modifications, and improvements to the 132
rooms and the mechanical systems, and provides support for official
and ceremonial functions.
   ``A staff of 14 specialized employes ... includes four florists,
five curators and five calligraphers.''
   There is also an administrative staff consisting of the chief
usher, three assistant ushers, an executive grounds superintendent,
two administrative assistants and one accountant.
   Elaine Crispen, press secretary to first lady Nancy Reagan, said
the 132 rooms include service rooms, many of them in two
sub-basements, in addition to the family quarters and the two
floors that are open to public tours.

<HEAD>Senate Sends Railroad Safety Legislation to President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government would have more muscle when it
seeks penalties against railroad workers who commit safety
violations, under legislation on its way to the White House for
President Reagan's signature.
   The Senate passed the measure on a voice vote Thursday, giving
final congressional approval to legislation sparked by a railroad
disaster that occurred 17 months ago.
   The legislation was developed after 16 people were killed and
175 hurt Jan. 4, 1987, when three connected Conrail locomotives
passed a stop signal and collided with an Amtrak passenger train in
Chase, Md.
   The measure, approved Thursday and having the support of
administration officials, would make it illegal for train workers
to tamper with safety devices. The Conrail crew was found to have
placed tape over a device that whistles if a train passes a stop
signal.
   The bill also would increase federal civil penalties levied for
safety violations. The maximum fine would increase from $2,500 to
$20,000.
   Under the measure, the government would acquire the right to
penalize individual workers for safety violations. Currently,
federal authorities only have the power to penalize railroad
companies if rules are broken.
   The power to pursue civil penalties would be in addition to the
right the government already has to seek criminal charges.
   The bill does not address another concern that arose from the
Chase, Md., accident: drug use by railroad workers. Members of the
Conrail crew have admitted they were smoking marijuana shortly
before the crash.
   Separate legislation that would require random drug and alcohol
testing of more than 3 million transportation workers has passed
the Senate but remains at committee level in the House.
   In addition to toughening penalties, the bill awaiting President
Reagan's signature gives the Department of Transportation a year to
create a licensing system for engineers, including requirements for
training and knowledge of operating practices.
   The government also would be empowered to examine applicants'
automobile driving licenses in an effort to learn if they have drug
or alcohol convictions.
   In addition, the measure requires installation within three
years of ``black boxes'' that would record a train's operating data
in case of an accident.
   The legislation was written largely by Sens. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., John Danforth, R-Mo., and J. James Exon, D-Neb.
   The bill passed the House May 23 by a voice vote.

<HEAD>North Will be First to Go on Trial in Iran-Contra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fired National Security Council aide Oliver L.
North is first on the prosecution's lineup of defendants to be
tried individually in four separate Iran-Contra conspiracy trials
ordered by the judge in the case.
   But independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is trying to minimize
the tactical setback imposed by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell's decision to hold separate trials of North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and Richard V. Secord.
   Walsh on Thursday proposed trying North and his former boss,
Poindexter, simultaneously before two juries and then holding a
similar proceeding for Hakim and Secord, former business partners
who brokered the U.S.-Iran arms deals and the diversion of profits
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gesell said four separate trials are needed to allow the
defendants to use each others' immunized congressional testimony to
defend the charges. A joint trial would compromise an individual
defendant's right not to have what he told Congress last year used
against him as evidence, the judge said.
   All the defendants except Secord received limited immunity from
prosecution for their testimony before last year's congressional
hearings. The law bars Walsh from using a defendant's immunized
congressional testimony against him.
   But Walsh said conducting two dual-jury trials ``would meet the
court's interest in protecting the rights of the defendants while
alleviating the enormous burdens on the government of trying each
defendant sequentially.''
   One jury would leave the courtroom when information prejudicial
to the defendant whose case it was hearing was introduced in court.
   ``Four separate and sequential trials will result in at least
some of the defendants living under the cloud of an indictment for
several months,'' Walsh said in a court filing Thursday.
   Legal experts say it would also force Walsh to disclose the
heart of his case to the other defendants long before they go to
trial. Trying each defendant separately could also have the effect
of diluting evidence that they participated in a conspiracy,
according to former federal prosecutors.
   Walsh said it was logical to try North and Poindexter together
because they were both charged with ``using their positions of
trust and power to facilitate and protect an illegal financial and
logistical network'' set up to help the Nicaraguan rebels after
Congress banned U.S. military aid to the Contras.
   Both are accused of ``numerous acts of obstruction and false
statements intended to cover up the activities of the
`Enterprise,''' Walsh said.
   Although evidence against the defendants would overlap, two
dual-jury trials would offer ``clear advantages in terms of
judicial efficiency, conservation of the government's resources and
speedy adjudication of the cases,'' Walsh said.
   Legal experts said North was a logical choice as the leadoff
defendant.
   ``You pick North first because he is the top banana in terms of
expansiveness'' of the evidence, said former U.S. Attorney Joseph
diGenova.
   ``It gives you the chance, if you are only to have one trial, to
get most of your evidence in and tell your story about the
conspiracy,'' he said, referring to the possibility of presidential
pardons that might avert subsequent trials.
   ``Normally you lead with strength,'' said E. Lawrence Barcella,
a former federal prosecutor here. ``If you get a conviction you
therefore may likely get a succeeding defendant to cave in and
plead guilty.''
   The strategy could backfire if ``you lose the strongest case and
the evidence against the other defendants is the same,'' Barcella
said. ``You have a bit of a dilemma as to whether or not you can go
forward with succeeding prosecutions.''
   Gesell had given Walsh until today to decide whether he wanted
to proceed first with North or Poindexter. The judge said they
should be tried first because the independent counsel law deals
with prosecution of high government officials.
   By sheer numbers, the probability of getting a conviction
against North is greater. He is named in 16 counts of the
indictment, while Poindexter is charged in seven.
   North is accused of conspiring to illegally use a tax-exempt
foundation to raise money to help arm the Contras and he is charged
with converting to his own use $4,300 of the $90,000 in travelers
checks he was given by a Contra leader for expenses incurred
helping the rebels.
   Unlike Poindexter, he is also accused of personally profiting
from the venture.
   The indictment also charges him with accepting an illegal
gratuity _ a $15,000 security fence that was installed around his
suburban Virginia house that Secord is accused of financing.
   North is also charged with obstructing the FBI's investigation
to determine who paid for the fence.

<HEAD>Vietnam Denies Chinese Charges of Intrusions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has denied China's claims that
its militiamen killed Vietnamese soldiers who intruded into Chinese
territory.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday that 12 Vietnamese
soldiers were killed or wounded during intrusions into China this
month.
   It was the latest accusation of cross-border provocations
between the two communist nations, which have had cool relations
since they fought a short border war in early 1979.
   The Vietnamese denied that their soldiers sneaked into China and
said none had been killed. The denial came in a Radio Hanoi
broadcast Thursday, a text of which was obtained from a Western
embassy in Bangkok today.
   The radio quoted the official Vietnam News Agency as saying it
was ``authorized to declare that this is totally a fabricated
report that is contrary to the actual situation and is released
with ill intention.''

<HEAD>Polls Suggest Jackson Would Hurt Democratic Ticket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is the top choice of Democrats
as a running mate for Michael Dukakis, but he would hurt the ticket
among groups whose support the Democrats need to win in the fall, a
survey published today in The Washington Post suggested.
   And another poll, conducted for USA Today and Cable News
Network, indicated a Dukakis-led ticket with Jesse Jackson as the
running mate would lose to George Bush, 47 percent to 40 percent.
Otherwise, Dukakis would win, 45 percent to 39 percent, the survey
suggested.
   Jackson has been saying that he deserves to be offered a spot on
the ticket. But the ABC News-Post survey found that two-thirds of
Democratic voters believe the nominee has the right to ``choose
anyone he wants'' as a running mate. Only three in 10 said the
second spot on the ticket should automatically go to the
second-place finisher in the primaries, the poll said.
   The ABC-Post poll said Jackson was the vice presidential choice
of 36 percent of all registered Democrats. However, nearly
one-quarter of those surveyed said they would be less likely to
vote for Dukakis if Jackson were on the ticket. Only 12 percent
said they would be more likely to vote Democratic with Jackson in
the No. 2 spot, the Post said.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee had the support of 20 percent,
and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio drew the support of 13 percent, the
newspaper said. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey had the backing of
7 percent, and Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia was supported by 3 percent.
   The ABC-Post survey also suggested that having Jackson as the
Democratic running mate would hurt Dukakis among former Reagan
Democrats _ a group that has been strongly supporting Dukakis in
primaries. About 28 percent of the Democrats who voted for Reagan
in 1984 said they would be less likely to vote for Dukakis if
Jackson were on the ticket.
   About a quarter of all Southern Democrats said they would be
less likely to vote for Dukakis if Jackson were the vice
presidential nominee. Jackson is from Greenville, S.C., and has
said he would bring regional balance to the ticket.
   The ABC-Post survey of 656 registered Democrats was conducted
May 19 to 25, and had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. The
USA Today-CNN poll, reported in today's editions of USA today, was
based on a survey of 1,253 registered voters, and had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points, the newspaper said.

   A Jordanian couple were convicted
Thursday of plotting to murder their unwanted son-in-law and two of
his relatives and have their bodies mutilated to avenge the family
honor.
   A Broward Circuit Court jury deliberated six hours before
finding Saud Tarawneh guilty of three counts of conspiracy to
commit murder and one count of solicitation to commit first-degree
murder.
   His wife Ghada was convicted of the three conspiracy counts but
was acquitted of solicitation. No one was injured in the alleged
plot.
   ``I love my daughter,'' Mrs. Tarawneh, 44, said after the
verdicts were announced.
   The prosecution contended during the weeklong trial that the
plot was hatched because the Tarawnehs were angered that their
daughter Raniah had married her Syrian cousin in 1986 over their
objections and moved to Tamarac.
   The Tarawnehs, who left Jordan 18 years ago and live in Toledo,
Ohio, were arrested last February. Prosecutors said Tarawneh, a
gynecologist, and his wife, a nurse, plotted the murder of Mouataz
Abdulsamad, his sister and mother to avenge the elopement.
   The prosecution also argued Tarawneh believed the killings,
along with the preservation of certain body parts and color photos
of the corpses, would enable him to restore the family's honor in
his native Jordan.
   The Tarawnehs' plans allegedly included instructions for the
killer to hang all three people, take photographs of the bodies and
mutilate them.
   The defense portrayed Tarawneh, 46, as a paranoid alcoholic,
easily manipulated and sometimes out of touch with reality. His
wife is a borderline psychotic, according to a clinical
psychologist called by the defense.
   Defense lawyer Barry Roderman said the Tarawnehs were exploited
and deceived by Ron Petrillo, a private investigator who uncovered
the alleged plot.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush has shifted his
self-proclaimed underdog presidential campaign into a frontal,
``look-at-the-record'' attack on Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis.
   Saying it's time ``to start swinging'' now that the party
nominating processes are all but finished, Bush on leveled a
broadside against Dukakis, accusing him of camouflaging left-wing
views with ``moderate tones.''
   Bush's hard-driving speech Thursday to a receptive Texas state
GOP convention marked the first time this year that the vice
president has taken on the Massachusetts governor in a
point-by-point recital of their differences.
   En route to Texas aboard Air Force Two, campaign manager Lee
Atwater had billed the Bush speech as signaling a major change in
strategy. Although Bush had often spoken negatively of various
Dukakis stands in recent weeks, the vice president had not gone to
such lengths to show where the pair part company.
   Bush's campaign aides said the time had come for the vice
president to say where he and Dukakis differ on issues.
   ``If the public doesn't see any difference between the two by
election day,'' said one high-ranking campaign official, ``then the
`time for a change' thing is going to benefit Dukakis.''
   Atwater indicated that the emerging Bush strategy between now
and the August nominating convention in New Orleans will involve
the vice president holding almost daily news conferences and ``make
his position clearer on a number of issues.''
   Bush, trailing Dukakis in public opinion polls and leading the
Democrat by only seven percentage points in a Texas Poll of his
adopted home state, told reporters that he wanted ``to begin
spelling out the differences.''
   ``I will do it factually. I will do it fairly. I want to get it
all together,'' he told a news conference here.
   ``And I'll begin with five words that are an underlying theme of
this campaign: `Let's look at the record.' ''
   Both Bush and Atwater indicated the vice president will give
little thought to choosing a running mate until Dukakis makes his
choice in Atlanta in July.
   ``He wants to see the Democrats throw their card on the table,''
Atwater said.
   The campaign manager also said the Bush camp believes that
President Reagan will prove a great campaign asset, although
Atwater said there has been no decision yet on just what specific
role the president will play in the fall campaign.
   In the meantime, Bush said he was happy with his campaign
organization, despite negative poll results, and Atwater suggested
publicly that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III might soon be
named campaign chairman.
   In his speech, interrupted frequently by applause, Bush attacked
Dukakis on several fronts, accusing the Democrat of favoring tax
increases, aggressive IRS audits of taxpayers and being soft on
crime. Bush also said that Dukakis would undermine U.S. military
strength and weaken America's ability to wield influence around the
world.
   Bush was traveling to Denver today to carry the same message to
a meeting of Western-state Republicans.
   Leslie Dach, a Dukakis campaign spokesman, reacted to the Bush
speech by saying the vice president had resorted to ``mudslinging
and tearing-down'' because of Bush's standing in the polls.
   Bush said Dukakis ``is an articulate defender of a flawed world
view, a man who holds strong convictions and who speaks in moderate
tones. But his views and values are often, in my judgment, out of
the mainstream.''
   Bush said ``it's uphill for us,'' because there may be a large
sentiment among U.S. voters in favor of change.
   ``After eight years of one party in the White House, no matter
how successful, some good people will yearn for a change,'' he
said, ``hoping that `change' will mean improvement.''
   ``And it's our job to let them know that this time, in this
case, change and improvement comes from the incumbent _ the
incumbent vice president.''
   ``Governor Dukakis, his foreign policy views born in Harvard
Yard's boutique, would cut the muscle of our defense,'' he said.
``I will not do that.''
   Bush said Dukakis would undermine economic growth as well.
   ``When I wanted to learn the ways of the world, I didn't go to
the Kennedy Scool, I came to Texas. I didn't go to a symposium on
job creation. I started a business. I didn't study a monograph on
the effects of economic growth. I met a payroll.''

<HEAD>State Council Votes to Reduce Intern and Resident Work Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interns and residents in New York hospitals will
no longer be scheduled for mind-numbing 36-hour shifts and
100-hour-plus work weeks, under hospital rules adopted Thursday by
a state health panel.
   The action curbs a training system for young doctors that
critics have condemned as part hazing and part labor exploitation,
dehumanizing to the trainees and dangerous to patients.
   A resident typically is paid $24,000 a year, which works out to
less than $5 an hour for a 100-hour work week.
   The state health commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, a champion of
the reforms, said he expected New York's example to spearhead a
national trend.
   New York, with 13,000 residents and interns, has 16 percent of
the nation's doctors in training, while an additional 6 percent are
in teaching hospitals in Massachusetts, where similar rules are
about to be adopted, Axelrod said.
   A review of doctor training was pushed by Axelrod in the wake of
a grand jury report faulting the hospital care that resulted in the
death in 1984 of Libby Zion, 18-year-old daughter of a well-known
writer, Sidney Zion.
   Among major benefits of the hospital code revisions will be
``better judgment by the physicians in training because they will
no longer be sleep-deprived and fatigued,'' Axelrod said.
   The new rules put a 12-hour limit on emergency room shifts for
interns, residents and attending physicians.
   In other services, young doctors in training will not be
required to put in more than 24 hours a shift and their work week
may not average more than 80 hours during any four consecutive
weeks.
   They will have at least eight free hours between work shifts and
at least one full day off every week.
   They also will be barred from moonlighting at other hospitals.
   Axelrod said the 12-hour ER shift, which is to take effect as of
Oct. 1, already is followed in 95 percent of the state's teaching
hospitals. Most of the other new rules were adopted with an
effective date of next July 1, 1989.
   The 32-member State Hospital Review and Planning Council adopted
the code revisions without dissent.
   ``It's a great day for patients and doctors, long overdue,''
said Dr. Robert Schwartz, leader of the Committee of Interns and
Residents at Kings County Hospital, where he is completing a
four-year residency in psychiatry.
   Schwartz said he worked 100 to 105 hours a week as an intern and
that 36-hour shifts are scheduled routinely. ``And you generally
don't sleep,'' he said. ``When you're on call and you sleep two
hours, that's a great night.''
   Schwartz said the reforms will not require hospitals' hiring
more interns and residents, ``but rather a redistribution and
rethinking of how the work is currently done, reorganizing the
shift.''

<HEAD>Even Genteel World of Cricket Rocked by Sex Scandals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sex for sale at Harrods? Prince Charles's polo
manager in a massage parlor? Sex frolics in a parliamentary shower
room? England's cricket captain fired for having female company in
his hotel room?
   Recent weeks have yielded an unusually rich harvest of lurid
tales for London's anything-goes tabloid newspapers. With the
firing of captain Michael Gatting on Thursday, it seems that not
even the genteel world of cricket is being spared.
   Gatting, 31, was summoned by the team selectors to answer
newspaper allegations that two of his players had sex on a lawn
outside their hotel Sunday night, and that he took a woman to his
room for sex.
   The alleged offense, as far as the selectors were concerned, was
that it happened while a five-day game, or test, was in progress
against the West Indies in Nottinghamshire.
   ``Warnings had previously been issued to all England players
concerning the standard of behavior expected of them at all times,
both on and off the field, and these had been ignored,'' said a
statement by the Test and County Cricket Board, the game's
governing body.
   Gatting, who is married and has two children, issued a statement
saying: ``I categorically deny allegations of sexual impropriety
which have been made against me by certain newspapers,'' and said
he would sue them. The allegations appeared Wednesday and Thursday
in the Sun, Today and the Daily Mirror.
   The cricket board said the selectors believed Gatting's account.
   So why fire him?
   Because, the statement said, ``Gatting behaved irresponsibly
during a test match by inviting female company to his room for a
drink in the late evening.''
   Therefore, it added, in the genteel language that still governs
the cricketing world, ``the invitation to Mike Gatting to captain
the England team ... has been withdrawn,'' and Gatting ``did not
wish to be considered for selection'' for the team for the second
game, starting June 16.
   The other three scheduled games were not mentioned, and Gatting
brushed reporters aside as he left.
   ``You've got to be extra careful for the good name of cricket,''
former captain Ted Dexter said in a TV interview. ``At the same
time it's a pretty sad day if a young man can't meet a nice girl
and spend a happy evening with her without being accused of frolics
and romps.''
   Today editor David Montgomery told the same interviewer:
``Perhaps the selectors should have more of a sense of humor about
lively behavior off the pitch.''
   But team manager Micky Stewart told a news conference ``cricket
has been let down by it, English cricket.''
   The scandal isn't yet over. Four other players will be
questioned about sex allegations today, Stewart said.
   Gatting, a stocky, bearded Londoner, did not attend an
upper-crust school like most previous captains, and his appointment
as captain in 1986 was greeted by the Observer newspaper as
``another step ... toward the classless society.''
   But although Gatting was decorated by Queen Elizabeth II for his
cricketing prowess, his captaincy has been lackluster. He has won
only two of his 23 international games as captain, and the West
Indies match ended Tuesday in a draw. Last year he was officially
censured for having a foul-mouthed shouting match with a Pakistani
umpire during a match in Faisalabad.
   Gatting got into further trouble for writing a book giving his
version of the Faisalabad incident, and had to promise the cricket
board he would withdraw the relevant chapter.
   Cricket is not the only English institution to take a tarnishing
in recent weeks.
   Ronald Ferguson, father of Sarah, the Duchess of York and polo
manager of Prince Charles, narrowly escaped expulsion from his polo
club last month after the tabloid Sunday People photographed him
leaving a London massage parlor.
   Two weeks ago a lawmaker for the opposition Labor Party publicly
denied newspaper allegations that he frolicked with a secretary in
a House of Commons shower room, and on Wednesday the Mirror claimed
saleswomen at the Harrods department store were selling sexual
favors to customers.
   Harrods said the women worked for perfume sellers using space in
the department store, and were not Harrods employees, but added an
investigation was under way.

   It wasn't enough that toddler Jessica
McClure spent 58 hours trapped in a well last October. Now she
plans to take on World Class Wrestling star Kevin Von Erich to
raise money for a 5-year-old who awaits a heart-lung transplant.
   Jessica will go into the ring Saturday with fund-raiser
organizer Bonnie Arnold on behalf of the youngster, Brennan Bolin.
   ``At the beginning of the event for fun he (Von Erich) will be
tumbling around with Jessica,'' Mrs. Arnold said Thursday. ``We're
not going to let him hurt her, or her hurt him either. It's a fun
bout.''
   Brennan needs $125,000 for his operation, said Mrs. Arnold. The
fund drive so far has raised about $55,000. The Bolins and the
McClures are acquaintances, said Mrs. Arnold.

   Leona Helmsley, already facing federal and state
tax evasion charges, is now on the rocks with an interior decorator
who allegedly ignored her wishes for outfitting one of her homes.
   The decorator, Rita Silbert Davis of El Paso, Texas, has refused
to return a $50,000 advance on the Paradise Valley, Ariz., home,
court papers filed by Mrs. Helmsley alleged Thursday.
   Mrs. Helmsley, the self-proclaimed ``queen'' of the hotel chain
run by her husband, New York real estate magnate Harry Helmsley,
has requested that Ms. Davis use Mexican volcanic stone inside the
house, among other things.
   ``Davis' recommendations did not reflect the concept for the
house previously agreed upon with Helmsley,'' the court papers
charge.
   Ms. Davis was fired March 31. Mrs. Helmsley, one of the world's
wealthiest women, seeks the return of her $50,000 _ with interest _
along with unspecified damages and payment of her legal fees.
   Ms. Davis, reached at her home, declined to comment.
   The Helmsleys have pleaded innocent to tax evasion charges that
they hid about $4 million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn.,
mansion as business deductions. Their federal trial is set to begin
Sept. 14.

   Entertainer Bruce Willis was ``at home,
resting comfortably'' five days after doctors removed his appendix,
a spokeswoman said.
   Willis, 33, was released from an unidentified hospital
Wednesday, spokeswoman Cheryl Nakao said Thursday.
   ``Everything is fine. He's doing great,'' she said.
   After about 10 days at home, Willis is expected to go back to
work promoting his upcoming movie, ``Die Hard.''
   Willis, one of the zany detectives on ABC's ``Moonlighting''
television series, experienced pain Saturday night and was taken to
the hospital, where appendicitis was diagnosed and surgery was
performed later that night.

   Paul Newman says a delicatessen owner
who sued the actor seeking stock or profits from Newman's food
business had nothing to do with the development of his line of
salad dressing.
   The 63-year-old president and founder of Newman's Own Inc.
testified Thursday that the ideas for the salad dressing, its
recipe, label and packaging were his own, and that Westport deli
owner Julius Gold had no involvement.
   Gold alleges that he contributed 30 months of effort to Newman's
company and that an attorney for the actor promised him 8 percent
of the stock from Newman's Own in return.
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity since 1982 and
helped create a camp for seriously ill children in northeastern
Connecticut, which opened last week.

   Teen-age pop star Tiffany has agreed to
withdraw her petition to be legally recognized as an adult after
reaching a settlement with her mother.
   Tiffany Darwish, her formal name, and her mother, Janie
Williams, reached the agreement Thursday after hours of
negotiations at the Los Angeles County Courthouse.
   Attorneys for both sides refused to disclose the terms of the
settlement, as did the 16-year-old singer, who has scored hits with
remakes of '60s era songs such as ``I Saw Him Standing There'' and
``I Think We're Alone Now.''
   Tiffany filed emancipation papers in March after Williams
refused to approve a management contract between the singer and
George Tobin, her manager. Since Tiffany is a minor, her contracts
must be approved by her guardian and a court.
   While Tiffany had contended that her mother was hindering her
career, Williams claimed that Tobin had too much control over the
singer's finances and career.

   Americans must find the courage to overcome
their biases in the face of often-subtle prejudice, author and
actress Maya Angelou says.
   ``Courage is the most important of all the virtues,'' she said
at the 50th anniversary banquet Wednesday of the Midlands Chapter
of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
   ``It is easy to speak of racism when the food is good and the
wine is generous,'' she said.
   It is more difficult on the street, but she predicted that
Americans eventually will overcome their prejudices.
   ``It will happen or our country will disintegrate,'' she said.
   Ms. Angelou portrayed Kunta Kinte's mother in the TV miniseries
``Roots,'' and a television movie was produced from her
autobiographical book, ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.''

   The maker of the Suzuki Samurai took the
offense in a battle over the vehicle's safety, disputing the
validity of tests by Consumer Reports magazine that found the
Samurai dangerously prone to roll over.
   The tests by Consumers Union, the magazine's publisher,
apparently were intended to persuade the government to adopt new
stability standards for sport-utility vehicles like the Samurai,
Suzuki executive Doug Mazza said Thursday.
   ``The Suzuki Samurai has been falsely accused, and it does not
have a design error,'' Mazza said. ``We have absolute confidence in
its safety record and road-worthiness in the United States.''
   Calling the test results ``inaccurate and defamatory,'' Mazza,
vice president of Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Corp., said the
company was considering a lawsuit against Consumers Union.
   Consumers Union stands by its tests, said David Berliner,
assistant director of the non-profit organization based in Mount
Vernon, N.Y. He denied the tests were intended to influence federal
regulations.
   Consumers Union said last week the Samurai rolled over in abrupt
maneuvers because it is too tall for its small wheelbase. Similar
vehicles passed the test. The group called for the immediate recall
of all 160,000 Samurais on U.S. roads and reimbursement of their
owners.
   But Mazza said government accident statistics, along with tests
conducted by an automotive engineering consultant for Suzuki, show
the four-wheel-drive vehicle is safe under typical driving
conditions, safer than some other vehicles of its type.
   At simultaneous news conferences in New York, Detroit and Los
Angeles, Mazza showed films of Samurais passing a number of what
were described as rigorous tests of the car's ability to stay
upright.
   ``For years the Consumers Union has been pressing the government
for an unrealistic rollover standard,'' Mazza said. ``What better
way than pressing the smallest Japanese automaker with the No. 1
selling sport-utility vehicle?''
   Publicity about the Consumers Union tests is expected to cut
Samurai sales, Mazza said, adding that the company has boosted its
advertising budget by $1.5 million a week to counter consumer fears
raised by the tests. The $8,500 vehicle is promoted as a fun car
for the youth market.
   Suzuki's auto engineering consultant, Jon McKibben of Irvine,
said it appeared the Consumers Union test driver deliberately
turned the Samurai more sharply than other sport-utility vehicles
in the obstacle-avoidance test. Sport-utility vehicles are
Jeep-like light trucks.
   McKibben acknowledged that he knew of the test only by watching
a videotape of it.
   Berliner of the Consumers Union responded: ``We never suggested
that the Samurai will turn over every time a driver swerves to
avoid an obstacle in the road. We said that its design creates
enough chance of that happening to the typical driver that it poses
an unacceptable risk.''
   The Samurais in the Consumers Union tests may have been made
unstable by 300-pound ``outriggers'' bolted to the cars to keep
them from rolling over completely, McKibben said.
   However, Consumers Union contends the outriggers actually should
make the vehicles more stable.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there
have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving
53 injuries and 16 deaths.
   Consumers Union filed a petition with the NHTSA seeking rules
requiring that sport-utility vehicles be put through road tests for
safety, rather than just requiring them to meet design standards.
   Suzuki said its study of federal statistics on fatal accidents
found that in the last two years, there were three fatal accidents
in which a Samurai may have rolled over on a relatively flat
surface. In two of those cases, the drivers had been drinking and
none of the victims wore seat belts, McKibben said.

<HEAD>Sandinista-Contra Talks Break Off With No New Round Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government and
the U.S.-backed rebels have broken off peace talks that the
insurgents called the final attempt at negotiating an end to the
6-year-old war.
   After the negotiations ended Thursday, both sides said a
temporary truce would remain in effect for an undetermined amount
of time.
   No new date was announced for resuming the talks, aimed at
fashioning a permament halt to the fighting that has claimed more
than 26,000 lives.
   Despite the breakdown, rebel leader Alfredo Cesar told
journalists Thursday night: ``We have reiterated our deep
conviction to look for solutions to the conflict in our motherland
in a civilized way.''
   Each side blamed the other for the discussions' failure.
   The nation's defense minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega, head of the
Sandinista delegation, said the Contra rebels held ``irrational
positions'' and maintained an ``anti-negotiation attitude against
the peace.''
   In a statement released in Washington, rebel leader Adolfo
Calero countered that the government ``demonstrated its hostility
toward any meaningful solution to the oppression in Nicaragua.''
   The goal of the fourth round of negotiations, which began on
Tuesday, was to end the war and install democratic reforms, in
accordance with a preliminary peace plan signed on March 23 in the
village of Sapoa on the Costa Rican border.
   Thursday morning, the government put forth its most liberal
proposal to date and granted a key rebel demand to institute
democratic reforms before the rebels put down their weapons.
   The Contras rejected the proposal, saying the Sandinistas did
not guarantee that the measures would be enacted before they
disarmed.
   The Sandinista proposal included freedom of expression, reform
of electoral laws, separation of the ruling Sandinista party from
the state and the right to strike.
   The government proposal also would have granted political
amnesty in steps, with the first 200 prisoners freed after the
signing of an agreement and the last freed on Sept. 28.
   The Contras offered a proposal calling for total amnesty for all
political prisoners within five days of signing.
   The rebels said there are 4,207 political prisoners, while the
International Red Cross, seen here as sympathetic to the
government, put the figure at 3,324.
   The Contras also demanded separating the armed forces from the
ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front in name as well as
actions. The govenment agreed to the ``separation and independence
of the powers of the state.''
   The rebels have insisted on a timetable for enacting political
reforms, including pluralism, freedom of expression, the right to
strike, electoral reforms and guarantees of a mixed economy.
   The Sandinista proposal said those changes would be discussed
during 60 days among the 14 opposition political parties and eight
rebel representatives after rebel fighters gathered in designated
zones to disarm.
   The talks would be held before the date set for the fighters to
lay down their arms. The Contras said they needed guarantees that
the democratic measures would not only be discussed but enacted.
   The government said in earlier meetings that several points in
the rebel plan were unacceptable. They included a temporary
suspension of the military draft, permission for the Contras'
Nicaraguan Resistance group to open offices in Nicaragua and
licenses for private television stations.
   The rebels said that if the Sandinistas wanted to show good
will, they would bend to their demands.
   ``It is with deep consternation we announce that an agreement
for a permanent cease-fire was not reached,'' Cesar told reporters.
   ``The war that our people have suffered for seven years and that
has stopped almost entirely should not be renewed. The Resistance
will not initiate offensive military operations,'' he said.
   Ortega, speaking later to reporters, blamed ``recalcitrant
positions of the (Reagan) administration'' and said the rebels had
not intended to sign an agreement.
   American lawyer Paul Reichler, who serves as a Sandinista
negotiator, said earlier that members of the Reagan administration
did not want a peace plan to be signed so there would be a chance
for additional military aid to the rebels.
   Congress voted down President Reagan's request earlier this year
for renewed Contra military funding, which ended Feb. 29. The
United States has backed the rebels since 1981.
   Reichler put most of the fault for the talks' failure on Col.
Enrique Bermudez, highest-ranking Contra military leader. He quoted
Cesar as telling him during private meetings that Bermudez would
respond to orders from the U.S. State Department.
   Cesar and Bermudez said Reichler's comments were an attempt to
create divisions within the rebel ranks.

   Each night she builds a dam. Each
morning he breaks it down.
   This frustrating relationship has been going on since last month
between a beaver just doing what comes naturally and a town
official just doing his job.
   ``We haven't come up with a name for her yet,'' said
Conservation Commission Chairman James McBride. ``But you should
hear some of the names I call her when I'm out there in the morning
knocking down the dam.''
   The beaver bedevilment began for McBride in late May, when a dam
built by the animals on Deep Brook caused flooding on nearby
streets. Snares were placed around the stream to catch the pair of
beavers alive, but only the male beaver was nabbed and released in
a 330-acre bog across town last week.
   Attempts to apprehend the beaver's mate have been unsuccessful.
   ``She's a shrewd one,'' said McBride. ``She hasn't come near the
traps ... but don't worry, we'll catch her.''
   McBride, who theorizes the female beaver may have become
familiar with the traps' appearance, pulled the snares on Thursday.
   ``We'll put them back on Monday and maybe we'll catch her off
guard,'' said McBride. ``Maybe she'll get careless.''
   McBride also has hopes that the urge to mate may deflect some of
the beaver's attention from her dam-building mission.
   ``It's mating season, so we want to get them together,'' he
said. ``Right now, the mate is out in the bog by himself eating
poplar trees _ their favorite thing to eat.''
   Despite McBride's matchmaking aspirations, the beaver may yet
get to keep her dam after all. If the beaver is found to be
nursing, she will be returned to the brook.
   ``If she's already given birth, then we'll put her back for the
summer,'' said McBride. ``There's nothing else we can do. She would
win.''
   Meanwhile, the commission has delayed installation of a
state-ordered pipe system to regulate water flow through the brook.
   He said the pipes could kill any beavers in the brook by
lowering the water depth to a point where it would freeze solid to
the bottom in winter.
   ``One way or another we'll get the flooding problem figured
out,'' said McBride. ``The first thing on my mind at this point is
catching that beaver.''

   Yasser Arafat and the PLO emerged from
the Arab summit meeting greatly strengthened for their
confrontation with Israel by the unqualified material and moral
support of the Arab leaders.
   Saudi Arabia and the other oil-rich Persian Gulf states for the
first time agreed to pay the Palestine Liberation Organization a
substantial subsidy to intensify the 6-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   The amount of the subsidy officially was kept secret to avoid
showing the Arab hand to the Israelis. But delegates said it was
set at $118 million for the first year.
   This fell short of the $600 million a year Arafat said he needed
to keep the full heat of the revolt on the Israelis, but it meant a
solid boost to what the Palestinian leader has described as the
``stone-throwing revolution.''
   The oil-exporting states told the PLO they could not meet its
full financial needs because their income has been hurt by an
unstable world oil market and by the effects of the Iran-Iraq war.
Arafat was widely believed to have overstated his real needs in the
expectation that his demands would not be fully met.
   Arafat's associates made no secret that he was overjoyed with
the outcome of the summit.
   The PLO leader said the money would be used to pay relief and
medical treatment for injured rioters, help the families of those
killed or injured and compensate strikers for lost wages.
   Arafat did not specify what other uses he had in mind for the
windfall, but it was clear the subsidy could also allow the PLO to
step up its efforts to smuggle small arms and communications and
sabotage equipment to the rioters.
   ``The conference stresses its full commitment to extend all the
support needed to secure the continuation and escalation of the
uprising under the leadership of the PLO,'' the summit's final
communique declared.
   However tightly Israel tries to keep the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip sealed off from
the outside world, never an easy task at best of times, the PLO's
riot fund will not make it any easier.
   The Arab leaders made a further significant gesture in Arafat's
favor by deciding the PLO henceforth should be the sole master of
the insurgency fund. This meant Arafat will no longer have to share
any part of his funds with Jordan or with a joint PLO-Jordanian
support committee.
   The summit also endorsed previous Arab decisions to recognize
the PLO as the ``sole and legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people,'' automatically branding non-PLO Palestinians
who choose to work with the Israelis in the occupied territories as
traitors.
   It reiterated Arafat's earlier scornful dismissal of U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz's latest peace plan and
insisted that the PLO must participate with full delegation status
in any international peace conference.
   The United States and Israel regard the PLO as a terrorist
organization and refuse to envisage any role for it in the peace
process.
   The Arab leaders went beyond previous summits by endorsing more
strongly than ever the Palestinians' right to set up a sovereign
state in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in
the 1967 war. Israel has proclaimed the reunited holy city as its
capital and is unlikely to relinquish its control of it.
   Nonetheless, the summit's endorsement in effect strengthened
Arafat's status as a full-fledged head of state in Arab eyes. It
was likely to boost him even further in the eyes of Soviet leaders
who have long supported him.
   Arafat also strengthened his position against his more militant
rivals within the PLO by apparently achieving a full reconciliation
with Syria's Soviet-backed president, Hafez Assad. Their relations
seemed to have warmed considerably since they met in Damascus in
April following five years of open hostility.
   Assad conferred privately with Arafat for more than two hours
shortly before the final session.
   On the strength of what he believes is a new relationship with
Assad, Arafat soon may be in a position to beat down his rivals in
the Palestinian camp. These include the Syrian-backed Abu Moussa,
who has led several armed revolts against the PLO chairman in
recent years.

   AIDS education is paying off, with more than
two-thirds of adults recently surveyed saying children with AIDS
should be allowed to attend school with other youngsters, the
American Medical Association said today.
   In addition, 80 percent of 1,500 adults surveyed in February
said they knew ``a lot'' about AIDS, compared with only 69 percent
who said they knew ``a lot'' or ``a fair amount'' in a similar
survey last year.
   ``It is gratifying to see that the AIDS education efforts of the
past year have helped,'' said Dr. James H. Sammons, AMA executive
vice president, in a statement accompanying results of the survey.
   ``Although we are encouraged by the progress, the AMA will
continue to work toward having 100 percent of the public confident
in their knowledge about AIDS,'' he added in the statement in the
organization's weekly newspaper, American Medical News.
   The February survey found that 68 percent of adults said
children with AIDS should be allowed to attend regular class; 18
percent said they should not; and 14 percent were unsure.
   That compares with a 1987 survey in which 57 percent of adults
favored regular school attendance for youngsters with AIDS, 23
percent opposed it and 20 percent were unsure.
   The AMA said two years ago that no valid reason exists to bar
most children with AIDS from classes, and the American Academy of
Pediatrics has since expressed a similar view.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said in his report on AIDS a
year ago that children could be allowed to attend classes with a
physician's approval.
   More than 1,000 children under age 13 have been diagnosed with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta began tracking cases in 1981, the CDC
said Thursday.
   Most children with AIDS have gotten the deadly disease from
their mothers, with the rest contracting it through transfusions of
contaminated blood or blood products or from undetermined causes.
   The survey, commissioned by the AMA, was conducted by
Tarrance-SRI of Houston, and involved interviews with 1,500 adults,
using a random sample of all residential telephones in the United
States, the AMA said. Its margin of error was plus or minus 2.5
percentage points.
   In a separate recent survey of 1,000 physicians, the AMA found
that 80 percent thought children with AIDS should be allowed to
attend classes, compared with 78 percent in 1987, the organization
said.
   Only 11 percent of the physicians surveyed said children with
AIDS should be barred from school, compared with 14 percent in
1987, the AMA said. Nine percent were unsure in this year's survey,
compared with 8 percent in 1987, it said.
   The margin of error in the physician survey was plus or minus 3
percentage points, the AMA said.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has indicted home video
producer Stuart Karl on charges of giving nearly $200,000 in
illegal campaign contributions to former presidential hopeful Gary
Hart and other candidates.
   Karl, 34, of Newport Beach, who made a fortune on Jane Fonda's
workout tapes, induced others to make political contributions
benefiting candidates he favored in 1984 and 1986 and then
reimbursed the donors to elude federal limits on such
contributions, the 12-count indictment alleged.
   The indictment, returned Thursday, accuses Karl of conspiracy,
false statement-concealment in a matter before a government agency,
making an illegal corporate contribution to a federal candidate,
making excessive contributions to a candidate and making a campaign
contribution in the name of another.
   ``There is no evidence that Mr. Hart or the other senatorial
candidates were aware of the illegal contributions,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert Bonner said at a news conference.
   Thirteen of Karl's former employees who were used as conduits
for the alleged contributions were not indicted because most of
them cooperated in the investigation and have been given limited
immunity from prosecution, Bonner said.
   The indictment contends Hart's 1984 campaign received $159,500,
while $38,300 went to U.S. House and Senate candidates.
   The indictment also alleges Karl used his corporation,
Karl-Lorimar Home Video, to give an illegal $25,000 contribution to
a fund-raiser entitled ``An Evening With Barbara Streisand and
Robin Williams.''
   The fund-raiser benefited various candidates, including Sen.
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., Sen. Tom Daschle D-S.D., former U.S. Rep.
Bob Edgar, D-Pa., Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.
   Bonner and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Stock said members of
Hart's political campaign who encouraged the contributions to be
made were still under investigation. Unidentified members of the
Hart campaign are cooperating with the government, Ms. Stock said.
   If convicted, Karl faces 36 years in prison and fines totaling
at least $930,000. His arraignment was scheduled for June 20 in
U.S. District Court in Santa Ana.
   Karl, who once described himself as a ``humble little guy with
the torn tennis shoes,'' became a millionaire in the magazine and
video markets. He started Karl Video in 1979. It was responsible
for Jane Fonda's first ``Workout'' video, which has sold millions
of copies.
   After selling his company to Lorimar Inc., a movie and TV
production house, in 1984 for an undisclosed amount, Karl became
president and chief executive of Karl-Lorimar Home Video division,
with an employment contract running through 1989. But in March
1987, Karl was forced to resign after conflict-of-interest
allegations.
   Lorimar-Telepictures, the renamed parent company, contended that
Karl, along with another Karl-Lorimar executive and a former
executive, had set up an outside company to provide services such
as video posters, then awarded that company Karl-Lorimar contracts.
The three men allegedly earned about $150,000 from the venture.
   Karl said in an interview then that Karl-Lorimar's estimated
annual sales were between $80 million and $100 million.
   In November 1987, Lorimar-Telepictures filed suit against Karl,
alleging he had violated terms of a financial agreement made when
he resigned. He denied wrongdoing and the suit is pending.

<HEAD>Sociologist Says Soviets Need Full-Time Mothers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The working Soviet mother spends no more than 30
minutes a week raising her children, and her mate spends only six
minutes, a sociologist said in a plea for mothers to make children
their prime mission.
   ``Such negative phenomena as juvenile delinquency are largely
explained by the inadequate attention shown to children by their
parents,'' Tatyana Zaslavskaya told the official Tass news agency
in an interview published Thursday.
   The remarks of the prominent sociologist, one of the
theoreticians of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for economic and
social change, clash with longstanding Soviet orthodoxy.
   The government has maintained for decades that its network of
day-care centers, kindergartens and schools could raise children
while both parents occupy full-time jobs.
   But Ms. Zaslavskaya, who conducted a poll of Soviet parents,
rejected that logic.
   ``The time spent by working mothers on spiritual communication
with their children, that is, directly on their upbringing, does
not exceed, according to our poll findings, a weekly 30 minutes,''
she said.
   ``The figure for men is even lower, or six minutes a week,'' the
Soviet sociologist said.
   Ms. Zaslavskaya's conclusion: ``The high rate of employment
among working-age women _ 94 percent _ tells especially adversely
on their prime mission _ the upbringing of children.''
   The recent Western phenomenon of the ``Super Mom'' has been
known for years in the Soviet Union, where it is wryly referred to
as ``the problem of two jobs.''
   After a typical Soviet woman finishes her job at the factory,
shop or office, she heads home, where shopping, cooking, cleaning
and keeping house await her.
   Her husband traditionally feels it is beneath him to help,
either with the housework or the children.
   A 1987 report to a Soviet national conference on women said that
because of the lack of home appliances and the need to spend hours
in lines while shopping, ``the time expended on housework by a
woman is almost equal to the length of another entire working day.''
   Ms. Zaslavskaya, the president of the Soviet Sociological
Association, proposed that more Soviet women stay home and rear
their children full-time.
   So far, that has not been possible in the Soviet Union because
of economics, she said. ``Most men won't be able to ensure a
dignified life for their families if their wives don't work and
earn money, too.''
   The average Soviet industrial wage is now only about 200 rubles,
or the equivalent of about $330 a month.
   But Ms. Zaslavskaya said that as economic reforms instituted by
Gorbachev begin to bear fruit, wages will be pegged to individual
job performance, or the output of a given work collective, and two
incomes will not be needed to keep a family financially afloat.
   ``The choice between having a job and being a housewife is thus
going to become a reality,'' Tass quoted her as saying.
   Ms. Zaslavskaya said surveys show that 40 percent of Soviet
women with children would like to be homemakers if the wages of
their husbands were ``at least equal to the current combined
earnings of man and wife.''
   She called on a nationwide conference of the Communist Party
convening June 28 to discuss ways ``to reduce excessively high
employment levels among women.''
   But that seems doubtful as the Kremlin leadership tries to
mobilize all the country's economic resources behind Gorbachev's
restructuring campaign.
   Women now constitute 51 percent of the nation's 130
million-member labor force and often perform exacting and delicate
work that managers say would be more poorly done by men.
   The Soviet Union remains a resolutely male-dominated society,
although the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution proclaimed the equality of
the sexes. Only one woman, Aleksandra P. Biryukova, serves on the
powerful Communist Party Secretariat, and all 13 voting members of
the ruling Politburo are men.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ban on Japanese Fishing That Kills Porpoise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has upheld an injunction
barring Japanese fleets in an area off the Alaska Coast from salmon
fishing with huge gillnets, a technique that traps porpoises and
other marine mammals.
   The move Thursday was hailed by environmentalists and a native
Alaskan fishermen's organization. It was a defeat for the Reagan
administration and the Commerce Department, which had issued the
permits for fishing with the gillnets.
   ``We know at least we're not going to have this ecological
disaster played out in our waters this summer, and we're hopeful it
is going to be stopped for good,'' said Alan Reichman, a
Seattle-based spokesman for the Greenpeace environmental group.
   The Federation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association and
the Reagan administration had asked the high court to overturn the
injunction and permit fishing to resume pending the high court's
consideration of a formal appeal.
   The Justice Department said preventing the Japanese from fishing
for salmon ``may prompt Japan to withdraw from the international
convention that currently prohibits Japanese fishermen from fishing
for North American salmon in a large area of the North Pacific.''
   The order also will ``almost certainly lead to the removal from
Japanese fishing vessels of the United States observers who now
monitor the incidental taking of marine mammals by Japanese
fishermen,'' it said.
   The injunction bars gillnet fishing by Japanese fleets during
the June-July salmon season in an area of the Bering Sea and North
Pacific.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last February upheld a federal
judge's preliminary injunction halting gillnet fishing by the
Japanese inside the zone.
   The appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, said a Commerce Department
permit to allow use of the nine-mile-long gillnets violated a
federal animal protection law.
   The permit would allow the unintentional catching in the nets of
5,250 Dall's porpoise, plus seas lions, fur seals and killer
whales. The mammals become ensnared in the nets, which stretch for
hundreds of miles.
   The injunction in the case does not prevent the Japanese from
using gillnets beyond the 200-mile protected zone.
   The injunction was obtained by the Center for Environmental
Education and the Kokechik Fishermen's Association.
   Supporters of the ban said the government was exaggerating the
impact of the injunction.
   They said the Japanese already had scaled down their fishing
operations in anticipation that the court ban would remain in
effect during the current season.
   The environmentalists said if the injunction was lifted it
``would have enormous and irreparable impact on marine mammals''
within a 200-mile zone off the Alaska coast that is at issue in the
dispute.
   The cases are Secretary of Commerce vs. Kokechik Fishermen's
Association, A-906, and Federation of Japan Salmon Fisheries vs.
Kokechik, A-907.

   Radical students hurling hundreds of
firebombs tried to march to Communist North Korea Friday, and riot
police fired volleys of tear gas to drive them back.
   About 5,000 students, yelling ``Skin the Yankees'' and ``Unite
our fatherland,'' tried to march out of Yonsei University to head
for the border to press for the peninsula's reunification.
   Waves of students hurling firebombs charged out of the
university's main gate to attack waiting riot police. Several
officers hit by firebombs screamed when they were covered in
blazing gasoline.
   Other students pelted police with rocks and broken bricks as
lines of riot troopers battled to drive them back into the school.
   Later, about 2,000 students massed on a 500-yard section of
street leading to Seoul's main railway station and tried to march
to the station, shouting, ``Let's go and meet brothers from the
North.''
   Police drove them back with tear gas, but the students regrouped
and clashed anew with police. Then groups of hundreds of students
lay on their backs in the street with arms linked. Others fled into
side streets. Police took away at least 100 students.
   At Korea University, about 3,000 students battled police with
rocks and firebombs, and police countered with tear gas, the Korean
news agency Yonhap reported.
   Several hundred students also rallied to back the northward
march plan at two other campuses in Seoul and one in the
southeastern port of Pusan, Yonhap said, but there were no
immediate reports of violence in those rallies.
   At Yonsei, black police armored vans with multiple tear gas
launchers fired thunderous barrages of the gas bombs into charging
students. Dense white clouds of the choking mist enveloped the
campus, but students kept on attacking.
   ``Drive out the Yankees who divide our fatherland,'' radical
leaders bellowed over loudspeakers as they urged the students to
attack again and again. ``Down with the military dictatorship,''
students shouted.
   Thousands of riot police had surrounded the sprawling campus
after the government banned the unification march as a threat to
national security. Vicious fighting erupted at the school Thursday
when students clashed with riot police trying to prevent them from
assembling.
   About 6,000 students kept an overnight vigil at the school to
prepare for the march.
   The students, joined by some dissident leaders, staged a rally
before marching Friday, but it appeared that their numbers had
fallen considerably from Thursday.
   Some of the 13 delegates chosen by the students for
reunification talks with North Korean counterparts attended the
rally, and rally organizers announced that two of their 13 already
were trying to make their way to the border truce site of Panmunjom.
   North Korean official media monitored in Tokyo have reported
that the North's representatives already have gone to the border
area.
   The government deployed 60,000 riot police and put security
forces on maximum alert to stop the march. Riot squads guarded key
locations throughout Seoul and roads leading to the border, 30
miles to the north.
   Yonhap reported that about 400 wounded and disabled military
veterans staged a demonstration on the south bank of the Imjin
River to denounce the students' march plan. The river, about seven
miles south of the North-South boundary, is the farthest north
South Korea allows civilians to go without a special pass.
   Scores of policemen and students were injured Thursday. Officers
with burns or blood pouring from cuts were dragged away by comrades
or slumped exhausted against walls. Student leaders said at least
five protesters were hurt seriously.
   Students took two captured officers away with their hands tied
and their fate was not known. Police made scores of arrests.
   Running clashes were reported Thursday in at least eight
provincial cities between police and students trying to reach the
capital for the march. More than 200 students were arrested in
Kwangju and street fights also took place in Suwon, Taeju, Taejon,
Mockpo, Chung, Iri and Kyongju.
   The protests were bitterly anti-American. Radical leaders blame
the United States for the peninsula's division in 1945, and several
violent anti-American protests have occurred in the past month.
   Radical students are a small but powerful minority on university
campuses and get no support from the most South Koreans who believe
North Korea wants to conquer the South. An invasion by the North in
1950 started the Korean war.
   Today is the first anniversary of the start of riots that forced
the government to agree to elections and reforms.
   During the Yonsei rally, radical leaders accused the United
States of ruling the South as a colony. They demanded immediate
reunification and expulsion of the 42,000 American soldiers
staioned in South Korea.
   No intergovernment unification talks are in progress and the
last contacts were in 1985. North Korea refused talks in 1986
because of U.S.-South Korean military exercises it said were a
preparation for war, and each side has rejected recent proposals
made by the other.
   Riot police guarded government buildings enclosed the U.S.
Embassy in a protective ring. The U.S. Army television station
cautioned Americans about trouble spots.

<HEAD>Records Say Colorado Man Allegedly Awaited Orders to Kill Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal court records show an informant told
authorities a Colorado man charged last month with threatening the
life of Jesse Jackson was awaiting orders to kill the Democratic
presidential candidate.
   The informant alleged in federal court records that Leland
Bowden, 33, has ``a strong hatred for blacks and Jews,'' and was
expecting the orders from a group called the Christian Patriots
Defense League.
   Bowden, a stockyard worker in La Junta, Colo., was arrested May
14 and charged with making a ``threat against a person protected by
the Secret Service.'' He was released two days later on $5,000
unsecured bond.
   The complaint against Bowden was sealed May 13 at the request of
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Mackey, who said he feared Bowden might
flee if the warrant against him were made public before he was
arrested.
   Mackey filed a motion to unseal the complaint June 2, and it was
made public this week.
   On Thursday, Bowden told The Pueblo Chieftain in a telephone
interview that his attorney, a federal public defender, advised him
against discussing the case.
   Asked about the Christian Patriots Defense League, Bowden told
the newspaper, ``I don't have any information about (it).''
   According to the U.S. Secret Service complaint, Bowden told one
witness ``it was biblically and personally right to kill persons
that were destroying America.''
   Bowden came under suspicion April 25 when an informant contacted
Police Detective John Spencer in La Junta about Bowden. The
informant was interviewed the next day by Secret Service Special
Agent Robert Hislop and Denver Police Detective Billy Carter.
   Hislop said Bowden told the informant he would kill Jackson. The
court file described the distance from which Bowden would shoot
Jackson.
   Secret Service and FBI agents placed Bowden under surveillance
on May 6. According to Hislop, the federal agents overheard him
saying he was waiting for orders to kill Jackson.
   ``Bowden stated that if he was ordered, he would blow up the
White House, but that he had not been told to do it,'' Hislop's
report said.
   It also said Bowden was prepared to plead insanity if he were
arrested for shooting Jackson.
   One witness, John O'Connor of the Sacramento, Calif., area, told
federal agents that Bowden discussed killing Jackson and Henry
Kissinger and appeared mentally unbalanced.
   O'Connor told the agents he had several conversations with
Bowden in La Junta in December and January.
   The complaint, in U.S. District Court in Denver, said Bowden
told O'Connor that Jackson, Kissinger and others ``were destroying
America and it was his duty to kill them in order to save the
country.''

   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee-apparent,
looked ahead to a ``tough and competitive'' race with George Bush
in November.
   Dukakis warned backers at a victory bash on Thursday night not
to get overconfident now that he has clinched the nomination. He
also told them to ignore polls indicating he has a lead over Bush.
   The Massachusetts governor promised to campaign aggressively,
but joked that a break from the campaign trail would be welcome
after the grueling primary campaign, which ended with four races on
Tuesday.
   ``My tomato plants need cultivating, my house needs work and I'd
love to have a day off,'' he said.
   Dukakis was devoting the day to Statehouse business today, and
had a meeting set with Azores President Mota B. Amaral. A day
earier, he met with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   The governor did not directly respond to remarks made about him
by Bush earlier Thursday. The vice president told Republicans in
Houston that Dukakis' views are ``out of the mainstream'' and
attacked his positions on a variety of issues.
   Dukakis said only: ``It's going to be a tough, competitive
race.''
   His spokesman, Leslie Dach, called Bush's remarks
``mudslinging,'' and added: ``It's clear that the vice president
doesn't think that his own record or vision can bring him the votes
he needs in November.''
   Thursday night's celebration raised nearly $500,000, said
campaign fund-raiser Robert Farmer. That money will go toward a $2
million fund campaign officials want to raise for post-primary
legal and administrative costs.
   The campaign already has raised the maximum $27.6 million
allowed to be spent during the primary season.
   Dukakis' campaign, meanwhile, continued its survey of potential
running mates, and worked on getting ready for July's Democratic
National Convention.
   The governor told backers Thursday night he was happy to have
his wife Kitty home again. Mrs. Dukakis, 51, was released from
Massachusetts General Hospital on Thursday, six days after
underdoing spinal surgery.
   ``You're looking at the luckiest guy on the face of the earth,''
Dukakis said.
   Next week, Dukakis will head to the South for three days of
campaigning. He is also expected to receive visits from several
members of Congress.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported in today's editions that one
endorsement Dukakis is likely to pick up during his swing South
would be from former rival Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   ``It's really just a matter of time before there is an
announcement by Senator Gore on what his plans are with respect to
an endorsement and possibly releasing delegates,'' Mike Kopp,
Gore's press secretary, told the newspaper.
   The newspaper quoted sources in both campaigns as saying they
are examining the logistics of an announcement in Tennessee next
Thursday, the first day of Dukakis' three-day swing through the
South.
   The governor was attending the Massachusetts Democratic
Convention on Saturday, and on Sunday he was to address the
nation's mayors at a national conference in Salt Lake City.

   U.S. sanctions designed to push Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega from power are hurting American companies in
Panama and could force some of them to close, businessmen say.
   American companies are caught between their obligations to
Panama and to the United States, which has ordered them not to pay
taxes to their host country.
   Under a complex, 52-page U.S. Treasury Department order, signed
in April by President Reagan as part of the economic sanctions
aimed at overthrowing Noriega, the companies face fines or
imprisonment if they pay taxes, services or duties to Panama. In
addition, they are prohibited from contributing to the Panamanian
Social Security Institute.
   ``They are shooting at the wrong target,'' said Federico Denton,
executive director of the Panamanian-American Chamber of Commerce,
in a recent interview.
   ``You could not even buy a Panamanian air mail stamp if you were
an American company operating here when this was first announced,''
said Denton, who added that some exceptions were made later when
U.S. companies protested.
   Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, heads the Panamanian Defense Forces and is the
power behind Panama's goverment.
   When President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire him in
February, Noriega had him ousted. Delvalle is now in hiding.
   There are more than 60 U.S. subsidiaries here with a total
investment in plant and inventory of more than $2 billion.
   ``The sanctions practically keep us from operating here,'' said
Carlos Rodriguez, manager of Colgate-Palmolive. ``It is a Catch-22
situation. We abide by U.S. law and we violate Panamanian law, or
vice versa.''
   The Panamanian government has been very flexible and has not
demanded payments or taken over any of the companies, company
managers say.
   ``The government does not want the U.S. companies to leave and
knows that it is not their fault,'' Rodriguez said.
   Denton said that to keep their employees covered under the
Panamanian Social Security system, some of the companies simply
hand over the money to the employee to pay into the system
directly. Others have expanded their own private medical plans for
the employees.
   Companies like Texaco had to collect a gasoline sales tax and
turn it over to the government every month. To avoid U.S. penalties
Texaco now does not collect the tax, but at the moment of purchase
the buyer separates the tax and hands it over directly to a
government collector.
   ``Now the government gets the tax money every day instead of
once a month,'' said a U.S. businessman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Meanwhile, tons of supplies stack up in Panamanian customs
because the companies cannot get them out without paying taxes.
   The companies also cannot repatriate dividends because they must
first pay taxes.
   ``We told them in Washington that they were hurting the wrong
people, that we would have to dismiss Panamanian workers, someone
there detached from reality told us that `there is a sacrifice
quota that must be paid,''' Rodriguez said.
   U.S. businessmen believe the measures are not going to overthrow
Noriega and his regime.
   ``But they are going to affect U.S. international
competitiveness,'' Rodriguez said. ``U.S. companies should not be
used as tools of U.S. policy.''
   Colgate-Palmolive has not dismissed any employees but has
reduced working hours by 50 percent.
   Danilo Gutierrez, sale manager for Alambres y Cables de Panama,
a subsidiary of Phelps-Dodge, said the company is about four weeks
away from using up all its inventory. It manufactures cable and
telephone wires for local markets and exports to the Caribbean
including Puerto Rico.
   ``Our sales to U.S. markets were also reduced considerably
becasue we were removed from the preferential treatment system,''
said Gutierrez.

<HEAD>Experts Say Cocaine Use Increasing In Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL CIRULLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe could be heading for a cocaine epidemic as
drug dealers search for new markets to replace dwindling demand in
the United States, experts at an international conference on drug
abuse said.
   Researchers at the four-day International Drug Abuse
Epidemiology Conference in Rome said Thursday there are signs that
cocaine use is increasing in Europe, especially among users of
heroin and amphetamines.
   Nicholas Kozel, an official with the U.S.-based National
Institute on Drug Abuse, a sponsor of the conference, said cocaine
traffickers have moved into Europe because use of the drug has
leveled off in the United States.
   The weak U.S. dollar has contributed to the spread because the
drug has become more affordable to Europeans, he said.
   ``The economic conditions really influence (the spread of drugs)
because the bottom line of drug trafficking is dollars and very big
dollars,'' Kozel said in an interview.
   Cocaine use in Europe is expected to follow patterns set in the
United States in the last three to five years, said Christopher
Luckett, secretary to the Pompidou Group, a France-based drug
research organization representing 19 European countries.
   ``We've learned that cocaine use booms, it peaks and then it
drops. And we know we have to go through this in Europe. The
question is how big is this boom going to be,'' Luckett said.
   Heroin currently is the most abused drug in Europe, followed by
amphetamines, he said.
   In the United States, a 1985 survey by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse showed that 22 million people over the age of 11 had
used cocaine at least once, Kozel said.
   More recent surveys show cocaine use is tapering off among the
general U.S. population because there is a growing awareness of the
drug's dangers, Kozel said. But cocaine use has spread into the
inner city areas as the drug has become more affordable, he said.

   The army today activated a special

against terrorist attacks.
   The Olympic support command was formally put into action in a
ceremony attended by generals and sports officials at a military
camp near the capital.
   Army Chief of Staff Park Hee-do said the army will provide
maximum support to ensure a successful Olympics by fully utilizing
its manpower, equipment and other resources.
   The support covers security against possible terrorist attack,
protection of athletes and team officials, transportation, and
manpower assistance for Games officials, the Seoul Olympic
Organizing Committee said. Committee officials said the army will
make available aircraft and other equipment, blankets, vehicles and
supplies worth a total of $28 million.
   The Yonhap News Agency said 9,000 officers and men will be
assigned to the special unit, led by a major general, during the
Games, to be held Sept 17-Oct. 2.
   Police also have formed an anti-terrorist command group to guard
against possible terrorist attacks, particularly from Communist
North Korea.

<HEAD>Japan Asks U.S. Navy to Move Night Practice Flights to Iwo Jima</HEAD>

   Japan has asked the U.S. Navy to move its night
practice landings from a densely populated area to the remote
island of Iwo Jima, site of one of the fiercest U.S.-Japanese
battles in World War II.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi said Thursday that
U.S. officials have not yet responded to a suggestion that they
move the practice flights from Atsugi Air Base in the Tokyo area to
Iwo Jima, about 750 miles to the south.
   Haraguchi said the Japanese government proposed the temporary
move to counter mounting complaints from Atsugi residents about
noise.
   In addition, strong opposition from citizens of Miyake Island,
selected by the government as the site of a new permanent night
landing strip, has slowed construction plans there.
   ``The Japanese government position is still the same regarding
Miyake,'' Haraguchi told reporters at a regular news briefing.
   Defense administration officials selected Miyake Island, 115
miles from Tokyo, as the most suitable site for a new night landing
airstrip for U.S. planes from the carrier Midway, based in Japan.
   But 85 percent of the island's 4,300 residents have signed
petitions against the planned air strip.
   Miyake village head Haruo Terasawa, elected in 1984 on an
anti-airstrip platform, welcomed the Iwo Jima proposal as ``one
fruitful outcome'' of the islanders' opposition movement.
   ``But we will not give up on our fight against a permanent air
strip here until the government completely abandons its plan,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   Setsuko Sakuraba, spokeswoman for the Defense Facilities
Administration Agency, said a temporary site was necessary
``because construction of the landing strip on Miyake will take a
long time due to the opposition movement.''
   The agency handles all construction projects designed to support
U.S. military needs in accordance with the U.S.-Japan Security
Treaty, implemented in 1952 and revised in 1960.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Haruguchi said Iwo Jima was only one
proposed landing site, but he did not name any other possible
locations.
   Tiny Iwo Jima was the site of a February 1945 battle that
claimed the lives of 6,800 Americans and 20,000 Japanese. The
United States maintained jurisdiction over the island from 1945
until 1968, when control passed over to Japan.
   Off-limits to ordinary tourists, it is now used only by the
Japanese Self Defense Forces as a practice ground.

   A promising vaccine to prevent
recurrence of melanoma is being tested in nationwide clinical
trials involving at least 200 patients suffering from the deadliest
form of skin cancer, its developer says.
   ``What it means is there is potential for some hope, and perhaps
we're going to be able to immunize a patient against potential
recurrence,'' said Marc Wallack, a cancer specialist and chairman
of general surgery of Mount Sinai Medical Center.
   Wallack on Thursday announced the beginning of the three-year
trial of the vaccine he has been testing for 15 years.
   Melanoma, which strikes about 27,000 Americans each year, is
easily treated by removing the tumor if the disease is discovered
before cancer cells spread. But death rates can climb as high as 70
percent if it spreads to lymph nodes.
   The disease resists traditional chemical and radiation
treatments, making it the hardest skin cancer to treat, said
Wallack.
   Cancer vaccines aren't a new idea, and vaccines for various
cancers are being studied around the nation. Like others, Wallack's
aims to prevent the disease from recurring by energizing the body's
immune system to seek out and destroy stray malignant cells that
may have broken off tumors.
   ``We specifically activate the immune system against the
patient's melanoma,'' said Wallack, who will oversee the trials
involving at least 200 patients whose tumors have been recently
removed and whose lymph nodes have been invaded.
   It will be a double-blind study, meaning neither doctors nor
patients will know who gets the vaccine and who gets a placebo.
   The trials are beginning at the University of Florida; Duke
University in Durham, N.C.; the M.D. Anderson cancer institute in
Houston; the University of Alabama; and Emory University in
Atlanta, Wallack said.
   The vaccine is created by infecting four types of melanoma cells
with smallpox vaccine viruses. Membranes from the infected cells
are injected into patients weekly for 13 weeks, then biweekly for
the rest of a year.
   Wallack believes the smallpox ``wakes up'' the immune system,
prompting it to act against the cancer.
   Wallack plans to compare in follow-ups the cancer recurrence and
survival rates of the two groups of patients. He hopes to repeat
the results of early experiments, which helped at least 15 percent
of smaller numbers of patients.
   ``Surgery is very important to remove the primary lesion, and
also any (lymph) nodes that are positive. After this, that's when
this approach, specific immunotherapy, comes into play,'' he said.
   A different type of melanoma vaccine is being developed by Dr.
Philip Livingston of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
   ``I'm not saying one is better than the other, but it's a
different approach,'' said Livingston, whose work uses purified
chemicals taken from cancer cells.
   Researchers wonder if extracts from the melanoma cells used in
Wallack's study will trigger immune systems for the dozens of types
of melanoma, Livingston said.
   ``It's a little bit of a shot in the dark in that regard,'' he
said.
   Wallack said the four cell types he's using should prove
effective on all melanomas.
   Skin cancers are diagnosed in about 500,000 Americans each year
and are readily cured by surgical removal, except for advanced
melanoma, recent American Cancer Society figures show. Of about
7,800 annual skin cancer deaths, 5,800 were melanoma victims.

   A drifter who admitted cooking and
eating part of a human corpse has been charged with murder, police
said today.
   David William Phillip, 31, was accused of killing Kyung Bup Lee,
a 44-year-old Korean transient, police said.
   Senior Constable Fran Barclay said Phillip admitted eating
portions of Lee's thigh after cooking it in a wok. She said the
suspect, charged Thursday, killed Kyung and later burned him at an
empty warehouse last month.
   Magistrate Robert Tuppen refused to set bail at a hearing today.
He noted the suspect was already facing two separate counts of
attempted murder.

   George Bush engaged ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' anchor
Ted Koppel in a combative debate for an hour, but the vice
president's mind kept wandering back to the memorable 9-minute
faceoff last January with CBS' Dan Rather.
   On several occasions during Thursday night's ``Nightline''
interview, Bush called Koppel ``Dan,'' and Koppel kept reminding
Bush that his name is ``Ted.''
   Koppel spent several minutes of the interview program grilling
Bush on the vice president's knowledge of the clandestine sales of
U.S. arms to Iran _ as Rather had done in the Jan. 25 interview on
``CBS Evening News.''
   And after saying at one point that he had no regrets about that
stormy CBS encounter, Bush aggressively challenged Koppel's line of
questioning, telling the ABC anchor at one point that ``there's a
fatal flaw in your analysis'' of the impact of the Iran-Contra
affair on his presidential prospects.
   Koppel opened with sharp questioning of Bush's knowledge of the
alleged drug dealings of Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, and then challenged Bush's statement that it wasn't until
December 1986 that he knew the full details of the
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   After Koppel's ``Nightline'' producers showed a clip from the
Bush-Rather interview, the vice president told the ABC anchor:
``And yes, things went wrong, Dan. I'll take the credit for that if
... ''
   ``No, Dan's the other fellow,'' Koppel retorted.
   The ABC anchor was in Washington, interviewing Bush live via
satellite at affiliate KTRK here.
   Bush said at one point that it was only when he was
``debriefed'' by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., a ranking member
of the Intelligence Committee, that he became fully aware of the
arms-for-hostages connection in December 1986, a month after the
story became public.
   Koppel then interrogated Bush about a meeting the vice president
had in July 1986 in Israel with Amiram Nir, a counterterrorism
adviser to then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Koppel cited a memo
written by Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller indicating that Nir had
told the vice president the nature of the arms-to-Iran connection.
   ``I didn't say that I never knew anything about this,'' Bush
said.
   Said Koppel: ``I rarely keep notes for questions, but I thought
I might have to today.''
   ``When you were talking to Dan,'' Koppel said, ``you were
saying, `Sure, we did it to get (CIA station chief William) Buckley
out (of Lebanon).' ''
   ``You want to start back over it with the rationale of why we
didn't think it was arms for hostages?'' Bush asked.
   ``No, I understand the rationale,'' Koppel replied.
   ``But you just don't like my answer,'' the vice president
snapped.
   ``No, what I'm saying is I find your answer ... inconsistent ...
,'' Koppel said.
   ``Well, that's your opinion,'' Bush said. ``You ask the
questions but you don't like the answer. What do you want me to
say?''
   When Bush addressed Koppel again by the name ``Dan'' a few
moments later, the ABC anchor said: ``I'll tell you what. If you
stop calling me Dan, try calling me Peter or Tom or ... .''
   ``Did I do it again,'' Bush asked. ``Hey, listen, it's Freudian.
I am not trying to be clever. I promise you it's Freudian.''
   As they were wrapping up the show, Bush said to Koppel: ``Ted, I
apologize for calling you Dan. I wasn't being smart. I can't see
you. I'm in Houston, Texas, and I was not trying to be
provocative.''
   ``Not at all,'' responded Koppel,``and I didn't take it that
way.''
   ``Next time, call me Barbara.''

   Arthur Gary Bishop was put to
death by injection early Friday for the sex-related murders of five
boys, an execution he sought hoping to bring peace to his victims'
families.
   ``There was nothing unusual. He went peacefully to the execution
chamber,'' Myron March, Department of Corrections director of field
operations, said after Bishop was pronounced dead at 12:16 a.m. He
said a statement from Bishop would be released later.
   Bishop, 36, was the 99th person to be executed in this country
and the third in Utah since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ended
a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment and convicted killer
Gary Gilmore, demanding death, was executed by a Utah firing squad
in early 1977.
   In the hours before three drugs in succession _ sodium
pentothal, the muscle relaxant Pavulon and potassium chloride _
were dripped by IV into his right arm, Bishop was low-key and
contemplative.
   ``It's unbelievable how calm and cool he is. Even the guards
can't understand it,'' said Mormon Bishop Heber Geurts, a volunteer
chaplain at Utah State Prison who counseled Bishop in his final
days. ``I've dealt with thousands of inmates in 33 years, and he's
the most sorrowful and repentent and remorseful man I've ever dealt
with.''
   An excommunicated Mormon, Eagle Scout and bookkeeper, Bishop
spent Thursday in a 10-by-15 holding cell in the prison's
maximum-security section. His only reading materials were three
issues of ``Ensign'' magazine, a publication of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   Because Bishop shunned further appeals, civil rights groups did
not plan to intervene to try to halt the execution.
   Prison chaplain Jay Lowe said Bishop, during a Thursday
afternoon visit, said he felt at peace and was not afraid to die.
   Prison psychologist Al Carlisle said Bishop was a man with
religious feelings who read the Book of Mormon 10 times during his
fours year in prison and used television earphones to block out
inmates' swearing, but is afraid that if he were to go back on the
streets, ``his old impulses would come back.''
   ``I've seen remorse in him from the beginning,'' Carlisle told a
news conference. Bishop ``believes he will be going into the spirit
world, that it will be more peaceful than here. He doesn't believe
he's been forgiven. ...
   ``He believes he can continue to work on the other side on these
problems.''
   Bishop saw his parents for the last time on Tuesday, and prison
officials suspended their usual no-contact policy, removing
Bishop's handcuffs so he could embrace them.
   ``It was a good visit; sorrowful. They hugged each other,''
Geurts said.
   Geurts said Bishop generally was in good spirits Wednesday, but
wept when they prayed together following a long discussion of
spiritual matters.
   Geurts was one of three people Bishop asked to witness the
execution, along with L. Kay Gillespie, a Weber State College
professor studying the death penalty in Utah, and Kathy Luck,
Bishop's biographer.
   Bishop was convicted in 1984 of the murders of Alonzo Daniels,
4; Kim Peterson, 11; Danny Davis, 4; Troy Ward, 6; and Graeme
Cunningham, 13.
   Bishop fired his attorneys in February and said he wanted to die
after the Utah Supreme Court rejected his initial appeal.
   Bishop murdered his first victim, Daniels, on Oct. 16, 1979.
Bishop lured the boy into his apartment with an offer of candy.
When Bishop tried to fondle the boy, the child cried and threatened
to tell his mother.
   Panicking, Bishop struck Daniels on the head with a hammer. The
boy fell to the floor crying, and Bishop drowned him in the
bathtub. He carried the body out in a box past a woman, apparently
the boy's mother, who was frantically calling his name.
   In the months that followed, he relived the experience by
killing 15 or 20 puppies the same way he killed four of his five
victims.
   ``It was so stimulating,'' he said. ``A puppy whines just like
Alonzo did. I would get frustrated at the whining. I would hit them
with hammers or drown them or strangle them.''
   In Utah's last execution, Pierre Dale Selby was executed by
injection last August for the 1974 torture-murders of three people.
People on death row in Utah choose between lethal injection and
firing squad.

<HEAD>Remains Of 22 U.S. Soldiers From War Of 1812 To Get Honorable
Burial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of 22 soldiers who fought and died
during the War of 1812 are coming home to America for an honorable
burial.
   Researchers who studied 36 skeletons unearthed at a battle site
on the Canadian side of the Niagara River said Thursday they know
what food the men ate, some of their daily hardships and the way
they died, but not their names.
   ``I never expected to be able to identify the bodies,'' said Lt.
Col. Joseph Whitehorne, a historian with the U.S. Army.
   He said army records of the day were used mostly for tracking
deserters by making notes of hair color and scars.
   Whitehorne is part of a 40-member team of archeologists and
historians from the United States and Canada who studied the
remains and compiled a report on their findings.
   A study of the bones revealed that hardships the soldiers faced
led to premature arthritis in men as young as 20.
   Their legs showed fatigue fractures from carrying heavy packs
over hundreds of miles. In most of the skeletons, as many as seven
discs in each spine were collapsed from physical labor.
   Seven of the skeletons showed signs of amputations before the
soldiers died. One 17-year-old youth had both arms amputated below
the elbow.
   Insignia on shirt buttons, the only clue to nationality,
identified 22 of the skeletons as those of American soldiers. Their
remains will be buried June 30 at Bath National Cemetery in New
York state with full military honors.
   Six more of the skeltons are suspected to be slain American
soldiers. The others will be studied further at the University of
Tennessee.
   The skeletons were found last fall at Snake Hill, a strategic
mound of earth on the Canadian side of the Niagara River where
occupying U.S. forces established a battery and a field hospital in
1814 in their war against Britain. The site overlooks Buffalo, N.Y.

   Western hotels heightened security today and
children were told not to talk to strangers because of a warning
from the U.S. Embassy that Americans may become targets of
terrorist attacks.
   ``We are on the alert for all unusual occurrences and have added
a few more people to our security staff,'' said Max Wilhelm,
manager of the Sheraton Great Wall Hotel. ``But it's hard to say
where to look and what to look for.''
   The embassy sent out an ``urgent notice to American citizens''
Thursday, saying Chinese authorities told the embassy ``nationals
of a third country may be planning a terrorist attack on Americans
in Beijing.''
   Embassy officials in Beijing said the Chinese reported there was
Middle East involvement, but provided no details. They said
high-level Chinese public security officers informed the embassy of
the threat on Wednesday.
   There are approximately 1,500 American businessmen, diplomats,
students, teachers and their families in Beijing.
   Scott Chambers, principal of the International School of
Beijing, said the school blocked off the road leading to the school
building, locked the back doors and notified security officers to
increase their vigilance.
   ``Our security perimeter is pretty vulnerable,'' he said.
   Chambers said children were told of the warning at a morning
assembly and that teachers will stress to their students not to
talk to strangers.
   ``We're trying to keep it below the panic stage. It's a fine
line,'' he said. The school is supported by the governments of the
United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
   Embassy officials said they were taking ordinary precautions and
few signs emerged of an increase in already tight security around
embassy buildings.
   Solitary Chinese guards continued to man posts outside the
buildings, and, as usual, young Chinese hoping to receive a visa to
go to the United States milled around the outside of the consular
affairs building.
   The embassy on Thursday circulated to staff members and some
American business people a 15-point list of security tips. It
advised people to vary their activities and travel routes, avoid
wearing clothes and carrying bags which identify one as an
American, and stay away from restaurants and bars which are popular
hangouts for Americans.
   ``Don't be embarrassed or afraid to seek help if you note
unusual activity or believe you are being followed,'' it said.
   It urged people to be alert and ``don't daydream while traveling
to and from work.''
   The notice sent out to American residents said, ``The embassy
believes that this warning reflects a genuine threat and that
American citizens in the Beijing area should take appropriate steps
to protect themselves.''
   It recommended that people steer clear of popular gathering
points and asked that suspicious activity be reported to the
embassy immediately.
   The notice also went to Americans in the port city of Tianjin,
60 miles to the southeast.
   Embassy spokeswoman Sylvia Rifkin said the U.S. Mission in
Beijing sent out warnings before to Americans based on worldwide
alerts against terrorists, but this was the first time the warning
specifically concerned China.
   No past incidents have arisen of terrorist attacks in China
against Chinese or foreign residents. China also has good relations
with Mideast nations which have been accused of fostering terrorist
activities.
   China deals harshly with Chinese caught stealing or committing
other crimes against foreigners, and foreigners in Beijing and
other cities generally have little concern over their personal
safety.
   ``I'm bewildered like everyone else,'' said an American lawyer
when asked how she planned to respond to the terrorist threat.

<TEXT>
   A media watchdog group says Mighty Mouse
is teaching the nation's children to sniff cocaine, but CBS says
such accusations against its longtime cartoon hero are ridiculous.
   ``Mighty Mouse is down in the dumps and he reaches in his cape,
pulls out a substance and sniffs it through his nostrils, and from
that point on in the cartoon he is his normal self,'' said The Rev.
Donald Wildmon, who heads the Tupelo-based American Family
Association.
   Wildmon claimed Thursday that Mighty Mouse used cocaine during
the cartoon's April 23 episode. CBS and the cartoon's producer,
Ralph Bakshi, says that's hogwash.
   The whole affair ``smacks of burning books and the Third Reich.
It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm not going to get into who sniffs
what,'' Bakshi said. ``This is lunacy.''
   Wildmon's organization has sponsored boycotts and other
activities against businesses that sponsor what it sees as too much
sex and violence on television and in magazines.
   Wildmon is seeking the resignations of Bakshi, an animator best
known for the risque ```Fritz the Cat'' cartoons in the 1970s, and
Judy Parker, CBS television's vice president for children's
programming. He said they attempted to cover up what was aired on
April 23.
   ``Mr. Bakshi told reporters from Detroit, after calling me all
kinds of names, that Mighty Mouse was sniffing crushed flowers,''
he said.
   ``We had a state narcotics officer and a university professor,
both experts, to view the scene in question and they were convinced
it was cocaine,'' Wildmon said.
   CBS on Thursday released a two-page letter to Wildmon from
George Dessard, the network's vice president of program practices,
in which he accused the Methodist minister of taking ``three
seconds of air time ... out of context and made (it) the subject of
a fanciful and irresponsible misrepresentation.''
   Dessard said the substance was clearly crushed flowers. He said
that in the episode in question, ``The Littlest Tramp,'' the
principal story line revolves around Mighty Mouse's efforts to
assist Polly, ``a poor but industrious flower seller.''
   In the cartoon, the villain repeatedly destroys Polly's flowers
and she is forced to make substitute flowers using fallen leaves,
strawberries and ``even wedges of over-ripened tomatoes.''
   He said Mighty Mouse is shown collecting and saving the fake
flowers and ``later, when a speaker at a service-oriented lodge
meeting of ants talks of wanting to help `those less fortunate,'
Mighty Mouse announces that phrase reminds him of `someone else'
and pulls out a pink mass of crushed stems, tomatoes and flowers,
which he holds out as if to show them.
   ``We see the aroma reach his nose in typical cartoon fashion as
the scene changes to another story event,'' Dessard said. ``There
is no `powder.' He is neither shown to be nor described as
`rejected or down in the dumps' before he brings out the remains of
the flowers.''

   Rival Palestinian guerrilla factions
battled each other with howitzers and mortars in two Beirut refugee
camps today, leaving three dead and 15 wounded, police said.
   Police said the fighting in the Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh
camps was between Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction and the dissident
Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising, led by Col. Saeed Mousa.
   The casualties raised the known toll from two days of fighting
to five killed and 25 wounded.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed across Beirut until a
security committee called a cease-fire at 7 a.m., a police
spokesman said.
   The cease-fire, the second in as many days, was ``generally
holding,'' the spokesman said. He cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   Mousa broke with Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in
1983 and established headquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   The two factions have repeatedly clashed in recent weeks in the
Beirut camps despite moves by Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
Assad to end a five-year feud.
   Scores of people, many of them civilians, have been killed.

   Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard likes his chances of
getting undivided attention when he speaks to a high school
graduating class tonight.
   The senior class at the school, in the town of Put-In-Bay on
South Bass Island in Lake Erie, consists of one student:
18-year-old Jay Faris, the son of school Superintendent Kelly Faris.
   Young Faris had some say in the choice of a speaker, and
requested someone who is ``a political personality and well-known.''
   Leonard quipped Thursday that as lieutenant governor, a
traditionally obscure post, ``at least I meet one of his two
criteria. I am honored.''
   The school, which has 80 students, also serves Middle and North
Bass Islands, and some of the students come to class by boat and
airplane.
   The commencement is traditionally held at Perry's Victory and
International Peace Memorial on South Bass Island, five miles from
the U.S.-Canadian border that divides the lake.
   ``Never have I had the opportunity to impart so much wisdom to
so few people. But at least this way I may have the undivided
attention of my audience,'' the Democratic lieutenant governor said.

   Temperamental movie stars can generally
be placated with flattery, money or special treatment, but when
parts of their bodies fall off, there isn't much a director can do.
   That's the lesson learned by the cast and crew of ``Ernest Saves
Christmas,'' starring Jim Varney in his familiar role as Ernest P.
``Know whut ah mean'' Worrell.
   The filmmakers were given an impromptu vacation when a herd of
reindeer, featured in the movie's climactic scene, suddenly shed
their antlers en masse.
   ``There was nothing you could do about it,'' writer and unit
director Coke Sams said as the film's final scenes were being shot
this week at Berry Field.
   ``You couldn't yell at them. You couldn't offer them more money.
They had molted,'' he said.
   The deer, provided by Steve Martin's Working Wildlife in Los
Angeles, were flown in from California and Oregon up to six weeks
ago to appear in the Emshell Producers Group Inc. motion picture.
   The deer sported lovely antlers right up until the moment their
cue was called.
   ``We talked about prosthetic antlers,'' Sams said. ``The problem
is when the antlers fall off, there are these little bloody stumps
they're real touchy about.''
   Styrofoam antlers were made for silhouette shots, but didn't
work for scenes in which the reindeers were to pull a sleigh
through the sky.
   The only alternative was to put the deer out to pasture _ along
with everybody else _ until the problem solved itself.
   ``They grew their little horns back,'' Varney said as the
animals trotted out this week in full regalia at last.
   ``It's a stupid business,'' Sams said with a shrug.

   Likely Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis is planning a meeting with Florida Attorney General
Bob Butterworth and about a half-dozen state and federal officials
next week in Boston to discuss ways to battle the nation's drug
problems.
   Dukakis, who already has won enough delegates to capture his
party's nomination during first-round convention balloting, is
calling on Butterworth for advice partly because of his early
campaign support and because Florida is the top port for the
nation's illegal drug imports.
   ``The only way we're going to resolve this drug problem is for
the federal government to work with the state government and local
officials. Having been a sheriff, I can say ... the federal
government has never been known for its efforts to work with local
officials,'' said Butterworth.
   Also planning to attend the policymaking sessions from Florida
are Rep. Larry Smith, D-Hollywood, and Janet Reno, chief prosecutor
in the state's drug-ridden Dade County. Reps. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.; Glenn English, D-Okla.; Thomas Foley, D-Wash.; and Sen.
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. also are expected to attend.

   Virginia Republicans will end their search for a
U.S. Senate candidate this weekend, but a breakfast fund-raiser on
Saturday may draw more interest than the state GOP Convention
itself.
   Delegates to the convention, which opens later today, have a
three-way choice to replace Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr., who surprised
party leaders last fall when he said he would not seek a second
term.
   Vying for the Senate nomination are Andrew F. Wahlquist, a

   Wahlquist is believed to be favored by most rank-and-file

   About 10,500 people have lost their MasterCard
and Visa privileges nationwide because of complaints the company
that issued the cards was not reimbursing merchants even though
cardholders paid their bills, a published report says.
   The cards were issued by MoneyCard Systems Inc., which markets
credit cards for people with poor credit ratings, The Washington
Post reported in today's editions.
   VISA USA Inc. canceled privileges for 2,500 card holders and
MasterCard International Inc. canceled privileges for about 8,000
card holders, the organizations told the Post.
   Banking officials in Maryland and Washington reported they had
been inundated with complaints from consumers and state banking
officials who said companies that accepted payment via the credit
cards were not being paid even though card holders had been paying
their bills.
   Universal Bank of Lanham, Md., issued the cards for MoneyCard,
but officials said they had no reason to believe Universal was
aware of any wrongdoing.
   Edward Irons, District of Columbia superintendent of banks, said
holders of the cards had been required to post security deposits of
$300 or more to obtain charging privileges, but merchants in many
cases were not paid for merchandise charged with the cards.
   Irons said he was referring the situation to the Justice
Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Interstate
Commerce Commission.
   Regulators said they had been unable to reach anyone at
MoneyCard, which had a recording on its telephone.

<TEXT>
   Religious and conservative groups organized
a rally today at the Dayton Daily News to protest the firing of its
publisher over his rejection of advertisements by two homosexual
groups.
   Dennis Shere, 47, was fired Wednesday by David Easterly,
president of Cox Newspapers, after Shere said his religious beliefs
did not allow him to compromise on the matter. Atlanta-based Cox
owns Dayton Newspapers Inc., publisher of the paper.
   ``I really think that it's a sad day,'' said the Rev. Paul
Dixon, president of Cedarville College, a nearby Baptist school
that helped organize the protest set for this afternoon.
   ``I don't think that this is as liberal a community as they
perceive,'' Dixon said. ``We have strong concerns for family, for
morality, for Biblical values, and I think they're going to begin
to see that.''
   The college staff was rounding up signatures for a full-page
advertisement backing Shere to be published in Sunday's Daily News,
he said.
   The new publisher, J. Bradford Tillson, said the newspaper on
Thursday accepted a classified advertisement from one of the
homosexual groups, The Dayton Lesbian and Gay Center. He said he
was unsure when the ad would appear.
   Leon Bey, program chairman for the center, said the ad reads:
``Summer '88 program guide for the Dayton Lesbian and Gay Center
available now. Write (box number).''
   ``It's not the same ad ... but it is an ad with the `g' and `l'
words,'' Bey said.
   Bey said he was mystified by Shere's position because the
newspaper had accepted a similar program guide ad in the fall of
1986. Shere had been publisher since 1984.
   Shere rejected ads for a health lecture series sponsored by The
Dayton Lesbian and Gay Center and for a gay-rights group, Serenity
Inc., said James McCarthy, Serenity's executive director.
   McCarthy, who led two days of recent picketing at the newspaper
protesting rejection of the ads, said he was shocked at the firing.
Serenity wanted to meet with the publisher to explain its position,
but Shere refused, McCarthy said.
   ``I would support any effort to get Mr. Shere's job back if once
he came back we would have access to the paper,'' McCarthy said.
   Shere said in a statement that he had tried ``to be obedient to
God, my Christian convictions and my belief that to publish these
ads is not in the bests interests of this newspaper or community.''
   He said homosexuality ``is responsible for helping to spread a
virus considered by many to be a virtual plague,'' an apparent
reference to AIDS. He called it ``tantamount to moral suicide.''
   Easterly said Shere was given several chances to resign but
refused. ``Personal feelings, religious or otherwise, cannot be
allowed to override our obligation to treat people fairly,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Ellis Island Computer to Record 17 Million Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the help of a new computer, millions of
Americans will be able to ``learn for the first time how they
became Americans,'' says the president of the Ellis Island
Restoration Commission.
   ``Never before has such an extensive pool of genealogical
information been so readily available to the public,'' Philip Lax
said as he launched a new computerized family history center
project on Thursday.
   By using a simplified computer for 10 to 12 minutes, visitors to
Ellis Island will be able to glean information from original ship
manifests: where relatives came from, how old they were, who
traveled with them, where they were going and what possessions they
carried.
   A special program is being developed to track immigrants whose
names were changed or spelled phonetically by immigration officials.
   ``It's like Plymouth Rock. It marks the entrance between the old
and new worlds,'' said Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``It will bring a living
use and an ongoing use.''
   The officials estimated that 100 million Americans whose
relatives passed through Ellis Island on their way to the New World
will be able to trace their roots through the computer.
   The plan is to feed 5 million names a year into the computer,
for a total of 17 million, said Lax. The goal is to open the Ellis
Island Family History Center during the monument's June 1992
centennial. The island's renovated Great Hall is to reopen in the
fall of 1989.
   On hand to help launch the project were 105-year-old Mary Kelly
Stevenson of Manchester, Conn., the oldest living American to
immigrate through Ellis Island, and Margaret O'Connell Middleton,
72, of Tucson, Ariz., whose mother, Annie Moore of Cork County,
Ireland, was the first immigrant processed there.
   ``I always loved America,'' said Mrs. Stevenson, whose
sprightliness earned gasps of appreciation from the crowd. She
passed through Ellis Island from Belfast, Ireland, in 1920.
   Mrs. Middleton presented a $10 bill to the commission,
symbolizing the $10 gold piece her mother _ then 15 years old _
received on Jan. 1, 1893, to commemorate the opening of Ellis
Island.
   ``You gave my mother $10. So this will help you,'' said Mrs.
Middleton. The gift marked the beginning of a $25 million
fund-raising campaign to finance the family history center.

   Australia's first confirmed case of rabies in man
or animal most likely came into the country from Asia, according to
U.S. health officials.
   The death of a 10-year-old Australian boy was confirmed last
November as rabies, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
Thursday. It was the first laboratory-confirmed case of rabies ever
reported from Australia.
   The patient had been scratched by a neighbor's dog two months
before becoming sick, the Atlanta-based CDC said, but the animal
showed no signs of rabies when tested last December.
   However, the child had been bitten on the finger by a wild
monkey at a marketplace in India 16 months before becoming ill, the
CDC said.
   ``All available data indicate that this was an imported case,''
the CDC said, adding that the patient might also have received
other animal bites while traveling in Asia.
   Australia is considered rabies-free; animals there are not
vaccinated, and those that bite people are not quarantined. If the
fatal disease were to become endemic in Australia, the CDC said,
about 38,000 people a year there might have to undergo
post-exposure preventive treatment, and millions of dollars would
have to be spent on vaccine and quarantine programs.
   A limited survey of bats in Queensland, Australia, is now under
way to check for any signs of rabies.

   A Bulgarian helped two Soviet cosmonauts guide
their capsule toward a docking with the Soviet space station Mir
and prepared for the busiest program of experiments of any Soviet
space flight involving a foreigner.
   Alexander Alexandrov, a 36-year-old cosmonaut from the Bulgarian
town of Omurtag, will help the Soviets perform more than 40
medical, metallurgical, astronomical and geological studies on Mir,
Russian for ``peace.''
   Today's schedule calls for the crew to conduct vision
experiments in the weightlessness of space, activate a
Bulgarian-made device to study the stars and other distant objects,
try mixing metals and look for natural resources in Bulgaria.
   Live black-and-white video broadcast on state-run Soviet and
Bulgarian television Thursday showed the Mir complex _ with its
three solar battery panels shaped like an upside-down letter ``T''
_ getting bigger and bigger as the Soyuz TM-5 capsule approached.
Docking occurred shortly before 8 p.m.
   About 90 minutes later, Soviet television broke into its evening
news program ``Vremya'' for a live color broadcast showing
Alexandrov, wearing a dark blue flight suit, aboard Mir with four
Soviet cosmonauts.
   Among those shown applauding the docking at the Soviet Mission
Control Center in Kaliningrad, northeast of Moscow, was Georgy
Ivanov, a Bulgarian who along with a Soviet cosmonaut failed in
April 1979 to link a Soyuz-33 capsule with the Soviet space station
Salyut-6.
   Alexandrov was the backup Bulgarian cosmonaut for the 1979
mission, and began training last year for the current mission which
is scheduled to end June 17. He and Soviet cosmonauts Viktor P.
Savinykh and Anatoly Y. Solovyov blasted off Tuesday from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia.
   Aboard Mir, the three are guests of Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir
Titov and Musa Manarov, who boarded the space station Dec. 23.
   If the cosmonauts have any spare time, Mission Control's
planning director Boris A. Sirotkin told reporters, they can listen
to music tapes, watch movies on videotape or read books and
newspapers.
   The 1979 docking failed because a maneuvering engine aboard the
Soyuz-33 malfunctioned. The docking was aborted.
   The Soviet labor newspaper, Trud, said Wednesday that the
cosmonauts aboard the capsule ``could have become prisoners in
orbit'' because the same engine would have to be used to return to
Earth. A backup engine also didn't work properly, but it was able
to return the cosmonauts safely.
   Soviet reports on the current mission have emphasized that the
Soyuz capsule's propulsion systems have been improved since the
1979 failure.
   Two other Soviet space missions with foreigners are planned
later this year, with astronauts from France and Afghanistan.
   The Mir station has been aloft since February 1986. It is the
base to which several scientific modules, supply craft and
cosmonaut transport craft have been attached. Soviet officials say
it will be manned permanently.

<HEAD>Stallone Denied Permission To Enter East Berlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armies of communists couldn't stop Sylvester
Stallone's movie character Rambo from rampaging through Vietnam and
Afghanistan, but it took only a few border guards to keep Stallone
himself from entering East Berlin.
   ``I was just going there to look at a museum, and they look at
me like the enemy,'' Stallone's publicist, John Bloch, quoted him
as saying after the actor was refused entry Thursday.
   Communist border guards gave no explanation for refusing entry
to Stallone, said his spokeswoman, Ana Weinert.
   ``(President) Reagan called them the `evil empire' yet they let
him in. I told it the way it is in movies. So much for glasnost,''
Stallone was quoted as saying in reference to the Soviet policy of
openness.
   Stallone, in West Berlin to promote his new movie, ``Rambo
III,'' wanted to tour the Pergamon Musuem in East Berlin.
   The latest installment of Stallone's Rambo series pits his hero
against Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
   Earlier Thursday, the 43-year-old film star arrived at the
Berlin Wall Haus am Checkpoint Charlie museum just as West Berlin
resident Johannes Georg Ehret and his East German girlfriend were
demonstrating how he smuggled her out of East Berlin on May 27.
   Ehret, 35, said he had met Liane Suendermann, a 22-year-old East
Berlin nurse, through broadcasts on an illegal private radio
station.
   He explained how he drove regularly to East Berlin and
eventually hatched the plan to smuggle Ms. Suenderman out in his
car.
   After the re-enactment of the escape, Stallone paused to have
his picture taken with Ms. Suendermann and said: ``It just goes to
show how important human rights are, and what people will go
through to be free.''

   Education Secretary William J. Bennett and
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III have sent a proposal to
Congress that would give low- and moderate-income families tax-free
interest on savings bonds used to pay for college.
   Under the proposed bill, entitled the College Savings Bond Act
of 1988, interest earned on the bonds would be tax-exempt for
families with adjusted gross incomes under $60,000 if the money was
used to pay for college tuition or related expenses by the
bondholder, spouse, child or dependent.
   The tax benefit would be reduced for families earning between
$60,000 and $80,000, and eliminated entirely for households with
incomes above $80,000.

to a Justice Department report.
   The study, released Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
also found it costs an average of $118,200 a year to protect each
of the 5,200 people who face possible reprisals when they testify
for the government in major criminal cases and $35,500 to conduct a
state or federal wiretap.
   Some $46 billion in federal, state and local taxes was spent on
both the criminal and civil justice system in the United States in
1985, the report said, reiterating a figure published in an earlier
study.

   About 40 patients were hurriedly
evacuated from their rooms when a fire damaged a second-floor room
and spread smoke into two floors of the 12-story Santa Rosa
Hospital, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported, and officials said the patients would
be returned to their rooms after the smoke cleared.
   It took more than 80 firefighters about 20 to 25 minutes to
bring the fire at the downtown hospital under control Thursday
night, but smoke and water damage appeared extensive, officials
said.
   ``I didn't panic till I smelled smoke,'' said one patient,
Carmen Velasco. ``Then I started to run. I had to carry my own IV
unit. One of the firemen stepped on it.''
   The cause of the blaze was not immediately determined and arson
investigators were called to the scene early today. Santa Rosa
Health Care Corp. Chief Executive Officer Michael White said no
damage estimate was available.

<HEAD>Proposal Rejected to Ban Sex With Foreigners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law Ministry officials have rejected a
proposal to ban sex with foreigners to fight the spread of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, news reports said today.
   The move would have imposed a three-month jail sentence and an
unspecified fine on Indians caught having sex with foreigners. The
proposal by the Indian Council for Medical Research was made public
earlier this week.
   All but one of the 12 deaths from AIDS in India occurred in
people who contracted the disease abroad, the council said.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact.
   The Indian Express newspaper said the proposal raised the
specter of a ``police peeping squad'' to bring culprits from the
bedroom to the jailhouse.
   The proposal itself included no details of how it would be
enforced.
   Despite the rejection, Dr. S.P. Tripathi, director-general of
the council, told the Indian Express newspaper that the issue would
be raised in Parliament next year after a national debate.
   Tripathi said he would like legislation to include mandatory
testing of all people arriving in India from abroad, including
returning nationals.
   ``They (tourists) can see our land, parks, temples, etc. But
what is the need to mix with our people?'' The Indian Express
quoted Tripathi as saying. ``They can come and go without hurting
us.''

   The Guardian Angels have begun patrolling chic
Restaurant Row in Manhattan's theater district, where restaurateurs
blame the crack trade and inadequate police protection for a drop
in business.
   The 30 Guardian Angels, unarmed teen-age volunteers who patrol
neighborhoods and subways, were given a closed French restaurant to
use as their headquarters and promises of meals from 15 fashionable
cafes on West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth avenues.
   ``They're not even fully operational yet, but you can feel the
difference,'' Joe Allen, owner of a restaurant bearing his name,
said recently. ``People are smiling again, old people are coming
out of their homes without feeling in danger and tourists can cross
Eighth Avenue without fear.''
   Eighth Avenue has a history of drug dealing and prostitution,
but the arrival of crack has ``altered everything, making the
problem much more pervasive and dangerous,'' Allen said.
   Some restaurant owners estimated business had dropped off 20
percent in recent months.
   Restaurateurs said the police presence has dropped as crime has
risen.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Edward Burns said there had been a
decrease in the number of officers at the precinct in the past six
months, as there had in all precincts.
   However, Burns said, in the three-block area around Restaurant
Row, police made 600 arrests last year and 600 already this year,
the highest figures for any section of the city.
   Since their founding in 1979, the Guardian Angels have expanded
into a nationwide group, drawing both strong praise and criticism
from local officials.

<TEXT>
   A senior Soviet diplomat once expelled from
Egypt by presidential order arrived in Cairo today as a special
envoy from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The three-day visit by Vladimir Polyakov, director of the
Foreign Ministry's Near East and North Africa Department, reflected
greatly improved Cairo-Moscow relations since President Hosni
Mubarak took office in 1981.
   Polyakov told reporters on arrival that he had been assigned by
Gorbachev ``to convey to President Mubarak details of the results
of the recent American-Soviet summit.''
   Gorbachev and President Reagan met in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   ``Good relations now exist between Egypt and the Soviet Union,''
Polyakov said, speaking in Russian through an Arabic interpreter.
He added that last month's visit to Moscow by Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the first of its kind in 14 years,
further improved bilateral ties.
   During his visit, Polyakov is to meet with Mubarak and State
Minister for Foreign Affairs Butros Ghali.
   Polyakov was ambassador in Cairo in 1981 when then-President
Anwar Sadat launched a massive crackdown on domestic opponents. It
included the expulsion of Polyakov and six other Soviet dipolomats
whom Sadat accused of meddling in internal affairs and fomenting
Moslem-Christian sectarian friction..
   The bilateral crisis continued until Sadat was assassinated by
Moslem extremists at a Cairo military parade in October 1981.
   Relations improved under Mubarak and diplomatic representation
was restored to the ambassadorial level in 1984.

   An experimental vaccine may act as a
contraceptive for as long as six months without serious side
effects, according to a preliminary study of 30 women.
   In the study, the vaccine created blood proteins, or antibodies,
in the women that attacked a key hormone required for pregnancy,
researchers said.
   The effectiveness of the proteins could not be tested directly
because the test subjects had already been surgically sterilized.
But the level of proteins appeared to be high enough to block
pregnancy, researchers said.
   No significant side effects appeared in the women studied, said
the scientists from Australia, Ohio State University and the World
Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The study appears in
Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
   Several groups are also studying vaccines similar to the one
used in the new study, said Gabriel Bialy, chief of the
contraceptive development branch of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development.
   Some foreign governments have approved use of match-stick sized
capsules that are implanted just under the skin of a woman's arm
under local anesthetic. By slowly releasing a drug, they provide
contraception for five years unless removed sooner.
   A variety of strategies is needed to allow choices in birth
control, Bialy said.
   The vaccine was designed to spur the immune system into making
antibodies that attack a hormone called human chorionic
gonadotropin, which is produced during pregnancy.
   Animal studies had shown that an antibody attack on this hormone
can halt pregnancy at an early stage, researchers wrote.
   Scientists are not sure whether the attack prevents the
blastocyst, a clump of cells that grows from a fertilized egg, from
implanting itself in the uterus wall, or whether it prevents
further development soon after implantation, Bialy said.
   Implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the
egg is fertilized.
   The study focused on 30 women, ages 26 to 43. Twenty received
one of five dosage levels of the vaccine and the rest a placebo
injection. Each received two injections, six weeks apart, in the
buttocks. They were studied for six months after the first
injection.
   All vaccinated women showed antibody levels that apparently
would be high enough to block pregnancy, researchers said.
   On average, the four women who got the highest dose exceeded the
critical antibody level by the fifth week after the first
injection, and stayed above that level after six months. Two women
remained at or above the level for nine and 10 months, researchers
said.
   Women who received lesser doses reached the critical level about
six weeks on average after the first injection, which was at the
time of the second injection, and stayed there almost six months.
   No participants showed any serious side effects, researchers
said. Several in the highest-dose group had mild and temporary
muscle pain within two days of the injection.
   Twenty-five of the 30 women reported no change in their
menstrual patterns. Of the remaining five, one who had received a
placebo reported an early menopause. Three who received the vaccine
had slight bleeding, called spotting, between periods and one
reported excessive menstrual bleeding.

<HEAD>Thousands of Armenians Shut Businesses in Disputed Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Armenians have been marching
daily through a southern city and have shut down most businesses
and public transportation, Pravda said today in an update on the
country's severest ethnic dispute.
   The Communist Party newspaper said the unrest in
Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region of the republic of
Azerbaijan, has cost the government $41.1 million since it began in
February.
   Pravda said a general strike in the area has lasted for three
weeks.
   ``Such an unusual and unexpected word for us,'' the newspaper
said.
   The Soviets used to say strikes were a purely Western phenomenon
that were anathema to their socialist system of rule by the working
class. But strikes have become a frequent way for Armenians to
press their demand that Nagorno-Karabakh be taken away from
Azerbaijan and made part of the neighboring Armenian republic.
   Pravda admitted the central Soviet press had been ignoring the
story in Nagorno-Karabakh since February, when the unrest began,
but that in the meantime ``tension in the region did not subside.''
   It said it was providing an update because readers had written
letters asking if the situation had improved.
   Residents of the area and Moscow-based dissidents have been
reporting the latest wave of unrest to Western journalists, but the
Soviet press carried nothing on the situation until today.
   Pravda said strikes that began May 23 had shut down the majority
of industrial enterprises and mass transit in Stepanakert, the main
city of Nagorno-Karabakh, whose population of 160,000 is mostly
Armenian.
   Also affected were three regional centers within
Nagorno-Karabakh: Martunin, Mardakert and Askeran. Nearly all
cafeterias and stores are also closed, according to Pravda.
   ``Every morning, tens of thousands of people move side-by-side
in columns along streets toward the center of the city with banners
and signs, conducting meetings,'' the newspaper reported.
   Armenians have set up ``self-defense posts'' around the clock to
prevent attacks by Azeris, the main national group in Azerbaijan,
Pravda said. Such measures are unnecessary because there haven't
been any attacks, it said.
   But it said Armenians have been mixing rumors and facts about
what happened in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and that this has
led to unwarranted fear.
   Azeris went on a rampage at the end of February in Sumgait, and
32 people, mostly Armenians, were killed.
   Pravda disclosed that Azeris staged counter-demonstrations
rejecting the territorial demand May 14-15 in the republic's
capital, Baku, and other Azerbaijani cities.
   The newspaper blamed Nagorno-Karabakh's party officials for not
ending the strike.
   The party's top official in the region, Boris Kevorkov, was
fired Feb. 24 and kicked out of the party altogether in late May
for negligence that Soviet media said exacerbated the ethnic
conflict.
   Demonstrations also have been taking place in Yereven, the
capital of Armenia. Armenians, mostly students, began a sit-in
outside the city's Opera Theater on May 25. They want the
parliament of Armenia, the Supreme Soviet, to consider their demand
at a June 15 meeting.
   Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh have complained of poor
cultural and social services and discrimiation by Azeris, and say
the area is part of their ancestral homeland. Armenians are
predominantly Christian, while most Azeris are Moslem.
   The central government has rejected the demand to give
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia and instead ordered improvements in
living conditions for its residents.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino signed a
land reform bill today and said she hoped the measure would uplift
millions of rural Filipinos from their ancient poverty.
   She congratulated Congress for enacting the legislation after
nearly a year of debate and said the measure would contribute to
the true independence of the Filipino people.
   The bill, approved by Congress last Wednesday, gives landowners
the choice of dividing their property among tenants or sharing
profits with them.
   It is expected to benefit two million landless farmers in this
largely agricultural nation of 7,100 islands. Land reform is
considered essential to defeating the 19-year Communist insurgency,
which draws its support primarily from rural areas.
   ``Few measures have been as rigorously scrutinized and discussed
as this program has been by representatives of the people and by
the people themselves,'' Mrs. Aquino told a national television
audience after signing the measure.
   ``I should hope that now the various interests in the land will
be able to work together to achieve the twin goals of the program,
a radical leap in agricultural productivity and, therefore, a
significant contribution by the agricultural sector to Philippine
progress and the upliftment of the Filipino masses from their
ancient poverty.''
   Under the plan, each landowner may retain 12 acres and an
additional seven acres for each direct heir over age 15 who will
till the land. A landowner has the option of sharing profits or
giving workers shares of stock instead of physically dividing the
property.
   ``Let us see the program not as a taking of property from some
and a giving of it to others, but rather as a way of liberating the
hitherto suppressed energies and creativity of the nation for the
material upliftment of the many and prosperity of all,'' she added.
   Leftist farm groups have branded the plan a ``grand deception''
because they claim it does not go far enough in breaking up huge
estates and redistributing property to the landless.
   Rep. Bonifacio Gillego, who sponsored the bill in the House but
voted against the measure after amendments, claimed the law would
bring about agrarian reform ``through a revolution.''
   He predicted Communist rebels would seek to undermine the
program by trying to convince rural Filipinos that it was a sham.
   Other critics said the success of the plan will depend on the
government's success in providing credits, expertise and other
support to new landowners.
   ``The main responsibility for the implementation of the program
lies with the Department of Agrarian Reform,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
``But I expect all the other departments, the entire apparatus of
government, civil and military, to be as deeply involved and as
committed to its success.
   The law also provides for the distribution to farm workers of
tracts of public land greater than 2,470 acres now leased to
multinational corporations.
   Government lands will be the first distributed in the 10-year
program. Private holdings of more than 123.5 acres will be
parcelled out in the first four years and smaller holdings later.
   Owners of more than 123.5 acres will be paid 25 percent of the
value in cash and those with less than 60 acres will be paid 35
percent in cash. Tax exemptions, shares of stock in government-run
corporations or Land Bank of the Philippines bonds will make up the
rest of the compensation.
   Officials say the program, estimated to cost $70 billion, will
be financed by foreign aid and assets of exiled former President
Ferdinand Marcos and his associates that were seized on grounds
they were illegally acquired.
   Marcos ruled the Philippines for 20 years and was driven from
the country by a civilian-backed military uprising that swept Mrs.
Aquino to power in February 1986.
   The Philippines attempted about a dozen land reform programs in
the past, but they failed either for lack of funds or resistance
from landowners.
   Land reform was among the demands of pro-Soviet Huk rebels in
the 1950s and early 1960s and is a major demand of communist rebels
in the current insurgency, which began in 1968.

   Brian Sullivan finished his 42-day, 800-mile
hike from Chicago to Philadelphia in a steady rain. He did it on
two pairs of running shoes, almost 30 spaghetti dinners and one
kidney.
   His brother Kevin has the other one.
   The two wet men, followed by relatives and well-wishers, walked
with their arms around each other Thursday to the Philadelphia
hospital where nearly four years ago Brian donated the kidney that
saved his brother's life.
   Brian, a 31-year-old recreation supervisor from Carol Stream,
Ill., walked most of the distance by himself to emphasize the need
for organ donation and demonstrate that he has suffered no ill
effects from donating one of his kidneys.
    ``You don't have to do something this stupid or crazy
obviously, but it's nice to know if you wanted to you could,'' he
said.
   His brother Kevin, 36, developed kidney failure in 1984 and
needed a transplant. Two brothers and a sister were eligible
donors, but after a family discussion it was decided that Brian was
in the best shape to give a kidney.
   The experience taught him that organs of all types are in scarce
supply, whether they come from living or dead donors.
   He decided on the walk as a way to bring attention to the
importance of organ donation and set a goal of signing up 100,000
people to organ donor cards. Brian said he has personally signed as
a witness on 561 donor cards during the walk.
   He and officials with organ donor networks estimate he spoke to
more than 10,000 people during the trip, and that many more were
reached through the publicity surrounding the walk.
   Brian, who began the trip on April 24 in Chicago, averaged about
20 miles a day, walking from Chicago, through Indiana to Cleveland,
through the mountains of Pennsylvania to Philadelphia.
   On Thursday he wended his way through downtown Philadelphia to
Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where the transplant was
performed. A crowd of about 30 hospital staff members and
transplant recipients waited to welcome him.
   ``It's really unbelievable. I find it hard to believe. God, did
six weeks go by?'' he said.
   Brian insisted that the trip proved there are no physical
limitations for donors. He did drop 12 pounds from of his
5-foot-11-inch frame, though he remains solid at 198 pounds, due in
large part to a steady diet of high-carbohydrate, high-calorie food
along the way.
   ``I must have had 28 spaghetti dinners,'' Brian said of the meal
he grew most tired of eating. ``That and oatmeal in the morning.''
   ``Yeah, and what did you have the first night you got to our
house?,'' his brother Kevin asked, grinning. ``Spaghetti.''

<TEXT>
   Movie star Michael Douglas, who gained
early fame as a police officer in the Streets of San Francisco
television series, got a taste of real-life court action on
Thursday.
   Douglas was called as a character witness at the murder trial of
David P. Thompson, a beer importer accused of killing his landlord
with a .357 caliber Magnum.
   Douglas, who received an Oscar for his portrayal of a greedy
tycoon in the movie ``Wall Street,'' testified he met Thompson six
times in 1986 when he was considering investing in Thompson's firm.
He said he never saw Thompson show signs of a hot temper.
   The star later spent about a half hour watching the trial. He
told reporters it was the first time he'd ever appeared as a court
witness.
   ``He (Thompson) had the best qualities of a professional,''
Douglas said during his time on the stand. ``Good business acumen
and good marketing skills.''
   Thompson, 38, is charged with the murder of Raymond McCoy, 40.
   Defense attorney Douglas Schmidt contends McCoy had previously
threatened Thompson. He said Thompson secured a court order the day
before the shooting to force McCoy to stay away.
   When McCoy came to Thompson's office, Schmidt said, Thompson
thought he was armed and fired his handgun, hitting the victim in
the chest and killing him.
   Prosecutor Robert Gordon told jurors the shooting was not in
self-defense because McCoy was unarmed when he came to collect the
rent.

   Radical students attacked riot police
with firebombs and clubs today as they battled to reach the North
Korean border for reunification talks with students from the
communist north.
   Police in the center of Seoul chased thousands of screaming
students trying to reach the main train station to take trains to
the border. About 5,000 bottled up by police in Yonsei University
tried to force their way out.
   ``We fight for unification,'' students chanted as they tried to
break through police lines to make their way to the border 30 miles
north of Seoul.
   Police hit by firebombs screamed with pain as they were
enveloped in orange flames in the fighting around Yonsei. Students
wielding wooden and iron clubs beat troopers trying to ward off
blows with shields. Both sides pelted each other with rocks and
bricks.
   Black police armored cars fired volley after volley of choking
tear gas into the charging students, and police martial arts squads
counterattacked. Students tried to immobilize the vans with
firebombs and clubs.
   Police arrested more than 500 students in various parts of
Seoul, and about 40 students who managed to reach Imjingak at the
edge of the Demilitarized Zone along the border were immediately
detained.
   Police battled several thousand students who held demonstrations
to support the reunification march in the provincial cities of
Taejon, Iri, Chunju, Chonan and Kongju. Troopers fired tear gas to
drive protesters back into college campuses as students hurled
firebombs and rocks.
   Protesters at one point dragged a 20-foot baseball backstop to
the main gate at Yonsei to deflect exploding gas bombs fired by
police. But riot troopers attacked and dragged it away.
   Dozens were injured at the university, but authorities had no
overall figures. Police officers and students with burns or blood
pouring from cuts were carried away or staggered to safety. A
student hit in the head by a teargas shell was in critical
condition.
   Radical students called for the march to force reunification of
the communist north and the pro-Western south. Radicals claim the
United States enforces partition of the Korean peninsula to rule
the south, and the protests were vehemently anti-American.
   ``Yankee go home'' and ``Skin the Yankees,'' screamed the
students.
   About 60,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and helmets
were deployed in Seoul and on roads leading to the border to block
the march, banned by the government as a national security risk.
   Police guarded train and bus stations to stop students from
slipping through to the border. Riot squads ringed government
buildings and U.S. diplomatic facilities to prevent attacks.
   Riot squads seized dozens of students in clashes around the
railway station. Some students hurled rocks, but most did not fight
back as charging police roughly scattered marchers.
   Officers were seen brutally punching and kicking students as
they dragged them away. Blood poured from faces of beaten students.
   Pedestrians ran for cover or choked and coughed from swirling
tear gas. The running clashes repeatedly brought traffic to a
standstill on many main streets.
   Fighting erupted around Yonsei today when students attempted to
march out after a rally at which speakers called for reunification
and denounced the United States. A giant picture of an enraged
student slashing a U.S. flag was used as a backdrop.
   ``We call for struggle of the masses for unification and against
dictatorship,'' a speaker shouted as cheering students waved red,
blue and black anti-government and anti-U.S. banners.
   Students attacked riot police with firebombs as they marched out
of the sprawling campus in the west of Seoul ringed by about 8,000
troopers. Other students in nearby sidestreets tried to attack
police from the rear and seized several high rooftops.
   Radical leaders said two representatives were sent to slip past
police blocks and reach the border truce site of Panmunjom to meet
with the northern delegates. The heavily-militarized border is off
limits to all civilians.
   The North Korean government Korean Central News Agency said in a
report monitored in Tokyo that the north's delegates and many
students had reached Panmunjom and were waiting. The delegates
would be government appointees.
   ``The student delegation from our side is now waiting for the
moment when it will have an emotion-charged meeting with fellow
students from the south,'' the report said.
   Most South Koreans oppose the radicals' reunification drive.
People fear the totalitarian north is as determined to conquer the
south as it was when it invaded in 1950 to start the Korean War.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, claim
reunfication overrides any ideological considerations. Radicals
demand expulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the south under
a mutual defense treaty.
   The South Korean government says the radicals are pro-communist
or idealists who risk being used by the north. It insists it alone
should handle contacts with the north and the mainline opposition
parties opposed the student march.

   A landslide following heavy rain
killed 10 people and injured two others in a west Java village, an
official of the Social Affairs Ministry said today.
   Z.A. Sastrawijaya said 34 houses and rice field were damaged and
destroyed Thursday in the landslide that hit the village of Kolot,
about 190 miles southeast of the capital.
   Sastrawijaya said he could yet not give an estimate of material
losses caused by the landslide, which forced evacuation of 142

<HEAD>Canadian Prison Escapees May Have Crossed Into United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAVAL, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three inmates who shot a guard while
escaping from a maximum-security prison may have fled to the United
States after releasing their two hostages, provincial authorities
said.
   The escapees, two of whom were believed to be wounded in a gun
battle with guards, commandeered a car Thursday outside the Laval
Institute, a prison north of Montreal.
   They took both its driver and a guard with them. The guard,
Therese Gagne, and the motorist, an unidentified middle-aged woman,
were found unharmed three hours later at a farmhouse about 20 miles
from the prison. They phoned police from Candiac, about 30 miles
from the New York state border.
   Constable Andre Blanchette, a provincial police spokesman, said
the two women reported that one of the convicts was shot in the
elbow and another in the shoulder.
   Paul Fournier, assistant director of the institute, said the
injured prison guard, Pierre Blouin, was shot in the shoulder and
leg but was expected to survive.
   The escapees were identified as Rene St-Arnaud, 26, serving 12
years for armed robbery; his brother Pierre, 24, serving seven
years for robbery; and Robert Henley, 29, serving life for murder.
   The elder St-Arnaud has a large spider web tattooed on his
forehead, Blanchette said.
   ``They could be anywhere, including the United States,'' he said.
   The breakout began about 10:30 a.m. as Gagne was returning to
her post after checking a disturbance in one of four workshops she
guards from a tower. Fournier and Pierre Chapleau, an official with
the guards' union, said the three prisoners overpowered her,
grabbed her rifle and revolver and took her hostage as other guards
went to help.
   After a brief exchange of gunfire, the prisoners drove a
forklift to the prison wall, scaled it, threw down a 36-foot-long
hose, descended with Gagne, then ran, Chapleau said.
   Chapleau said Blouin, posted in a tower on the wall surrounding
the prison, was shot at ``whenever he popped his head out to see
what was happening.''
   A few minutes later, the prisoners and Gagne were spotted by two
guards who were searching a truck belonging to a courier company,
authorities said.
   Yves Dube, driver of the truck, said a gunfight broke out
between the guards and two of the prisoners.
   ``I didn't hang around to see what happened,'' he said, ``but I
heard about 30 to 40 shots,'' he said.
   Fournier said the convicts stopped the passing car, forced the
driver to go wth them and headed toward Montreal.
   The medieval-looking prison, called St-Vincent-de-Paul
Penitentiary when it was opened in 1873 on Ile-Jesus, now the city
of Laval, has been witness to many escapes, hostage-takings and
disturbances.
   In August 1980, a bungled escape attempt that left one convict
dead turned into a three-day drama when nine prisoners held eight
hostages before finally surrendering.

<HEAD>Genetically Engineered Hormone Holds Out Hope for Treating
Infertility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they're encouraged by animal
tests of a genetically engineered human hormone for treating one of
the more common forms of infertility in women.
   ``It does everything we want it to do so far,'' said Dr. James
Simon, one of four authors of a study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The hormone, produced by recombinant gene-splicing technology,
is called rechLH and is biologically identical to the substance
produced by a woman's pituitary gland to induce ovulation, called a
luteinizing hormone, or LH.
   ``In primate testing, rechLH initiated ovulation, it helped
stimulate normal hormonal production through the entire menstrual
cycle, the eggs were fertile and the monkeys produced embryos,''
Simon said.
   ``But until we try it in humans, we can't be sure all the
advantages are real,'' said Simon, who is director of the
Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Services at the
Georgetown University School of Medicine.
   Serono Laboratories Inc., the worldwide pharmaceutical concern
that is developing rechLH, estimates it could be seven to nine
years before the product is clinically tested on humans, approved
by the Food and Drug Administration and put on the market.
   One of the more common causes of infertility in women is
hormonal abnormalities that prevent a woman from regularly
producing fertile eggs.
   The hormonal abnormalities, in turn, can frequently be traced to
a woman's inability to produce either LH or another hormone, called
a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), in the proper sequence and
ratio.
   Supplies of both FSH and LH used to treat infertility are now
extracted from the urine of post-menopausal women.
   Sources of pure FSH, which causes follicles in the ovary to grow
and mature prior to the start of ovulation, have been available
commercially for about a year.
   Prior to development of rechLH, no source of pure LH existed.
   ``The delicate balance between the two hormones is what makes up
a menstrual cycle, and getting both together limited our ability to
mimic the normal pituitary processes,'' Simon said. ``By having a
pure source of LH, we can add it back in such a way to tailor the
relationship to each individual we treat.
   ``And that says nothing about the obvious advantages of
availability and consistency of production we can maintain by being
able to produce rechLH through genetic engineering,'' Simon said.
   LH also is involved in sperm production and rechLH may help
battle sterility in men as well, said Simon, though its potential
application for males now is much less understood by researchers.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports that Fiji Weapons Came From India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today said India's
intelligence service tried to overthrow Fiji's Melanesian-dominated
government by smuggling tons of weapons to its Indian community.
   The report in the Australian drew a quick denial from Australian
Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who said he would have known of such
shipments. The Indian embassy in Canberra also issued a vigorous
denial.
   The Australian, the country's only national broadsheet, said in
its leading story that Western intelligence services blamed the
Indian government for recent arms shipments to the volatile South
Pacific nation of Fiji, a former British colony 1,860 miles
northeast of Sydney.
   It said the Soviet-made arms, which included rockets launchers,
anti-tank mines, automatic rifles and grenades, were part of a plan
to overthrow the nominally civilian, Melanesian-dominated
government, which came to power after two coups last year.
   The newspaper quoted Australian intelligence sources and a U.S.
government official in Washington. It did not identify them.
   Fiji's security forces this week seized two large caches of arms
from two Indian-owned sugar cane farms. Authorities followed with a
roundup of Indian businessmen.
   On Thursday, police detained two former Cabinet ministers in the
ousted Indian-dominated government of Timoci Bavadra.
   Bavadra's government was overthrown by Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka
one month after it was elected. Rabuka said he mounted the May 14,
1987, coup to protect political rights of ethnic Fijians, who are
outnumbered by Indians in the 715,000 population. Rabuka carried
out a second coup four months later, citing the same reason.
   Rabuka has since handed power to the nominally civilian
government and appointed himself head of the army and home affairs
minister in charge of internal security.
   He has said the arms shipments were part of a foreign plot to
destabilize the nation but he did not specifically accuse any
particular group.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court decision to
reconsider a landmark ruling striking down the Army's ban on
homosexual soldiers was a setback but not a reason to despair, says
a homosexual-rights group's lawyer.
   ``The struggle for equal rights for lesbians and gay men is a
long-term struggle,'' Leonard Graff, legal director of National Gay
Rights Advocates, said following Thursday's decision.
``Realistically we have to expect some setbacks. That doesn't mean
we give up,''
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to reconsider a
Feb. 10 ruling in the case of a discharged soldier from the Seattle
area.
   A panel of the court ruled 2-1 at the time that 1981 Army
regulations providing for discharge on the grounds of homosexual
orientation were unconstitutional.
   The panel had said homosexuals, as victims of historic
mistreatment, deserved the same protections from discrimination as
racial minorities. It was the first time an appellate court reached
that conclusion.
   The latest ruling, which granted a Reagan administration request
that the case be referred to an 11-member panel for a new hearing,
cancelled the earlier order's legal effect.
   The 25-judge appeals court gave no reason for its decision or
details of its vote. No date has been set for the new hearing.
   The government had contended the ruling failed to defer to the
Army's judgment in matters of discipline and morale and also was
inconsistent with the Supreme Court's 1986 ruling upholding an
anti-sodomy law in Georgia.
   A lawyer for Perry Watkins, the former solider, said he was not
surprised by the decision and expected the case to end up in the
Supreme Court if he wins the next round.
   ``That's why I did not advise homosexual members of the Army
(after the February decision) to come out of the closet and say,
`Here I am, you can't touch me,' '' said attorney James Lobsenz.
   Watkins, now 39, enlisted in the Army in 1967 at age 19,
admitting at the time that he had homosexual tendencies. The man,
who had been supervisor of the Fort Lewis personnel administration
center and had high job ratings, was discharged in May 1984.
   Before 1981, the Army discharged soldiers for sodomy and other
specific acts, but not for homosexuality itself. But that year,
homosexual orientation was declared to be grounds for discharge.
   Nearly 1,400 people were discharged from all branches of the
armed services for homosexuality in the fiscal year that ended last
Sept. 30, the government said.
   In the Feb. 10 ruling, the three-judge panel said the Army must
reconsider Watkins' application for re-enlistment without regard to
his sexual orientation.
   Writing for the majority, Judge William Norris likened laws
limiting the ``acceptable focus'' of sexual desire to members of
the opposite sex to laws limiting the choice of a spouse or sex
partner to members of the same race. Such laws, he said, are
unconstitutional discrimination in the absence of ``compelling
governmental justification.''
   Norris rejected Army arguments that the ban was justified by
widely shared moral standards and by military morale and
discipline. The claim that homosexuals would hurt morale and
discipline was an attempt to ``illegitimately cater to private
biases,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Colossus is getting a gorilla
girlfriend.
   Muke, pronouced ``Moo-key,'' will be the first member of his
species that Colossus, billed as the largest lowland gorilla in
captivity, will have seen since infancy when she arrives next
Wednesday at The Zoo.
   ``Hopefully, she's good looking,'' said Pat Quinn, director of
The Zoo. ``I'd hate to have him mad at me for the rest of his
life.''
   Muke will be on breeding loan from the St. Louis Zoo.
   Colossus, 6-2 and more than 550 pounds, took his first step
outside in about 20 years March 18, when zoo officials allowed him
to explore a spacious outdoor habitat.
   Colossus was moved to the zoo outside this Pensacola suburb from
Benson's Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., where he had been kept in a
small indoor cage since his capture in West Africa.
   A prior effort to produce offspring from Colossus through
artificial insemination failed just before his move to Florida
because the huge ape wasn't very sexually active. Quinn said
Colossus has shown signs of more sexual interest at his new home
and hopes the introduction of a female will heighten his fervor.
   To prepare for his first glimpse of another gorilla, scientists
from the University of West Florida have been showing him National
Geographic videotapes of gorillas.
   ``He did respond,'' Quinn said. ``He was most interested in
gorillas that interacted with humans because that's what he is used
to.''
   A young male chimpanzee has been placed in a room adjoining that
of Colossus in the zoo's gorilla house to get the huge ape used to
the idea of having someone next door.
   Muke will replace the chimp. At first they will be allowed only
to look at and smell each other. Later, a door between the two
rooms will be opened wide enough so they can touch, and finally
wide enough so the female can enter Colossus' room.
   The match was arranged by the Gorilla Species Survival Plan
Committee of the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
   Gorillas are an endangered species, and Colossus is seen as
particularly attractive for breeding because he was captured in the
wild and will introduce new genes into the community of captive
apes.
   Even if they fail to mate, Muke would have accomplished one goal
if she can get him to socialize with another member of the species.
In the wild, dominant male gorillas don't have a single mate, but
preside over veritable harems.

<TEXT>
   Defrocked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart plans to
preach in Indianapolis next month, delivering his first sermon
outside his home base of Louisiana since being dismissed from the
Assemblies of God.
   An Indiana Assemblies of God official said Thursday the local
denomination will not take part in Swaggart's free crusade in
Market Square Arena July 22, 23 and 24.
   The evangelist's visit was scheduled before he was defrocked,
said Fred Leader, secretary-treasurer of the denomination's Indiana
district.
   ``At that time, we were going to cooperate with him,'' he said.
   The Executive Presbytery dismissed Swaggart from the pulpit
April 8 for refusing to accept a year's punishment for an
unspecified sin.
   A New Orleans prostitute, Debra Murphree, 28, has claimed the
preacher paid her to pose nude in a motel room. She later claimed
to have had sex with Swaggart on at least one occasion.
   ``We like Indianapolis. We have a lot of people up there that
love Jimmy Swaggart, and so we're coming back up there,'' said the
Rev. John A. Jendresen, arrangements director of Swaggart's crusade.
   Swaggart returned to preaching May 22, but has not preached
outside Louisiana, where his headquarters is based.
   The Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostal
denomination, announced Tuesday that ministers associated with
Swaggart as of Oct. 1 will lose their own credentials. Assemblies
spokeswoman Juleen Turnage estimated 80 or 90 ministers would be
affected.
   Swaggart also is scheduled to preach at Oakland, Calif., and
Houston in September, the Rev. Jendresen said.

   The Hong Kong government announced today that
it will introduce a bill later this month under which triad members
will be given amnesty if they renounce membership in secret
societies.
   Under present law, a person who has joined a triad society is
liable to prosecution whether or not he remains an active triad
member.
   A government statement said the proposed bill will set up a
tribunal to hear applications from those wishing to renounce their
membership in triad gangs.
   The statement said the plan would be open to all people,
including civil servants who wished to renounce their triad links.
   Triads originally were formed as secret societies in the 17th
century to try to overthrow the Manchu dynasty in China.
   They later turned into criminal cliques, whose members pledged
blood oaths and financed their operations with extortion, murder,
robbery, narcotics, kidnappings and prostitution.
   Police officials decline to estimate how many triad members live
in Hong Kong, although in the past they have put the number at
about 80,000. Extortion is viewed as a main activity of modern
triads.

<TEXT>
   Two of Iran's top leaders conferred with
the designated successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
official news agency said today. A Western television network
reported that the ailing patriarch may be dying.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani conferred Wednesday with
Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri in the holy city of Qom, 100 miles
south of Tehran. The agency said that President Ali Khamenei also
saw Montazeri in Qom on Thursday.
   In both cases, the agency said the two political leaders
discussed current issues, but it did not elaborate.
   Rafsanjani and Khamenei are political rivals in the power
struggle that has been taking place in the Tehran hierarchy over
who will run the country when Khomeini dies.
   The 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch has been reported in
frail health since he suffered a heart attack two years ago. There
have also been unconfirmed reports that he has cancer.
   Iran's official media have made no recent reference to
Khomeini's health.
   The CBS television network reported Thursday that intelligence
reports indicated Khomeini ``may now be very close to death.''
   It quoted the reports as saying that ``the Ayatollah's cancer
has spread from his prostate to his liver'' and that he ``may only
have two or three months to live.''
   It also reported that U.S. intelligence officials say Montazeri
would succeed Khomeini but the real power would be wielded by
Rafsanjani.
   Speculation that the Iranian leader's condition was
deteriorating heightened when he appointed Rafsanjani, also one of
his closest aides, as acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed
forces on June 2.
   Khomeini had held that title under Iran's revolutionary
constitution.
   His appointment of Rafsanjani followed two recent battlefield
defeats that Iran suffered in its nearly 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Khomeini, who last week declared the war would be won on the
battlefield and not at the negotiating table, ordered Rafsanjani to
reorganize Iran's fractious military forces.
   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani as
saying June 3 that it was no longer possible for Khomeini ``to
personally run the administrative affairs'' of Iran's various
military forces.
   He did not elaborate but added: ``We should not have such
expectations of his Holiness.''
   Rafsanjani, a 53-year-old cleric, has long been considered the
second most powerful figure in Iran after Khomeini.
   He consolidated his political power with the appointment as
military chief and his June 7 reelection as speaker by the Majlis,
or Parliament.
   He also represents Khomeini on the Supreme Defense Council,
which determines Iran's war strategy, maintains close links with
the Revolutionary Guards, and sits on several key committees.
   Although Khomeini clearly indicated in 1985 that 65-year-old
Montazeri would succeed him, he drew up a new political testament
on Dec. 10.
   Tehran Radio said it contained some changes from an earlier
document Khomeini had written, to be opened after his death. The
contents were not disclosed.
   Montazeri has been opposed by several Iranian leaders, including
Rafsanjani. He also lacks the charisma and authority of Khomeini.
   Khomeini was last seen in public May 13 accompanied by his son,
Ahmed. The national leader has rarely left his residence in the
last few years.
   When the Parliament reconvened May 28, his son read a speech in
the House on behalf of his father. There was no official
explanation of Khomeini's absence.

<HEAD>Michigan Legislature Approves Ban On Pregnancy-For-Pay Contracts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who make money by making babies
could be put behind bars under a bill approved by the Michigan
Legislature.
   Legislation outlawing pregnancy-for-pay contracts was approved
Thursday on a 90-10 House vote and 28-3 Senate vote.
   ``After five years, in probably the state that was most
difficult to pass a surrogate act, it's a real victory,'' said
Republican Sen. Connie Binsfeld, the bill's sponsor.
   The bill goes to Gov. James Blanchard, who will have 14 days to
veto, sign or let it automatically become law. Blanchard's chief
lobbyist, William Kandler, said he didn't know what Blanchard would
do.
   Michigan is an important target for surrogacy opponents because
it is home to one of the nation's most prolific surrogacy
matchmakers. Lawyer Noel Keane of Dearborn says he has arranged
more than 200 births, including the Mary Beth Whitehead pregnancy
that led to New Jersey's landmark ``Baby M'' case. In that case,
the state Supreme Court outlawed surrogacy for pay.
   Keane maintains those cases are the rare exception and that most
people involved in surrogate arrangements are very happy with the
results.
   Typically, an infertile couple pays Keane $10,000 to match them
with a woman willing to be artificially inseminated, carry a child
to term and give up her parental rights. The woman also is paid
$10,000.
   Under the proposed Michigan law, no such payments could change
hands, although a woman who entered into an unenforceable surrogacy
agreement could be compensated for her expenses.
   Brokers who arrange surrogate births for profit would face
felony penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine.
People who enter into such contracts would face misdemeanor charges
punishable by up to a year and $10,000.
   Binsfeld said the bill also would ban a contracting couple from
giving such women any gifts.
   Women still could become surrogates for free _ for example, if a
sister wanted to carry a child for her infertile sibling.
   The legislation would guarantee that in the case of a surrogacy
custody dispute, the baby would remain with its mother until a
circuit judge determined whether it was in the child's best
interest to give custody to the father.
   Binsfeld called the measure ``the only answer to protect
children.''
   ``I don't think adults should be able to fulfill their desires
at the expense of children,'' she said.
   Lawmakers who voted against the bill said the Legislature
probably hasn't settled anything.
   ``Surrogacy is not going to end _ it may be forced
underground,'' said Democratic Rep. Floyd Clack, who predicted
lawmakers within the next two years will be asked to come up with
different regulations.
   ``Women who become surrogate mothers are entitled to be paid for
their services, just like male athletes who risk their bodies are
paid,'' said Republican Rep. David Honigman, head of a special
committee that examined the issue.
   Honigman agreed that people who want a standard surrogate
arrangement will be able to enter one. ``Most people are going to
go out of state, of course,'' he said.
   Kentucky, Louisiana and Nebraska have enacted laws declaring
surrogate arrangements illegal. Indiana put enforcement of
surrogate contracts on hold until the issue can be researched, and
proposed surrogacy regulations were vetoed in Arkansas, according
to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

<HEAD>Six Charged In Student Slaying That Touched Off Pro-Democracy
Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities filed charges today against five
young men and a woman in the slaying of a university student whose
death prompted his classmates to agitate first for tighter security
and then for democracy.
   Two of the suspects, unemployed young men with criminal records,
were charged with murder and hooliganism, according to the official
Legal Daily. If convicted, they could receive the death penalty _ a
bullet in the back of the head.
   The four others were charged with hooliganism and face terms of
up to seven years in prison. Three of them were unemployed and two,
including a 22-year-old woman, previously served terms in labor
camps for theft, the Beijing Daily said.
   The six allegedly picked a fight with two Beijing University
students at a snackshop and liquor store late on June 1. Geophysics
graduate student Cai Qingfeng, 22, went to the students' aid but
was shot in the head with a B-B gun pellet and beaten with a shovel.
   Cai died of his wounds June 2 in a hospital. Late that night,
about 1,000 students marched from Beijing University to central
Beijing's Tiananmen Square to demonstrate their sorrow and anger
and demand better security for students.
   The high emotions quickly switched channel, however, and in the
next few days students put up dozens of posters attacking
government corruption and demanding democracy and greater press
freedom.
   The unrest peaked Wednesday when police sealed off Tiananmen
Square and intimidated the students into canceling plans for a
pro-democracy march.
   The mood on Beijing University campus was subdued today with
fewer and fewer students crowding around the weather-tattered
posters that advocated protest.
   About 850 students gathered late Thursday night near the
bulletin boards for an impromptu rally, but only half a dozen
students stepped forward to speak and their message was restrained.
   ``We students talk about democracy but we don't understand it
ourselves, so how can we preach it to society?'' one asked,
eliciting applause.
   Another said, ``We students and the government leaders are not
at odds. Our goals are the same. We are all Chinese.''
   No one suggested further protest, and the rally broke up shortly
after midnight. By contrast, hundreds of students rallied until 1
and 2 a.m. each night earlier in the week, cheering speakers who
suggested that they boycott classes, hold protest marches and take
over the campus radio station. None of the suggestions were acted
on.
   By sealing off Tiananmen Square on Wednesday, the government
made it clear it would not tolerate a repeat of the massive student
pro-democracy protests that took place in the winter of 1986-87.
Those protests ended with a conservative crackdown, including the
ouster of relatively liberal Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.

<HEAD>NATO Winds Up Its Spring Meeting, Calls For Negotiations For
Disarmament</HEAD>

   NATO foreign ministers today called for
early negotiations to reduce troops in Europe and promised to
consider a more equitable sharing of defense costs between the
United States and its allies.
   In a joint declaration, the 16 foreign ministers said successful
negotiations with the Soviet bloc depended on ``substantial and
balanced'' results on human rights.
   The statement, issued at the end of NATO's spring meeting,
attempted to prod the Soviets to improve their human rights record
before the North Atlantic Treaty organization would undertake
negotiations with the Warsaw Pact.
   The goal, the statment said, was a substantial and balanced
reduction of non-nuclear forces in Europe.
   Negotiations dealing only with troop reductions in Central
Europe have limped along for 15 years without any results. The new
negotiations between NATO and the seven-nation Communist bloc are
more ambitious, seeking to reduce tensions from the Atlantic to the
Ural Mountains.
   There was no specific promise in the declaration that the
Western Europeans and Canada will contribute a larger share to
NATO's defenses. The United States currently shoulders about 70
percent of the financial burden.
   But the statement cited a ``ontinuing commitment to share
equitably the risks, burdens and responsibilities as well as the
benefits of our common endeavor.''
   A hard decision on defense costs was not expected until the
winter NATO meeting in December.
   On another point, the declaration said the ministers had
discussed the ripening situation in Eastern Europe in light of the
economic and political reforms under way in the Soviet Union.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other U.S. officials
have stressed that the West should provide economic assistance to
Eastern European nations only if there is political reform.
   The ministers also welcomed the results of the recent May 29
-June 2 summit in Moscow between President Reagan and General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``both for their substance and as a
portent for the future development of East-West relations.''
   ``We welcome the unprecedented prominence accorded to human
rights in the joint statement of the summit and hope that a more
forthcoming Soviet attitude will also be reflected'' in the
concluding document of the current session of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna.

   Family and friends of kidnapped
Professor Thomas Sutherland marked the start of his fourth year in
captivity by adorning trees on campus with new yellow ribbons.
   Sutherland's daughters, Kit and Joan, were on hand Thursday to
repeat the now-familiar ritual.
   ``Every year we have to do it,'' said Kit Sutherland, 27. ``It's
very symbolic that we have to retie and make the knot maybe that
much stronger or use better ribbon simply so that it will stand up.
   ``It's symbolic of what Dad has to do every single day,'' she
said. ``He has to regroup, and retie and restrengthen his ways.''
   Sutherland, 57, was kidnapped June 9, 1985, as he was returning
to Beirut, Lebanon, where he was acting dean of agriculture at
American University while on leave from Colorado State University.
   The ceremony Thursday night in the CSU Student Center was a
simple one of poetry and music. The centerpiece was a 1966 tape
recording of Sutherland reciting poems of Robert Burns, who like
Sutherland is a native of Scotland.
   Coincidentally, friends of the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco had
sent Jenco the tape 20 years before Jenco and Sutherland met as
fellow hostages. Jenco rediscovered the tape after his release in
July 1986.
   ``For us, it was a tremendous joy to listen to him,'' Jenco
said. ``And frequently, when things got sad or depressing, we would
say, `Tom, is there any possibility of you reciting a poem for us?'
   ``And frequently he would do this and would uplift our spirits.''
   Only one American has been held hostage in Lebanon longer than
Sutherland: Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Since Sutherland's abduction, his wife, Jean, has returned to
Beirut to continue teaching at American University.
   ``I know a lot of people who have lost their dads,'' Kit
Sutherland said. ``They will never again be able to tell them that
they love them. We're lucky. He's still alive and we'll see him
soon.''

   Workers used shovels and their bare
hands today to dig up 12 bodies from a mass grave where human
rights advocates say victims of right-wing death squads may have
been buried.
   The church-backed Ecumenical Movement for Justice and Peace said
the three-square-yard shallow pit held at least 22 bodies, which
were mysteriously buried in April at the suburban South Cemetery.
   Movement officials obtained a court order authorizing exhumation
of the bodies to determine whether they were members of the
left-wing Youth for Democracy and Nationalism, reported missing
since April.
   Lawyer Romeo Capulong, the movement's chairman, called the court
order a breakthrough in efforts to locate victims of death squads.
   ``The relatives of victims of disappearances were never able to
find a mass grave like this,'' Capulong said.
   Health department workers began the dig after spraying the area
with disinfectant. The workers found the first body about three
feet below the surface of the muddy pit. By late afternoon, the
diggers had found at least 12 decomposing bodies, including that of
a woman.
   ``We believe the presence of mass graves is an indication of
death squads all around us,'' said Sister Pat Lardizabal, a Roman
Catholic nun.
   However, Dr. Ethelyn Nieto, Manila city health officer, claimed
at least some of the bodies had been properly buried after
autopsies. Nieto said the bodies had remained unclaimed for months
before they were buried.
   Volunteer Dr. Aurora Parong said at least one of the bodies
showed that it had not undergone an autopsy.
   ``The fact that he was not autopsied shows us that he could have
been illegally buried,'' she claimed.
   She said the digging would continue until all 22 bodies believed
buried there were recovered.
   Amor Cabusao, 55, was looking for her missing son, Ernesto. A
laborer, he disappeared July 17 during a police sweep of Manila's
slum district of Tondo, which military authorities claim to have
been a refuge for communist hit squads in the capital.
   At least 100 soldiers, policemen and village officials were
killed by communist guerrillas in the capital last year.
   Civil rights groups have frequently charged their members have
been victims of right-wing death squads seeking to eliminate
leftists and sympathizers to the 19-year Communist insurgency.

   Many South Koreans reacted with
disappointment and anger today to moves by radical students to
march to communist North Korea for unification talks.
   ``What a stupid idea it is. They are simply crazy,'' said the
owner of a small bakery near Yonsei University in Seoul, where
thousands of students battled riot police.
   ``I supported them when they fought for democracy last year. But
this time, I simply don't understand them,'' said the shopkeeper,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Coughing and sneezing in a small bakery filled with drifting
tear gas, the shopkeeper said he could not understand the students
shouting the same slogans that North Korea puts out daily through
its propaganda outlets.
   Few people interviewed supported or showed sympathy with the
students who called for talks with their North Korean counterparts
on reuniting their land left divided since the end of World War II
in 1945.
   Chung Soon-im, a 38-year-old housewife, said sarcastically,
``Let them go to the north and live there for a few months. They
need to learn by experience what is good and bad.''
   A uniformed army captain interviewed in a subway said: ``I would
like to shoot them. They are too naive or idiots.''
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took office Feb. 25 after victory in
last December's elections, has liberalized debate on unification
but said the government should serve as a unified channel of
dialogue with North Korea.
   ``I do agree that the students have the right to meet their
North Korean friends. It would help ease the bitter rivalry between
the two sides,'' dissident Buddhist monk Song Kwan said after a
rally at Yonsei University.
   Another dissident leader, Moon Ik-hwan, told students at the
rally, ``The Roh Tae-woo regime has neither capability nor will to
push national unification. I support the student talks.''
   About 4,000 students, shooting clenched fists into the air, rose
in wild cheers and sang a song titled ``Our Lifelong Wish is
Unification.''
   But many intellectuals say the student activism could backfire.
They point out that the military staged a coup in 1961 after
radical students called for similar unification talks with North
Korea.

   Costa Rican President and Nobel
Prize-winner Oscar Arias pledged to continue pressing for peace in
Central America, and asked Harvard University graduates to join him
in taking risks ``to build a different world.''
   At an overcast, rainy 337th commencement ceremony Thursday,
Arias told 25,000 Harvard graduates, alumni and spectators that he
maintained a dream of peace and democracy in strife-torn Central
America.
   Arias, 48, received the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for a plan to end
conflict in the region.
   ``When we proposed the peace plan for Central America, many
people thought we were wrong and that that was an impossible
dream,'' Arias said. ``Out of that risk, we now have a chance for
peace, and guns have been silenced in Nicaragua for the first time
in 20 years.
   ``Don't ever fear the risks you will have to take to build a
different world. Don't ever fear the risks when you are acting on
your own principles. You will soon learn that the accommodation
with the old world, a world where you see violence and injustice,
poverty and submission, offers no reward.''
   Before Arias spoke, Harvard President Derek Bok assailed the
``hypocrisy of encouraging students to address the gravest problems
of society while perpetuating conditions that make it very
difficult for them to do so.''
   Bok cited statistics showing fewer Harvard graduates entering
government, teaching, manufacturing or social work, and he pinned
blame on the failure of salaries in those fields to approach ones
in private, professional jobs.
   Bok conferred degrees to the 5,526 graduates en masse, school by
school.
   Business school graduates were booed roundly when they stood to
receive their degrees waving $100 bills.
   In presenting an honorary doctor of laws degree, Bok praised
Arias for his ``clear voice of peace and reason for our new world.''
   Other honorary degree recipients were: economist John Kenneth
Galbraith, Christian Science Monitor Editor Kay Fanning, operatic
soprano Jessye Norman, mathematician David Harold Blackwell, Roman
historian Sir Ronald Syme, astronomer Vera Cooper Rubin and
epidemiologist Sir Richard Doll.

   Norway's consul general has been arrested
for complicity in the secret dumping of 15,000 tons of toxic waste
from the United States, the government said.
   The arrest, announced Thursday, was the latest event in a
growing scandal over dumping of toxic wastes in Africa by developed
countries.
   Proposals for shipping such material are on the increase,
according to a Greenpeace International report released Thursday in
Caracas, Venezuela.
   Guinea identified the Norwegian consul general as Sigmund Strome
but provided no other details about the charges. International law
gives diplomats immunity from prosecution.
   Ibrahima Sory Diaby, Guinean secretary of state for security,
announced on Radio Conakry that several Guinean employees of the
Ministry of Commerce also were arrested for granting import
licenses for the waste.
   The toxic material, which was dumped on the island of Kassa off
Conakry, originated in the United States, Diaby said. He said it
was shipped from Philadelphia.
   The West African nation's government said a Norwegian company
with government links, Aluko-Guinee, imported the waste and was
still holding 85,000 tons.
   Diaby said the waste had been imported under the guise of
construction materials, and the company was to receive $50 per ton
for each ton of waste.
   The government has demanded that the waste be returned at the
cost of the company.
   The dumping was discovered when trees began dying on the island,
the government said.
   In Caracas, representatives of Greenpeace distributed their
report during a conference devoted to drafting a global accord on
controlling the international shipments of hazardous wastes. The
five-day meeting, sponsored by the U.N. Environment Program,
includes delegates from 50 nations and 14 international
organizations.
   The Greenpeace report said 12 shipments of hazardous wastes,
including five involving U.S. firms, have been designated for
transport from industrialized countries to Africa this year. The
report said there were only two African-bound shipments from the
United States before 1988.

   Japan, already the world's largest donor of
overseas economic aid, will expand its aid program to developing
countries if the current level is not enough, Foreign Minister
Sosuke Uno said today.
   Uno also said Japan would continue to concentrate on boosting
demand in the domestic economy to relieve its trade surplus with
other countries.
   ``Our $7 billion in ODA (official development assistance) is the
greatest in the world, although in terms of percentage of the gross
national product, it may not be,'' Uno said in a luncheon speech at
the Japan National Press Club. ``If our efforts toward ODA are not
enough, we will work harder.''
   He did not say how the government would determine if Japan's
efforts were sufficient.
   Boosted by the surging value of the yen, Japan's assistance has
risen from $3.8 billion in 1985 to about $7.4 billion in fiscal
1987, which ended March 31. The budget for the current fiscal year
is $10 billion.
   Japanese development aid this year is about 0.3 percent of
Japan's gross national product, below the average 0.36 percent for
major Western donor countries.
   Uno said such aid to developing countries was for humanitarian
and global security purposes.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci urged the Japanese
government during a visit to Tokyo this week to increase its aid to
strategically important Third World countries such as Pakistan,
Portugal, Turkey and Afghanistan.
   Carlucci also called on Japan to bolster its own military and
increase financial support of U.S. troops stationed in this country.
   ``Just don't ask us to send our Self-Defense Forces abroad,''
Uno said today. ``Don't ask us to take any guns overseas.''
   Western allies have urged Japan to take a more active role in
global security. The government says the constitution, which
renounces war, limits Japanese contributions to non-military
actions.
   Uno said his forthcoming trip to Israel as the first Japanese
cabinet official to visit that country represents absolutely no
change in Japanese policy toward the Middle East.
   ``It is not at all a case of emphasizing Israel and neglecting
the Arab countries, or emphasizing Arab countries and neglecting
Israel,'' he said. ``There is absolutely no change in our Mideast
policy.''
   Japan imports 99 percent of its oil and is heavily dependent on
Middle East petroleum. Tokyo tries to maintain cordial relations
with most Arab countries as well as with Israel.

   Two Europeans and a Filipino of
German descent were arrested in a rebel-infested area and accused
of training communist insurgents, a senior military officer said
today.
   Col. Hernani Figueroa, spokesman for the army's southern Luzon
island command, identified the three as Antonio Bosch, 46, a
Filipino of German descent; Klaus Schmidt, 52, a West German
Protestant minister; and Stellan Hermansson, 30, a Swede.
   Figueroa said the three were arrested Wednesday during a
military operation in Quezon province. He said they had been
training communist rebels in the Bondoc peninsula of Quezon
province, a rebel stronghold.
   He said two soldiers identified them as being with a band of New
People's Army guerrillas who raided the town of San Francisco last
February. The soldiers were captured in the raid but escaped by
killing their guards a few days later.
   Figueroa said the three were undergoing interrogation and were
being held in a room at the command headquarters in Lucena City, 60
miles southeast of Manila.
   He said the military planned to charge them with either
espionage or murder and robbery in the San Francisco raid. He said
the trio was found with a camera containing film of rebels training
and Hermansson was depicted holding a .30-caliber machine gun.
   Spokesmen for the West German and Swedish embassies said they
were unaware of the reports. A spokesman for St. Andrew's
Theological Seminary in Manila said Schmidt had been teaching
biblical studies there for the past year and was expected to return
for classes next week.
   In Sweden, officials of the Young Communist League said
Hermansson was a member of the organization. Spokesman Erik
Cardfelt said Hermansson arrived here May 18 to travel and gather
information for lectures. He said Hermansson was a freelance
journalist and was to have returned to Sweden Saturday.
   The arrests followed charges by the military that Western groups
are supporting the New People's Army, which has been waging a
19-year insurgency to establish a Communist state.
   Last month, a captured rebel claimed journalists from New
Zealand paid her guerrilla unit to stage an ambush in February in
southeastern Luzon in which 11 soldiers were killed.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told foreign reporters Thursday
that there was no corroborating evidence to support that charge.

<HEAD>Bill Seeks to Include Overseas Residents in Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the House of Representatives shifts seats
from one state to another following the 1990 Census, some of the
changes may be caused by people living in Korea, Germany and other
foreign nations.
   A House subcommittee voted Thursday to require that Americans
living overseas be counted in the census for purposes of
reapportionment.
   Traditionally, they have not been included in the count because
the census is designed to distribute House seats among states, and
people overseas do not reside in any particular state.
   But in recent years the question has become an emotional issue,
with some politicians questioning the policy of counting illegal
aliens who live in the United States, but excluding citizens who
happen to be living abroad.
   The Constitution requires that apportionment be based on a count
of all the people residing in the states. Thus, illegal aliens are
counted because they do reside in the country.
   The bill approved by the House census subcommittee calls for a
count of all Americans living outside the country. For purposes of
House seats, those people would be considered residents of
whichever state they last lived in for a period of at least six
months.
   The bill now goes to the full Post Office and Civil Service
committee. It's future is uncertain.
   The Justice Department has raised questions about the
constitutionality of apportioning among the states people living
overaseas.
   The Commerce Department, parent agency of the Census Bureau,
also opposes the requirement, contending that it would not have
enough time to plan and budget for the large and costly overseas
effort, and pointing out that administrative records do not exist
to show the past residence of many people.
   The Census Bureau has reached an agreement with the Defense
Department to count military personnel overseas. Pentagon officials
last year estimated that there were 506,000 military personnel and
385,000 of their dependents in foreign posts.
   However, there are also unknown numbers of federal civilian
workers and their dependents overseas. These include employees of
11 cabinet departments and 17 different federal agencies, spread
across 160 foreign nations, according to the Office of Personnel
Management.
   There are also Americans in private business living overseas,
and no records are kept of them.
   Past efforts to estimate the number of overseas residents who
come from various states have run into problems. Many military
personnel, for example, listed as home the coastal community from
which they shipped out or, in other cases, claimed as their usual
residence one of the states which has no personal income tax.
   If the measure should become law, however, it could have an
impact on the number of House seats distributed to various states
following the 1990 Census.
   The private Election Data Services company estimated in April
that a 18 states stand to gain or lose House seats following that
head count.
   But while that company's figures showed Pennsylvania losing
three House seats, the state was only 14,762 residents short of
retaining one of those seats. Minnesota, on the other hand, held
onto one of its seats by a margin of only 5,390 people.
   Thus, if the overseas count boosted Pennsylvania at the expense
of Minnesota, a House seat could easily shift between those two
states. Other shifts might also be possible, depending on which
states gained or lost in the overseas count.
   The other side of the apportionment coin, counting illegal
aliens, remains at issue, with the matter currently before a
federal court.
   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the census
subcommittee, announced that he and Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif,. are
seeking to intervene in that suit in support of continuing to count
aliens in the census. Excluding them can only be done through
Constitutional amendment, said Dymally.
   The suit seeking to block the counting of aliens was brought by
Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis., and a coalition of other congressmen and
private groups.

   A high-pressure system caused the mercury to plunge in parts of
the Northeast and upper Midwest today, while fierce winds ripped
off roofs, downed power lines and toppled a 75-foot-tall pine tree
in the South.
   Frost and freeze warnings were posted this morning from southern
New York into Pennsylvania's northern mountains. Frost and freeze
advisories covered parts of central and northeast Wisconsin and
northern Michigan.
   Meanwhile, thunderstorms drenched parts of the Southeast. The
storms extended from eastern North Carolina through much of South
Carolina into the central Gulf Coast region.
   In Georgia, strong winds ripped a roof off a house and a barn
Thursday night in Bullard, while trees and power lines were downed
in parts of Macon, Irwinton and Toomesboro. The winds toppled a
75-foot pine tree as the storms moved through an area near
Charlotte, N.C.
   The storm system brought rain to some drought-stricken areas,
along with crop-damaging hail. ``It was not a lot of rain, but
every little bit helps,'' said Joe M. Peliffier, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service at North Carolina's
Raleigh-Durham International Airport.
   New Orleans was inundated by 3\ inches of rain within an hour
early this morning.
   Thunderstorms also moved across parts of eastern Colorado and
extreme northwest Kansas into north-central New Mexico late
Thursday and early today.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms along the
coast of the Carolinas, Georgia and across Florida; showers in the
Pacific Northwest into northwest Montana; and sunny skies over much
of the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 60s and 70s from
New England across the Carolinas, from the inland portion of the
central Gulf of Mexico states across the Great Lakes, from Arkansas
across Missouri, and along the Pacific Coast; 100 to 110 from
southwest Texas across the desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s
in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 32 at
Bradford, Pa., to 88 at Del Rio, Texas.

   Protesters angry at the slaying of a
man shot by an off-duty police detective roamed downtown following
the man's funeral, throwing rocks and bottles at officers and
looting stores, authorities said.
   Sixteen people were arrested and several police received minor
injuries in the confrontation late Thursday, the second straight
night the town's Hispanic community had turned out to denounce
Monday's shootings of Carmen Castro Coria, 25, and his 27-year-old
brother, Matteo.
   Carmen Coria died instantly from a bullet wound to the head, and
his brother, shot four times, was in critical condition at Robert
Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.
   Sgt. Allen Fuller, an off-duty detective, and the victims had
been drinking at the same bar when Fuller tried to break up a fight
outside, said Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan Rockoff. Carmen
Coria apparently threatened the officer with a beer bottle, he said.
   Fuller has been suspended with pay while Rockoff's office
investigates the incident. Protesters claim the shooting is only
the latest example of police brutality and harassment, and they
want a special prosecutor to handle the investigation.
   About 1,000 people attended a funeral Mass for Coria on Thursday
evening. As the crowd began to disperse afterward, smaller groups
on foot or in cars roamed through downtown, overturning a car,
breaking store windows and looting, said police Capt. James Volosin.
   Many followed the hearse back to the funeral home, near police
headquarters. Some threw rocks and bottles at the 25 officers in
riot gear standing by, Volosin said. One unidentified officer was
admitted for observation at Raritan Bay Medical Center after being
hit with a bottle, and several others suffered minor injuries, he
said.
   Most of those arrested were charged with criminal mischief, with
the remainder facing charges of assault on a police officer, said
Volosin. All were held overnight in the city jail.
   Police reported the streets were quiet by 1 a.m. today.
   Earlier Thursday, civil leaders met with Mayor George J.
Otlowski to demand that a forum be held so members of the Hispanic
community can air grievances.
   Otlowski said a community relations team was being formed.
   On Wednesday, about 500 people held a rally in a park across
from City Hall after a city council meeting. Windows were broken at
City Hall and some downtown businesses, police said.

   A former Eagle Scout who
sought his own execution for the sex-related murders of five boys
went calmly to his death today, saying, ``Though perhaps too little
too late, I am doing the right thing now.''
   Arthur Gary Bishop, a 36-year-old former bookkeeper and
excommunicated Mormon, was pronounced dead by injection at Utah
State Prison at 12:16 a.m., said Myron March, Department of
Corrections director of field operations.
   ``Give my apologies to the families of the victims,'' were
Bishop's last spoken words, said Warden Jerry Cook.
   ``He went peacefully to the execution chamber,'' March said.
   Three drugs in succession _ sodium pentothal, the muscle
relaxant Pavulon and potassium chloride _ were dripped
intravenously into Bishop's right arm. The former Mormon
missionary, clad in a white jumpsuit and strapped to a gurney
appeared to stop breathing a minute after the injection began at
12:09 a.m. He was pronounced dead eight minutes later.
   Bishop, who strangled, shot or bludgeoned and drowned his
victims, told police he got sexual pleasure out of seeing their
bodies naked afterwards. He said he relived his first murder by
buying and killing as many as 20 puppies.
   He was the 99th person to be executed in this country and the
third in Utah since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ended a
nationwide moratorium on capital punishment. The first to die was
convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who was executed by a firing squad
at the same prison in early 1977.
   Bishop decided earlier this year to shun further appeals and be
executed, an act of contrition he hoped would bring peace to his
victims' families.
   ``With great sadness and remorse, I realize that I allowed
myself to be misled by Satan, and as a result, my life has been
marked by wicked, perverse and depraved actions,'' he wrote in a
final statement released after his execution.
   ``At this time I want to offer again my most profound and
heartfelt apologies to my victims' families,'' he wrote. ``I am
truly sorry.''
   Bishop wrote that he hoped ``my death may help others to find
relief and forgiveness. ... Though perhaps too little too late, I
am doing the right thing now.''
   In the hours before his execution, Bishop pored over the Bible
and Mormon scriptures, and prayed and met with clergy.
   Mormon Bishop Heber Geurts, a volunteer chaplain at the prison,
said Bishop was calm and cool, and was ``the most sorrowful and
repentent and remorseful man'' of the thousands of inmates he'd
seen in 33 years.
   About 30 people held a candlelight vigil outside the prison
before Bishop's execution.
   ``We have to be here tonight to show our opposition to the whole
policy of capital punishment,'' said Grady Walker of the Utah
Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. ``Most of us are keenly
aware of what he did. We simply feel that adding Bishop's corpse
will not bring those five children back or undo what Bishop has
done.''
   A few demonstrators, however, came to voice their support of
capital punishment. Sandra Wiggins said she and her young brother
came in memory of Bishop's victims and their families.
   ``I'm a mother myself,'' she said. ``I came to let them know I'm
thinking of them.''
   Bishop was convicted in 1984 of the murders of Alonzo Daniels,
4; Kim Peterson, 11; Danny Davis, 4; Troy Ward, 6; and Graeme
Cunningham, 13, in Salt Lake County between 1979 and 1983.
   According to the account Bishop gave investigators, Alonzo, his
first victim, was killed after Bishop lured him into his apartment
with an offer of candy. When Bishop tried to fondle the boy, the
child cried and threatened to tell his mother.
   Panicking, Bishop struck Alonzo on the head with a hammer. The
boy fell to the floor crying, and Bishop took him to the bathroom
and drowned him in the tub.
   Bishop told police he fondled the body and mutilated the
genitals with a knife.
   He carried the body out in a box past a woman, apparently
Daniels' mother, who was frantically calling the boy's name.
   In the months that followed, he relived the experience by buying
and killing 15 or 20 puppies.
   ``It was so stimulating,'' he said. ``A puppy whines just like
Alonzo did. I would get frustrated at the whining. I would hit them
with hammers or drown them or strangle them.''
   Bishop went on to kill Kim, Danny, Troy and Graeme, in that
order.
   He confessed to Graeme's murder under police questioning.
   Describing why he killed, he inadvertently said, ``I get a
sexual pleasure out of seeing them naked afterwards.''
   Detectives pounced on the plural pronoun, and within minutes
Bishop confessed to the other murders. He later led police to the
boys' graves.

<HEAD>CDC Recommends Hepatitis B Tests For All Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials, saying testing only
high-risk women has not worked, are now recommending hepatitis
testing for all pregnant women and immediate vaccinations, if
necessary, for their babies.
   The new recommendation, announced Thursday by the national
Centers for Disease Control, is aimed at preventing some 3,500
American babies each year from becoming carriers of type-B
hepatitis.
   Each year in the United States, about 16,500 babies are born to
mothers with hepatitis B infections, the CDC said. About 3,500 of
those infants become chronic hepatitis B carriers, and it is
estimated that more than 25 percent of them will die of liver
cancer or cirrhosis.
   In 1984 the CDC recommended hepatitis B tests for women in
high-risk groups, such as intravenous drug users and some venereal
disease patients. But the agency said Thursday that many
obstetricians don't know what the high-risk groups are, and the
plan has not worked.
   ``It is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women
is the only strategy that will provide acceptable control'' of
mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission, the Atlanta-based CDC
said.
   The CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee said
pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis B during an early
prenatal visit. If a woman is infected, her baby should receive
hepatitis B immune globulin, preferably within 12 hours of birth,
to provide immediate protection, and hepatitis B vaccine within
seven days and again at 1 month and 6 months.
   Such a routine is between 85 percent and 95 percent effective in
preventing a child from becoming a chronic hepatitis B carrier, CDC
researchers said.
   ``Hepatitis B vaccine is the first human vaccine that can
prevent both serious chronic disease and a uniformly fatal type of
cancer,'' the CDC noted.
   Still, vaccinating every newborn child in the United States for
hepatitis B is not currently practical from a cost standpoint, said
Dr. Mark Kane, a CDC hepatitis specialist. A child's vaccine
regimen costs $60 or more, he said.
   In addition to intravenous drug users and people who have had
multiple venereal disease infections, other high-risk categories
are homosexually active men and medical personnel exposed to blood
on the job, the CDC said.
   Kane said studies have shown that the CDC's previous
recommendations were inadequate.
   In one study, for example, 40 percent of obstetricians couldn't
name more than two high-risk groups for hepatitis B and 72 percent
didn't know the recommended treatment for infants born to infected
mothers, the CDC said.
   In addition, studies in several inner-city hospitals that test
all pregnant women found that only 35 percent to 65 percent of
those infected would fall under the old guidelines.
   Hepatitis B is one of the two most common forms of hepatitis, a
serious inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B is transmitted
chiefly in the blood. There is not yet a vaccine for hepatitis A,
which is most commonly associated with poor hygiene.
   About 25,000 cases of each type occur in the United States each
year.

   The home affairs minister has
asked his staff to prepare a report on whether the British
Broadcasting Co. should be expelled from South Africa, the ministry
said today.
   On Thursday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok suggested that
the BBC might be ordered out because of a film it broadcast in
Britain this week about detained black children in South Africa.
   ``Naturally, the BBC regrets any action which would further
impede its coverage from South Africa,'' BBC spokesman John
Moulding said in London today. Asked whether the BBC was justified
is televising the film, he said: ``We're satisfied with the
journalistic integrity of the film.''
   In Johannesburg, Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha, who is in
charge of foreign press credentials, instructed his staff to ``look
into the presence of the BBC in South Africa and report to him,''
the ministry said.
   It said Botha might issue a statement on the matter next week.
   The South African government had appealed to the BBC for a
chance to view the film, ``Suffer the Children,'' before it was
broadcast Wednesday night. The BBC refused.
   The BBC said it had commissioned the report from an independent
London-based company, Penumbra, which filmed inside South Africa
without government permission and without seeking police comment
because of emergency restrictions on the news media.
   Vlok said Thursday that a BBC spokesman had phoned his office
Wednesday, asking for comment on allegations in the film about
torture of children during police interrogation. Vlok said that
when his press spokesman, Leon Mellet, asked the BBC why the
comment had not been sought earlier, the interviewer had said,
``Quite frankly, the BBC does not believe the South African
government.''
   Vlok said, ``If this is the BBC's attitude, then why should the
South African government continue to host their representatives in
our country?''

   A woman who went into labor on a flight
to Charlotte got to an ambulance with 10 minutes to spare, thanks
to air traffic controllers who rerouted rush-hour air traffic and
cleared taxiways for the woman's plane.
   A baby girl was born to the 22-year-old woman in the ambulance,
which had to pull off the road before reaching Presbyterian
Hospital.
   The race with the stork began shortly after 8 a.m. Thursday when
the pilot of Piedmont Airlines Flight 300 from Birmingham, Ala., to
Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham asked controllers to get him down and
to a ramp in a hurry.
   Air traffic controllers summoned an ambulance while rerouting
eight to 10 planes. When the flight touched down at
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, controllers held other
planes while it pulled up to a gate.
   A medical emergency team rushed the woman into the waiting
ambulance and sped off to the hospital.
   On Thursday afternoon, as she was recovering, the woman, who
requested that her name not be released, received an unexpected
memento of the early arrival _ a vase of roses and a card from the
airport controllers.

<HEAD>State Council Votes to Reduce Intern and Resident Work Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New hospital rules curtailing the long hours
that dull the reactions of interns and residents mean they will
ultimately become better doctors, the state health commissioner
says.
   Under the rules adopted Thursday, doctors training at hospitals
in the state will no longer be scheduled for 36-hour shifts and
100-hour-plus work weeks.
   The action curbs a training system for doctors that some
considered a rite of passage but that critics have condemned as
part hazing, part labor exploitation and dangerous to patients.
   The commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, a champion of the reforms,
said he expected the state's action to spearhead a national trend.
   New York, with 13,000 residents and interns, has 16 percent of
the nation's doctors in training, while an additional 6 percent are
to be found in teaching hospitals in neighboring Massachusetts,
where similar rules are about to be adopted, Axelrod said.
   ``Ultimately, these regulations will mean that we have better
trained physicians and a higher quality of care,'' he said.
   A review of doctor training began in the wake of a grand jury
report citing faulty hospital care in the 1984 death of Libby Zion,
18-year-old daughter of writer Sidney Zion.
   The new rules put a 12-hour limit on emergency room shifts for
interns, residents and attending physicians.
   In other services, young doctors will not be required to put in
more than 24 hours a shift and their work week may not average more
than 80 hours during any four consecutive weeks. They will have at
least eight free hours between work shifts, at least one full day
off every week, and will be barred from moonlighting at other
hospitals.
   The 32-member State Hospital Review and Planning Council adopted
the code revisions without dissent.
   Axelrod said the 12-hour emergency room shift, which is to take
effect Oct. 1, already is being followed in 95 percent of the
state's teaching hospitals. Most of the other new rules will go
into effect July 1, 1989.
   In the past, Axelrod said, grueling hours have led interns to
refer to some patients as ``gomers,'' which stands for ``get out of
my emergency room.''
   ``I think we'll see a change in the way they view the
patients,'' the commissioner said. ``I think we will also see
better judgment by the physicians in training because they will no
longer be sleep-deprived and fatigued.''
   Miss Zion's father, who has been campaigning to curb interns'
working hours since his daughter's death, said Thursday he welcomed
the changes.
   ``At least Libby didn't die in vain,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Jet lag hamstrings tens of millions of travelers
annually, and most don't know how to combat it, although proven
stategies exist to reduce or eliminate it, a new survey indicates.
   The survey found that 94 percent of people jetting across three
or more time zones suffered symptoms of jet lag, and 45 percent
were bothered severely, yet less than half tried to do anything
about it.
   ``If you ask the average person what could he or she do, most
might only say, `Take a semi-rest the first day or two when you
arrive,''' said Dr. Michael Irwin, medical director of the United
Nations.
   Yet, he said, several ways of coping are known to be helpful.
   Irwin was in Chicago on Thursday to discuss findings of the poll
of 784 long-distance travelers. The study, commissioned by the
Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., was conducted by pollsters R.L.
Associates of Princeton, N.J., with the help of United Airlines and
British Airways.
   Symptoms that bothered more than nine of 10 included fatigue,
sleeplessness, impaired concentration, slowed reflexes,
irritablity, upset digestion, hunger at odd hours and-or
depression, the survey found.
   Yet only about 45 percent of the total said they did anything to
avoid the ill effects, it said.
   Those who did make an effort most commonly avoided alcohol on
the flight, rested a few days on arrival, exercised daily on
arrival, adjusted sleeping patterns before leaving or used a
short-term sleeping medication the first night or two in the new
place.
   ``Most people still don't realize to avoid alcohol on the
plane,'' said Irwin, whose interest in the problem of jet lag
developed from his duties overseeing the health of U.N. staff.
   ``The reason is that the combination of dry air inside the plane
_ less than 5 percent humidity _ with the alcohol makes you very
dehydrated, and it's harder to adjust to a different time zone.''
   He said at least 100 biochemical and hormonal rhythms exist in
the body, which govern daily cycles such as sleep, and all suffer
with dehydration.
   Jet lag is worse flying from west to east, as evidenced by the
finding that 23 percent of East Coast travelers to Europe reported
severe jet lag, while only 14 percent had severe problems on the
reverse trip, the survey said.
   On long trips _ crossing three or four time zones _ exercising
outdoors can do much toward resetting the biological clock, Irwin
said.
   He said it would be ideal to exercise in morning daylight after
an eastward flight, to help the body to adjust to an earlier day,
and in evening daylight after a westward flight, to help the body
to adjust to a later day.
   Short-acting sleeping medications, known as benzodiazepines, are
also very useful to help readjust sleeping patterns the first day
or two after arrival, without causing grogginess during normal
waking hours, he said.
   ``Only take medication prescribed by a doctor, not something
given by a friend or (bought) over the counter,'' Irwin said.
   The travelers surveyed had made at least two round-trips of
5,000 miles, once eastward and once westward, in the 24 months
before the survey in June 1987, said Upjohn spokesman Leonard H.
Gross.
   U.S. airlines carried more than 29 million passengers on
international flights from June 1985 through May 1986, the company
said. Even if only half flew east or west, the survey suggests the
number of people suffering jet lag is huge, the company said.

   Conservatives angry at Solicitor General
Charles Fried for hiring a deputy they view as too liberal want
Fried dismissed unless the solicitor general urges the Supreme
Court to overrule a major civil rights precedent.
   Fried is the department's No. 4 official who, after considering
resigning in March, has stayed on despite a wave of protest
resignations and departures by top aides to Attorney General Edwin
Meese III over the past 2{ months.
   ``We urge you to relieve Mr. Fried of his responsibilities'' if
the solicitor general refuses to file a brief supporting reversal
of the precedent, Paul Kamenar, executive legal director of the
Washington Legal Foundation, said in a letter to Meese.
   Fried is considering what position the government should take in
response to the court's 5-4 vote to invite arguments in Runyon v.
McCrary. In that 1976 case, the court ruled that a civil rights law
from the Reconstruction era could be used to desegregate private
schools and to seek damages for racial discrimination in a wide
range of areas.
   Kamenar's letter Wednesday also criticized Fried's decision to
hire, with Meese's approval, Harvard Law School professor David
Shapiro as deputy solicitor general.
   Shapiro wrote a 1976 law review article criticizing Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist as a judge who is inflexibile
and whose performance on the bench is below his capabilities
because of his unyielding ideology. Department officials
successfully pushed for Rehnquist's elevation to chief justice.
   Justice Department conservatives were angry over the naming of
Shapiro, say department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The conservative weekly ``Human Events'' calls Shapiro a
``liberal'' and says he should not have been hired by Fried and
approved by Meese.
   Fried's selection of Shapiro comes at a period when Meese, beset
by legal problems and trying to hang onto his job, wants as many
top officials as possible to remain in place to avoid the
perception that the department is in trouble.
   Meese was informed ahead of time about Fried's plans to hire
Shapiro and was told of his background, Justice Department
spokesman Patrick Korten said today.
   ``The attorney general has always permitted department heads to
choose their own deputies,'' said Korten. The department spokesman
denied that Meese was giving Fried a free hand to keep the
solicitor general from leaving the Justice Department.
   Fried also has recently hired as lawyers in his office a clerk
to a liberal District of Columbia circuit court judge and another

<HEAD>YWCA in Tacoma Faces Loss of Affiliation for Hiring Male Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Young Women's Christian
Association say they will recommend dropping the 82-year-old local
Y from the national organization for hiring a male executive
director.
   Gwendolyn Calvert Baker, national YWCA executive director, and
national board member Marilynne Keyser failed Thursday to persuade
the local Y's 19-member board of directors to change their position
supporting the director.
   ``This association will continue as an association but will not
continue as a YWCA,'' Ms. Baker said.
   Alan Tiger, 34, hired as executive director on April 19, said he
expected the national organization to drop the local Y. The local
board gave him a unanimous vote of support Thursday night.
   The YWCA constitution limits membership to women and requires
that an executive director be female. Tiger is the first man chosen
for such a job at any Y in the country.
   ``We hired the best person for the job,'' said board member
Susan Ralph, one of three people who interviewed Tiger. ``I think
we can fight just as strong for women's issues _ if not stronger _
from this platform.
   ``If you're a Christian organization, you practice fal board at a meeting
June 21 in Chicago, Ms. Keyser said.
   Once disaffiliated, the Tacoma Y will be barred from using the
YWCA name or symbol; however, local board members said all
operations would continue under funding commitments from the city
and United Way.
   Officials of the city and the United Way, which together provide
more than $300,000 of the Y's annual $577,000 budget, said this
week that funding might be jeopardized if Tiger were fired because
he was a man.
   Tiger said he planned to continue building the local
organization as a provider of services for women, girls and
families in Pierce County, which includes Tacoma and has a
population of 485,000.
   ``We don't consider what we're doing here as a statement,'' he
said. ``We simply want to provide services.''

<HEAD>Writers, Producers Talk for Eighth Straight Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking scriptwriters ended a 19-hour
bargaining session with producers this morning but declined to say
whether they were nearing settlement of the 14-week-old strike.
   However, another round of bargaining was scheduled for this
afternoon.
   The latest negotiations, which began at 11 a.m. Thursday, ended
at 6:30 a.m. today, said Cheryl Rhoden, a spokeswoman for the
Writers Guild of America. The talks were scheduled to resume at 4
p.m., she said.
   Today marked the eighth straight day writers have met with
representatives of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers. Both sides have refused to disclose what is being
discussed, calling the bargaining sensitive.
   However, the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety reported
Thursday its sources said there was some basis for optimism in the
negotiations between the producers and representatives of the guild.
   ``We are still meeting, and still hopeful this thing will come
to a conclusion and we can get back to work,'' said alliance
spokesman Herb Steinberg.
   Facing both sides is the start of the fall television production
season, which usually begins the last week in June and first week
of July. The CBS network has already announced a two-month delay
for the debut of its new shows, blaming the strike.
   ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard told affiliates in
Los Angeles on Wednesday that the No. 2 network plans to begin its
season in October.
   ABC-TV Network Group President John Sias denied the writers
strike had any effect on his network's decision to open the season
later than usual. He cited the Summer Olympic Games and the World
Series, both on No.1-rated NBC, as the chief reason for the move.
   Scriptwriters called the industrywide work halt March 7, when
contract talks broke down over the issues of creative control on
the set and payments made for TV residuals, or reruns.
   The strike has stalled TV and movie productions, with the
exception of a few independent producers that have signed
independent contracts with the WGA.
   The 9,000-member guild has signed full-term contracts with about
80 independent producers, but the alliance contends none of its
large members have signed and the producers who did defect employ
only a fraction of the 3,000 active writers.

Homeland</HEAD>

   The six-month-old uprising on the West Bank has
erased Palestinian fear of Israel and changed the rules in the
fight over the occupied territories, said two Palestinian Christian
leaders in urging Presbyterians to oppose Israeli and U.S. policy
in the region.
   ``The uprising has really changed things,'' the Rev. Naim Ateek
told reporters Thursday at the 200th General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
   Ateek, an ecumenical delegate to the meeting from the Episcopal
Church of Jerusalem and the Middle East, said peace efforts by
Secretary of State George Shultz have been doomed because he has a
``pre-uprising agenda.''
   The Presbyterians are considering resolutions calling on Israel
to end its 20-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and join in
a United Nations-sponsored international peace conference. Israel
captured the territories from Jordan and Egypt, respectively, in
the 1967 Six-Day War.
   The Palestinian discussion is one of a number of issues before
various committees of the assembly, which meet today and Saturday
before beginning their reports to the 630-member assembly. The
nine-day meeting ends Wednesday.
   Other topics include consideration of a report on ``Christian
Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' a controversial paper that has drawn
criticism within the 3 million-member denomination because of its
discussions of church support for those who choose to resist
government actions.
   Ateek said the Palestinians want a homeland alongside Israel.
His contacts with fellow Palestinians in east Jerusalem have led
him to believe that most have accepted the existence of Israel, he
said.
   However, the Palestine Liberation Organization, seen by most
Palestinians as their representative, does not officially recognize
Israel. Its constitution remains committed to the destruction of
the Jewish state.
   Ateek's conclusions were echoed by the Rev. Elias Chacour, a
priest in the Melkite church in Jerusalem who was awarded the
Peaceseeker Award today by the Presbyterian Peace Fellowship, a
sanctioned group with the denomination.
   Chacour told reporters Israel must deal with the Palestinians
soon because they have ``no more patience, no more possibility to
wait under intolerable conditions.''
   The paper before the Presbyterians accuses Israel of
``systematic violation of the human rights of Palestinians in the
occupied territories,'' especially through administrative
detention, collective punishment and torture of prisoners and
suspects and the deportation of dissidents.
   Recommendations addressing U.S. conduct include calling for
pressure on Israel to cease use of excessive force and supporting a
U.N. peace conference. The paper also opposes efforts to expel the
PLO's U.N. mission in New York.
   The ``Christian Obedience'' paper is undergoing a line-by-line
review by a subcommittee of the assembly's Committee on Peacemaking
and International Relations, the same assembly committee that will
address the Middle East paper.
   Objections center on what opponents say is encouragement of
denominational support for resisting the government on a variety of
issues.
   The full assembly will begin hearing committee reports Saturday
afternoon, but many of the more controversial issues won't be taken
up until next week.

   Nearly a century after the famed Dreyfus Affair
divided France, a statue of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus has unleashed a
debate over anti-Semitism, racial hatred, and the National Front
party.
   Culture Minister Jack Lang, who commissioned the statue and
spoke when it went on public display Thursday, said the attitudes
that led to the Jewish army officer's false conviction for treason
survive in today's France in the form of the extreme-right National
Front.
   The party's head, Jean-Marie Le Pen, ran on an anti-immigration
platform in April's first-round presidential elections and took a
surprising 14.4 percent of the vote.
   ``I didn't realize that my first act as a minister would
coincide with what we're living through on a moral and political
level,'' said Lang, who returned to his former post last month in a
new Socialist government.
   ``The National Front is the party of the anti-Dreyfusards,'' he
said, three days before runoff elections for National Assembly.
Lang spoke at the statue's new site in the Tuileries Gardens near
the Seine River.
   Le Pen denies accusations of racism and anti-Semitism.
   The Dreyfus affair was launched by French author Emile Zola in
his broadside ``J'Accuse'' (I Accuse), which charged that false
evidence with anti-Semitic motives was used to frame Dreyfus on
charges of giving military secrets to the Germans.
   The case raged for years, dividing France into pro-Dreyfusards
and anti-Dreyfusards. Zola fled the country to avoid punishment for
libel but was later cleared.
   The 11-foot-tall statue, which shows Dreyfus standing at
attention and holding a broken saber upright in front of his face,
sparked a public debate even before it was finished.
   In 1985, Lang proposed placing it in the Ecole Militaire
courtyard where Dreyfus was stripped of his rank and dishonored in
a ceremony on Jan. 5, 1895. That plan was opposed by Socialist
Defense Minister Charles Hernu, who said the courtyard was
inappropriate because it is closed to the public.
   It was widely thought, however, that many in the French army
objected to the statue, and the public debate was called a ``new
Dreyfus affair.''
   When the statue by sculptor Louis Mitelberg, who works under the
name ``Tim,'' was completed in 1986, the conservative government of
former Premier Jacques Chirac decided not to put it on public
display.
   Lang said he hoped the statue could be displayed near the
courthouse in central Paris where judicial proceedings eventually
cleared Dreyfus of any guilt 12 years after he was exiled to
Devil's Island. Dreyfus later was reinstated as a major in the army
and received the Legion of Honor.
   So far, the city administration under Chirac, who remains mayor
of Paris, has balked, Lang said. Because the Tuileries is national
property, the city's agreement was not needed to place the statue
there.
   Lang denied any political motive in bringing out the statue
three days before runoff elections for the National Assembly. But
he denounced the center-right coalition parties for making an
agreement with the National Front not to run candidates against
each other in a few key districts.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Rise in May</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with report on producer price

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices, led by the steepest increase in food costs
since January, rose a moderate 0.5 percent in May, the government
said today.
   If the May increase held steady for 12 straight months,
inflation at the wholesale level would be 5.8 percent, nearly
triple the modest 2 percent increase of the past 12 months, the
Labor Department said.
   The index for wholesale prices at the finished goods level minus
energy and food was up 0.3 percent. Analysts consider this a more
reliable indicator of underlying inflation because of the
month-to-month volatility of food and energy costs.
   Over the past year, wholesale prices excluding food and energy
have risen 2.8 percent.
   On Thursday, the government reported that U.S. businesses plan
the biggest increases in spending on new plant and equipment in
four years.
   The Commerce Department said the ambitious investment plans were
partly due to an improvement in the trade picture. But the
department also said announced that the trade deficit is shrinking
more slowly than previously reported.
   The stock market was mostly lower Thursday as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials, up 48.36 on Wednesday, slipped back 9.60
to 2,093.35.
   Bond prices slipped and interest rates rose as higher commodity
prices stirred concerns about inflation. The dollar also lost
ground.
   The Commerce Department said U.S. companies plan to increase
their spending on plant and equipment this year by 11.9 percent
over 1987.
   The increased investment, found in a May survey, was partly the
result of companies' gearing up to produce more goods for export
and replace imports with products made at home.
   If the projected 1988 increase in capital spending actually
occurs it will be the biggest gain in plant and equipment spending
since 1984, when spending shot up 16.6 percent as businesses
recovered from the 1981-82 recession.
   ``Manufacturing, especially in 1988, looks like it has very
aggressive plans. ... That's got to be good news,'' said David
Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass.
   However, Wyss warned that rising interest rates or renewed
trouble in the stock market could cause businesses to quickly scale
back expansion plans.
   In a separate report, the department recalculated its trade
statistics to account for seasonal patterns in shipments and found
the deficits came out bigger. The March deficit was put at $11.9
billion, 22 percent higher than the previously reported $9.7
billion.
   The non-adjusted figure of $9.7 billion for the March trade gap,
the best showing in three years, had been hailed by the Reagan
administration as solid evidence that the country's trade problems
had finally turned around.
   The administration said the new figures still showed an
improving trend, and private economists agreed.
   ``There is no reason to be discouraged by the new figures,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co.
   In another report, the Conference Board, a business-supported
research group, said pay increases should average about 5 percent
this year and next for the nation's salaried workers, narrowly
outpacing expected inflation.

   Security forces arrested a
Palestinian suspected of stabbing the Israeli-appointed mayor of a
West Bank town and demolished his cinderblock house today in the
Jelazoun refugee camp.
   Villagers said soldiers arrested Khamis Jawdat Faraj, 26, late
Thursday night. The army confirmed the arrest and said Faraj had
stalked the mayor and stabbed him as an act of Palestinian
nationalism.
   Arab news reports, meanwhile, said the army arrested two
Palestinian reporters and a writer in a continuing crackdown on
Arab journalists. An Israeli newspaper said the military may shut
down West Bank schools again.
   It took 30 minutes for a large, yellow bulldozer to destroy the
three-room house where Faraj lived with his 60-year-old mother.
Only an almond tree, plum tree and rose bush were left standing in
the yard after the demolition.
   ``They are destroying our house _ I don't know what for,'' said
the suspect's mother, Nozha Faraj, who watched the army operation
from next door.
   Faraj was arrested in connection with the stabbing Tuesday of
Hassan Tawil, the 74-year-old mayor of El Bireh. The army follows a
long-standing practice of demolishing the homes of suspects in what
it considers terrorist acts.
   Tawil was stabbed in the heart and was reported recovering.
   Faraj has been detained several times previously because of
alleged involvement in public disturbances, an army statement said.
``He followed the mayor's movements, intending to assassinate him,
and attempted to do so previously, without success,'' the statement
said.
   Underground leaflets issued by leaders of the six-month Arab
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have repeatedly
called for Israeli-appointed officials like Tawil to quit their
posts.
   More than 200 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in
the violence.
   The Hebrew daily newspaper Haaretz today quoted army sources as
saying schools could close again if students follow orders given in
underground leaflets to leave classes at noon.
   Schools used to recess at noon, but authorities have extended
classroom time to 12:30 p.m. or 1 p.m. to make up for the four
months schools were closed during the height of the uprising.
   A spokesman for the West Bank's military government could not be
reached for comment on the Haaretz report. On Thursday, a spokesman
said the army had no immediate plans to close schools again because
of increased violence.
   On Thursday, protests and a general strike in the occupied lands
marked six months of the ``intefadeh,'' or uprising.
   Ahmed Hassan Hawari, 17, was killed when he was shot in the head
by an Israeli officer in the village of Sebastiya near Nablus. The
army said he was about to throw a cement block at troops from a
terrace when he was shot.
   An 18-year-old youth and a 12-year-old girl were wounded in the
legs during a protest in the West Bank town of Tulkarem, hospital
officials said.
   The army said only one person was shot in the protest but said
two other protesters were wounded when dozens of Palestinians
attacked troops with bottles and stones in Nablus' Arab bazaar.
   A 40-year-old Arab motorist, Rouhi Mohammed Khaliya, died of
heart failure after his car was stoned a he passed the Dheishe
refugee camp near Bethlehem, the army command said.
   Israel radio said several cars carrying blue West Bank license
plates were stoned by Dheishe residents, apparently to enforce
compliance with the strike.
   The deaths brought the Palestinian death toll in the uprising to
204. More than 5,000 Palestinians have been injured and 5,000
jailed since the protests began Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have died.
   The latest arrests of journalists came on the eve of the
protests. The east Jerusalem newspaper Al Shaab said the army
arrested Bader Taleb Yassin Meky, a sports reporter, at his home in
Jericho.
   Al Ittihad, another Arabic-language paper, said Samir Subayhat,
a free- lance reporter from El Bireh, and Muhammad Ayub Abu-Hadrus,
a writer and teacher from the Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis, were
seized at their homes.
   A spokesman for the army said he could not confirm the reports
or explain why the writers were arrested. At least 30 journalists
have been arrested and 20 of them have been jailed without charges
or trial for up to six months, according to Al Haq, an Arab human
rights organization.

<TEXT>
   A jury has awarded $25 million to the parents of
two children who were crushed to death under the wheels of a truck
as they were crossing the street with their mother.
   The jury, finding that a ``Walk-Don't Walk'' sign was partly to
blame, awarded the money Thursday to building superintendent Ismet
Delosovic, 39, and his wife, Fatima, 34, in the deaths of their
children, Vaid, 3, and Blerini, 5. Court papers and attorneys gave
conflicting spellings of the elder child's name, which was also
spelled Blerim.
   The truck, driven by Stephen Rapczak, 25, of Garwood, N.J., and
owned by Higgins Trucking Co. of Clifton, N.J., hit the little boys
May 8, 1981, as they, their mother and baby brother were crossing a
street in Greenwich Village.
   The Delosovics' lawyer, Gary Pillersdorf, said the light didn't
give the four pedestrians enough time to cross the street, turning
green while they were in the crosswalk.
   Rapczak testified during the 4{-week trial that he was unable to
see the family, so he proceeded.
   The two boys were killed almost instantly. The mother and her
third child, 9-month-old Rizo, suffered superficial injuries.
   The jury found found Rapczak and Higgins Trucking 44 percent
liable, but the Delosovics had already settled with them for
$500,000.
   The remaining 56 percent of liability was divided equally
between International Harvester because of alleged poor design of
the truck and the city because of alleged poor design of an
intersection and an improperly functioning light.
   This means International Harvester must pay 28 percent of $25
million, or $7 million, and the city must pay the same.
   Both defendants said they will appeal the verdict as excessive,
Pillersdorf said.
   ``She will never know joy again. You could have given her $100
million. It wouldn't matter,'' he said of Mrs. Delosevic, who told
the New York Daily News and New York Post that she still caresses
the clothes of her dead children and talks to them every night.
   Pillsdorf said his client was so anguished after the accident
that she could not bear to feed her youngest child for a year, and
the two children she has had since then have been named after the
boys who were killed.
   Justice Edward Lehner, the trial judge, scheduled a July 15
hearing for motions on the verdict.

   George Rodrigue displayed his oil paintings
today on Capitol Hill, where he encountered more glasnost than he
found in the Soviet Union.
   Thirteen of the Cajun artist's paintings, which caused a stir at
the Moscow summit, were hung in a meeting room for a one-day show
co-sponsored by Louisiana Reps. Bob Livingston, a Republican, and
James Hayes, a Democrat.
   The show came a week after Rodrigue said a network television
crew smuggled his paintings out of the Soviet Union following an
exhibition during the Moscow summit. Two of Rodrigue's paintings
had been temporarily confiscated.
   ``It was a remarkable contrast to see President Reagan extolling
perestroika and glasnost, and at the very same time an American
artist sees his paintings ripped off the walls,'' Livingston said.
   Hayes said he and Livingston disagree politically on many
issues, but they are united in the idea that artists have a right
to express themselves.
   Rodrigue said he resorted to smuggling the paintings out of the
country after Soviet functionaries refused to hand over the
necessary exit permits so he could leave.
   Soviet officials wanted him to donate his portrait of Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, dressed in a yellow suit and carrying
a red flag. Rodrigue said he declined the offer unless he could
meet Gorbachev personally.
   The American television crew ``didn't have to go through
customs'' because they were on a plane that carried reporters who
covered the summit back to the United States, Rodrigue said.
   He refused to identify the network by name for fear it would be
subject to reprisals in the Soviet Union. No one answered the
telephone at the Soviet information office and a message was not
returned.
   Rodrigue, 43, of Lafayette, La., described his experience with
the Soviet bureaucracy as ``horrifying ... the worst show I ever
had.'' That contrasted with his view of ordinary Russians who were
``real nice,'' he said.
   Rodrigue was invited to the Moscow summit by a Soviet delegation
that hoped to create a Louisiana theme at Moscow's international
trade center, the heart of activity during the summit.
   The paintings were to hang in a restaurant where a Louisiana
chef served Cajun food.
   Rodrigue said his first disappointment was that ordinary Soviet
citizens were banned from the trade center so his paintings had
only limited exposure, primarily to American reporters and
officials.
   The day after he put up the oil paintings, Soviet officials
confiscated the one that showed Gorbachev and another depicting
President Reagan mounted on a white horse and wearing a cowboy hat.
   Officials gave conflicting reasons for the action, but Rodrigue
called them all ``real stupid.''
   ``They asked `Why wasn't Gorbachev on a horse?''' he said.
``Then they said the paintings were too expensive. ... Then they
asked why Reagan's painting did not have a sun in it.''
   He added: ``The bottom line really is they didn't want the
president hanging in a Russian restaurant. That's what I think.''
   Rodrigue speculated that widespread media attention on the
painting prompted the Soviets to reconsider. Two days before he was
to leave, they re-hung the two paintings.
   A few hours later, Rodrigue removed the paintings for good and
unsuccessfully asked for the exit permits.

   The University of Massachusetts' top
administrator has asked the faculty senate to investigate
allegations that a black professor was ousted from the
Afro-American studies department for his views.
   Circumstances surrounding professor Julius Lester's reassignment
to the Judaic studies department might be referred to the American
Association of University Professors for a formal investigation to
clear up ``serious and, in some cases, perhaps misleading
allegations,'' Chancellor Joseph Duffey said.
   Lester has accused the Afro-American studies department of
racism in objecting to his criticisms of the black community and of
such leaders as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the late author James
Baldwin.
   ``The department reacted (to the Baldwin criticism) as if I had
attacked every member,'' Lester has said. ``They're acting as if
James Baldwin is a person who is above criticism. ... In effect
they're kicking me out. If a white did this to a black faculty
member, people would say `racism.' It's no different if a black
person does it to a black faculty member. It's worse.''
   Department members met a few months ago to discuss Lester's
unorthodox views and voted to recommend that he be reassigned to
another department.
   Lester had already begun talks with administrators about leaving
the department when its members cast their vote. The reassignment
became official last week and was made with the approval of all
parties involved.
   In a letter, Duffey wrote Afro-American studies professor
Michael Thelwell on Thursday, he criticized the department for the
meeting and for a letter faculty members sent the dean of
humanities suggesting Lester ``would be infinitely more comfortable
in a different location.''
   ``Julius Lester represents the kind of teacher this university
cherishes,'' Duffey said Thursday.
   The department had written a 40-page report rebutting Lester's
claim in his book ``Lovesongs'' that Baldwin made anti-Semitic
remarks during a 1984 faculty discussion. The report included
transcripts of Baldwin's remarks.
   ``Because Baldwin represented a constant struggle with racism of
all forms, we took those charges to be grossly serious,'' Thelwell
said.
   Julius, 49, is a 17-year veteran of the department and the
winner of the university's most prestigious faculty awards.
   He gained notoriety in the 1960s as a spokesman for the black
power movement. Although he once broadcast a poem taunting Jews, he
converted to Judaism six years ago and has since irritated his
black colleagues with his opinions. He wrote an essay in 1984, for
example, accusing Jackson of posing as a messiah to blacks in his
quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.

   Iraq said its warplanes attacked a tanker
off Iran's Persian Gulf coast at dawn today, and shipping sources
said two seamen were killed in an earlier Iraqi air strike on a
salvage tugboat.
   The latest convoy of Kuwaiti tankers and their U.S. Navy escorts
passed through the Strait of Hormuz and sailed into the gulf today.
Two small boats that resembled Iranian speedboats approached the
convoy but did not attack.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as
saying the jets hit a ``large maritime target,'' which usually
means a tanker.
   The spokesman, who was not identified, said the marauding
fighter-bombers scored ``an accurate and effective hit'' on the
unidentified vessel.
   There was no independent confirmation of the Iraqi claim of an
attack today. But shipping sources in the gulf and the London-based
Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the 742-ton tug Salverve
was hit by an Iraqi missile Thursday in the northern gulf.
   Thursday's attack was the first confirmed Iraqi air raid on
Iranian shipping lanes in about four weeks.
   Lloyd's, which monitors shipping around the world, said two
crewmen were killed abord the Singapore-flag tug. Shipping
executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the casualties
were probably Filipinos.
   The Salverve has been hit twice before. It suffered no
casualties in the first attack July 7. But its British captain and
two Filipino crewmen were killed in a Jan. 28 raid, when the
Salverve was towing a tanker damaged in an Iraqi air strike the day
before.
   Salverve is owned by the Singapore-based Semco Salvage Ltd., one
of the salvage companies that regularly work with Iranians.
   More than a half-dozen salvage tugs, mainly Semco vessels, that
operate off the Iranian coast have been hit in the so-called
``tanker war,'' a spinoff from the Iran-Iraq conflict, which began
in September 1980.
   Iraqi warplanes regularly attack Iranian tankers, seeking to
choke off Tehran's vital oil exports which pay for its war effort.
The Iranians retaliate by attacking neutral commercial ships in the
waterway. The last confirmed Iraqi raid was on the Iran-flagged
tanker Bisoton May 16.
   The 36th U.S. convoy of the year _ three U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
oil carriers and two escorting warships _ departed from an assembly
area in the Gulf of Oman, steamed through the Strait of Hormuz and
entered the Persian Gulf early today.
   The convoy, guarded by the 3,880-ton guided missile frigate USS
Fahrion and the 7,810-ton destroyer USS John Hancock, was joined by
about nine other ships from other countries that tagged along for
the journey through the strait.
   The two vessels that approached to within two miles of the
convoy each carried two crew members but there was no sign of
weapons, said Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, a Navy spokesman with a
Pentagon news media pool aboard the Fahrion.
   Iran usually hits vessels sailing to or from Kuwait or Saudi
Arabia in its retaliatory strikes. It accuses both countries of
aiding Iraq.
   This prompted Kuwait last summer to re-register 11 of its
tankers in the United States to entitle them to U.S. Navy
protection.
   The U.S. Navy widened its protective role to non-American
vessels May 3 and said its warships would aid any vessel in their
vicinity if it was attacked by either side outside designated
exclusion zones.

<HEAD>Talk Show Host Draws Ire of Neighbors For Razing House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phil Donahue has razed an experimental,
all-concrete house despite criticism that he was destroying a
landmark, but the talk-show host questioned why the community let
the 26-year-old house fall into disrepair.
   ``Why didn't somebody take care of this building?'' Donahue said
after the building, next door to his classic Tudor-style mansion,
was demolished Wednesday. ``Where were all these caring people when
the building was unoccupied?''
   Donahue, who bought the concrete house and 7.2 acres of land
around it for $6 million two months ago, said he wanted more space,
privacy and security for his wife, actress Marlo Thomas, and their
family. He denied that he wanted to improve the view of Long Island
Sound from his mansion.
   Donahue said he didn't know about the house's architectural
significance and that it had become a hostel for ``vagrants, lovers
and other strangers'' who left behind ``empty beer cans and
McDonald's wrappers.''
   Some local historians described the concrete house as the
affluent town's most architecturally significant building, a piece
of sculpture as well as a structure.
   ``I still get knots in my stomach when I think about it,'' said
Mary McCahon, Westport's architectural historian. ``It was a
wonderful building. The best design in Westport. Tearing it down, I
think, on a scale of 1 to 10, is a 10. It's pretty bad.''
   John M. Johansen, the internationally known architect who
designed the house, said: ``This wasn't a very exemplary act from a
public figure. And they've nicknamed him `Mr. Sensitivity.'''
   The house, designed in what McCahon called a
contemporary-expressionist style, was built as a retirement cottage
for a wealthy physician.
   ``Many people who are expressing deep concern have never seen
the house, nor have they been in it,'' Donahue said, adding that
the house's style left him cold. ``I did not find this an inviting
home.''

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Has Decided to Sell Warplanes to Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has decided to sell
F-18 warplanes, America's most sophisticated fighter-bombers, to
the Persian Gulf nation of Kuwait, and will seek congressional
approval, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   The decision will be sent to Capitol Hill imminently, giving
Congress 50 days to approve or reject the sale, which could include
the transfer of up to 40 F-18s, according to an official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The administration wants to sell jets to Kuwait to help that
oil-rich gulf state defend against strikes by combatants in the
7-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
   Congressional opposition is possible, however, from members who
have noted that Kuwait, like other Arab nations, is technically in
a state of war with Israel. Some congressmen have also expressed
concern that selling advanced weapons to countries in the Persian
Gulf will increase tensions in the region.
   The official said administration representatives met privately
on Thursday with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
to explain the proposed sale.
   State Department spokesmen said last month that the
administration favored the sale of advanced jets to Kuwait but had
not decided whether to ask Congress to approve the transfer of
F-18s, or less powerful F-16s or F-15s.
   F-18s have been specially designed for equal effectiveness as
fighters and bombers. The F-15, the Air Force's hottest fighter, is
used mostly as an interceptor against other aircraft. The F-16 has
dual capabilities as a fighter and bomber, but according to
administration experts the F-18 can switch fighter-bomber roles
more quickly than the F-16.
   Only Australia, Canada and Spain _ all formal allies of the
United States _ have been permitted to buy F-18s.
   The official speaking today said the decision was made to pick
F-18s. If Kuwait purchases all 40 planes authorized, the contract
would be worth $1 billion to the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas.
   In the international arms market, the company competes heavily
with the French makers of the Mirage 2000 jet and administration
officials are eager to see an American concern get the Kuwaiti
contract.
   Kuwait reportedly also wants to purchase weapons the F-18 can
carry in its arsenal: Maverick air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air
Sidewinder missiles and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.

<HEAD>Scientists Directly Observe Pluto Atmosphere For First Time, NASA
Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with scientists saying observations show
Pluto has substantial atmosphere, details of findings. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists flying over the southern
Pacific Ocean directly observed the atmosphere of Pluto for the
first time, NASA has announced.
   While scientists previously had strong indirect evidence for the
existence of an atmosphere on the solar system's ninth planet, the
astronomers who viewed Pluto from a telescope aboard NASA's Kuiper
Airborne Observatory on Thursday got the first direct look at it,
said space agency spokeswoman Diane Stanley.
   The observations show that Pluto is surrounded by what appears
to be a substantial atmosphere, said J. Kelly Beatty, senior editor
for Sky & Telescope magazine, reporting in Friday's edition of The
Boston Globe. Beatty, who rode aboard the NASA aircraft, filed his
report from Pago Pago in American Samoa.
   The discovery of a significant atmosphere could end years of
debate over the extent of the atmosphere of Pluto, which averages
more than 3.7 billion miles from the sun in its orbit, Beatty said.
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers, flying at
an altitude of 41,000 feet, used a solid-state video camera
attached to a 36-inch telescope to watch the light of a star as the
tiny planet started to move in front of it.
   As the edge of the planet started to move in front of the star,
changes in the light confirmed the existence of the atmosphere,
said Stanley, a spokeswoman at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
   James Elliot and MIT colleague Edward W. Dunham said that Pluto
must be surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere because as the planet
passed in front of the star, the faint starlight disappeared and
reappeared gradually rather than abruptly.
   Elliot and Dunham said they are not yet sure what gases make up
Pluto's atmosphere, but possibilities include methane, argon,
nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide and neon.
   The observations were made about 3,500 miles south of Hawaii.
The airborne observatory flew out of Hawaii at 7:30 p.m. local time
Thursday and landed in Pago Pago 7{ hours later.
   In May 1987, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena published a study in the British journal Nature contending
that Pluto has a substantial atmosphere of methane, or natural gas.
They said observations of the planet in 1983 by the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite showed that Pluto's temperature was uniform
over its entire surface, something that could occur only if a
significant atmosphere existed.
   However, scientists from the University of Arizona and the
Planetary Science Institute, both in Tucson, published a
contradictory study last September in the journal Science. They
said that evidence from the same satellite suggested Pluto's
atmosphere was extremely thin, at least 900 times less dense than
Earth's atmosphere.
   Stanley said that the observations made Thursday will, after
analysis, provide information about the extent of Pluto's
atmosphere and its temperature and pressure.
   Pluto, which is thought to be half ice and half rock, usually is
thought of as the ninth planet from the sun, but because it has an
elongated elliptical orbit, it will be the eighth planet from the
sun until 1990, when it heads outward beyond Neptune's orbit.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha today
extended the two-year nationwide state of emergency for another
year and tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activity.
   Anti-apartheid leaders assailed the proclamation, which will
leave hundreds of prominent activists in jail without charge.
   The emergency regulations allow sweeping powers of detention,
outlaw many forms of peaceful anti-government protest and restrict
freedom of speech, press and assembly.
   White women from the Black Sash civil rights group stood along
highways in Johannesburg during the morning rush hour with posters
saying: ``Apartheid is the emergency.'' A multiracial crowd of 100
attended a vigil for the estimated 2,500 emergency detainees at
Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said extension of the emergency
``is a pointless and bankrupt exercise'' which ``aggravates South
Africa's crisis.''
   The Reagan administration had only a brief comment on the latest
development.
   ``This action underscores the need for a dialogue between the
government and the black opposition to bring about a fully
functioning non-racial democracy,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   In Tokyo, the Japanese government today criticized the extention
and urged South Africa to release political prisoners, permit
anti-apartheid activities and talk with the opposition.
   The outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, in a
statement from its headquarters in Zambia, said the government
sought ``to ensure its survival by continuing to resort to the most
brutal repression.''
   The ANC called for comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against
South Africa and said its guerrillas must escalate their attacks.
   Botha's announcement came two days after blacks ended their
biggest and longest general strike against the white-controlled
government. Black labor federations said today that about 2,000
workers who joined the protest have been fired and 1,000 more
subjected to various disciplinary actions.
   The new emergency decree took effect immediately upon government
publication. New press restrictions will bar all media from quoting
any member of an outlawed or restricted organization and require
local news agencies to register with the government.
   These domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive in their
coverage of anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered to submit all
their dispatches to a government censor before publication, the
regulations say.
   Journalists are already restricted in coverage of unrest,
security force action, treatment of emergency detainees and a wide
range of political statements the government considers subversive.
   Another section gives the government power to extend the
suspenions of two anti-apartheid newspapers, New Nation and South,
which were closed down in recent months. New Nation's editor,
Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been detained without charge since December
1986.
   ``It is indeed the aspiration of the government that conditions
will change to such an extent that the declared state of emergency
can be lifted,'' Botha said in a statement.
   ``We might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent state
of emergency,'' independent member of Parliament Jan van Eck told a
gathering in Johannesburg on Thursday. ``A minority regime will not
be able to govern this country without the very wide and very
arbitrary powers afforded by the state of emergency.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Despite banning of apartheid groups and restrictions on their
leaders, more than 2 million blacks stayed away from work, school
and shops from Monday to Wednesday. The strike was called to
protest these restrictions and oppose labor legislation that could
weaken black unions.
   Botha declared the nationwide emergency on June 12, 1986, after
two years of violence that claimed 1,700 lives.
   In February, 17 anti-apartheid organizations, including the
nationwide United Democratic Front coalition, were banned from all
political activity. The two front presidents and treasurer, the
last executive members not in hiding or in detention, were banned
from giving speeches or news interviews.
   About 40,000 people, including 10,000 children, have been
detained during the past two years, according to the now-banned
Detainees Parents Support Committee. They estimate 2,500 people are
still in prison.
   The government has refused to give definitive numbers of people
in detention.

<HEAD>Salvagers Find Gold Coins Off Florida's Treasure Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasure hunters have found hundreds of
Spanish gold coins on the ocean floor just off Florida's coast,
according to one of the state's most famous salvors.
   ``They found it today, this afternoon,'' an excited Mel Fisher
said Thursday.
   The Key West salvor and a friend, Demostines ``Mo'' Molinar,
first found gold in the area on April Fool's Day in 1964.
   Molinar, who now works a lease held by Fisher, found 455
two-escudo gold coins, an eight-escudo coin, a gold brooch inlaid
with diamonds and a golden lid to a jewelry box, Fisher said.
   John Brandon, chief of operations at the site, came up with 25
one-escudo coins, three ``dated Lima'' coins, seven four-escudo
coins and two eight-escudo coins.
   On July 31, 1715, a hurricane slammed into an 11-ship Spanish
fleet in Florida waters near Vero Beach and Fort Pierce, now
nicknamed the Treasure Coast. The fleet reportedly was carrying $14
million worth of gold, silver and jewels from Havana to Spain. Some
1,000 people died.
   Spaniards and pirates salvaged some of the sunken ships, but
most of those efforts stopped by 1720, archive records show. Little
thought was given the treasures until 1955, when retired builder
Kip Wagner mounted a search after finding a piece of eight on a
Florida beach. He eventually brought up about $1 million from four
of the ships.
   There are an estimated 5,000 shipwrecks lying off Florida's
coasts. Some contain treasure from the wrecks of Spanish fleets
that traveled from the New World to Spain between 1537 and 1778.
Most, including military vessels, coastal passenger steamers and
shrimp boats, are virtually worthless to anyone but archaeologists
and historians.
   In 1985, after years of searching, Fisher found the mother lode
from another Spanish ship sunk by a hurricane off Key West. Booty
from the Nuestra Senora de Atocha has been in the millions of
dollars.

   Some 33,000 pounds of refuse was carted
away from a house after it was declared unfit for human habitation,
the city's environmental health director said.
   That was 9,000 pounds more garbage than was generated in the
entire city after last October's World Series celebration, said the
director, Frank Staffenson.
   It took seven truckloads to remove the refuse. Cleanup was
completed Wednesday when the last of the garbage was removed,
rodent traps were placed inside, and the house was boarded up.
   ``As it stands now the house is condemned as unfit for human
habitation and will remain so until the repairs are made and the
utilities turned back on,'' said Staffenson.
   The house's owners, Michael and Deborah Eggert, have not been
available for comment. The couple's four children, who lived in the
house, have been placed in foster care.

<TEXT>
   Two vessels
resembling Iranian speedboats raced toward a convoy of U.S.
warships and Kuwaiti tankers, but veered off without attacking,
Navy officials said Friday.
   The speedboats came within two miles of the two U.S. warships
and three U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil carriers as they steamed
Thursday night through the Strait of Hormuz en route to the Persian
Gulf, the officials said.
   Nine other tankers, at least two of them with ``Philadelphia,
Pa.'' painted on their sterns, tagged along with the convoy as it
ran the gantlet of Iranian missile batteries and gunboats in the
strait.
   The 36th U.S. convoy of the year began its journey at the
so-called ``K-Mart parking lot,'' the convoy assembly area in the
Gulf of Oman.
   By the time the procession turned the corner past Oman's
flashing Didimar Light in the strait, it had swelled to at least 14
ships, according to officers aboard this 3,880-ton guided missile
frigate, which was taking part in its first escort mission since
arriving in the gulf earler in the week.
   The second escort was the 7,810-ton destroyer John Hancock, also
a new arrival, which recently accompanied another Kuwaiti tanker
down the gulf.
   The two vessels that rushed the convoy were Boston Whaler-type
speedboats, often used by Iran to attack neutral shipping in the
southern gulf.
   Each speedboat carried two crew members but there was no sign of
weapons, according to Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, a Navy spokesman
accompanying a Pentagon news media pool aboard the Fahrion.
   ``They just wanted to see who we were,'' said the frigate's
skipper, Cmdr. Thomas E. Plichta, of Charleston, S.C.
   Iran has carried out four gunboat raids on ships in the southern
gulf since May 3, when a tougher U.S. policy permitting American
warships to intervene in attacks on non-U.S. vessels went into
effect. In all four cases, however, no American ships were close
enough to act.
   The U.S. convoy was one of the largest this year and the 57th
since Washington agreed a year ago to reflag 11 Kuwaiti-owned oil
tankers and give them naval escort against Iranian attack. Iran
considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq, Iran's enemy in the Persian Gulf
war.
   The convoy included the 295,085-ton Middletown and the
80,000-ton Ocean City, oil products tankers, and the 48,725-ton
liquefied gas carrier Gas King.
   ``Tag alongs'' have become a regular feature of the American and
European convoys in the gulf, as merchant ships look for ways to
shield themselves from Iranian gunboat raids in the southern gulf
and strait.
   But rarely, if ever, has a convoy attracted as many as the nine
hitchhikers that sailed in front, behind and on both sides of the
convoy Friday.

<TEXT>
   Willie Williams, a 24-year police department
veteran, was sworn in today as the city's new police commissioner
and pledged to put more officers on the street despite budgetary
restraints.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode called today's ceremony a ``historic
occasion,'' although he did not specifically mention that Williams
is the first black to serve as police commissioner. Goode is the
city's first black mayor.
   Williams, 44, will succeed Kevin Tucker, who resigned to take a
job in private business after about 2{ years on the job. Tucker had
appointed Williams to the post of deputy commissioner.
   The new commissioner faces what police union officials say is a
crisis of manpower. He's under orders to reduce the 6,500-member
force by a reported 350 officers, or 5 percent.
   At the same time, the city is releasing hundreds of people from
its jails to get the prison population down to a court-mandated cap
of 3,750 inmates.
   Williams has said his major goal is to prevent any reduction of
the patrol force, which includes more than 3,000 uniformed police.
   He also said he would continue to battle street-corner drug
sales and try to modernize the police department's communications
system.
   Fraternal Order of Police president Robert Hurst today said
Goode had asked him to sit down with the new commissioner and
discuss how to cut police manpower. However, Hurst said he couldn't
do that, since his job was to fight for police offices, not to have
their numbers reduced.

<TEXT>
   A woman who says her dog was electrocuted by the
electric lights in a clothing store's Christmas display has filed a
$6.5 million lawsuit against the store.
   Rebecca Tachna, a 34-year-old graphic artist who filed suit
Thursday, said her 2-year-old golden retriever, Ruby, died Dec. 29
after stepping on a steel plate surrounding a decorated tree in
front of Barneys New York on Seventh Avenue.
   ``I got a call at work'' from a professional dog walker taking
care of the pet, ``and I came running immediately. She was already
gone,'' Ms. Tachna told the New York Post.
   ``Ruby was like a little kid to me,'' she said.
   A Barneys spokesman denied the store was responsible, the Post
said.

   Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
urged Democratic platform writers today to not turn the party's
election manifesto into a Yellow Pages listing of demands ``for
every organized group.''
   As a 16-member drafting committee opened work, the party
released a 2,000-word ``discussion paper'' penned by one-time John
F. Kennedy speechwriter Theodore Sorensen. Even before it was made
public, the Sorensen paper was drawing criticism from the campaigns
of Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson as not specific enough.
   The Sorensen paper, styled as a declaration by ``We the people
of the Democratic Party,'' denounces ``voodoo economics'' and
condemns ``South Africa's hateful apartheid, government-sponsored
terrorism.''
   Jackson has said the platform must denounce South Africa as a
terrorist state.
   Kirk, in an opening statement to the platform writers, said the
party needs ``a pragmatic, principled and positive statement that
American people can read and reflect upon and say, `That's the kind
of country I want my kids to grow up in.''
   ``We have to not only speak to ourselves, we have to remember
the so-called swing voters. Where are they going to end up in
November and where will their families end up in the 1990s?'' Kirk
asked.
   He told reporters as he departed that the Sorensen paper was ``a
starting point.'' He said he did not think the party needs to spell
out dollar figures or precise program goals in its platform.
   ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow Pages, an ad for
every organized group,'' he said.
   At a welcoming party Thursday night hosted by Michigan Gov.
James J. Blanchard at his summer residence on this resort island,
Kirk said he did not expect showdown votes at this weekend's
drafting sessions.
   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman who is Dukakis'
chief liaison with the platform committee, said the differences
between the two ``are not that great. It's not like Jesse Helms and
George McGovern. We're talking about two progressive Democrats.''
   Jackson has said repeatedly he wants the platform to feature
specific planks, including a denuncation of South Africa as a
terrorist state, elimination of voter registration restrictions,
and a shift of resources from the military to social programs.
   But it is a central theme of Jackson's own campaign, his promise
to raise taxes on the wealthy, that could cause the most discomfort
for Dukakis and party chieftains.
   Although Dukakis commands a delegate majority, Jackson's
24-percent share of delegates is large enough to force a floor
fight on any platform issues he chooses.
   Barnes told reporters that if Jackson seeks to bring a minority
report to the convention floor in Atlanta favoring tax increases,
``I can guarantee you it will be defeated.''
   The platform drafting committee is led by a Jackson supporter,
Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the House
Budget Committee. Barnes also said a working paper that Kirk
commissioned by Theodore Sorensen, once John F. Kennedy's
speechwriter, needed additional work.
   Democratic officials declined to make Sorensen's paper public
Thursday.
   Kirk said, ``It is a very positive first step in the process,
embracing all of the fundamental beliefs of our party.''
   The party chief also said ``there is a reference to South Africa
and terrorism'' in the paper, but did not elaborate.
   ``I can't remember a time the party's been more unified. We have
a tremendous opportunity. We see in our ranks common sense and a
sense of common purpose,'' said Kirk.
   The full 186-member platform committee will not meet until June
25-26 in Denver.
   Blanchard, its chairman, said in a recent interview he does not
expect a finished product out of the deliberations on Mackinac, a
sylvan retreat where horse-drawn wagons, not cars, ply the
lilac-lined roads.
   ``I don't think we'll know what the platform really contains
until we're at Atlanta, probably. But the sooner we can get a draft
to everyone, the more time we provide for discussion, debate, the
better off we'll be,'' Blanchard said.
   ``I think it's going to be quite hard-hitting and progressive on
things like women's rights and civil rights and traditional things
that we all feel strongly about,'' said Blanchard, adding:
   ``I would like a document that you could actually read at the
Democratic National Convention and people would listen to and stay
awake for.''

   The United States has asked the Soviet Union
and other countries to use their influence to attempt to insure a
peaceful summer Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, the White
House said today.
   ``We obviously are hopeful that the Olympics will go off without
any demonstrations or undue disruption,'' spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. ``We have raised this matter with the Soviet Union
in asking them to use their influence and we have spoken to all
countries who might have any influence to try to insure a peaceful
and successful Olympics in Seoul.''
   He said the issue was raised by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz in his meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze before the U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow
   He said as far as he knew it was not raised by President Reagan
in his summit meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Researcher Predict Italy Will Have Europe's Greatest AIDS Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy could be facing Europe's greatest AIDS threat
because of its high percentage of AIDS victims who are drug
abusers, an official said Friday at a medical conference.
   Researchers attending the four-day International Drug Abuse
Epidemiology Conference in Rome said drug abusers account for 64
percent of the 1,411 cases of AIDS reported in Italy through the
end of 1987.
   Donato Greco, an official with the Istituto Superiore Di Sanita
in Rome, said the percentage is the highest of any country in the
world.
   Greco said researchers have not determined why Italy has a
disproportionate concentration of AIDS cases among drug addicts.
   ``There is reason to believe that needle injection is a more
efficient means of transmission than sexual intercourse. This is
why (even though) our (Italian) epidemic started later, it is
running at higher speeds than other countries,'' Greco said.
   ``I'm sorry to say ...(Italy) will be the leading AIDS country
in Europe due to this very effective means of transmission,'' he
said.
   Estimates for heroin addicts in Italy range from 200,000 to
400,000.
   Sharing contaminated needles is one of the most effective means
to transmit acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The AIDS virus
attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a
wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or
before birth.

<HEAD>First U.S. Art Exhibit in 11 Years At Public Cultural Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American art is on display in a
public cultural center here for the first time since Marxist
Ethiopia became a staunch ally of the Soviet Union 11 years ago.
   U.S. Charge D'Affaires James Cheek opened the exhibit, ``U.S.A.
Printworks: Selections From the Brandywine Workshop Collections,''
Thursday night at the Addis Ababa City Hall Cultural Center.
   He said he hoped the art show would bring about a better
understanding of American art and society and encourage more
cultural exhanges between Ethiopia and the United States.
   The eight-day show came to Ethiopia after traveling extensively
throughout other parts of Africa, Latin American and Asia. It was
sponsored by the U.S. Embassy's Public Affairs office under the
U.S. government's cultural exchange program.
   The Brandywine Workshop was opened in Philadelphia, Penn., in
1972 by printer Allan Edmonds to provide access to sophisticated
printing techniques for artists.
   John Burns, the U.S. Embassy's public affairs spokesman, said
Friday his office sponsored an American art exhibition in Ethiopia
two years ago, but it was held in the Italian Cultural Center.
   He said the current exhibit marks the first time an American art
show has been held in a public cultural center in Ethiopia since
1977, when the government closed the U.S. Information Service and
the U.S. Military Assistance and Advisory Group office.
   Until Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in 1974, Ethiopia
was one of the West's staunchest allies. The nation turned to the
Soviet Union during its 1977-78 war with Somalia over a region of
eastern Ethiopia inhabited by ethnic Somalis known as the Ogaden.
   Cheek said the collection of prints from the Brandywine Workshop
collection were selected because they reflect the ethnic and
stylistic diversity in American art.
   Among the 34 artists whose works are represented in the exhibit
are Richard Hunt, of Chicago, and Sam Gillian, who was born in
Tupelo, Miss., but works in the Chicago area.
   Also represented in the show is Jules Olitski, a Soviet-born,
U.S.-educated artist based in New York. Olitski's works have been
shown in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of
American Art, and the Chicago Art Institute.

   The government cut off drinking water to
200,000 people after cancer-causing discharge from a chemical fire
flowed into the Loire River, authorities said Friday.
   An explosion and fire Wednesday night at the Protex factory in
Auzouer-en-Touraine, 15 miles northeast of Tours, injured one
person and sent phenol and metallic pollutants into the Brenne, a
tributary of the Loire.
   Protex produces synthetic carpets and other floor coverings.
   The government detected traces of phenol in the water supply
Thursday afternoon and immediately switched off water mains to
Tours and its northern suburbs, said Environment Minister Brice
Lalonde.
   Markets were mobbed with people buying emergency water supplies,
and the Interior Ministry shipped in potable water. The government
was conducting hourly checks on the water supply in the area.
   Lalonde said the government would take legal action against
Protex. The factory owners were ordered to secure the site to guard
against renewed spills, he said.
   Tours is 140 miles southwest of Paris in the Loire Valley, a
scenic and culinary center. The Brenne flows into the Loire a few
miles upstream of Tours.

   A Kenyan motorist who refused to give a
stranded government official a ride was jailed for three months for
``very unsocial behavior,'' press reports said Friday.
   Peter Makau, 36, a factory technician from Nairobi, pleaded
guilty Thursday in Eldoret Court to a charge of ``uttering words of
defiance and disobediency to a lawful authority, namely Yusuf
Haji,'' Nairobi newspapers said.
   Makau was driving through Eldoret in the Rift Valley region of
western Kenya last Wednesday when the commissioner, clad in his
official pith helmet and khaki uniform, hailed him for a ride. His
official car had broken down on the way to an official function.
   The commissioner, the top government official in the Rift Valley
province, was late.
   Makau told Haji, ``Go and find a GK (Government of Kenya
vehicle). My car is not a government vehicle.''
   The angry official reported the incident to local police.
   ``Government officials deserve respect,'' magistrate Njuguna
Kimani said when sentencing Makau to jail without the option of a
fine. ``The accused lacked respect.''

   The House ethics committee announced today
that it has voted to start an official inquiry into the financial
dealings of Speaker Jim Wright.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the panel voted
unanimously to probe six possible violations of the House rules.
   ``Last night, the committee ... voted a preliminary
investigation in the matter of Speaker Jim Wright,'' said Dixon.
``The speaker of the House has been notified and has pledged his
full cooperation.''
   The six areas to be formally investigated by the committee
include:
   _ The circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts for a friend
and constituent, Richard Moncrief, with whom Wright had an interest
in a private gas well venture.
   _ The circumstances surrounding Wright's intervention in a
matter before the Interior Department on behalf of Texas Oil & Gas
Co.
   _ Whether campaign funds were used to help pay for publication
of Wright's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' from which he
received a 55 percent royalty totaling some $55,000.
   _ Whether Wright improperly detailed a congressional aide and
used his office expense accounts to complete work on the book.
   _ Wright's use of a condominium in Fort Worth, Texas, which
belongs to friend and business partner George Mallick, for which
Wright reportedly pays expenses but no rent.
   _ The possible exercise of undue influence in dealings with
officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on behalf of Texas
savings and loan institutions.
   The committee authorized issuance of subpoenas for depositions
and records in connection with the inquiry.
   Wright, in advance of the committee announcement, today released
papers he said would refute charges that he violated ethics rules.
   But the speaker said he still welcomed an official inquiry.
   ``The committee properly wants to look very carefully and
exhaustively into each of the items of which I've been accused,''
said Wright, D-Texas. ``Ultimately I'm certain that exposure to all
the facts will assure the committee that there is no warrantable
charge.''
   Wright released an inch-thick sheaf of papers with a statement
saying they ``will demonstrate conclusively that my official
conduct has not violated any rule of the House.''
   The papers included news stories, letters between Wright and
past and present administration officials, financial disclosure
documents, copies of bank checks and statements, investment
information and documents relating to a book he wrote.
   ``There've been so many innuendos, so many planted stories, so
many reprints of stories that were inaccurate,'' Wright said, that
he had several times sought an inquiry in order to clear his name.
   The ethics panel, asked to investigate the speaker's financial
dealings, met privately for nearly 8{ hours on Thursday in its
second session on the topic.
   When the committee broke its meeting at 11:25 p.m. Thursday, the
lawmakers refused to say if any decisions had been made. The
committee has been weighing whether to launch a formal inquiry,
what the scope of such an inquiry should be, and whether to hire an
outside counsel to handle any inquiry.
   ``I am supremely confident, when all of it is seen out on the
table in the sunlight it will be absolutely clear to everyone''
that no House rules were violated, Wright told reporters on
Thursday. He had written and planned to publicly release a
``narrative account'' explaining his actions, he said.
   The complaint against Wright was filed by a political enemy,
Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. Common Cause, a non-profit group which
pushes for tighter government ethics standards, also called for an
investigation.
   Gingrich's complaint accused Wright of improperly lobbying U.S.
officials and the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on behalf of
oilmen with whom he had financial relationships.
   He also questioned the propriety of Wright's receiving royalties
at several times the standard rate for his book, ``Reflections of a
Public Man,'' which was published by a friend and campaign
contractor.
   News reports this week revealed that Wright used one of his
Capitol Hill staffers to help compile the book, which earned him
about $55,000.
   Wright is using a current staffer to work on a new book project,
and Gingrich has conceded that one of his aides worked on a book he
wrote.
   Wright's supporters have called the charges a Republican effort
to deflect criticism of ethical lapses in the Reagan administration
and the current controversy surrounding Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   Some Democrats were known to oppose the Republican request for
an outside counsel to probe the speaker, fearing it would aid the
GOP drive to equate the Wright and Meese cases in the public eye.
   The ethics committee, officially called the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, is the only House panel with equal
representation of the two parties _ six Democrats and six
Republicans.

   The Republican candidate to challenge Sen. Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md., in November has told party leaders he can't devote
the time needed to mount a proper campaign and will quit as the
party's candidate.
   Thomas L. Blair, 43, faced an uphill battle in his challenge to
Sarbanes, a two-term incumbent who won with 57 percent of the vote
in 1976 and 63 percent in 1982.
   The party's state central committee will choose a replacement
candidate, party officials said.
   In a letter to the chairman of the state GOP, Blair said he
regretted his ``present inability to conduct a full-time campaign
to retire Mr. Sarbanes from the Senate.'' Blair said in the letter
he faced ``intense pressures and business events.''
   Blair's office said he was unavailable for comment Thursday and
referred calls to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee in
Washington. Blair's letter was released through that office.
   One GOP source said the firm that took over Blair's health-care
management consulting firm wouldn't give him time off to campaign.

   The presidential contenders' comments are getting more pointed,
with Republican George Bush denouncing Democrat Michael Dukakis for
a ``flawed world view'' and the Dukakis camp charging
``mudslinging.'' But the Democrats' national chairman called today
for a positive party platform.
   Paul Kirk, addressing Democratic platform drafters on Mackinac
Island, Mich., said the party needs ``a pragmatic, principled and
positive statement that American people can read and reflect upon
and say, `That's the kind of country I want my kids to grow up
in.'''
   As for the specifics that many groups are demanding the platform
include, he said, ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow
Pages, an ad for every organized group.''
   Meanwhile, a pair of polls published today suggested the
Democratic ticket would be hurt if Jesse Jackson were Dukakis'
running mate. A USA Today-CNN survey indicated Dukakis has a clear
lead over Bush _ unless he picks Jackson as his running mate. And
an ABC-Washington Post poll suggested Jackson's presence on the
ticket would hurt Dukakis among key groups whose backing he needs
to win in November.
   Both Bush and Dukakis looked ready for a long hot summer leading
up to their respective parties' conventions. Although the
post-primary, pre-convention period traditionally marks a lull in
campaign activity, the two rivals are indicating they won't wait
for formal nominee status to begin their battle.
   ``There's no reason to wait till the World Series to start
swinging,'' said Bush, in Texas to address delegates at the state
GOP convention on Thursday. ``This is a new ball game _ spring
training is over.''
   The vice president criticized Dukakis' positions on a variety of
topics, saying the Massachusetts governor would raise taxes, plague
innocent taxpayers with IRS audits, weaken national defense, be
soft on crime and put forth an isolationist foreign policy.
   ``My opponent is an articulate defender of a flawed world
view,'' said Bush. ``His views and values are too often ... out of
the mainstream.''
   Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach said ``it's clear that
the vice president doesn't think his own record or vision can bring
him the votes he needs in November.''
   ``Given where George Bush is in the polls, I think it's no
surprise that he's chosen to spend his time mudslinging and tearing
down,'' Dach said.
   Late Thursday night on ABC-TV, Bush engaged ``Nightline'' anchor
Ted Koppel in combative debate, occasionally calling him ``Dan'' in
slips harking back to the vice president's 9-minute faceoff last
January with CBS' Dan Rather.
   As Rather had, Koppel questioned Bush closely on his knowledge
of the clandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran. Bush said, as he has
repeatedly, that he knew little of the arms dealing while it was
going on.
   In the midst of one pointed exchange, Koppel said to Bush that
``I find your answer ... inconsistent.''
   ``Well, that's your opinion,'' Bush said. ``You ask the
questions but you don't like the answer. What do you want me to
say?''
   A series of recent nationwide polls suggested Dukakis had the
edge in a faceoff with Bush, with some surveys putting the lead in
double digits.
   The latest such survey, the CNN-USA Today poll, gave Dukakis a
6-point lead over Bush, 45 percent to 39 percent.
   Dukakis became the certain Democratic nominee on Tuesday, when
the final four primaries of the season gave him the delegates he
needs for a first-ballot victory in Atlanta. Bush put away his GOP
rivals months ago.
   Three of those former opponents _ Kansas Sen. Bob Dole,
television evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemp _ were
joining Bush at a Republican ``unity conference'' today in Denver.
   And the Atlanta Constitution reported in today's editions that
former Dukakis rival Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. is planning to
endorse Dukakis, possibly during a Dukakis campaign trip through
the South next week.
   Jackson was out of public view on Thursday, resting up at the
posh La Costa resort outside San Diego. He held strategy meetings
with about a dozen top aides to map out his next moves.
   The ABC-Washington Post survey, published in today's editions of
the Post, said Jackson was the top choice of Democrats as a Dukakis
running mate, but that his presence on the ticket would badly erode
Dukakis' support among Southern Democrats, Reagan Democrats and
independent voters.
   And Dukakis' lead over Bush in the USA Today-CNN survey was
reversed when Jackson was added on as a running mate. With Jackson
on the ticket, Dukakis' 6-point lead changed to a 7-point deficit.
   The Post's poll of 656 Democrats, conducted May 19-25, had a
4-point margin of error. The USA Today survey of 1,253 registered
voters, was conducted June 6-9 and had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
   The Massachusetts governor attended a victory bash Thursday
night in Boston. He said he expected a ``tough and competitive''
campaign.
   In other campaign developments:
   _California video magnate Stuart Karl was charged Thursday with
illegally funneling money to the campaigns of Gary Hart and other
political candidates. A federal grand jury indictment accuses Karl
of conspiracy, false statement-concealment in a matter before a
government agency, making an illegal corporate contribution to a
federal candidate, making excessive contributions to a candidate
and making a campaign contribution in the name of another.
   _Dukakis' wife Kitty was released from Massachusetts General
Hospital on Thursday, six days after undergoing spinal surgery.
Mrs. Dukakis, 51, had two bone fragments taken from her hip and
fused to a pair of ruptured discs. The ruptured discs had been
putting dangerous pressure on her spinal cord.

   Sweden, the host of the fourth
international conference on AIDS, is campaigning against the deadly
disease with the same matter-of-fact openness that marks its
attitude toward sex.
   Swedes and other Scandinavians discuss AIDS in schools, make
condoms easily available, and in some places provide free
hypodermic needles to drug addicts.
   Tests to detect exposure to the AIDS virus are free to military
conscripts, pregnant women and prison inmates. Volunteers can be
tested at any psychiatric or venereal disease clinic.
   Scandinavia's public education campaign, aimed largely at
teen-agers, is conducted with explicitness that might be startling
in more conservative parts of the world.
   Even some Danish TV viewers complained about one ad showing a

sex can be fun.
   The Scandinavian model for campaigning against AIDS will be one
aspect of the conference beginning Sunday. It is drawing 6,500
experts from 125 countries to discuss scientific and social aspects
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   AIDS has hit Denmark the hardest of the Scandinavian countries,
afflicting 257 people and killing 134 of them. Authorities estimate
that as many as 15,000 Danes are infected with the AIDS-causing HIV
virus.
   Norway's National Health Directorate has established a special
AIDS unit to monitor the illness, which has killed 48 of Norway's
81 recorded AIDS victims. Another 688 Norwegians are registered HIV
carriers and an estimated 2,500 others may have the virus.
   An estimated 1,839 Swedes are known to carry the HIV virus. The
AIDS Delegation, a task force in Sweden's Social Ministry, says 89
Swedes have died of the 192 who contracted the disease.
   The Scandinavians have had a reputation for sexual freedom since
the 1967 Swedish movie, ``I Am Curious _ Yellow,'' brought nudity
to legitimate filmmaking.
   That image has been exaggerated by their lack of shyness about
discussing sex and their lifestyles. Sexual experimentation among
teen-agers is accepted here.
   Marriage also has gone out of fashion.
   Only half the Swedish couples who establish households go
through a wedding ceremony, and about half of Swedish children are
born to unwed parents. But separation is about as common as divorce
in other industrial countries, the experts say.
   In Swedish schools, where sex eductation begins in the pre-teen
years, students can obtain free condoms simply by asking the school
nurse, said Brigitta Hessulf of the AIDS Campaign.
   Swedish authorities sent 4 million pamphlets to homes earlier
this year to explain in graphic detail how the disease is
transmitted, she said.
   The drug culture also is a campaign target. Danish addicts can
anonymously obtain syringes from pharmacies and from dispensing
machines. In Sweden, a pilot program that will allow addicts to
exchange used needles for new ones is nearly complete in the
southern university town of Lund.
   In Norway, needles can be bought cheaply.
   The education campaign has not been an unqualified success. A
survey of 4,000 Swedes published Wednesday noted that
misconceptions still are common. It said 25 percent thought AIDS
could be transmitted by insects, even more than the 18 percent who
believed they could catch AIDS by kissing.
   But 27 percent said they had modified their sexual behavior
because of AIDS, compared with 11 percent in a poll two years ago.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   The Senate passed legislation today that would
permit the death penalty for drug dealers convicted of murder,
rejecting pleas that the measure would be a move toward ``reducing
the civility'' of society.
   The election-year legislation was sent to the House on a 65-29
vote. The bill's fate is less certain in that chamber, where the
House Judiciary Committee _ which will consider it _ has been
hostile to capital punishment legislation in the past.
   ``Murder is murder, whether legal or illegal,'' said Sen. Dan
Evans, R-Wash. ``We are reducing the civility and the compassion of
our society.''
   But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., the bill's sponsor, said, ``I
believe society has a right to say we are outraged at certain acts,
and the death penalty is the appropriate penalty in these cases.''
   Before final passage, lawmakers voted 66-28 to set aside a
provision by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., that would have limited the
bill's capital punishment provisions to drug dealers who are
convicted of killing law enforcement officers.
   On voice votes, they accepted a provision that would allow
prison employees to refuse to participate in executions, and
rejected language that would have required prisoners to be killed
in public. Both measures were sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore.
   On Thursday, the Senate voted 69-27 to shut off debate, ending a
filibuster by opponents who had stalled a vote.
   ``I'm not saying the death penalty will eliminate the drug
problem, but I do think it will serve as a deterrent,'' said
D'Amato.
   But opponents decried the bill as election-year politics, saying
it would do nothing to deter drug dealing and represented a cynical
response to public demands to do something about illegal drugs.
   Evans referred to a similar bill proposed in 1986 and said:
``Once again, we're going for an election-year slam dunk on drugs.
... We're taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political
vanity.''
   The D'Amato bill provides that the death penalty can be imposed
on people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug
ring and who are then separately convicted of killing law
enforcement officers or private citizens.
   Many states, including those with severe drug problems, already
have the death penalty and it hasn't had much deterrent effect,
opponents of the bill said.
   Before invoking cloture, the Senate voted 65-31 against an
amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment
without parole, instead of the death penalty, for people convicted
under the terms of D'Amato's bill.
   D'Amato's proposal was originally attached as an amendment to
the Pentagon budget bill, but opponents filibustered and D'Amato
withdrew his proposal in return for a promise by Senate leaders to
give him a vote on a separate bill.
   Supporters said the death penalty would deter drug kingpins.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``To go on talking about a war
on drugs and not commit ourselves to a death penalty for those who
kill our law enforcement officers in that war is to make a mockery
of saying we have a war on drugs.''
   But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``The evidence that the death
penalty is a deterrent is just not there at all.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., added that the death penalty
provision could lead to the execution of innocent people. He cited
a Stanford University study which said 350 people have been
convicted of capital offenses in this century and then later found
to be innocent.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, responded that there are enough
safeguards in the legal system to protect innocent persons.
   ``Nobody should be able to kill our policemen without paying the
ultimate price,'' he said.
   Also Thursday, the House Banking Committee approved legislation
to make it more difficult for drug dealers and other criminals to
hide their profits. The bill would require banks to file
transaction reports with the government for all cashiers' checks,
money orders and travelers' checks of $3,000 or more. Now, banks
need to file such reports on transactions of $10,000 or more.
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, meanwhile, was proposing the
creation of ``tent jails'' in Nevada to incarcerate convicted drug
offenders and relieve prison overcrowding elsewhere.
   In an appearance before two House Armed Services subcommittees,
Koch conceded that Nevada probably wouldn't think much of his idea.

   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski said today he had
asked Vietnam to allow the Red Cross to verify that there are no
American prisoners of war still in the country.
   The Alaska Republican made the request in a meeting in New York
with Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, who is attending
a special U.N. General Assembly session on disarmament.
   ``I was very pleased with the response,'' said Murkowski. ``It
was a very positive one. He said the suggestion was very
appropriate and would address it upon his return to Hanoi.''
   Murkowski is a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
   ``We have also contacted the International Committee of the Red
Cross, and they have indicated receptiveness'' to cooperating,
Murkowski told The Associated Press by telephone from Washington,
where he had returned later in the morning.
   Vietnam's U.N. ambassador, Trinh Xuan Lang, also attended the
meeting.
   Murkowski said the cooperative attitude of the Vietnamese was
encourging in light of next week's scheduled meeting of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee to consider the possibility of America
and Vietnam establishing interest sections in each others'
countries.
   Vietnam and America do not have diplomatic relations.
   ``I proposed to the foreign minister my conviction that until
the suspicion and doubt is removed on the MIA-POW issues, it's
going to be difficult to make headway,'' said Murkowski.
   ``I suggested it is time to invite the ICRC to come into Vietnam
and examine the area intensely, and satisfy themselves and issue a
report.''
   A total of 2,400 Americans are listed as missing in Indochina as
a result of the Vietnam War. Of that number, 1,762 are listed as
missing in Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 156 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States and subsequently identified by the laboratory
since the end of the war.
   On Wednesday, Thach met retired Gen. John Vessey at the U.S.
Mission to discuss Americans missing in action.
   U.S. officials said they could give no details of the meeting.
   
   Vessey is President Reagan's special envoy to Vietnam on
prisoners of war, MIAs, re-education camp inmates and other
questions. He and Thach have met in Vietnam and agreed to work
toward solution of problems left over from the war.

   Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet
labor camps and prisons, says President Reagan in his recent visit
to Moscow made the same mistake that many Westerners do.
   Reagan, during his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, accepted simple explanations for complex problems,
Sharansky said at a news conference Thursday.
   ``They (the West) prefer to analyze the Soviet Union in terms of
black and white,'' Sharansky said. ``Probably, Reagan fell into the
same trap.''
   For example, by saying some of the problems in the Soviet Union
are the result of government bureaucracy, Sharansky said, Reagan
wrongly ``accepts that the Soviet system is like the Western
system.''
   Though acknowledging that some reforms, such as increased press
freedom, are taking place, Sharanksy said he doubted that real
progress would be made in human rights because the concept runs
counter to the Soviet system.
   ``The reforms are interesting, exciting ... but they are not
changing the principles of the system,'' Sharansky said.
   The Soviet way of life says that individuals cannot decide for
themselves what to say, where to go or what to believe in,
Sharansky said. He described glasnost, Gorbachev's program to
create a more open society, as ``only a new set of instructions.''
   Sharansky, who is on a tour to promote his new autobiography,
``Fear No Evil,'' commented during a news conference prior to his
lecture at an Atlanta synagogue.
   Sharansky was arrested in 1977 and charged with espionage and
treason for his efforts on behalf of Soviet Jews seeking emigration
to Israel. He was freed and joined his wife in Israel in 1986.
   He said an indication of how little progress has been made in
human rights is that many of the prisoners he wrote about in his
book are still locked up under the same conditions as before the
Gorbachev era.

   Willis Swint usually strolls behind his feed
store every morning to measure rainfall, but he hasn't done that
much lately in this drought-stricken area.
   In fact, until thunderstorms rumbled through the area Thursday,
there hadn't been any rain to measure in two weeks.
   ``We measured a quarter of an inch,'' Swint said Friday. ``It
helped a little bit.''
   ``If we know there are no visible signs of rain, we don't go
back there,'' said Swint, 59, an official rain watcher for the
National Weather Service for 38 years in Jonesboro, just south of
Atlanta. Before he started, his father had measured rainfall since
1940.
   Swint said Jonesboro's monthly rainfall totals since 1941 are
recorded on ``one big cardboard sheet'' that hangs in his feed
store. He also keeps a daily record, which he mails to the weather
service in Atlanta each month.
   The Jonesboro area is close to being short one year's worth of
rain, he said.
   Swint said the area was 6.4 inches short on rainfall for the
year through May, and was short a total of 34.21 inches for the
previous four years. That means Jonesboro, which usually gets 50.30
inches of rain in a year, is missing 40.61 inches for the 4{-year
period through May, he said.
   ``We just had an inch and 94 hundredths (of rain) in May, so
it's pretty dry.''
   Much of northern Georgia is dry. Officials from Atlanta and six
metropolitan counties agreed Thursday to adopt a uniform set of
outdoor watering regulations to conserve water. State Natural
Resources Commissioner Leonard Ledbetter said the agency probably
will have to ban all outdoor watering and begin water rationing
unless there is substantial rainfall in the area in the next two or
three weeks.
   A committee of representatives from Georgia, Florida and Alabama
decided Thursday to recommend that barge traffic on the lower
Chattahoochee River and the Apalachicola River in Florida be
restricted because of low water. The Corps of Engineers warned that
barge traffic may have to be suspended altogether next month.
   Swint said the area could catch up on some of its rainfall
deficits this month if it gets an average June rainfall of 3.71
inches.
   ``If we just got the average, we'd still catch up,'' he said.
``These four years in a row is what's really hurt. That's hurt the
moisture way down in the ground, you see.''
   Swint said there have been drier years than this one _ namely
1954, 1981 and 1986 _ so water demand plays more of a role in this
season's drought than rainfall.
   ``In 1986 through May, we were ... about twice as short then as
it is now,'' he said. ``There's more demand for water now.''
   But the early conservation efforts being implemented by local
governments are helping, Swint said.
   ``Authorities are trying not to wait until they get to the last
dipperful to start conserving,'' he said. ``That's my thinking on
it, anyway.''

<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc.'s policy of requiring male
employees to keep their hair cut above the collar is discriminatory
because women are permitted to have long hair, a lawsuit filed
against the pizza chain says.
   The Wayne County Circuit Court lawsuit was filed Thursday by
Michael Pitt, an attorney appointed by the American Civil Liberties
Union to represent Scott Bedker, 17, of St. Clair Shores. Bedker
was told in January that he must cut his shoulder-length hair or
lose his job.
   The suit names RPM Inc., the franchisee; Domino's, the parent
company, and owner Thomas Monaghan. It seeks to get Bedker's job
back and end the company's policy about hair.
   Pitt said Bedker's hair in January was shoulder-length and
well-groomed, the style he had when he was hired in November 1986.
Bedker was told when hired to wear a cap with his hair folded under
for sanitary reasons. Women in similar jobs were instructed to
treat their hair the same way, Pitt said.
   ``But in January 1988 when the edict from Mr. Monaghan came down
that men had to cut their hair, there was no similar edict for
women,'' Pitt said. ``Scott was subject to different work standards
because of his sex.''
   Bedker, who recently graduated from high school, remains
unemployed and wants his job back at Domino's, where he made pizzas
and answered phones, Pitt said.
   Ron Hingst, Domino's national director of public relations, said
company attorneys hadn't seen the lawsuit and wouldn't comment, but
he added, ``We believe in our policies.''

<TEXT>
   Some European governments are easing their
pressure on Libya and thereby encouraging its leader, Moammar
Gadhafi, to resume his international terror campaign, the top U.S.
counterterrorism official said Friday.
   Ambassador L. Paul Bremer told a congressional hearing that at
the forthcoming seven-nation economic summit in Toronto, the United
States would stress to its allies the need to continue the
international isolation against Gadhafi.
   ``Evidence has emerged indicating that some European governments
are weakening their resolve to keep the pressure on Libya,'' Bremer
said in remarks prepared for testimony before the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
   He did not elaborate, but U.S. officials have noted that
European oil companies recently have renewed their exploration
projects in Libya, and that British business executives have
returned to live there.
   ``We know the governments can't control private business, but
these kind of actions realy send Gadhafi the wrong signal,'' said
one official who spoke only on condition he not be named.
   The number of terrorist attacks in 1988 ``is up significantly''
from 1987, Bremer said. ``We are deeply concerned by an upsurge in
Iranian terrorism and recent evidence that Libya is becoming more
active as a sponsor of terrorism.''
   Although Libyan sponsorship of terrorism declined sharply after
the U.S. air raid on Libya in April 1986 and the Western economic
sanctions imposed that year, Libyan agents and surrogates are
active throughout the world, Bremer said. The surrogates include
the Japanese Red Army and the Palestinian Abu Nidal group, which is
based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, he said.
   The leaders of the world's major industrialized countries
pledged last year at their summit in Venice, Italy, to combat
terrorism.
   ``We expect our friends and allies to live up to that commitment
and will advocate this'' in Toronto, Bremer said.
   Other U.S. officials say the summitteers probably will focus
their discussions on efforts to secure international aviation
against terrorism. They say several paragraphs on the subject will
be included in a joint political communique to be issued during the
summit, which takes place June 19-21.
   The question of air safety has become particularly pressing in
view of several recent hijackings and bombings, notably North
Korea's bombing of a Korean Airlines jet last year in which 115
people were killed.
   U.S. officials are concerned that North Korea may try to disrupt
the Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, in September, Bremer said.
   The United States has been providing training and sharing
intelligence with South Korea and other governments to reduce the
chance of such attacks, he said.
   ``To help prevent a terrorist incident either at or en route to
the Seoul Olympics, the United States and South Korea are
co-hosting a regional aviation security conference at the end of
this month'' in Seoul, he said.

   A former sheriff has been sentenced to
three years in prison and ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution
following his guilty to plea to taking payoffs from two gambling
companies.
   Roy Sandefer, 53, who pleaded guilty Jan. 5 to accepting the
payoffs and failing to report the income on his 1986 tax return,
was ordered Thursday to report to federal authorities July 11 to
begin his term.
   Sandefer's sentence included a three-year term for the bribery
charge and a one-year, concurrent term for the tax evasion charge.
   Sandefer's plea bargain with federal prosecutors didn't include
a condition that he not seek office when his sentence is completed,
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hailman said.
   ``But as a practical matter, having been convicted of bribery,
he probably could not get elected again,'' Hailman said.
   The sheriff had served one term, which ended in January.
   Sandefer had faced a maximum 13 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines.
   According to authorities, the former sheriff received $500
monthly payoffs for allowing two amusement companies to install and
operate gambling machines in Lee County.
   He was indicted on charges of bribery, extortion, conspiracy to
obstruct law enforcement, aiding an illegal gambling operation and
filing false tax returns.
   Federal prosecutors dropped all charges but two in making the
agreement under which Sandefer pleaded guilty. He also agreed to
cooperate with federal authorities.
   Before his sentence was announced, Sandefer told U.S. District
Judge L.T. Senter Jr.: ``I never told them they owed me a dime. I
do admit I took their gratuities.''

prospects</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, ready
to step into new duties as a university president, says he's an
unlikely choice for the No. 2 spot on the national Republican
ticket. But he's willing to change his plans if George Bush asks.
   Like everyone else on the veep lists, Alexander says he isn't
seeking the job. But he's thought about the possibility and is
frank in his assessment:
   ``It's hard to want, impossible to seek, and virtually
impossible to turn down.''
   Alexander has had time to think about such matters.
   The day after leaving the governor's office in 1986, he and his
family _ his wife Honey and four children _ packed up and moved to
Australia for six months. The kids went to school and Alexander
just hung out, thinking.
   ``People couldn't believe it: `The others are running for
president and you're running for the other side of the world,''' he
said. ``I just went to be there with my family and think about what
I wanted to do next.''
   He has written a book about the hiatus. Called ``Six Months
Off,'' it is being published this summer.
   Alexander, a two-term governor who emphasized education during
his administration, is well known to his fellow governors _
including Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the likely Democratic
presidential nominee.
   He's often mentioned among the potential vice presidential
running mates for Bush, who has consulted with Alexander while
trying to fill out the programs to back his oft-stated goal of
becoming ``the education president.''
   Alexander's terms as governor, and his stint as chairman of the
National Governors' Association, were marked by activism. He
acknowledges the contrast with Republican-led efforts to reduce
government on the national level, but says states must step into
the gap.
   ``I've tried to be a preacher of the rest of the Republican
message,'' he said.
   ``I've always believed many Southern Republicans have gotten so
fascinated with the Washington message, which is usually put the
harness on government, they've forgotten the rest of the Republican
message, which is what needs to be done ought to be done locally,''
Alexander said. ``That's sort of been my philosophy, and it's been
very activist.''
   Alexander recently was named president of the University of
Tennessee, and he begins his new job July 1, two days before he
turns 48. Although he told university trustees he was leaving
partisan politics behind, he also told them the vice presidency was
a possibility that he couldn't turn down.
   ``If I were asked, I would accept it,'' Alexander said in a
recent interview, recounting what he told the university officials.
   ``I genuinely don't expect it. I think it's an extremely remote
possibility,'' he said. ``I think almost anybody who was asked
would accept it.''
   Two years ago, Dukakis was picked the most effective governor in
a survey of governors by Newsweek magazine. Second-place finisher
in that balloting was Alexander _ although two-thirds of the
governors at that time were Democrats.
   A former Democratic governor, Charles Robb of Virginia,
acknowledged Alexander's return from Australia last summer: ``We
all hoped that he would stay there. He makes Democrats nervous.''
   A lawyer, he got his start in politics working for Howard Baker,
then a senator from Tennessee, and he worked as an aide in the
Nixon White House. He ran for governor in 1974 and lost, but won
four years later and became the first Tennessean to serve eight
consecutive years in the office.

   Most South Koreans reacted with anger
Friday to plans by radical students to march to communist North
Korea for unification talks. The critics included some who backed
pro-democracy riots last summer.
   ``I supported them when they fought for democracy last year. But
this time, I simply don't understand them,'' said the owner of a
small bakery near Yonsei University in Seoul, where thousands of
students battled riot police.
   Coughing and sneezing in his bakery filled with drifting tear
gas, he termed reunification ``a stupid idea'' and called the
students ``simply crazy.''
   ``Students are not politicians. Such contact should be made in
an orderly manner through the government,'' said the shopkeeper,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Few South Koreans support or sympathize with the radical
students' call for talks with North Korean students to reunite the
peninsula, which was divided at the end of World War II.
   ``Let them go to the North and live there for a few months. They
need to learn by experience what is good and bad,'' said Chung
Soon-im, a 38-year-old homemaker.
   A uniformed army captain interviewed in a subway said: ``I would
like to shoot them. They are too naive or idiots.''
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took office Feb. 25 after elections
in December, has liberalized debate on unification but said the
government, not students, should lead any dialogue with North Korea.
   South Korean students, traditionally a major political force,
played a key role in nationwide public protests last summer that
led to sweeping democratic reforms, including direct presidential
elections.
   The radical students are a very small but loud minority.
   Government officials say they account for just 2 percent to 3
percent of the country's 1 million students. About 41 million
people live in South Korea.
   ``I do agree that the students have the right to meet their
North Korean friends. It would help ease the bitter rivalry between
the two sides,'' dissident Buddhist monk Song Kwan said after a
rally at Yonsei University on Friday.
   Another dissident leader, Moon Ik-hwan, told students at the
rally, ``The Roh Tae-woo regime has neither capability nor will to
push national unification. I support the student talks.''
   About 4,000 students, clenched fists in the air, rose in wild
cheers and sang a song, titled ``Our Lifelong Wish Is Unification.''
   They demanded permission to march to the border village of
Panmunjom for the unification talks. South Korea banned the march
as a national security threat.
   The students are also demanding that North Korea be a co-host of
September's Olympic Games in Seoul as a step toward reunification
and that the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea withdraw.
   Many intellectuals have said the activism could backfire. They
point out that the military staged a coup in 1961 after radical
students called for similar unification talks with North Korea.

<HEAD>Tree-Chopping Doctor Ordered to Pay Restitution</HEAD>

   A physician who felled 24 trees on
federal property to improve the view of a lake must pay $7,500 in
restitution and provide free emergency medical treatment to lake
visitors, a judge ruled.
   Kenneth Abbott of Smithville was charged Thursday with ``timber
trespass'' by U.S. Magistrate Joe Haynes in a petty offense
citation.
   Abbott, a radiologist, was also ordered to pay a $500 fine.
   ``This man showed a blatant disregard for the rights of the
public in general,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Washko.
   Several of the trees Abbott chopped down were more than 100 feet
tall, Washko said.
   ``There was nothing malicious about it. He was simply oblivious
to the harm he did to erosion control, to wildlife and to the
beauty of the area itself,'' said Washko. ``And it was all because
he wanted a better view of the lake from his home.''
   The 24 trees, which stood on federal property in woods
separating Abbott's clifftop home from a lake, included 13 red
maples, 6 hickory trees, 4 chestnut oaks and 1 yellow poplar.
   The Corps of Engineers initiated an investigation after rangers
notified them that trees were missing.
   Haynes called the damage done by Abbott ``irreparable'' and
ordered him to provide two years of free emergency medical
treatment for visitors to the lake.

<HEAD>Eight Members of Environmental Group Arrested in Whaling Protest</HEAD>

   Eight members of the environmental
group Greenpeace were arrested today for boarding an Icelandic
fishing vessel in Gloucester Harbor to protest that nation's
whaling industry.
   The protesters, riding to the ship aboard their trademark
inflatable motorboats known as ``Zodiacs,'' boarded the fishing
vessel Jokulfell as it docked at the Americold Corp., a freezer
company on Gloucester's inner harbor.
   The protesters climbed on board using ladders and ropes and
informed the crew of 14 what they were there for and then proceeded
to hang several banners on the ship. There were no injuries or
violence. But three of the protesters chained themselves to hatches
or gangways and had to be cut loose by police, Gloucester police
said.
   The aim of the protest was to put economic pressure on Iceland
to end whaling. Protesters said they were trying to prevent the
ship from unloading, even though the cargo contained no whale meat.
They also hope to pressure American buyers, particularly fast-food
chains, to stop buying Icelandic fish.
   Michael DeChiara, a Greenpeace member, said: ``We're putting
economic pressure on Iceland selling fish to the U.S. We're doing
all we can to stop whaling.''
   Greenpeace alleges that Iceland has been killing whales for
commercial use under the guise of scientific research. It says
Iceland for two years has defied an International Whaling
Commission request to stop whaling activities.
   Most recently, the request was made at Auckland, New Zealand,
two weeks ago by the commission, according to Campbell Plowden,
Greenpeace's whale campaign coordinator.
   Gloucester police and members of the U.S. Coast Guard boarded
the ship and took eight of the demonstrators into custody after
they scaled a massive crane used in unloading. The demonstrators
were able to unfurl a large banner reading, ``Save the whales,
boycott Icelandic fish, Greenpeace.''
   The protesters were charged with unlawful boarding of a vessel
and tresspassing and were scheduled to be arraigned in Gloucester
District Court sometime today, according to Sgt. David Reardon of
the Gloucester police.

   The House Appropriations Committee on Friday
approved a bill making nearly $136 billion available for the
departments of labor, education and health and human services in
fiscal 1989 starting Oct. 1.
   The spending bill, approved by voice vote, is expected to come
up on the House floor Wednesday.
   The measure makes up to $1.2 billion available for AIDS
research, education and other activities directed at prevention and
treatment of the fatal disease. The figure is $308 million over the
current fiscal year.
   The bill also substantially increases spending on job training
and employment services, preschool education and academic services
for disadvantaged children.
   It conforms to the budget framework agreed to last year by
Congress and the Reagan administration.

   A former prosecutor testified today that U.S.
District Judge Walter J. Nixon entered into a ``sweetheart deal''
with a wealthy Mississippi investor that led to the judge's
conviction and imprisonment for lying to a federal grand jury.
   Attorney Reid Weingarten, who was the prosecutor at Nixon's
trial, told a House impeachment panel that the judge bought three
oil well properties from Wiley Fairchild for $9,500 in 1980 and
netted more than $50,000 from the deal.
   ``It was obviously a freebie ... a sweetheart deal,'' said
Weingarten, who quoted Nixon as telling Fairchild that ``If I can
help you I will, and if I can't, I'll tell you.''
   The judge was accused of trying subsequently to get favorable
treatment for Fairchild's son, Drew, in a drug smuggling case.
   Nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity in the oil
drilling transaction with Fairchild, but was convicted in February
1986 of lying to a grand jury when he denied discussing Drew
Fairchild's case with Fairchild's father and a Mississippi
prosecutor.
   The Supreme Court denied Nixon's appeal last January, and the
judge began serving a five-year sentence at a minimum-security
federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., on March 23. He
continues to draw his $89,500 annual salary while in prison.
   Nixon, who listened quietly to Weingarten's testimony today,
told House Judiciary subcommittee investigators Thursday that
``justice will prevail and my innocence will be understood,'' and
that he should not be impeached for his perjury conviction.
   If impeached by the full House and convicted at a Senate trial,
Nixon, 59, would be removed from the federal bench where he has
served since 1968.
   It is a ``natural reaction,'' Nixon said, to think that someone
who is in prison should not be a federal judge.
   ``I agree that something is wrong with this situation, but what
is wrong is that I am in prison even though I have committed no
crime,'' Nixon said in his opening statement. ``If I believed for a
moment that I had committed a crime, I would have resigned as a
judge and this hearing would not be necessary.''
   Nixon, told the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights he had done nothing to ``call into question
the integrity of the bench.''
   ``My loving family and I have lost a great deal over the last
several years: our peace of mind, damage to my reputation, and now
my freedom,'' he said. ``But we have not lost faith that in the
end, justice will prevail and my innocence will be understood and
recognized.''
   Nixon has been a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge for
Mississippi's southern district since 1982. He would forfeit his
annual salary of $89,500 and his eligibility for a pension at age
65 if he is impeached by the House and removed from office by the
Senate.
   He is the third federal judge to be indicted on charges of
crimes allegedly committed while in office.
   U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida was acquitted of
bribery in 1983, and impeachment hearings ended in that case
Thursday. Former federal judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was
convicted in 1984 of failing to report $106,000 on his federal
income tax returns and was sentenced to two years in prison. He was
impeached and removed from office in 1986.
   Nixon's legal problems stemmed from his business relationship
with Fairchild. Nixon has testified that his purchase of oil and
gas rights in three wells was a legitimate transaction, and that he
promised no favors to Fairchild in return.
   In March, a group of judges that makes policy for the federal
courts urged that the House consider impeaching Nixon. A few days
later, an impeachment resolution was introduced in the House.
   During Thursday's hearing, the subcommittee members heard tape
recordings of an interview federal authorities had with Nixon in
April 1984, when they were investigating the case, and of his July
1984 testimony to the grand jury.

   Fallen evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker
said today they're preparing to submit a plan to the PTL's
bankruptcy trustee that will provide for them to go back on
television.
   The couple, who returned to South Carolina at the end of May
intent on regaining control of the ministry Bakker founded,
admitted they don't have money to buy air time or to purchase PTL's
assets.
   But Bakker said he had promises of support from some businesses
in Rock Hill and Fort Mill, near PTL's Heritage USA headquarters.
He wouldn't provide names.
   ``We are preparing in the next 48 hours a plan to present to Mr.
(M.C.) Benton and that would include air time and quite a bit
else,'' Bakker said in a news conference at the offices of a
Columbia law firm.
   ``We don't have money in the bank. We haven't asked for people
to put money in the bank. We will launch a campaign, perhaps in the
next few days, to do some of that,'' he said.
   Mrs. Bakker, who underwent treatment for an addiction to
prescription drugs before the couple's March 1987 departure from
the ministry, said she has not used drugs to cope with stress since
their fall from PTL.
   ``I haven't had a pill in a year and five months!'' she said.
   On Thursday, Bakker met in Winston-Salem, N.C., with Benton as
his former church, the Assemblies of God, announced that his
request for a meeting with church elders had been denied.
   After his meeting with Bakker, Benton said he told Bakker that
if his presence proved disruptive at Heritage USA, the trustee
would ``really lay down the law with him.''
   ``I explained to him that he has a big following of people and
wherever he goes he draws a crowd,'' Benton said. ``Crowds can be
disruptive and I'm just not going to allow that to happen at
Heritage USA. We're going to have to do things in an orderly
fashion.''
   The former Winston-Salem mayor said he will place no
restrictions on Bakker's visits to the religious theme park ``as
long as he conducts himself like a gentleman and doesn't cause any
problems for us.''
   Bakker lost his Assemblies ministerial credentials last year and
control of his multimillion-dollar evangelical complex after his
1980 tryst with former church secretary Jessica Hahn became public.
   Assemblies of God spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said Thursday in
Springfield, Mo., that Bakker's request for a meeting with church
leaders was considered and rejected by the Executive Presbytery,
which met Tuesday through Thursday.
   Bakker wrote in April asking to meet with Assemblies leaders,
but did not say why, according to Mrs. Turnage. He would have to
wait two years before requesting an appeal of his dismissal, she
said.

   Riot police firing tear gas blocked
thousands of students Friday who tried to march to communist North
Korea for reunification talks. Radicals hurled rocks and firebombs,
trying to fight their way through.
   About 60,000 riot police blanketed the South Korean capital and
roads leading north to disperse students trying to reach the border
30 miles away. Fierce street clashes erupted at Yonsei University
as about 5,000 screaming students tried to fight their way out.
   An estimated 8,000 troopers surrounding the school fired
hundreds of tear gas bombs into the charging students. Both sides
hurled rocks and bricks.
   Police and protesters with skin burns or wounds streaming blood
staggered or were carried to safety. Authorities didn't say how
many people were injured.
   North Korea's Korean Central News Agency said in a report
monitored in Tokyo that delegates and students from the North
waited at the truce village of Panmunjom for the southern students.
   Ko Ung Sam, head of the delegation, was quoted as saying, ``The
responsibility for the failure of the talks rests entirely with the
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean rulers.''
   Police and press reports indicated at least 700 students were
arrested in various parts of South Korea. Most detainees were
expected to be held briefly.
   Radical students _ who government officials say account for just
2 percent to 3 percent of the nation's 1 million students _ called
the march to force reunification of the communist North and the
pro-Western South.
   The radicals claim the United States, which has 42,000 troops in
South Korea, enforces partition to rule the South. The protests
were vehemently anti-American.
   ``Let's go and meet our brothers from the North!'' the students
at Yonsei yelled, beating drums and singing revolutionary songs.
``Yankee go home!'' yelled others. ``Skin the Yankee imperialists!''
   ``We call for struggle of the masses for unification and against
dictatorship!'' a speaker shouted as students cheered.
   Riot troopers hit by firebombs screamed in agony as other
officers frantically beat out the flames. Students wielding clubs
attacked police who tried to ward off blows with riot shields.
   A dozen armored police vans with multiple tear gas launchers
fired barrages of gas bombs to hold back attacking protesters as
police martial arts squads attacked. Students tried to immobilize
the vans with firebombs and clubs.
   Students in nearby sidestreets tried to attack police from
behind and stationed themselves on several high rooftops.
   Clashes broke out in at least six provincial cities as students
supporting the march clashed with police. Dozens of students were
arrested at bus and train stations as they tried to reach Seoul for
the march.
   At Seoul's railway station, thousands of riot police threw tear
gas grenades to break up crowds of students trying to get to trains
to the border. Some students hurled rocks and firebombs, but most
did not fight back.
   The police detained hundreds of students, beating and kicking
detainees as they dragged them away. Students had blood streaming
from their faces.
   Their attempts to assemble in various parts of Seoul failed
repeatedly. About 4,000 students who staged a sit-down strike in
the north of Seoul were dispersed by charging police firing tear
gas.
   Riot squads guarded train and bus stations to stop students from
getting to Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone. About 40 students
who sneaked through were arrested near the border, which is
off-limits to civilians.
   Large detachments of riot police stood guard at intersections
and along main streets in Seoul. Riot squads surrounded government
buildings and U.S. diplomatic facilities to prevent attacks.
   Many onlookers criticized the protesters, saying they were
leftists or fools who would help the communist North conquer the
South.
   ``Let them go to the North and live there for a few months,''
said Chung Soon-im, a 38-year-old homemaker. ``They need to learn
by experience what is good and bad.''
   A uniformed army captain said: ``I would like to shoot them.
They are too naive or idiots.''
   Most South Koreans want reunification with the North but fear
the North is determined eventually to conquer the South.
   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to launch the Korean War
and the two nations remain bitter enemies with no ties or contacts.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, deny
they are communists and insist reunfication overrides ideological
considerations.

   A North Korean woman who said she
planted a bomb aboard a South Korean jetliner may be pardoned after
the Olympic Games in Seoul, newspapers reported Friday.
   The woman, Kim Hyon Hui, could be pardoned even if she were
found guilty, because she cooperated in the government's
investigation of the November 1987 bombing, the newspapers said.
   The reports, carried in all the city's daily papers, quoted a
prosecution source but did not give the source's name. They said
local and international laws against terrorism mandate a trial for
Kim, who acknowledged her role in the bombing of the Korean Air
jetliner.
   All 115 people aboard were killed.
   ``Strong public sentiment and concerned local and international
laws make it inevitable to try the woman after the Olympics,'' the
newspapers quoted the source as saying.
   The South Korean government has decided to delay Kim's trial
until after the Olympics to avoid a possible adverse impact on the
Games, the reports said. A record 161 countries are scheduled to
take part in the Games, which run from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   Kim, 25, told a news conference in Seoul in January that she and
a male North Korean agent planted a bomb aboard the jetliner, which
disappeared off Burma on Nov. 29.
   Kim said they bombed the jetliner on orders from North Korean
leaders to disrupt the Olympic Games. North Korea has denied
involvement.
   The North Korean couple, passengers on an earlier part of the
flight from Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul, got off the plane in Bahrain.
They took poison before being questioned at Bahrain Airport. The
man died, but Kim survived and was sent to Seoul in December.

   In a case that echoed the ``rough sex''
defense of the ``preppie killing'' trial, a teen-ager who strangled
his girlfriend was sentenced today to up to four years in prison,
the most he could have received.
   Joseph Porto, 19, had been found guilty of criminally negligent
homicide in the death of Kathleen Holland, 17, whom he said he
strangled in a sex act gone awry.
   In sentencing Porto to one and one-third to four years in
prison, Nassau County Court Judge John Thorp Jr. said, ``The
punishment does not fit the crime.''
   Porto's attorney, Barry Slotnick, who represented subway gunman
Bernhard Goetz, had asked the judge to give his client probation.
   He later called the sentence excessive and said he would seek to
have the verdict and sentence overturned.
   Porto showed no outward sign of emotion when the sentence was
announced.
   In asking for the maximum sentence, prosectutor Kenneth Littman
said, ``The probation report paints a picture of a self-centered,
arrogant and spoiled young man who acts impulsively and
aggressively toward young women.''
   He said officers detected no remorse in Porto and in fact said,
``Porto smirked during the entire interview with probation
officers.''
   Porto, of Bayville, was charged with second-degree murder after
he confessed in writing and on videotape to strangling Miss Holland
on Sept. 27, 1986, when she tried to end their nine-month
relationship.
   In his confession, Porto said he used his hands and a high
school graduation tassel to choke the teen-ager to death. He
recanted the confession during his April trial and, like the
``preppie killing'' defendant Robert Chambers, said Miss Holland
died accidentally while they were having sex.
   Porto told the jury he tied a rope around Miss Holland's neck to
heighten her sexual pleasure and apparently yanked too hard in the
heat of passion.
   The jury acquitted him of murder and manslaughter charges while
finding him guilty of the lesser charge.
   Porto's defense was offered shortly after Chambers, who was
charged with murdering teen-ager Jennifer Levin during a 1986
sexual tryst in Central Park, claimed he accidentally killed her
during rough sex.
   Chambers interrupted his trial and pleaded guilty to a lesser
charge of first-degree manslaughter.

   Wheelchair-bound youngsters cut a red
ribbon Friday to dedicate a special playground designed to let them
play side-by-side with children who aren't disabled.
   About 40 eager children, many in wheelchairs, made a bee-line
for the ``Playground for All Children'' and climbed on the
equipment for the first time at the ceremony at Holmes Elementary
School in this suburb west of Chicago.
   ``I'm excited to play in it because it looks fun and
interesting,'' said David Hyde, a 6th-grader who suffers from
muscular dystrophy. ``Before, I would just sit around and watch.
There was nothing else to do.''
   ``It was pure joy,'' for the children, said Myra LaRoque,
president of the local Parent-Teachers Organization. ``They were
able to stand on it, walk on it, feel that it was real,''
   Representatives of the village, park district and school board
addressed a crowd of about 200 at the half-hour ceremony.
   ``The response by the community as a whole was excellent. ...
The enthusiasm the kids showed for the project was great,'' Mrs.
LaRoque said.
   The 75-by-140 foot playground features an extensive ramp system
for wheelchair-bound children, leading to a large platform with
access to four slides and a large sandbox.
   The ramp is designed to be therapeutic, to help kids develop
upper body strength. The sandbox is raised to lap height so
children can wheel right up and stick their hands in. They can also
slide into it.
   And the swings have specially adapted mesh hammock seats that
can be slipped under a child in a wheelchair.
   The playground also has an herb garden for blind children to
develop their senses of touch and smell, and plantboxes for
students to cultivate.
   About 10 percent of the approximately 500 students at Holmes are
wheelchair-bound, said Mrs. LaRoque. The school offers special
programs for physically disabled children from Oak Park and
neighboring suburbs.
   ``These children are 100 percent integrated in the classroom,
but notable differences appear when they go outside to play,'' said
Mrs. LaRoque.
   The PTO decided about 2{ years ago to develop the playround.
   ``We wanted them to be accepted as individuals, not ostracized
or put aside as would happen in normal life,'' said Elaine Sherman,
the Playground Committee co-chairperson.
   Architect Richard Katz, who had experience designing
playgrounds, found the project ``a great challenge.''
   He adapted some standard equipment, and used his imagination.
   About half of the $100,000 budget came from federal community
development funds allocated by Oak Park authorities. The rest came
from the local park and school districts and the parents'
fund-raising efforts.
   The playground, dedicated on the last day of school at Holmes,
will be open to the public. Workers are still putting finishing
touches on the equipment, which should open officially by the end
of the month, Mrs. LaRoque said.

   Major elements are coming together
for the first space shuttle mission in 2{ years but critical
milestones lie ahead on the road to an August launch, shuttle
officials reported Friday.
   ``The August target is optimistic, for sure, but given where we
are today, we've got a shot at it,'' launch director Bob Sieck said.
   ``We're getting close and there's a feeling of excitement
here,'' said astronaut Bob Crippen, deputy director of shuttle
operations, who will make the final decision on whether Discovery
is launched on the first post-Challenger mission, now set for Aug.
31.
   Sieck and Crippen addressed a news conference on the day two
major parts for the Discovery flight were joined in an assembly
building _ the huge external fuel tank and the two solid fuel
booster rockets.
   Engineers next week will complete a major overhaul job on
Discovery and will mate the spacecraft with the tank and boosters.
   Transfer of the spaceship to the launch pad is set for June 25.
   ``That will be the most tangible evidence to us that a launch is
near,'' Sieck said.
   A key test is set for July 18 when Discovery's three main liquid
fuel engines are fired with the shuttle bolted firmly to the pad.
The 20-second ignition will evaluate modifications made to the
power plant and provide countdown experience for the launch team.
   Full scale test firings of the redesigned solid fuel booster
rockets are scheduled for next Tuesday and on July 26 at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah.
   All three tests must be completed successfully and evaluated
before Discovery can be committed to flight.
   ``We'll get through these milestones and then we'll look at the
launch date,'' Sieck said.
   A faulty joint in one of the 126-foot booster rockets allowed
flame to escape and destroy Challenger and its seven-person crew in
a fiery explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Crippen said that once the tests are complete and a firm date
has been set, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
officials must clear another major hurdle _ a flight readiness
review scheduled two weeks before liftoff.
   ``That meeting will be the culmination of many earlier meetings
and decisions and will decide if we are ready to fly,'' Crippen
said.
   Two days before launch, Crippen's mission management team will
convene to evaluate weather, hardware, software and other elements
and decide whether the final countdown should start.
   At nine minutes before liftoff, with a planned hold called for
in the count, Crippen will call for a go-no-go decisions from Sieck
and other officials.
   ``I will make the commitment whether to proceed at T-minus-nine
minutes,'' Crippen said. ``I assure you we'll be certain it's as
safe as possible before we go.''
   The commander of the flight is Frederick H. Hauck, and the pilot
is Richard O. Covey. Also on the four-day flight are mission
specialists John M. Lounge, George D. Nelson and David C. Hilmers.
   Their chief objective is to deploy a NASA communications
satellite.

<TEXT>
   Pop music's biggest names give a 10-hour rock
concert Saturday honoring jailed black South African leader Nelson
Mandela. The event kicks off a five-week, anti-apartheid campaign
in Britain.
   The concert signals a resurgence here of the campaign against
white rule in South Africa, but it has been attacked by
right-wingers who claim that by televising it, the British
Broadcasting Corp. is violating its duty to be impartial.
   South Africa has denounced the Wembley Stadium concert, expected
to draw 72,000 spectators. It launches a series of rallies and
birthday celebrations in Britain leading up to Mandela's 70th
birthday July 18.
   Modeled on the 1985 Live Aid music extravaganza for African
famine relief, the concert will be broadcast live on television and
radio in Britain by the BBC and beamed to about 60 countries,
including the United States and Soviet Union.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has
served 25 years of a life sentence for plotting the overthrow of
the South African government.
   The publicly funded BBC has rejected allegations that it is
implicitly backing the ANC, the main guerrilla group fighting South
Africa's government.
   ANC president Oliver Tambo is billed as the concert's guest of
honor, but the BBC says it is not paying for broadcast rights and
views the concert purely as ``an outstanding international musical
event.''
   The Anti-Apartheid Movement says half the proceeds from the $50
tickets will go to children's charities in southern Africa and the
rest will fund its activities in Britain.
   ``You can only say it is a political event because he (Mandela)
is a political prisoner,'' the movement's president, Archbishop
Trevor Huddleston, said Friday.
   The right-wing Freedom Association claimed cash from the concert
would finance what it termed terrorist actions by the ANC. ``The
BBC governors must now have on their conscience the responsibility
for the future deaths of innocent men, women and children from the
proceeds of a pop concert,'' it said.
   South Africa said its London embassy complained to the BBC ``at
the highest level'' for broadcasting the concert, and it also
attacked a BBC documentary screened Wednesday night in which black
South African children alleged they were tortured by police.
   Twenty-five lawmakers in the governing Conservative Party signed
a House of Commons motion complaining that the BBC was violating
its rules by giving ``publicity to a movement that encourages the
African National Congress in its terrorist activities.''
   The South African Embassy placed an advertisement in four
British newspapers on Friday headlined ``Nelson Mandela Could Be
Free,'' which incorporated President P.W. Botha's offer on Jan. 31,
1985, to release Mandela if he renounced violence.
   The ad also repeated Mandela's reported response, as quoted in
an interview with the Washington Times on Aug. 22, 1985: ``There is
no alternative to taking up arms. There is no room for peaceful
struggle.''
   Six hours of the concert will be telecast in the United States
by Fox Broadcasting, the Los Angeles-based network.
   Scheduled performers include Whitney Houston, Sting, George
Michael, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Dire Straits, Eurythmics,
Simple Minds, Roberta Flack, Natalie Cole, Phil Collins, the Bee
Gees, Joe Cocker, the Fat Boys, Maxi Priest.
   Other big-name ``surprise'' performers are promised.
   On Sunday, a ``Freedom March'' across Britain will begin in
Glasgow, Scotland, winding up with a rally in London's Hyde Park on
July 17. The next day, prayers for Mandela will be held in St.
James's Church.

   Gov. Roy Romer today recommended that a permit be
issued to build the $500 million Two Forks dam and reservoir, but
he attached a slew of conditions and said the project should be
built only as a last resort.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the final say in issuing
the permit for the project, which has been proposed by the Denver
Water Board and a group called Metro Water Providers, a consortium
of 42 Denver-area water providers and municipalities.
   Col. Steve G. West, district engineer for the Army Corps of
Engineers, said the governor's recommendation will be one of many
factors considered in deciding whether the project is in the public
interest.
   Two Forks would be built just downstream from the confluence of
the South Platte River and its North Fork, about 25 miles southwest
of Denver. It would flood 20 miles of scenic Cheesman Canyon, a
prospect that has upset environmentalists and sportsmen.
   ``Colorado should build Two Forks, in my judgment, only as a
last resort,'' the governor told a packed news conference at the
state Capitol. He added that he believes it has only a 50-50 chance
of being constructed even with his approval of the permit.
   ``I am challenging the state to find an alternate solution and I
think I can,'' Romer said.
   Denver officials say Two Forks would add 98,000 acre-feet of
water to the city's water system, enough to meet Denver's water
needs through the year 2035.
   Project planners say Two Forks' 615-foot-high dam and reservoir
would take two years to design and five years to build, meaning it
would be usable in 1995 at the earliest.
   Proponents have painted the project as crucial to the
metropolitan area's growth. Opponents say it would needlessly wipe
out 20 miles of Gold Medal trout fishing and nearby recreation
areas and would pose a threat to whooping crane habitat and
irrigators along the Platte River in Nebraska.
   Romer said he wants to save Cheesman Canyon and possibly make it
a state recreational area. But in order to do so, he said, his
favored alternative _ a dam and reservoir west of the Two Forks
site _ may have to be be built, flooding the town of Bailey.
   ``There is a cost in saving the canyon. The cost is in moving
Bailey,'' Romer said.
   The governor said he would recommend a 25-year shelf life for
the project, meaning it could be built anytime during that period.
   But he attached conditions to his approval of the permit: a
metropolitan-area water conservation program; creation of a
Metropolitan Water Authority to plan distribution of water supplies
in the Denver area; a requirement that metro water providers share
existing water supplies, and full implementation of a mitigation
plan to replace wildlife habitat and recreational facilities if Two
Forks is ever built.

<HEAD>Some Activists Face Third Year of Detention Without Charge</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's decision to
extend the state of emergency for a third year means continued
detention without trial for some of the country's most articulate
and effective anti-apartheid leaders.
   Many of the estimated 2,500 people detained under emergency
regulations are black activists known only in their own
communities. But scores of others formed the core of leadership of
nationwide anti-apartheid groups like the now-restricted United
Democratic Front.
   Those still in detention include:
   _Zwelakhe Sisulu, 37, editor of the New Nation, a weekly
newspaper closed by the government three months ago. Sisulu, who
was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, was detained in December
1986. His father is jailed African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu. His mother, Albertina, is co-president of the United
Democratic Front and has been banned from speaking publicly.
   _Raymond Suttner, 42, a law school lecturer at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand and the only white emergency
detainee held for two years. Suttner served eight years in prison
starting in 1975 for aiding the outlawed African National Congress.
He co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a
non-racial, post-apartheid South Africa that has been endorsed by
the ANC and the UDF. Friends say he has spent much of his detention
in solitary confinement.
   _Henry Fazzie, 64, and Mkhuseli Jack, 30, UDF leaders from Port
Elizabeth who helped organize effective black consumer boycotts of
white-owned stores in 1985 and 1986. They were detained in August
1986. Fazzie's wife, Beauty, also is in detention, as are many
other UDF leaders from the area.
   _Vusi Khanyile, 37, chairman of the National Education Crisis
Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher and student groups
seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in
their schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off
classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the
government outlawed its later campaign for ``people's education.''
Khanyile was detained in December 1986 and nearly all other top
leaders of the crisis committee have been detained since then.
   _Murphy Morobe, 32, acting publicity secretary of the UDF, who
was detained in July 1987. Between the 1986 emergency declaration
and his detention, Morobe operated from underground, wearing
disguises and showing up unannounced at newspaper offices. He is
considered one of the UDF's most eloquent writers and speakers.
   _Ivy Gcina, 51, leader of the UDF-affiliated Port Elizabeth
Women's Organization, detained for the entire emergency. Employed
as a cleaning woman at a school, she had five children _ including
one killed in unrest and three who have fled the country.
   _Brian Sokutu, a Port Elizabeth-based free-lance journalist,
held for the entire emergency.

   Cherry farmer Dave Amon found making a profit
wasn't as easy as pie, so he came up with a few innovative ways to
make the cherry pay despite crop gluts and falling prices.
   Visitors to his farm can buy cherry mustard, cherry barbecue
sauce, cherry hot pepper jelly, cherry dressing and cherry dessert
sauce.
   Amon has managed to transform his 400-acre farm in the northwest
region of Michigan's Lower Peninsula into a tourist attraction,
enticing an estimated 65,000 visitors a year to take home some of
his cherry-based products.
   ``Each year I have to put my visitor's hat on and think about
what would turn me on,'' Amon said.
   In his fields, you can pick your own cherries, take a tour on
his ``fruitmobile,'' buy pumpkins in the fall and Christmas trees
in December. In the winter, you can even ski his groomed trails.
   ``We are in the cherry capital of the world and it wasn't too
long ago when all you could get was a piece of cherry pie or maybe
a cherry decoration on your meal,'' said Keith Charters, owner of
the Music House Museum and chairman of the area's convention bureau
board.
   Michigan is the country's No. 1 producer of tart cherries and
fourth leading grower of sweet cherries.

   Professors and students got a chance to
take a few good whacks at a temporary classroom structure that was
revered by none, but reviled by all at Fresno State University.
   Faculty and students regarded the San Ramon I building as a
noisy claptrap that was too hot in the summer and too cold in the
winter. And, they say, it was just plain ugly.
   So, when the time came to tear down the structure built two
decades ago on the campus 200 miles south of San Francisco, plenty
of volunteer demolitionists showed up.
   About a dozen professors, administrators and students used
sledgehammers to attack the building Thursday before a professional
wrecking crew completed the job.
   Student Robert Petrucci even brought a 3-foot pipe wrench to get
``the last vengeance.'' Petrucci said the noise problem in the
building was so bad that ``you could hear people sneeze three
classrooms down.''

   Angler Craig Merchant's battle with a
quillback carpsucker won't qualify as a great moment in fishing
history.
   He says the fish didn't fight, he wasn't trying to catch it, and
he didn't know what it was when he did.
   But as the world will soon know, Merchant's quillback carpsucker
_ a fish that truly looks like its name and smells worse _ was
something special.
   Apparently, it's the biggest quillback carpsucker ever caught.
   The 22{-inch, 6-pound, 14-ounce fish has been confirmed as a
state record and is expected to meet quick approval for the world
record from the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in Wisconsin,
Michigan Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Patricia
Merrick said Thursday.
   The fish was caught April 30 in the Kalamzoo River northwest of
Kalamazoo in southwestern Michigan. Merchant, a 43-year-old
toolmaker from nearby Wayland, said he almost threw the fish back
because he didn't know what it was.
   ``I thought it was just an old trash fish from a dirty old
river,'' Merchant said. ``I was fishing for walleye.''
   The previous world record quillback carpsucker, 5 pounds, 12
ounces, came from Lake St. Clair, near Detroit, in 1982. Merrick
said the bony, bottom-feeding fish averages one to two pounds.

   The owners of Bangkok's ``Nazi Bar''
renamed the nightspot following strong objections from several
foreigners, the manager said Friday.
   Owners replaced caricatures of Adolf Hitler, photos of Nazi
storm troopers and cartoons of Italian Fascist leader Benito
Mussolini with racing posters when the pub was renamed ``No Name''
on Wednesday.
   The name was changed, manager Aor Sarayuk said, ``to make
everybody happy.''
   ``We don't want to offend even a few people, so we're
experimenting with a new, neutral name and decor,'' Aor said in a
telephone interview.
   Some foreigners had complained in the pub and in letters to the
English-language Bangkok Post that the name glamorized Hitler's
brutal regime in Germany before and during World War II. But Aor
said Thai patrons remained unconcerned.
   Aor earlier said he and his business partners focused on the
Nazi theme because of ``its powerful, catchy and emotive appeal.''
Waiters in the bar, which opened in early May, wore swastika
armbands.
   The new decor features racing cars, including Ferraris and
Porsches.
   ``Not many people object to cars,'' Aor said.

   Police opened fire and lobbed tear gas
canisters at rioters in the northern Indian state of Kashmir on
Friday, killing two and injuring more than 30, the United News of
India reported.
   At least 100 policemen suffered minor injuries in the melee in
Srinagar, the capital of the state, the news agency said.
   The demonstrators had gathered in downtown Srinagar to protest
the state government's recent decision to raise electricity rates,
UNI said.
   The police charged after the demonstrators tried to burn down a
major bridge in the city, it said.
   Many stores were closed for the day on a strike call from the
Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Association, which opposes the
electricity hike, the news agency said.

   Commercial billboards with educational
messages are springing up in schools around the country in a free
program praised by some educators as creative and criticized by
others as exploitative.
   Ads for Coca-Cola, Maybelline, Snickers and other products run
across the bottom of the billboards, up to 6-by-4{-foot, which
carry educational messages on topics ranging from physical fitness
to the U.S. Constitution.
   ``They brighten up our school, which is overall beige,'' said
Jennifer Knight, editor of the student newspaper at Rosemount High
School in a St. Paul suburb.
   Ms. Knight said she saw nothing wrong with posters bearing a
commercial message, but noted that ``there were some posters (in
which) I thought the advertising was more the focus than what it
was trying to get at.''
   But Jeanne M. Anderson, a first-grade teacher in White Bear
Lake, said she and other teachers persuaded their principal to bar
them from their elementary school.
   ``I don't see any value with these things with the ads displayed
so blatantly,'' she said in a recent interview. ``What's next? Do
we start sending coupons home with them?''
   The posters have been distributed to secondary schools for three
years and to elementary schools since last fall by Whittle
Communications, said Donna Cheek, a spokeswoman for the Knoxville,
Tenn.-based company.
   The posters, accompanied by teaching guides, are displayed in
about 9,000 schools in about 40 states, including more than 70
schools in the Minneapolis area, the company estimates. The posters
are called ``Connections'' in secondary schools and ``The Big
Picture'' in elementary schools.
   The ``Big Picture'' posters featuring young celebrities and
other children are paid for by the advertisers, said Ed Winter, a
Whittle division president and publisher of ``The Big Picture.''
The company declined to say how much it earns from distribution of
the billboards.
   The billboards, Winter said, are no different from newspapers
and magazines that contain advertising and are available in most
school libraries.
   The posters have won commendations for their educational value,
Cheek emphasized. In May, she said, ``Connections'' received an
award from the Educational Press Association of America for an
issue last fall focusing on the U.S. Constitution.
   Reaction to the program ranges from acceptance to anger.
   ``I've never found anything offensive,'' said Assistant
Principal John Holliday at Rosemount High School. ``The kids in
them are typical of what we have in school here. The role models
are good.''
   At Tartan High School in the St. Paul suburb of Oakdale,
Principal Lawrence Hartman said he takes a hard line against
advertisements in schools.
   ``We have categorically rejected it because it always carries
with it some ad message. This is a captive audience here,'' Hartman
said. ``I don't think we can utilize the fact they must be in
school...for profit.''
   The company says criticisms of the billboards smack of
hypocrisy. ``Many teams have uniforms sponsored by someone in the
community,'' Cheek said.
   Countered Ms. Anderson: ``Band uniforms don't say M&M's across
them.''
   Reproductions of famous paintings or students' artwork would be
more fitting for hallways, said Ms. Anderson. ``I don't think these
posters do anything to boost their self-esteem.''
   Lester Knight, a University of Tennessee elementary education
professor who is a paid member of ``The Big Picture'' advisory
board, said the educational value of the billboards value overcomes
any disadvantage of the advertising.
   ``I can understand why some people might say there is a captive
audience here,'' Knight said. ``At the same time, the ads are done
so creatively it seems they could be an impetus for some kids to do
creative things.''
   The American Association of School Administrators has no firm
guidelines on educational messages with advertising content, said
Gary Marx, the group's associate executive director. He said school
superintendents should weigh the educational value against the
prominence of the advertising message.
   The National Association of Secondary School Principals
publishes a list of corporate promotions and activities it finds
acceptable, but hasn't addressed the billboard issue.

<HEAD>AIDS Testing To Begin In Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compulsory testing of members of
high-risk groups for exposure to the AIDS virus will begin in
Hungary on June 15, the state news agency MTI said Friday.
   Those subject to the tests will include people who suffer or are
suspected of suffering from venereal disease, sexual partners of
identified AIDS victims, prostitutes, prison inmates and
intravenous drug users, MTI said.
   The new tests are in addition to the compulsory testing of blood
donors introduced in 1986.
   Those who test positive for exposure to the AIDS virus will be
directed to a competent regional specialist, MTI said.
   Should a known AIDS sufferer fail to attend prescribed regular
examinations or observe doctors' orders, regional health officials
will be empowered to take ``necessary measures,'' MTI said. It did
not say what the measures were.
   The first AIDS cases in Hungary were detected in 1985. By
November 1987, official statistics placed the number of reported
AIDS cases at 148 out of a total population of 10.6 million.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   The defense in former Gov. Evan Mecham's
criminal trial tried to establish in testimony today that Arizona's
campaign financial reporting procedure can be difficult for
candidates to understand.
   Mecham and his brother Willard, his 1986 campaign treasurer,
face felony charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan on
financial reports required by the state.
   Secretary of State Jim Shumway testified that his office would
advise a campaign to seek legal help if it asked how to report a
loan that was backed by promissory notes, such as the loan from
developer Barry Wolfson.
   Under questioning by Willard Mecham's lawyer, Joe Keilp, Shumway
said his office does not provide instructions on how to fill out
all of the required reports.
   Prosecutor Michael Cudahy objected as Keilp asked Shumway
whether his office had been working recently with other state
officials to revise the law.
   Cudahy also objected when Keilp referred several times to a
meeting Evan Mecham sought with Shumway in October 1987, after the
$350,000 loan was revealed by the news media. Judge Michael Ryan of
Maricopa County Superior Court ruled Thursday that testimony on the
meeting was inadmissible because any advice Mecham sought at the
time was irrelevant to his intent in filing his financial
statements months earlier.
   On Thursday, former top Mecham aide Edith Richardson testified
that the loan was well known among his inner circle.
   Mrs. Richardson said that she learned, probably early in 1987,
that developer Barry Wolfson had provided Mecham with the money.
   ``It was just common knowledge that there was a loan,'' Mrs.
Richardson, former special assistant to Mecham, told the Maricopa
County Superior Court jury.
   Mecham and his brother Willard, his 1986 campaign treasurer,
face felony charges of concealing the loan on financial statements
required by the state.
   Other witnesses in the trial have testified that they may have
had some general knowledge of a loan, but that they did not know
Wolfson was involved.
   Meanwhile, attorneys took a formal deposition Thursday from Gov.
Rose Mofford during a closed session at her home, but defense
lawyers later decided it will not be introduced as evidence. The
deposition was to be used in lieu of Mrs. Mofford's testimony in
court, because she still has been suffering ill effects from a mild
concussion she received in a recent fall.
   According to a tape recording of the deposition session, Mrs.
Mofford said she knew nothing about the Wolfson loan, about
Mecham's campaign and personal financial disclosure statements or
about the criminal case.
   Mecham is on trial on six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in
prison if convicted on all counts. His co-defendant and brother,
who served as campaign manager, is charged with three similar
counts and faces up to 9{ years in prison if convicted.
   The defense has contended that the $350,000 loan was properly
reported as part of a $465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution
from Mecham. The defense also has said the failure to itemize the
loan was an innocent mistake.
   Mecham, a Republican, took office in January 1987. He was
removed from office April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of
two unrelated impeachment counts.

<HEAD>US Official Discusses East German Plan To Pay Victims Of Holocaust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>POTSDAM, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. official on Friday discussed
with East German leaders a plan that for the first time would
provide payments from this communist nation to Jewish victims of
the Nazi Holocaust.
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead met with Foreign
Minister Oskar Fischer to discuss details of East German plan, made
public by the official ADN news agency on Wednesday.
   ``We welcome the announcement,'' Whitehead later told The
Associated Press.
   The ADN dispatch said East Germany was prepared to lend
``humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust living
outside its borders.
   East German officials previously had argued that their nation,
which was formed in 1949, bore no legal or moral responsibility for
the actions of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   The news agency did not specify the amount of the payments.
Whitehead said Friday that the amount ``is currently being
discussed.''
   On Monday, Heinz Galanski, chairman of the West German Jewish
Council, said East Germany was prepared to pay up to $100 million
to Holocaust victims.
   Whitehead that he and Fischer would meet again to discuss the
issue within the next few days.
   ``We hope this matter can be resolved in the near future,''
Whitehead said.
   More than 6 million Jews were killed under Nazi rule.
   In 1952, the Luxembourg Agreement covering reparations was
signed by the World Jewish Congress and West Germany, but not by
East Germany.
   Since then, West Germany has paid more than 80 billion marks _
worth $48 billion in today's currency exchange _ to Holocaust
survivors.
   Whitehead indicated that there was an urgency in providing the
additional aid.
   ``It is a tragic situation (the plight of Holocaust survivors)
because the victims, if you think about it, are now quite elderly.
There are only a small number of them left,'' Whitehead said.
   Whitehead said talks on the issue also would continue with East
German officials in Washington.
   Whitehead and Fischer are attending a three-day conference on
East-West security issues in Potsdam.

   A single-engine plane crashed nose-down in a
field near this central Texas town today after losing radio and
radar contact with air controllers. All four men on board were
killed, authorities said.
   The flight was believed to have originated in the Texas
Panhandle and was bound for Austin, about 25 miles west of the
crash site, authorities said.
   The plane flipped over and crashed nose-down, said Con Keirsey,
Bastrop County deputy sheriff. The propeller was buried in the
earth.
   Three of the victims were from Perryton, about 110 miles
northeast of Amarillo, and a fourth victim was from nearby Booker,
said Ochiltree County sheriff's spokeswoman Judy Guinn. The four
were identified as businessmen but their names were not released,
pending notification of their families.
   The downed plane was discovered at 8:51 a.m. by a Department of
Public Safety helicopter on a training mission from Austin, said
agency spokesman Mike Cox said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mitch Barker said the
plane was on an instrument landing approach to Austin when radio
and radar contact was lost.
   The helicopter pilot told ground crews the plane appeared to
have hit the gound at a severe angle, authorities said.
   ``All you could see was a crumpled up plane,'' said Bobby Dodds,
who lives about a mile north of the crash site.

   Secretary of Transportation Jim
Burnley today proposed a drug testing program for interstate big
rig truckers and drivers of passenger buses to make the nation's
highways safer.
   ``When society has a drug problem, no segment of our population,
from welfare recipients to Wall Street brokers, is exempt from it.
The trucking industry is clearly vulnerable as well,'' Burnley said
at a news conference at the Le Mondrian Hotel here.
   He said although there are no firm statistics to indicate how
many of the nation's truck drivers are drug abusers, he cited a
June 1987 test of 317 tractor-trailer drivers in Tennessee that
showed 15 percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana,
cocaine and prescription stimulants.
   The proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million drivers of
commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, drivers
of vehicles that transport 16 or more people or drivers
transporting hazardous materials. School bus drivers and intercity
bus drivers would not be affected by the proposal, he said.
   The Department of Transportation is proposing five types of drug
testing, including pre-employment, random, post-accident, as part
of a physical, and for reasonable cause when a trucker is suspected
of using narcotics.

honors.
   At Thursday's graduation, Warner, 17, was cheered on by one of

a younger sister. In his role as Theo Huxtable, Warner struggles
through his homework while dreaming of flying.
   The actor said his first plans were to ``buy myself a new car.''
   After lunch with his family, Warner went back to work Thursday
evening in ``Three Ways Home,'' a three-person play at the

   Randy Travis, Barbara Mandrell, Reba
McEntire and other country music stars appearing at this year's Fan
Fair remember what it was like to be a nobody.
   ``It's been four years ago that I had my first booth at Fan
Fair. Very few of 'em (fans) came to see me. Not many at all,''
said Travis, who won four awards, including entertainer of the
year, at the annual Music City News country music awards on Monday.
   Up to 24,000 people were in town for the annual fair, which
features concerts and 365 autograph booths at the state fairgrounds
for fans to meet favorite artists up close. This week's fair began
Monday and wrapped up Friday.
   Miss Mandrell recalled she and sisters Irlene and Louise fixed
up their booth themselves the first year they attended the event.
   ``And I sat in it full time, the whole time it was open, every
day. And I would be sitting there for as long as 15 minutes at a
stretch before anybody would stop to get an autograph,'' she said.
   Miss McEntire said at her first Fan Fair in 1976, she was pretty
much ignored. ``People would come by ... and ask, `Where's the
bathroom?' or `When are the Statler Brothers gonna be here?''' she

   ``Wall Street'' bad guy Michael Douglas
made his first appearance as a court witness when he testified
during a murder trial.
   Douglas, who won an Academy Award for his role as a greedy
tycoon in the film, was called as a character witness Thursday at
the murder trial of David P. Thompson, a beer importer accused of
killing his landlord with a .357- caliber Magnum.
   Douglas testified he met Thompson six times in 1986 when he was
considering investing in the importer's firm. He said he never saw
Thompson show signs of a hot temper.
   Thompson displayed ``good business acumen and good marketing
skills,'' said Douglas, who saw some make-believe court action as a

   Phil Donahue has been exchanging sharp
words with an architect and a historian after demolishing a
modernistic house next door to his Tudor-style mansion.
   ``Why didn't somebody take care of this building?'' the talk
show host said after he had the 26-year-old all-concrete house
razed Wednesday. ``Where were all these caring people when the
building was unoccupied?''
   Some local historians described the experimental house as the
affluent town's most architecturally significant building, a
sculpture as well as structure.
   Donahue, who bought the house and 7.2 acres of land around it
for $6 million two months ago, said he didn't know about the
house's architectural significane and that he wanted more space,
privacy and security for his wife, actress Marlo Thomas, and their
family.
   John M. Johansen, the architect who designed the house, said:
``This wasn't a very exemplary act from a public figure. And
they've nicknamed him `Mr. Sensitivity.'''
   ``I still get knots in my stomach when I think about it,'' said
Mary McCahon, Westport's architectural historian. ``It was a
wonderful building. The best design in Westport.''

<HEAD>Kuwait Would Be First Arab Nation To Get F-A-18 Fighter-Bombers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Friday it wants
to sell up to 40 F-A-18 warplanes to Kuwait, which would be the
first Arab state to get America's most sophisticated
fighter-bombers.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced the sale plan
and said the triggering of a 50-day process under which Congress
could block the proposed $1 billion sale was imminent.
   The sale would be part of an administration policy of arming
Persian Gulf nations endangered by attacks spilling over from the
7-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Gulf states have also benefited from U.S.
naval cover for tankers plying the oil routes.
   Congressional opposition to the sale is likely, however, from
members who have noted that Kuwait, like other Arab nations, is
technically in a state of war with Israel. Some lawmakers also have
complained that U.S. arms sales to the region will contribute to an
already-dangerous weapons buildup in the gulf, without enhancing
U.S. security.
   State Department officials met privately with members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday in an effort to
allay some of those fears.
   Richard W. Murphy, assistant secretary of state for Near East
affairs, said last month that the administration favored the sale
of advanced aircraft to Kuwait, but Friday's announcement was the
first on-the-record word that the F-A-18, produced by McDonnell
Douglas, was chosen over other candidates.
   F-A-18s, the newest jets in the U.S. Navy's carrier-based
arsenal, are twin-engine craft with the latest electronic guidance
systems. Kuwait chose these planes because they could hit targets
throughout the gulf and could make a quick transition between
bombing and interception missions.
   Pentagon officials said also considered were F-16s, older planes
with dual capability but less versatility to change roles quickly,
and the F-15, which is a high-performance fighter with limited
bomber capacity.
   Only Australia, Canada and Spain _ all formal allies of the
United States _ have been permitted to buy F-A-18s.
   If Kuwait purchases all 40 planes authorized, the contract would
be worth about $1 billion for McDonnell Douglas, which competes
heavily with the French makers of the Mirage 2000 jet.
   A State Department arms expert said Friday that one of the
arguments the administration could make to Congress is that if
Kuwait is denied permission to buy F-A-18s, it will turn to
Mirages, giving the French manufacturer the profit.
   Unlike Israel and Egypt, who purchase billions of dollars of
U.S. weapons with funds from the U.S. foreign aid budget, Kuwait
would buy the F-A-18s with its own money.
   The Kuwaitis also are reported to be ready to buy armaments that
can be carried by F-A-18s and other U.S. planes: Maverick
air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air Sidewinder missiles and Harpoon
anti-ship missiles.
   Under U.S. arms sale law, the administration sends an
``informal'' notice to Capitol Hill of its intention to sell
weapons to a particular country. Then 20 days later, formal notice
is given and Congress has 30 days to block the transfer if both
houses concur.

<HEAD>Armenian Strikes, Marches Shut Down Several Soviet Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Armenians have shut down
several southern cities with daily strikes and marches to demand
that the region in which they live be joined with the Armenian
republic, Pravda reported Friday.
   The Communist Party newspaper said the strikes began May 23 and
shut down most industries and mass transit in Stepanakert, the main
city of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Also affected were three regional centers within
Nagorno-Karabakh: Martunin, Mardakert and Askeran. Nearly all
cafeterias and stores were closed, but farms continue to operate,
according to Pravda.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is an autonomous region of the Soviet republic
of Azerbaijan in the Caucasus Mountains. Its 160,000 people are
mostly Armenian.
   Since February, Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have demanded the
region be taken from Azerbaijan and made part of Armenia.
   ``Every morning, tens of thousands of people move side-by-side
in columns along streets toward the center of the city (of
Stepanakert), with banners and signs, conducting demonstrations,''
the newspaper reported.
   Armenians have set up ``self-defense posts'' around the clock to
prevent attacks by Azeris, Pravda said. But it said such measures
are unnecessary because there haven't been any attacks.
   Tensions are so high that some Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh
have set up a system of 24-hour guards to prevent attacks by
Azeris, Pravda said.
   Residents of the area and Moscow-based dissidents have been
reporting the latest wave of unrest to Western journalists, but the
Soviet press carried nothing on the situation until Friday.
   Phone calls to the region on Friday did not go through.
   Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh complain of poor cultural
and social services and discrimination by Azeris, the main ethnic
group in Azerbaijan. Armenians are predominantly Christian, while
most Azeris are Moslem.
   The newspaper said unrest in the region has cost the government
$41 million.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has become the most severe issue
involving some of the country's more than 100 nationalities. Taking
advantage of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness on some issues, Armenians have been
staging street rallies, marches and strikes.
   The government has refused to give Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia
and ordered improvements in living conditions for the region's
people.
   One Azerbaijani official said the issue would never have been so
openly aired before Gorbachev took power in 1985.
   ``There was national self-awareness before April 1985,'' Shakyul
Aleskerov, the party chief of the Ordubadsky region of Azerbaijan,
told the newspaper Syelskaya Zhizn. ``They simply didn't talk about
it so openly and concretely.'' In an interview published Friday, he
said that behind the ``beautiful slogans of equality and
brotherhood accumulated unsolved problems.''
   Gorbachev has said nationalities' problems are among the most
acute facing the country and that a meeting of the policy-making
Communist Party Central Committee should be devoted to them.
   ``Such an unusual and unexpected word for us,'' Pravda said,
referring to the ``strike'' that has affected Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Soviet officials used to describe strikes as a Western
phenomenon that was anathema to their socialist system of rule by
the working class.
   But strikes have become a frequent way for Armenians to press
their demand.
   Pravda acknowledged that the central Soviet press had been
ignoring the Nagorno-Karabakh story since February, when the unrest
began, but that in the meantime ``tension in the region did not
subside.''
   It said it was providing an update now because readers had
written letters asking if the situation had improved.
   Pravda said Armenians have been mixing rumors and facts about
what happened in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and that this has
led to unwarranted fear. Azeris went on a rampage at the end of
February in Sumgait, and 32 people were killed, most of them
Armenians.
   Pravda disclosed that Azeris staged their own demonstrations May
14-15 in their capital of Baku and other Azerbaijani cities. The
newspaper blamed Nagorno-Karabakh's party officials for not ending
the strike.
   The region's top party official, Boris Kevorkov, was fired Feb.
24 and kicked out of the party in late May for negligence that
Soviet media said exacerbated the ethnic conflict.
   Demonstrations also have been taking place in Yerevan, the
capital of Armenia. A group of Armenians began a sit-in outside the
city's Opera Theater on May 25. They want the parliament of
Armenia, the Supreme Soviet, to consider their demands to annex
Nagorno-Karabakh at a meeting on Wednesday.

   Pianist Van Cliburn is to perform in Dallas for
the first time in 11 years at the inauguration next year of the new
home of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra.
   The concert at the Morton S. Meyerson Symphony Center is
scheduled Sept. 8, 1989, a symphony official said Thursday.
   The pianist, who lives in Fort Worth, began to perform again
recently after 11 years. He accepted President Reagan's invitation
to perform at a White House dinner for Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev last fall.
   The $79 million Meyerson center will hold its first music-making
event with an orchestra concert on Sept. 6, 1989. The
invitation-only performance will feature violinist Isaac Stern as
guest soloist.

   They differ on why, but friends and foes of Florida
Sen. Bob Graham agree on one thing _ he's a political winner.
   ``Graham's a phenomenon,'' said Charles Black, a Republican
consultant who helped run then-Sen. Paula Hawkins' unsuccessful
1986 re-election bid against Graham. ``He is not what you call a
charismatic personality, but he's a public relations genius.''
   ``Bob Graham has managed to survive in Florida because he has
some of the attributes, the personal skills, of Ronald Reagan,''
added J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich, chief adviser to Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez. ``He is able to communicate very well with the mass
public, symbolically and physically. He is very skilled at
convincing everybody he's on their side.''
   The first-term senator is on most lists of potential Democratic
running mates for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, although
Graham's brief Washington tenure could work against him.
Conventional wisdom would point the governor in the direction of
someone with long experience in the nation's capital.
   Graham also has some serious policy disagreements with Dukakis.
For example, he is known for vigorous enforcement of the death
penalty, signing more than 150 death warrants while 16 executions
were carried out, and for support of military aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras. Dukakis opposes both.
   Among his advantages, Graham would give Dukakis a strong
opportunity to carry electoral giant Florida, which Graham governed
for eight years.
   Graham has solid ``New South'' progressive credentials and his
years as governor saw major education and environmental programs.
   While Graham isn't an exciting speaker, he's proven to be a
tireless, enthusiastic campaigner given to singing and poking fun
at himself. He was a star attraction at annual Florida press corps
skits in which Graham did take-offs on rock music stars and Latin
dictators.
   He built his uphill gubernatorial campaign in 1978 around ``100
Workdays,'' spending a day each at 100 jobs including Hialeah
stable boy, tomato picker, garbage man, bellboy, and chicken parts
processor. The workdays have continued monthly.
   ``He'll go on stage in boxer shorts or paint his face and put on
a headdress,'' Stipanovich recalled. ``In that way he would be a
good counterweight to Dukakis.''
   On the campaign trail, it's often easy to forget that Graham is
a Harvard-educated lawyer and multimillionaire whose family made a
fortune in land development and dairy cattle. His late father,
Ernest, ran successfully for state senator in 1936, the year Graham
was born, and his half-brother, Philip Graham, ran The Washington
Post and was a major Democratic power broker until his suicide in
1963.
   Graham has been a low-key senator. Quietly, he has been active
in Latin American policy and often meets with Reagan administration
officials and leading Democratic colleagues on those issues. He
recently completed a three-nation tour of South America and
returned with detailed knowledge of the complex Latin debt problem,
displayed at a Washington news conference that some reporters
admitted went over their heads.
   Graham suggested that Florida _ which Dukakis called ``a
bellwether state'' before winning its March 8 primary _ is a key
state for Democrats, who have seen only Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy
Carter carry it in the last four decades.
   Democrats still hold a 3-2 lead in registered voters, but the
state has been a challenge to campaign strategists because of its
mix of traditional southern Democratic conservatives in the north,
Reaganites along its Gulf Coast, northeastern liberals along
southeastern Florida, and large blocs of Hispanics and senior
citizens.
   ``If a campaign can be constructed that will carry Florida, that
almost assures that Dukakis will carry the country,'' Graham said.
``If you carry Florida, that means that a Democrat has broad enough
appeal to win anywhere.''
   Although he has indicated he would be interested in
consideration by Dukakis, Graham plays down the possibility.
   ``It's very flattering to be included on a list of some people I
admire _ Sam Nunn, John Glenn, Lloyd Bentsen and the others _ but
I'm not going to be affected by that,'' Graham said. ``I'm looking
forward to the challenges of the Senate. That's where I anticipate
that I will be the next several years.''

<HEAD>`Pee-Wee's Playhouse' Artist Puts Stuff on Display</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``You know one of those picture-drawing
guys who thought up the stuff at my place, `Pee-wee's Playhouse,'
like the talking chair and weird puppets and stuff?
   ``Yeah, well, he draws weird stuff for grown-ups, too, but I
think kids like it, too. You can take your mom and dad to see it at
this place in Pepsi-Cola, Fla. Neat, huh?''
   Wait a minute, Pee Wee, that's Pensacola, and the stuff Gary
Panter draws and sculpts is art. It's on display at his first
one-man show through July 16 at the Pensacola Museum of Art.
   But you're right, it is a bit weird.
   The 37-year-old New York artist is one of three people who
design sets for the popular children's television show starring
Paul Reubens, better known as Pee-wee Herman, with the cherry lips,
bow tie and squeaky voice.
   Panter also designs Pee-wee toys and says he'll probably do more
``Pee-wee stuff.'' But he wants to be known for more.
   ``As fun as Pee-wee is, it's not as fun as just painting a
picture,'' Panter said in an interview with the Pensacola News
Journal published Friday.
   ``Everything kind of comes out of painting for me, but modern
art painting theory is so broad you can do anything and call it
painting,'' said Panter, who also has designed album covers for
Frank Zappa and others.
   The show exhibits 22 pieces diverse both in subject and style:
cartoon animals, primitive buffaloes, dinosaur sculptures,
psychedelic murals and simple line pieces.
   They range in size from ``Cookie Company,'' a mural occupying an
entire wall, to ``Dinosaur,'' a 15-inch tall sculpture that would
fit in Pee-wee's toy box.
   Director Mary Takach said the museum occasionally likes to show
works by up-and-coming contemporary artists and chose Panter partly
because of his association with Reubens.
   Panter says he has been inspired by a range of sources including
Picasso, Andy Warhol and Walt Disney. His goal, he said, is to
bring art to ``where it doesn't belong, trying to bridge the gap
between fine art and commercial art.''
   ``It's like when you're driving out in the jungle or somewhere
and you come across a big Smurf sign,'' he said. ``It's really
neat.''

   James J. Dukerstadt was named president
of the University of Michigan by the school's board of regents
Friday.
   Duderstadt, university's provost and vice president for academic
affairs since 1986, becomes the school's 11th president Sept. 1.
   His appointment ends a selection process that began after Harold
Shapiro announced in April 1987 that he was leaving Michigan to
become president of Princeton University. Shapiro assumed that post
Jan. 1.
   Duderstadt, 45, graduated from Yale University in 1964 with a
bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. At the California
Institute of Technology, he earned a master's degree in 1965 and a
doctorate in engineering science and physics in 1967.
   Duderstadt joined Michigan in 1969 as an assistant professor of
nuclear engineering. He also was dean of the College of Engineering.

   One man was killed and another seriously
wounded by the same bullet, police said.
   Police spokesman Roger Austin said Peter Garcia, 18, was holding
the gun pointed at his head Thursday when it went off, apparently
accidentally. The bullet went through Garcia's head and struck Luke
Schinzel, 19, in the face, police said.
   Garcia died a few hours later at a hospital. Schinzel was
hospitalized in serious condition in Phoenix.
   Austin said several people aged 18 to 20 were at an apartment
when Garcia went to his car and brought the automatic handgun to
the door. Austin said the gun did not belong to Garcia and he may
not have known the gun had an adjustable trigger set to go off at a
light touch.

<HEAD>Final Arguments on Whether To Authorize Marijuana for Medical Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge heard final arguments Friday on
whether marijuana has a medical use, with proponents contending
that the drug can help people suffering from a variety of diseases
and the government maintaining that the drug's safety has not been
proven.
   Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young did not specify when
he would make his recommendations on the issue to the head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, but lawyers for both sides said
they expected Young's ruling by late summer or early fall.
   At issue in the 16-year-old case is whether marijuana should be
reclassified from a Schedule I drug _ where it, like heroin and
LSD, cannot be produced by pharmaceutical companies and has no
accepted medical use _ to a Schedule II drug that can be marketed
for medical uses.
   The hearings before Young began last November in New Orleans,
continued in San Francisco in December and moved to Washington in
January. In that time, legalization advocates, among them the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and the
Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, presented dozens of witnesses
who said marijuana could help cancer patients suffering from nausea
from chemotherapy treatments, glaucoma sufferers and people with
multiple sclerosis and a host of other neurological diseases.
   Attorney Kevin Zeese, representing NORML, told the judge that
thousands of people were tested after using marijuana for medical
reasons in federally approved state experiments, and ``the lack of
side effects was astounding. The most common side effect was
fatigue and dry mouth, which are not significant compared to the
side effects of other drugs commonly prescribed to these people.''
   Attorney Frank B. Stilwell III, representing the Alliance for
Cannabis Therapeutics, argued that ``society at large accepts
marijuana as a medicine'' and said the DEA ``is so caught up in the
drug war, it is afraid to say that marijuana has medical uses.''
   Charlotte Mapes, representing the DEA, countered that marijuana
is a complex drug whose effects are not known completely and that
further testing is needed. She also said that groups like the
American Medical Association had not endorsed the use of marijuana
for medical purposes.
   ``Aren't there politics involved in the AMA's position?'' the
judge asked Ms. Mapes. She said there were.
   The judge at another point asked Ms. Mapes whether she agreed
with arguments by the legalization advocates that the federal
government's standards on drug legalization were slanted toward
synthetically produced drugs.
   ``They argue that we have a situation where monied
pharmaceutical companies are willing and able to send great sums of
money to win approval for drugs,'' Young said. ``The petitioners
argue that the federal standards are not slanted toward natural
drugs.''
   Ms. Mapes responded that the Food and Drug Administration ``is
constructed toward the needs of pharmaceutical companies,'' adding,
though, that ``the federal standards for drug approval are also
accepted by the medical community.''
   The case dates back to 1972, when NORML petitioned the DEA to
remove marijuana from its drug schedules, in effect, to
decriminalize possession of the drug.
   The DEA took no action in the case until 1979 when it announced
that it would continue to classify marijuana as unfit for medical
use. NORML, by that time joined by the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics, appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
And the court ordered the DEA to reconsider its action and to
conduct hearings on the issue.
   Also arguing against legalizing marijuana for medical use at
Friday's hearing was Karl Burnstein, president of the National
Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth, based in Silver Spring,
Md.
   Burnstein said his group was concerned that ``if marijuana would
be rescheduled, what kind of message would that be sending to this
nation? Our citizens are not familiar'' with the details of federal
laws, he said, adding that he feared the nation's youth would say
that ``if marijuana is good for all these (medical) things, why
isn't it good for me?''

   A bomb ripped through a house near the
home of officials of the guerrilla-backed African National
Congress, injuring a 12-year-old girl in an adjacent building,
police said Friday.
   Police said the attack occurred Thursday night in the Libala
suburb. They said the home also was hit with machine gun fire.
   Residents in the neighborhood said the blast and machine gun
attack demolished part of the house and shattered the windows of
nearby buildings.
   The injured girl was cut by flying glass, police said. She was
treated at the main hospital in Lusaka. There were no other
injuries.
   It was not immediately known how many occupants were in the
house at the time of the attack.
   Witnesses said the front walls were peppered with bullet holes.
The house was sealed off by police Friday as forensic experts
sifted through the debris, they said.
   The African National Congress is the main guerrilla group
fighting white domination in South Africa and trying to overthrow
the South African government. It maintains its external
headquarters in Lusaka.
   In the past, Pretoria has been blamed for bombings and commando
attacks on ANC houses and offices in Zambia and neighboring
black-ruled nations.
   The ANC declined to comment on the attack Friday. ANC spokesman
Tom Sebina refused to identify the senior ANC officials that local
residents said used a nearby house in Libala.

   President Reagan on Friday presented the first
annual Ronald Reagan Award for Volunteer Excellence to a feisty
91-year-old woman from Jacksonville, Fla., who chided him about his
jokes.
   The presentation climaxed a luncheon at which the president gave
awards for volunteer action to 18 individuals and organizations.
   After Reagan finished giving the regular awards, Bobby Trimble
of Midland, Texas, who received an award at the first such luncheon
in 1982, announced establishment of the Reagan award.
   Trimble said future presidents will select the winner, but in
this case the winner was chosen by leaders of volunteer
organizations in order to keep the creation of the award a secret.
   The winner was Arnolta Williams, a leader in the Jacksonville
black community who has engaged in a variety of volunteer
activities and been credited with helping smooth the way to
peaceful racial integration there.
   After saying how honored he was to give the award to Mrs.
Williams, the president said he would like to stay all afternoon,
but, ``Nancy tells me I've got to help her with the dishes.''
   ``Don't you make another joke like that,'' Mrs. Williams cracked.
   ``Mama Williams,'' said the president, ``that may not be as much
a joke as you think. One of the best jobs I ever had was when I was
in college washing dishes in the girls' dormitory.''
   ``That was before you were married,'' Mrs. Williams said.
   ``Yes,'' said Reagan.
   The winners in addition to Mrs. Williams were:
   _Kaye Kiker, York, Ala., founder of Alabamians for a Clean
Environment.
   _SHARE, Inc., of Los Angeles, an organization of women in the
entertainment industry who raise funds for nonprofit organizations.
   _Operation Comeback, Orlando, Fla., which assists troubled
adolescents referred to Juvenile Court.
   _Verlyn R. and Martha J. Roskam, Glen Ellyn, Ill., founder of an
organization that solicits contributed goods from companies and
gives them to colleges in return for scholarships.
   _The 1987 International Summer Special Olympics Committee Inc.,
South Bend, Ind., which helps mentally retarded athletes.
   _Red River Revel Arts Festival, Shreveport, La., an annual event
since 1976.
   _Roberta R. Roper of Upper Marlboro, Md., who has worked for the
rights of victims of crime since her college-age daughter was
kidnapped and murdered six years ago.
   _First Bank System Community First Program, St. Paul, Minn., a
program to encourage employees to participate in volunteer work.
   _Thomas W. Evans, a New York attorney who developed a program to
expose high school students to the workings of the law.
   _Zachary Fisher of New York, who has led in development of the
USS Intrepid as a sea-air-space museum in New York harbor.
   _Time Inc., Time to Read, New York, a tutoring program using
corporate and community volunteers.
   _Mission Air Ministries, Charlotte, N.C., which provides air
transportation to patients who cannot afford the air fare to
hospitals and medical centers.
   _Barberton Council of Labor Free Clinic Development Project,
Barberton, Ohio, a free medical clinic for residents of a community
with 33 percent unemployment.
   _Margaret A. Gallimore, Dallas, a nurse who has provided a home
for 20 people with AIDS since 1987.

   Four drug suspects pried apart the wooden
floorboards of a police wagon and escaped, triggering a review of
the aging vehicles, police said Friday.
   ``I suppose it's embarrassing,'' Lt. Gary Hall said of
Thursday's escape from a wagon estimated to be at least 20 years
old.
   Two of the four men were quickly captured, but the two were
still free Friday, Hall said.
   ``Over the years the floorboard had cracked and deteriorated,''
Hall said. ``Somehow the suspects managed to loop a shoestring
around the cracked board, pried it up, broke it and pulled up some
other boards.''
   The men slithered through the 24-by-30-inch hole and fled, he
said.
   The four men had been arrested for investigation of narcotics
sales. They were locked in the wagon at the Hollywood station for
transfer to police headquarters.
   ``Most of the paddy wagons have steel floors,'' Hall said.
``They'll have to put some sheet metal in this one and I guess
check them all citywide.''

<HEAD>Iraqi Planes Raid Tanker off Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi warplanes raided a tanker off Iran
at dawn Friday, one day after ending a two-week lull in the Persian
Gulf sea war with an attack on a salvage tug that served Iranian
vessels.
   The raids coincided with a declaration of support from an Arab
summit for Iraq's efforts to force Iran to accept a cease-fire
resolution the U.N. Security Council passed unanimously last July.
   A final communique issued Thursday by the Arab League summit in
Algiers criticized Iranian ``intransigence'' in refusing to settle
its war with Iraq, which began in September 1980. It praised Iraq's
willingness to talk peace and its military achievements in the war.
   Iraq has attacked Iranian oil facilities and tankers Iran owns
and charters since 1983 in an attempt to dry up the petroleum
exports with which the Iranians finance the war. The Iraqis also
pay for the war with oil, but most of their exports go overland by
pipeline.
   Iran attacks neutral commercial shipping in response, most often
in the southern gulf in or near the narrow Strait of Hormuz that
provides the only sea access to the waterway.
   More than 500 ships have been attacked and more than 300 seamen
killed.
   A military spokesman in Baghdad said jets patrolling over
Iranian waters ``spotted and attacked a large maritime target,''
the standard term for a tanker, scoring an ``accurate and effective
hit.''
   Gulf shipping executives had no immediate confirmation. They
said an attack reported Thursday referred to the salvage tugboat
Salverve, which flies the Singapore flag and serves Iranian
shipping in the northern gulf.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit of London said two seamen on
the 742-ton Salverve were killed. Salvage executives said they
probably were Filipinos.
   Iraqi planes have hit the Salverve twice before _ in July 1987
and last January while it was towing an Iranian tanker crippled in
a previous raid. The British captain and two Filipino seamen were
killed in the January attack.
   Many of the ships Iran attacks belong to or trade with Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, which Iran accuses of aiding Iraq in the war.
   Eleven Kuwaiti tankers, half the sheikdom's fleet, were given
American flags and registration last July so U.S. warships could
protect them.
   Saudi Arabia broke relations with Iran on April 26, citing
attacks on shipping and riots by Iranians during the annual Islamic
pilgrimage to Mecca last summer in which more than 400 people were
killed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the biggest increase in food costs
since January, wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.5 percent in May,
the government said Friday, supporting beliefs that inflation is
accelerating but not dangerously.
   The rise in the Labor Department's producer price index for
finished goods in May was halfway between a 0.4 percent increase in
April and a 0.6 percent jump in March.
   But if it continued for 12 months, the annual rate of inflation
would amount to 5.8 percent, nearly triple the 2 percentage points
it has risen in the past year.
   ``There clearly is some inflation in the system, but the fears
of an inflationary boom are overblown,'' said Larry Chimerine,
president of the WEFA Group, formerly Wharton Econometrics, an
economic forecasting consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Also taking comfort in the May numbers were officials at the
White House, where spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Inflation
remains low and under control.''
   Food replaced energy as the primary impetus behind higher
wholesale prices last month. At the prices paid by grocery stores,
food rose 0.9 percent in May _ the biggest increase since a 1.7
percent jump in January.
   Egg prices jumped 12.5 percent, mostly offsetting a 16 percent
decline in April. Poultry prices were up 8.2 percent, pork was up
5.5 percent and vegetable prices rose 3.3 percent. However,
wholesale prices for fruit declined 0.9 percent and rice was down
3.2 percent.
   Wholesale food prices at the grocery store level are still only
0.6 per cent higher than they were a year ago. That trend is not
expected to continue, particularly with near-record dry weather in
the Farm Belt pushing raw commodity prices for food upward 2.4
percent in May.
   ``We've got a couple more months of bad food prices coming _
everybody knows that _ and then everything will calm down,'' said
Michael Evans, who runs a forecasting firm in Washington.
   Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University who
runs his own wholesale price survey, said the danger of higher food
prices setting off an inflationary spiral is much less than the
fear that they will.
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``inflationary perceptions are being
formed from the performance of a commodity index (the Commodity
Research Bureau Index) that depends heavily on grain prices.''
   ``Dry weather has increased fears that crop yields may be
harmed,'' Ratajczak said, ``but sufficient surpluses of all
products except soybeans should reduce the significance on prices.''
   Energy prices, which had surged 3.1 percent in April, rose only
0.2 percent in May, largely because of a 3.8 percent drop in
natural gas prices.
   Home heating oil rose a modest 0.7 percent, compared with hikes
of 5.2 percent in April and 2.6 percent in March. Gasoline prices
jumped 3.8 percent last month, but were still only 1.5 percent
higher than a year ago.
   The government's index for wholesale prices at the finished
goods level minus energy and food was up 0.3 percent. Analysts
consider this a more reliable indicator of underlying inflation
because of the month-to-month volatility of food and energy costs.
   Over the past year, wholesale prices excluding food and energy
have risen 2.8 percent.
   Leading the May increase in those non-food, non-energy items
were soaps and detergents, up 1.3 percent; women's clothing, up 0.8
percent; tires, up 3 percent, and prescription drugs, up 0.7
percent.
   Car prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in May after declining 1
percent in April on manufacturers' rebates to dealers. Higher
prices also were recorded for cosmetics, household flatware and
home electronic equipment, all of which had declined in April.
   Children's clothing prices dropped 1.3 percent after rising
slightly more than half a percent in April. The only other product
which had a price drop was alcoholic beverages, down 0.4 percent.
   The May increase brought the overall wholesale price index for
finished goods to 107.5, meaning that a basket of products costing
$100 in 1982 would cost $107.50 last month, up 60 cents from April.
   At the intermediate goods level _ items such as flour, fabrics,
steel mill products, lumber and fertilizers _ prices in May rose
0.6 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent rise in April.
   Excluding food, prices for raw commodities such as tobacco leaf,
cattle hides, coal and scrap metals rose just 0.3 percent in May,
compared with a 1.7 percent jump the previous month.
   So far this year, wholesale prices are rising slower than
consumer prices. For the first five months of 1988, wholesale costs
at the most widely cited finished goods level are up 3.4 percent.
Consumer prices through April are up 4.5 percent. May figures on
consumer prices are due out June 21.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts Help Services Meet Enlistment Goals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military services easily met or exceeded
their recruiting goals during the first half of the fiscal year,
thanks in part to budget cuts that lowered their manpower goals,
the Pentagon said Friday.
   The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps also reported
``excellent recruit quality,'' with the percentage of recruits
possessing a high school diploma increasing to 92 percent from 91
percent a year earlier, the Pentagon said.
   Nonetheless, ``concern remains for future recruiting
prospects,'' said Grant S. Green Jr., the assistant defense
secretary for personnel.
   ``This year's recruiting objectives are significantly below
those of last year. Had the services been recruiting to last year's
levels, this quality might not have been achieved.''
   Releasing its latest quarterly report, the Defense Department
said the four services signed up a combined 133,000 recruits during
the first six months of fiscal 1988, a period that ended March 31.
   That compares with a combined goal of 131,100, and all four
services met or exceeded their individual objectives.
   By comparison, during the same period in fiscal 1987, the
services had to sign up 150,900 recruits. The recruiting objectives
have been falling because the Pentagon plans to cut active-duty
strength by almost 36,000 this year to cope with budget cuts.
   On the re-enlistment side, ``several key statistics trailed
those achieved during the comparable period fiscal 1987,'' Green
said.
   ``The Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force reported first-term
re-enlistment rates several percentage points below last year's
second-quarter numbers. The department will continue monitoring
retention trends closely ....''
   The Pentagon pays particular attention to the percentage of men
and women willing to re-enlist after completing their initial
obligation, viewing it as a measure not only of military readiness
and experience in the force but also job satisfaction.
   During the first half of fiscal 1988, 54 percent of Navy
personnel eligible to re-enlist for the first time did so _ down
from 58 percent during the same period a year ago.
   Similarly, the first term re-enlistment numbers dropped for the
Marine Corps from 35 percent to 32 percent, and for the Air Force
from 67 percent to 56 percent.
   The Army managed to buck that trend, reporting that first-term
re-enlistments rose from 40 percent to 46 percent.

   A man still wearing bandages from a
hit-and-run accident 10 days ago was struck and killed Friday by
another driver who fled the scene, police said.
   David Harding, 45, was killed as he crossed a street on
Jacksonville's west side. The accident occurred about 20 yards from
where Harding was struck previously, said Lt. Gary Looney.
   Harding was accompanied Friday by his landlady, who had stopped
to push the button for the traffic light. But he walked into the
intersection before the light changed, Looney said.

   Her students dressed her in a gold
cape and handmade crown, the school board named a kindergarten
classroom in her honor and the mayor declared it ``Nellie M. Karrey
Day.''
   It was all part of a celebration by this western Massachusetts
city for the teacher who, for more than a half-century, has gently
introduced its children to school.
   ``It was such a surprise. It was a big secret and the children
didn't tell,'' Miss Karrey, 78, said Friday. ``They were awfully
cute.'''
   She will retire this month after 54 years of teaching, including
51 in North Adams kindergarten classrooms.
   She and her three sisters, also teachers, never wanted to do
anything else, Miss Karrey said. ``I don't like cooking and I don't
like gardening, but kindergarten was my niche.''
   The celebrations began Thursday with a gala assembly at Greylock
Elementary School where, with a paper crown perched on her gray
curls, she accepted each class' handmade tributes, poems and cheers
as well as proclamations from local and national politicians.
   A fifth-grade class changed the lyrics of ``She's Coming Around
the Mountain'' and sang ``She gave us birthday cards and pulled our
teeth ... she taught all my aunts and uncles and grandpa, too.''
   ``One of the classes gave her a quilt, and put in it some of the
things that she was noted for, such as the clay handprints,'' said
Principal Stephen A. Boisvert.
   ``Every Christmas for as long as I can remember she has had each
of the children in her class make an imprint of their hand in clay.
And then she paints the imprints so they can give them to their
parents. They have become family treasures,'' he said.
   Thursday evening, more than 300 of her former students turned
out for an open house at the school. In keeping with one of her
traditions, each of Miss Karrey's former students received a
lollipop.
   ``She had a large tent in her classroom with a candle on top and
a box of lollipops inside and whenever one of the children had a
birthday they would light the candle and the child whose birthday
it was would get to pass out a lollipop to everyone in the class,''
Boisvert said.
   ``She's an outstanding teacher, because of her flexibility and
her warm relationship with the children,'' Boisvert said. Each fall
for the 23 years he has been at the school, he said, she has
gleefully reported that this was her best class ever.
   Five-year-olds, Miss Karrey said, haven't changed much over the
past 50 years.
   ``They're all sweet as youngsters,'' she said.
   ``The smart ones are very smart now, because of all the
opportunities they have to go places and be exposed to things
through television and VCRs,'' she said. ``And the others I'm not
going to tell you about.''
   As for teacher burnout, Miss Karrey scoffed.
   ``I don't know what they are talking about,'' she said. ``I love
the children and I'll miss them terribly.''

   Two gunmen burst into a hospital room Friday
and critically wounded a patient who had been shot in a barroom
brawl 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
   The gunmen fired another shot in the hall of the Monroe Regional
Medical Center as they fled, but no one else was hurt, said police
Sgt. Ken Hall.
   ``We are leaning toward some kind of bad blood grudge between
the victim and one of the suspects now at large,'' said Hall. ``We
have tentative identifications on the two suspects and are trying
to run them down.''
   The victim, Juan Ward, 27, was in critical condition Friday. He
was shot in the chest during a fight Thursday at Gwen's Inn. Two
other men were injured, and one was also admitted, but he was in
another part of the hospital when Ward was shot.
   Hall said the gunmen first entered a room next to Ward's and
threatened a patient by showing him a weapon and ordering him to
remain silent. They moved into Ward's room about 10 minutes later
and fired twice, hitting Ward in the chest and abdomen.

   Evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker said
Friday they don't have the money to buy back PTL, but they're
preparing to submit a plan to the bankruptcy trustee that would
allow them to go on television and ``quite a bit else.''
   ``We don't have money in the bank. We haven't asked for people
to put money in the bank. We will launch a campaign, perhaps in the
next few days, to do some of that,'' Bakker said at a news
conference.
   He said he had promises of support from some businesses in Rock
Hill and Fort Mill, near PTL's Heritage USA headquarters, but he
wouldn't provide names.
   ``We have commitments from various people. The finances is not
the problem. This is a very spiritual problem,'' he said, without
elaborating.
   Bakker, who met privately on Thursday with bankruptcy trustee
M.C. ``Red'' Benton, said he's drawing up a proposal that would put
the PTL founders back on television.
   The Bakkers were forced off the air out of the $160 million
evangelical empire they founded in a sex and money scandal. They
stepped down in March 1987 after revelations that ministry money
was used to pay a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, to keep quiet
about a sexual encounter she had with Bakker. That was followed by
further revelations of a lavish lifestyle led by the Bakkers.
   ``We are preparing in the next 48 hours a plan to present to Mr.
Benton and that would include air time and quite a bit else,''
Bakker said.
   Asked if he would use the air time to raise money, Bakker said
he and his wife want to use most of the time helping people.
   ``My goal is to spend most of my time ministering. We have
something that we want to say. We've learned a lot over the last
year and five months. We want to spend time helping hurting people,
to help people that are going through similar situations,'' Bakker
said.
   ``Needless to say, we're going to have to have help to pay the
bills,'' he added.
   Thursday's meeting was Bakker's first detailed discussion with
Benton. The trustee told Bakker that if his presence proved
disruptive at Heritage USA, he would ``really lay down the law with
him.''
   Bakker has said he is raising money to buy back PTL, but has
declined to discuss details, saying God was giving him direction.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is to rule Thursday on a
liquidation plan for the ministry that calls for most of its assets
to be sold, with the church and television studios to be leased
back by PTL.
   Mrs. Bakker, who underwent treatment for an addiction to
prescription drugs before the couple's departure from the ministry,
said she has not used drugs to cope with stress since their fall
from PTL.
   ``I haven't had a pill in a year and five months!'' she said.
``I made it totally, God and me. That was nice. It was good to be
able to do that.''

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service took custody of the

<TEXT>
   Rival Palestinian guerrilla factions
battled with mortars and machine guns in Beirut's two refugee camps
for a third day Friday. Police said eight people were killed and 50
wounded.
   One stray shell slammed into a crowded vegetable market near the
Chatilla camp at mid-afternoon, killing two people and wounding 31.
   The rest of the casualties occurred in overnight clashes between
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction and the
dissident Fatah-Uprising group in Chatilla and the Bourj
el-Barajneh camp, police said.
   The Syrian-backed dissidents are led by Col. Saeed Mousa,
code-named Abu Mousa, who broke away from Fatah in 1983 and set up
headquarters in Damascus, Syria.
   Friday's casualties increased the known casualties to 10 killed
and 60 wounded since the latest round of fighting between the
feuding wings erupted Wednesday.
   Also Friday, Israeli-backed militiamen opened fire on U.N.
peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and slightly wounded a Norwegian
soldier, a spokesman for the peacekeeping force said in Jerusalem.
   Members of the South Lebanon Army militia also held U.N. troops
at gunpoint for nearly an hour and prevented them from
administering first aid to the wounded man, said Timor Goksel,
spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or
UNIFIL.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across Beirut as a third
cease-fire mediated by a security committee made up of
representatives of neutral guerrilla factions collapsed after a
brief mid-morning lull.
   Arafat's loyalists had flushed out Abu Mousa's guerrillas from
both embattled shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting in the
last two months, despite a reconciliation between Arafat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
   But the dissidents regrouped at the Syrian-controlled edges of
the two camps in recent days, trying to counterattack, police
reported.
   Israeli army officials refused comment on the reported incident
involving pro-Israeli militiamen in south Lebanon.
   Goksel said the militiamen withdrew when an Israeli officer
arrived at the scene and ordered them to release the U.N. troops.
``We filed a complaint with the Israeli army,'' Goksel said. ``We
told them to get a rein on these people.''
   The South Lebanon Army, a force of mainly Christian Lebanese
militiamen, helps Israel patrol its self-declared ``security zone''
in southern Lebanon. Israel set up the zone, a 6-to-10-mile wide
strip of land north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, when it
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in June 1985, ending a
three-year occupation.
   Goksel said Friday's incident began when nine militiamen and
four members of the militia's security service broke through a U.N.
checkpoint near the village of Kaoukaba, about 10 miles north of
the Israeli-Lebanese border.
   In response, peacekeepers closed off the next UNIFIL checkpoint
guarded by six Norwegian soldiers.
   ``When the SLA people arrived at that checkpoint, they jumped
out, aimed their guns at the heads of the Norwegian soldiers, took
their weapons and forced them to lie on the ground,'' Goksel said.
   When a Norwegian officer, 2nd Lt. Rune Gleditch, arrived at the
scene and tried to defuse the situation, militiamen opened fire on
him, wounding him in the right knee, Goksel said.
   Gleditch was finally evacuated by helicopter and taken to a
hospital in southern Lebanon where he was reported in satisfactory
condition. Goksel said he did not know Gleditch's age or hometown.
   Since the 5,800-strong UNIFIL force was deployed in Lebanon in
1978, about 250 U.N. peacekeepers have been wounded, Goksel said.

<HEAD>Youth Patrollers Enlisted To Repel Riffraff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restaurant Row, a theater district block with
more than a score of fine-to-middling eating establishments, has
called in a volunteer anti-crime patrol to turn a tide of human
riffraff that has driven diners away.
   A team of 30 Guardian Angels, young men and women in red berets,
began patrolling the block this week, and there was ``marked
improvement'' after two days, Joe Allen, owner of a restaurant of
the same name, said Friday.
   ``I've had people calling up for reservations telling me how
glad they were that we are doing this and how much better it makes
them feel about coming here,'' he said.
   The patrollers on West 46th Street, have fingered drug dealers
for police arrests and kept crack-users, loiterers and prostitutes
on the move, Allen added.
   When an explosion of crack cocaine trafficking and loitering
reduced business by as much as 20 percent, Allen and 14 other
restaurant owners asked the Angels for help.
   The restaurateurs gave $300 each to finance the effort; the
Angels receive nothing personally. The restaurateurs supplied the
patrollers with walkie-talkies and allowed them to use a French
restaurant closed because of a slump in patronage as a headquarters
and barracks.
   The patrollers also are being fed, in rotation, by the
restaurants they are protecting. The first week the food has been
coming from Audrone, whose French-Continental fare is rated ``very
good to excellent'' in a popular restaurant guide.
   Restaurant Row has for years enjoyed a thriving business-lunch
trade and solid evening patronage from tourists and theatergoers.
Broadway's playhouses are a short walk away.
   ``My guys have gone from fast-food chicken to dishes they can't
pronounce. It'll be a while before they get a gourmet palate,''
said Curtis Sliwa, who founded the Angels in 1979 and now claims
about 5,000 members nationwide.
   The Angels were organized as an unarmed youth patrol to deter
subway crime. Though frowned on as unqualified vigilantes by
police, their presence reassured subway riders and they branched
out to escorting the elderly.
   Although police made 600 arrests last year in Restaurant Row's
immediate neighborhood and an additional 650 through May of this
year, the problems haven't gone away, said Deputy Inspector Edward
Fitzgerald, commander of the local police precinct.

<TEXT>
   Even for New York, no stranger to the
superlative, it's awesome: The New York International Festival of
the Arts aims to present 350 events, including 100 premieres,
during 31 days.
   In Friday's prologue, three Italian gondolas _ which crossed the
Atlantic by jet _ traveled down the Hudson River.
   The festival proper begins Saturday with the world premiere of
S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A., an American Ballet Theatre production set to
barber shop quartet music.
   There also is a new ballet and other fare Saturday evening, part
of the 100 premieres scattered among the festival's 31 continuous
days and nights of film, music, dance and theater offered mostly in
Manhattan.
   The theme? Highlighting the 20th century.
   ``There's been a lot done on other centuries,'' Martin E. Segal,
chairman of the festival and chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center,
said Friday.
   ``There hasn't been enough done on the 20th century. I would
rather people enjoy the works of the 20th century while they are
alive rather than have people comment on it while we are all dead.''
   So, from Indonesia to Ireland, from Canada to China, from Mali
to Mexico, from Belgium, France, Australia and other points
worldwide will tumble performing arts events that bear witness to
this century.
   Mary Martin will reprise her hit Sunday of ``My Heart Belongs to
Daddy,'' which she first sang 50 years ago during her Broadway
debut in Cole Porter's 1938 performance of ``Leave it to Me.''
   That's but one of the 75 events designed to capture the
evolution of music in this century. Playing the music of Debussy,
Stravinsky, Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein will be, among
others, the symphony orchestras of Chicago, Montreal, New York,
Philadelphia and St. Louis.
   There will be an international Pop series, an All-Duke Ellington
Evening, the JVC Jazz Festival and Placido Domingo's closing night,
free concert in Central Park.
   Dance works by George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham and newer
choreographers will be offered among the 11 dance premieres. The
American Ballet Theatre, the Dance Theatre of Harlem and the
Frankfurt Ballet are scheduled.
   Poland, Ireland and Argentina are represented among the theater
offerings. Six plays will premiere off Broadway. Works by Becket,
O'Casey and O'Neill are featured.
   Also on the menu are experimental works, film and television
tributes and showings, multi-arts happenings and symposia on
various arts topics.
   Every festival, however, has its setbacks.
   On Thursday, just before arriving in the United States, 23
performers from the Maly Dramatic Theater of Leningrad learned that
an American producer had canceled a two-day play about life in a
Soviet village.
   Producer Ken Marsolais, who said he was unable to raise the
necessary $450,000, said he hoped to have the Soviets perform at an
off-Broadway location.

   A leader of Iraq's Kurdish minority said
Friday he met with U.S. officials and lawmakers to seek their
support for preventing a massacre of his people by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   ``The government of Iraq has resolved to rid itself of what it
has termed the Kurdish problem by eliminating the Kurdish people,''
said Jalal Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
   The program to eliminate the estimated 4 million Iraqi Kurds
began in 1963 and is in its final phase, he told reporters.
   Talabani, whose group is one of the two main political
organizations in the northern autonomous region of Kurdistan, said
that over the past three years Hussein's government had destroyed
some 1,300 Kurdish towns and villages, poisoned water sources and
deported some 1.5 million inhabitants to remote desert areas.
   In one attack against the Kurds, Iraq dropped cyanide and
mustard gas last March on the town of Halabja, killing some 5,000
people, he said. The United States has condemned the Iraqi attack.
   Talabani said State Department officials have promised to press
Iraq to desist from human rights abuses against the Kurds.
   Talabani said his group is mostly self-supporting, although it
receives weapons and humanitarian help from Iran. ``We're not a
tool of Iran, but we have a common enemy,'' he said.
   There are an estimated 15 million to 20 million Kurds in the
world, the largest group in Turkey and the rest in Iraq, Iran,
Syria, Lebanon and the Soviet Union.
   Talabani said the Iraqi Kurds, who have pooled resources against
Hussein, were trying to improve relations with the Soviet Union,
which is Iraq's main military supplier. ``Maybe the spirit of
glasnost will help us too,'' he said.

   Herman Crook, a harmonica player who was
the oldest member of the Grand Ole Opry, died Friday, a hospital
spokeswoman said. He was 89.
   Crook died of respiratory failure after entering Parkl View
Medical Center on Monday night while suffering from a heart attack,
said hospital spokeswoman Fran Rajotte.
   Crook was the last remaining charter member of the Grand Ole
Opry, founded in 1925. He returned to the Opry last weekend after a
nine-week absence because of health problems.
   ``He loved country music but he wanted it country,'' said Opry
star Roy Acuff, who at 84 now is the oldest Opry member. ``He
didn't go for any of this rock 'n' roll type stuff.''
   ``Mr. Crook played the lonesome, original sound of the Grand Ole
Opry,'' said Opry star Minnie Pearl, 75.
   Jerry Strobel, an Opry spokesman, saw Crook's final performance
Saturday night. ``Herman was pretty weak. Since he went into the
hospital, he had lost a lot of weight. I thought all in all he did
a very fine job. He gathered a little more strength once he hit the
spotlight,'' he said.
   Although Crook was a harmonica player, Acuff said he like to
sing and did so occasionally on the show. ``His favorite number was
Amazing Grace.''
   Crook, orphaned early in life, was reared in Nashville by
brothers and sisters, from whom he learned songs.
   In 1926, Crook led a country music string band on the Saturday
Night Barn Dance and went on the Opry in 1927. The band is the only
act left that represents the original tradition of the Opry. The
band plays for cloggers, who perform traditional mountain dancing.
   ``Back in the early days _ before the Opry was actually started
_ we used to get two or three together and go around to different
houses to play for folks. We didn't charge anything. It was just
for fun,'' Crook said in an interview.
   ``We had gathered at a certain home one Sunday afternoon, and
the people told us about this young lady down the street who played
the piano. I suggested they invite her to join the playing,'' Crook
said.
   The woman, Helen Lee Adams, became his wife.
   Crook was among the Opry musicians who participated in
Nashville's first recording sessions in 1928. By the 1960s, the
Opry had become a modern, highly professional program, and the
traditional sound of Crook's group, called the Crook Brothers Band,
became a less prominent part of the show.
   ``I've never taken a drink of whiskey, smoked a cigarette or
spoken a curse word in my life. I never did take those habits up,
and I'm glad I didn't,'' Crook said.
   Services are scheduled Monday at Hermitage Funeral Home. Opry
member Roy Drusky will sing two songs, backed by the Carollee
Singers. Jerry Whitehurst will play the piano.
   Survivors include his wife; five sons, two daughters, 19
grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Pakistan Violating Afghan Accord, Blames U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Friday accused Pakistan of violating the accord on
the Afghan war by continuing to give arms to the rebels, and he
said the United States is partly to blame.
   At a news conference, he repeated a Soviet Foreign Ministry
statement that if violations continue, the Soviet Union may be
obliged to review the nine-month schedule for troop withdrawal
stipulated in the accord.
   The United States and Soviet Union are guarantors of the
Afghanistan agreement signed by Afghanistan and Pakistan on April
14 in Geneva.
   In another development, the United Nations on Friday called on
the world community to donate more than $1 billion over 18 months
to help the people of Afghanistan resettle their war-shattered
nation.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed not to interfere in each other's
internal affairs under terms of the Geneva accord, and many
observers say Pakistan's training and arming of Afghan guerrillas
is a clear violation. The United States also supports and has
supplied arms to the rebels and is Pakistan's major arms supplier.
   In his statement at the Soviet Mission on Friday, Shevardnadze
said in answer to a question: ``When we criticize Pakistan for
non-compliance, for non-observance of its obligations under the
Geneva agreement, we also, of course, have in mind the United
States.''
   ``If Pakistan is violating the Geneva accords, of course, the
United States, too, bears a portion of the responsibility,'' he
said.
   He said that if violations by Pakistan continue, ``then we may
have to review the schedule of withdrawal of Soviet troops, and we
believe this would be quite legal.'' The minister added, ``But that
would be an extreme measure and not something we would want to do.''
   Diplomats said that Shevardnadze's statement was his first
criticism of the United States by name for aiding Afghan rebels.
   In a speech to the General Assembly on disarmament Wednesday,
Shevardnadze also indirectly criticized the United States on the
Afghanistan issue and said U.S. actions could harm the possible
settlement of other regional issues.
   Under the Afghan accord, the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw
more than 110,000 troops over nine months, beginning May 15. About
a third are to be withdrawn in the first three months.
   Afghan leader Najib said this week that 34,000 Soviet troops
have left, while Soviet officials said 15,000 had been withdrawn.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the coordinator of the United
Nation's humanitarian and economic assistance program for
Afghanistan, said a $1.2 billion relief program is needed to see
the Afghan people through two crop cycles.
   The nearly decade-long war between the communist government in
Kabul and the Moslem rebels has crippled agricultural production in
Afghanistan.
   ``Now the United Nations must drive a wedge which can shore up
stability and trigger a return to normalcy in the country,'' said
Sadruddin.
   The $1.2 billion amount ``is not the total needs of Afghanistan,
but what we, after a very careful estimate, what we feel can be
absorbed,'' he said.
   Sadruddin later explained that by absorption, he meant that
warfare in some areas might hinder distribution; that the primitive
road network in the mountainous nation slows delivery of supplies;
and that he did not want grain supplies to rot in stockpiles.
   No specific pledges were announced Friday. Sadruddin said there
would be a donor coordinating meeting Tuesday at the United
Nations, at which he hoped that some initial pledges could be
announced.

   A judge dismissed charges against two
men who exchanged heated words with a delivery person for waking
them with a pizza they had ordered two hours earlier.
   ``Thank you, your honor,'' the men said in unison before leaving
court Wednesday.
   Stephen Reid and Robert Ham had been in Worcester from North
Carolina on a training program with Piedmont Airlines when they
called a pizzeria late on the night of May 28, Assistant District
Attorney Neil G. Snider said.
   They were asleep, however, when the pizza arrived two hours
later and they declined the goods.
   ``The delivery person threw the pizza at them, saying they would
have to pay for it,'' Snider said.
   A shouting match ensued, and police were called. Reid and Ham
were arrested, charged with disturbing the peace and defrauding a
common victualer.
   Snider told Judge William F. Scannell the state was ready to
dismiss the charges if the defendants agreed to pay a $50 fine.
   The judge agreed to dismiss the case on condition that the men
not have to pay the $50 fine, to which the prosecutor agreed.

   President Corazon Aquino signed a
land reform bill into law Friday and said she hoped the measure
will enable the country to feed itself and lift Filipino peasants
from poverty.
   Mrs. Aquino, in a nationally televised speech, congratulated
Congress for passing the bill after nearly a year of debate. The
bill, approved Wednesday, is considered essential in defeating the
19-year communist insurgency.
   The military announced the arrests of a West German, a Swede and
a Filipino of German descent accused of helping communist rebels.
   Seven soldiers and 10 insurgents were reported killed in
fighting west of the capital.
   Also on Friday, workers exhumed 12 bodies from a mass grave at a
suburban cemetery. Human rights organizations said the grave may
contain victims of right-wing death squads.
   The land reform act, which officials say will benefit 3 million
landless farmers, gives landowners the choice of dividing their
property among tenants or sharing profits with them.
   Mrs. Aquino said she hoped the 10-year program will increase
agricultural production and lead to the ``upliftment of the
Filipino masses from their ancient poverty.''
   She said she expects all Cabinet members to support land reform
and threatened to fire officials who impede its implementation.
   Under the plan, each landowner may retain 12 acres and an
additional seven acres for each direct heir over the age 15 who
will till the land. A landowner has the option of sharing profits
or giving workers shares of stock instead of physically dividing
the property.
   Leftist farm groups have branded the plan a ``grand deception''
because they claim it does not go far enough in breaking up huge
estates and redistributing property to the landless.
   Mrs. Aquino had been criticized for the pace of land reform. The
Philippines attempted about a dozen land reform programs in the
past, but they failed for lack of funds or resistance from
landowners.
   Land reform was among the demands of pro-Soviet rebels in the
1950s and early 1960s and is a major demand of communist rebels in
the insurgency that began in 1968.
   Officials say the program, estimated to cost $70 billion, will
be financed by foreign aid and assets of former President Ferdinand
Marcos and his associates. Those assets were seized on grounds they
were acquired illegally.
   The military announced that troops arrested the Rev. Klaus
Schmidt, 52, a West German Protestant minister; Stellan Hermansson,
30, a Swede; and Antonio Bosch, 46, a Filipino of German descent
for possible links with communist rebels.
   The West German and Swedish embassies said they were unaware of
the reports.
   In Stockholm, officials of the Young Communist League said
Hermansson was the organization's president. Spokesman Erik
Cardfelt said Hermansson was a free-land journalist and arrived May
18 to gather information for lectures.
   Col. Hernani Figueroa, spokesman of the military's Southern
Luzon Command, said the three were arrested Wednesday in Quezon
province. He said they had been reported training rebels.
   Figueroa said soldiers identified the three as among guerrillas
who raided the town of San Francisco in February.
   Figueroa said they were being held in Lucena City, 60 miles
southeast of Manila.
   In suburban Makati, workers exhumed 12 bodies from a mass grave.
The church-backed Ecumenical Movement for Justice and Peace said
the grave contained at least 22 bodies buried in April at the South
Cemetery.
   Movement officials obtained a court order authorizing the
exhumation to determine if some of those buried were missing
members of the left-wing Youth for Democracy and Nationalism.
   In Bataan province, communist rebels stormed an army post
Wednesday, killing seven troops and wounding two others, military
officials said. They said two rebels were killed.
   The government's news agency said Friday that eight more rebels
were killed in Orani town in the Bataan peninsula, 30 miles west of
the capital.

   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim
Burnley called Friday for drug tests for up to 5 million drivers of
interstate trucks, passenger buses and vehicles carrying hazardous
materials.
   ``We must act to identify those commercial drivers who abuse
drugs and get them off the roads. When one drugged truck or bus
driver goes out on the road, he not only puts the lives of many
people in danger, he gives the entire work force a bad
reputation,'' Burnley said.
   His announcement at a news conference here follows similar
proposals unveiled in March for the aviation industry and in May
for railroads.
   There are no firm statistics to indicate how many truck drivers
are drug abusers, Burnley said. But he cited a June 1987 test of
317 tractor-trailer drivers in Tennessee that showed 15 percent of
the drivers tested positive for marijuana, cocaine or prescription
stimulants.
   He also noted a survey of 1,300 truck drivers in Florida in
which 36 percent said they sometimes drove under the influence of
drugs.
   ``When society has a drug problem, no segment of our population,
from welfare recipients to Wall Street brokers, is exempt from it.
The trucking industry is clearly vulnerable as well,'' Burnley said.
   ``Operating these large, heavy vehicles requires that a driver
be fully alert and in complete control of his mental faculties,''
he added.
   The proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million people who
drive commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds,
vehicles that transport 16 or more people or vehicles that
transport hazardous materials. School bus drivers and city bus
drivers would not be affected by the proposal, he said.
   The Department of Transportation is proposing five types of drug
testing: pre-employment, random, post-accident, as part of a
physical, and for reasonable cause when a trucker is suspected of
using narcotics.
   Burnley did not suggest a budget or method of payment for the
drug testing plan.
   In Washington, the American Trucking Associations endorsed the
effort but expressed concerns about how the tests would be
implemented.
   Lana Batts, a legislative specialist at the trade organization,
said there is concern the tests would focus on drivers for large
companies and not reach many of the estimated 400,000
owner-operator drivers and those driving for small companies.
   The Transportation Department has suggested small companies or
independent operators might join together to develop a testing
program.
   Batts said the trucking companies favor legislation calling for
roadside drug tests for truckers to be established as a pilot
program in four states. That legislation has passed the Senate, but
has yet to be considered in the House.
   Burnley said he would ask for help from the industry and the
public in seeking effective ways to reach independent truckers.
   The program calls for those whose positive drug tests are
confirmed in follow-ups to be barred from driving in interstate
commerce. Depending on circumstances, the employee could be
reinstated upon successful completion of a rehabilitation program.
   The program does not cover alcohol abuse because states already
have strict laws governing drunken drivers, he said. Burnley added
that studies have shown truck drivers use less alcohol but more
stimulants than the public.

   A new state law banning obscene materials
and performances in Wisconsin should withstand expected legal
challenges, state officials say.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed the bill Thursday, as about 100
people applauded.
   ``This isn't the end of our fight against pornography. ... This
is only the beginning of our battle,'' Marlene McMullin of Omro
said.
   ``This (bill) is good public policy,'' Thompson said. ``I want
to publicly thank all of those who made this possible. This day has
been a long time coming.''
   The measure bans materials and performances fitting a three-part
definition of obscenity. It takes effect the day after it is
published, probably next week, officials said.
   Court challenges are expected, said Rep. Robert Welch, a
proponent.
   ``We are comfortable with the law. We think it's constitutional.
We think it will pass a court test,'' said Deputy Attorney General
Mark Musolf.
   In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled a previous law unconstitutional
on grounds it was vague and too broad. The new law adopts a
three-part obscenity test put forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in a
California case. It also exempts libraries and contract printers.
   Critics of the bill, including the Wisconsin chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, fought its enactment, contending it
could lead to censorship.
   ``We're not going after Playboy (magazine) or Mark Twain,''
Welch said. ``We're only going after hard-core smut.''
   He said the bill's target will be publications, films or
performances which ``offer blatant depictions of sexual (acts).''
   Under the law, a performance or work would be considered obscene
if the average person, applying contemporary community standards,
would find it appeals to the prurient interest if taken as a whole;
under contemporary community standards, it describes or shows
sexual conduct in a patently offensive way; and tt lacks serious
literary, artistic, political, educational or scientific value, if
taken as a whole.
   First and second offenses would be civil matters. A third
offense could be punished by a $10,000 fine and imprisonment up to
five years.

<TEXT>
   Several congressmen on Friday defended $2,000
payments they received for attending a breakfast briefing just
before voting to extend a huge contract for the truck manufacturer
that fed and paid them.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, said the payments by Oshkosh Truck
Co. of Oshkosh, Wis., were proper and not meant to influence the
vote, although he said he would not mind if the congressional
honorarium system were abandoned.
   Leath and aides to other members of the House Armed Services
procurement subcommittee who attended the April 1, 1987, breakfast
meeting said the timing of the meeting and the vote was
coincidental.
   The voice vote extending the government's currently $239 million
annual contract with Oshkosh for five years was nearly unanimous,
Leath said. The contract calls for multimillion-dollar penalties to
be paid to the company if the government terminates the contract.
   Congress later approved the subcommittee action despite Army
proposals to stop buying the $130,000 Oshkosh trucks in favor of
developing a sophisticated new model.
   Leath said he resented what he called inferences of impropriety
in a Dallas Morning News article that reported on the honoraria
Friday.
   ``The fact is, the House rules permit honorariums _ they are
legal. To intimate that they are illegal or immoral and are given
to buy support is neither factual nor accurate,'' said Leath.
   The payments were acknowledged by the company and detailed in
required financial disclosure forms filed last month by Leath and
Reps. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky.; Roy Dyson, D-Md.; Norman Sisisky,
D-Va.; Robert Bedham, D-Calif., and Bill Dickinson, R-Ala. .
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who was listed by the Dallas newspaper
as also attending the meeting, said he was holding a prayer
breakfast at the time. But he reported a $2,000 honorarium from
Oshkosh for participating in a luncheon meeting on April 28, 1987,
``long after any decisions were made'' on buying the company's
trucks, he said.
   Skelton said he saw nothing improper in accepting the money for
attending the later luncheon. He did not recall details of the
meeting but said it was likely that the company's truck sales were
discussed.
   All the congressmen who accepted the payments except Dickinson _
the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee _ are
members of the 19-member procurement subcommittee that hours after
the breakfast approved extension of contracts to buy thousands of
Oshkosh trucks over five years.
   ``It looks kind of funny, doesn't it?'' said Oshkosh Vice
President V.P. ``Pres'' Grove, quoted in the Morning News.
   Grove said the honoraria were not designed to preserve Oshkosh's
10-ton truck program and are just ``sort of the way business is
done'' in Washington.
   Leath said he saw nothing wrong with taking honoraria and
confirmed a quote attributed to him by the Morning News:
   ``I guarantee you, if they call me again and say, `Would you
like to come up here and get an honorarium?' I'll do it. You can
take that to the bank.''
   He said he would not object if the honorarium system were
discontinued, but said he does not think it is abused.
   Hopkins said he was not compromised by the honorarium.
   ``Any implication of that is an insult to me personally and to
my integrity,'' he said.
   Hopkins said the issue was whether to scrap a workable program
or to ``let the Pentagon march off in search of a whole new family
of expensive trucks.''
   Sisisky's press secretary, Evelyn Frazier, said the Virginia
lawmaker voted against the procurement. She said he was ``not fully
aware'' of the honorarium when he accepted the invitation to
attend, but he regularly donates his entire congressional salary
and honoraria to charity.
   Dyson's press aide, Katie Tucker, said he did attend the
breakfast but does not recall the vote. She said Dyson has a policy
of not accepting honoraria from companies unless he is on record
supporting their position. She said he accepted the Oshkosh payment
and has supported contracts for the company since 1981.
   Bedham confirmed through an aide that he voted for the measure.
   Dickinson aide Mike Lewis said the congressman attended the
breakfast and received the $2,000, but he denied a Morning News
report that Dickinson played a key role later in negotiating a
compromise with the Senate that required the Army to buy even more
Oshkosh trucks.
   ``In fact, he still doesn't understand why we have to buy more
trucks than the Army asked for,'' Lewis said.

   High school officials who
protested greeting cards linking drinking and graduation are irate
and embarrassed over a similar display in their school's yearbook.
   The full-page photo spread in Edison High School's yearbook, the
Oracle, shows students with beer bottles and wine coolers. It
appeared less than a week after Edison administrators joined in a
protest of the Hallmark cards, which the company later said it
would discontinue.
   ``I'm very concerned and disappointed,'' Principal Jack Kennedy
said Thursday. ``If there was a way I could recall it, I would. But
I can't.
   ``It depicts everything we're against,'' he said.
   Edison officials became involved in the protest after a parent
discovered two cards linking drinking to graduation fun. The
parent, who is on a committee planning a graduation party next week
at Edison, took the cards to Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.
   Kennedy is retiring July 1 and will be replaced by Brian
Garland, who also joined members of MADD in the June 3 protest
outside Hallmark's regional sales office in Newport Beach.
   Garland said Thursday that the photo page in the yearbook showed
``poor judgment'' and gives the school a bad image.
   ``It won't happen again,'' Garland said, ``I won't tolerate it.
You can bet the farm.''
   Students paid for the page, near the back of the annual, school
officials said.
   Jim Wheeler, a 19-year yearbook adviser, said he was unsure
``where to draw the line'' but added the yearbook staff had voted
to refrain from such features next year.

   The Reagan administration asked Congress on
Friday to get tough on coal wildcatters by making it a felony to
strip mine coal without a permit.
   Legislation sent to Capitol Hill by the Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement calls for a maximum prison term of five
years for people convicted of mining without a permit.
   The proposal also would allow a judge to impose a fine of up to
$250,000 against a convicted individual and a fine of up to
$500,000 against a convicted organization.
   Strip mining without a permit is now a civil offense with a top
penalty of $22,500, but office spokesman Alan Cole said that ``the
civil procedures are so ponderous, it's difficult to keep up with
the wildcatters.''
   In a prepared statement, Robert Gentile, acting director of the
office, said that ``what the wildcatters are doing is not only
illegal, it is an insult to law-abiding citizens and the legitimate
coal industry.
   ``The wildcatter's blatant disregard for our system means the
time has come to go after them with a vengeance,'' he said.

   The mother of a black teen-ager allegedly
abducted and raped by whites was driven on Friday from the Queens
church where she had holed up for two days to a church in Brooklyn,
the pastor of the church said.
   Glenda Brawley sought ``religious asylum'' in Ebenezer Baptist
Church in Queens on Wednesday, defying a court order to testify
before a grand jury investigating her daughter's case. She faces 30
days in jail and a $250 fine.
   On Friday afternoon, Mrs. Brawley, accompanied by some
supporters, drove off with her adviser, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and
lawyer C. Vernon Mason. They did not comment to reporters.
   Sharpton challenged police to arrest Mrs. Brawley along the 10
miles separating the two churches.
   Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert
Abrams, said police would arrest Mrs. Brawley only at the request
of Abrams, who is responsible for the Brawley investigation.
   ``We have no intentions of swooping in to participate in the
media circus that the Rev. Sharpton and attorneys (Alton) Maddox
and Mason are intending to orchestrate,'' said Gilles. ``For the
time being, we have no intention of moving in.''
   William Augustus Jones, minister of Bethany Baptist Church in
Brooklyn, said Mrs. Brawley was taken to his church, where rallies
for the Brawley family have been held for the last two months.
   Sharpton would not say why Mrs. Brawley was being moved.
   The Brawley family's lawyers have contended that law enforcement
authorities have engaged in a racist cover-up and have advised Mrs.
Brawley not to cooperate with the grand jury investigation.
   Tawana Brawley disappeared for four days in November and was
found wrapped in a plastic bag about 10 miles from her home, with
racial epithets scrawled on her. In sketchy interviews with
officials, she said she had been sexually abused by six white men,
one of whom had a police-style badge. A hospital examination found
no evidence of rape.

<HEAD>Aides Say Reagan Will Veto Welfare Reform Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will veto plans to overhaul
the nation's welfare system now working their way through Congress,
White House aides said Friday.
   The aides said Reagan, atfer meeting with a group of welfare
leaders, declared his intention to veto both a bill passed by the
House and another set for debate in the Senate next week.
   ``I think the president's likely to veto either bill, or both of
them in their present form,'' said Charles Hobbs, director of the
White House Office of Policy Development.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan told
the meeting he will veto any ``welfare expansion of the type now
under consideration in Congress.''
   Fitzwater said the legislation under consideration ``would spend
billions of dollars to expand the welfare system but without the
reforms that we think are necessary.''
   ``We are especially concerned that the current bill does not
require recipients of welfare to actually work if they are able to
do so,'' he said.
   Reagan also wants a bill that promises waivers of federal red
tape for states and municipalities wishing to try thier own welfare
reforms, Fitzwater said.
   Hobbs characterized the bill before the Senate as an ``expansion
of the welfare balloon that simply doesn't do anybody any good.''
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., has 62
co-sponsors.
   Despite the veto threat, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean said he
believes a welfare-reform bill can be passed and signed by the
president this year. Kean attended the meeting with the president.
   ``We're close ... very, very close,'' Kean said.
   The governor said he believes differences between Reagan and
Congress can be addressed when House and Senate conferees meet to
reconcile versions of the bill.
   Kean said Reagan will insist that a final version contain the
work requirement and the federal waivers. Otherwise, the White
House appears openminded, he said.
   Reagan met with Kean and other delegates to a two-day conference
on the future of welfare reform. Also at the session was Mayor
William Morris of Memphis, Tenn., and several administrators of
promising self-help programs.
   Fitzwater said the group discussed Reagan's welfare-reform
strategy, unveiled in February 1987, calling for pilot projects
designed to get people off welfare rolls by making them
self-supporting.
   Congress has not acted on Reagan's proposal, but the president
has asked his welfare advisory board to work with federal agencies
and state and local governments to launch demonstration projects in
at least half of the states by the end of the year.
   The board has endorsed projects in New Jersey, Wisconsin, Ohio,
Washington and New York and projects in five other states are under
active consideration, Fitzwater said.

   A panic-stricken 8-year-old girl
concocted a story about two intruders after she accidentally killed
her sister while playing with a gun, police said.
   The girl initially told police two men broke into a mobile home
the family used as storage and shot her 10-year-old sister when the
sister tried to call police, authorities said.
   Police launched a search Thursday for the intruders.
   Four hours later, the 8-year-old confessed she had found the
.22-caliber revolver, and was playing with it when it discharged,
Police Chief Richard Ausenbaugh said Thursday.
   The girl made up the story in panic and hid the weapon in the
mobile home, he said.
   ``It's just an unfortunate, very, very tragic thing,''
Ausenbaugh said. ``She's just going to have to live with it for the
rest of her life.''
   He said no charges would be filed.

<HEAD>White House Says Iran Possibly Could Launch Pre-Election
`Surprise'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 1 graf with Bush comment</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Friday that Iran may try
to exploit the presidential race in the United States with some
kind of surprise before the November election.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the comment in
response to a published report that said a National Security
Council staff memo had warned that Iran may try to use the nine
American hostages in Lebanon as political pawns.
   Fitzwater said he wouldn't confirm or deny the memo, but added,
``I think it's safe to assume in a kind of common-sense way that
Iran is not above exploiting the elections in our country by some
means.''
   The report, in The Wall Street Journal, said the NSC memo
suggested Iran might offer to release some hostages before the
elections if Vice President George Bush would soften the United
State's anti-Iran stance.
   The story said an Iranian official had tried to arrange a
clandestine meeting with a Bush aide, who was warned off the
meeting by colleagues.
   Fitzwater said he was not aware of any overture to Bush.
   Bush, during a campaign stop in Denver on Friday, said, ``No, I
don't know anything about it _ nothing.''

<HEAD>Montazeri Meets Leaders, Khomeini Reported Ailing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's health
again is reported to be deteriorating and the 87-year-old
patriarch's chosen successor has met with two senior Iranian
leaders in the past two days.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported from Tehran
that Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's hand-picked heir
apparent, held separate meetings Wednesday and Thursday with the
parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, and with President Ali
Khamenei.
   It said both men traveled to the holy city of Qom, 100 miles
south of Tehran, for the meetings with Montazeri.
   They discussed ``various current issues,'' the agency said, but
it did not elaborate or indicate the meetings were linked to
Khomeini's health.
   Khomeini has been reported in frail condition since a heart
attack two years ago, and there have been reports he has cancer.
Rumors that he was dead or dying have circulated frequently.
   He has appeared fragile and slow-moving, his speech slow, in the
few recent public appearances broadcast by Iranian government
television. Khomeini rarely leaves his home in Qom and was last
seen in public a month ago.
   The CBS television network said Thursday night that intelligence
reports indicated he ``may now be very close to death.'' It quoted
them as saying ``the ayatollah's cancer has spread from his
prostate to his liver'' and he ``may only have two or three months
to live.''
   Rafsanjani, one of Khomeini's closest aides, has strengthened
his political power in the past week at President Khamenei's
expense. They are rivals in a power struggle within the hierarchy
to determine who will run the country when Khomeini dies.
   Speculation that the revolutionary leader's condition was
deteriorating increased when he named Rafsanjani, 53, acting
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces June 2. Khomeini had held
the title.
   His decision clearly was linked to recent military setbacks in
the 8-year-old war with Iraq and the need to reorganize the armed
forces.
   Tehran radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying June 3 it was no longer
possible for Khomeini ``to personally run the administrative
affairs'' of the military. He did not elaborate, but said: ``We
should not have such expectations of His Holiness.''
   Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking cleric, has long been considered
the second most powerful figure in Iran. His appointment as
military chief and re-election June 7 as speaker of the parliament
were seen as a consolidation of his political power.
   He also is Khomeini's representative on the Supreme Defense
Council, which determines war strategy, has close links with the
fanatical Revolutionary Guards and is on several other key
committees.
   Khomeini's edict naming Rafsanjani military commander said he
acted at the urging of Khamanei, chairman of the Supreme Defense
Council, but Western analysts saw his use of Khamenei's name as an
attempt to avoid publicly humiliating the president.
   Although Khomeini clearly indicated in 1985 that Montazeri, 65,
would succeed him, he drew up a new political testament Dec. 10.
Tehran radio said it contained ``some changes'' from an earlier
document Khomeini had made that is to be opened after his death.
   The most common speculation is that he wants power held by a
council of three to five men to avoid political strife that could
undermine the revolution.
   Montazeri clearly was angry when Rafsanjani became military
chief and demanded that he relinquish the post as speaker of
parliament. Rafsanjani made two fellow radicals deputy speakers so
they could run Parliament while he concentrated on military
reorganization.
   Several Iranian leaders have opposed Montazeri's selection as
successor to Khomeini.
   He has the required religious status but lacks the patriarch's
presence and authority, and his power base has been eroded by
Rafsanjani's maneuvering.
   That combined with Khomeini's support for Rafsanjani has led
analysts to believe Montazeri will be little more than a
figurehead, with real power in the hands of Rafsanjani and other
politicians.

<TEXT>
   A weeklong barrage of publicity failed to
turn up the identity of a deaf boy found wandering in Mexico, and
authorities decided Friday to cancel an outing to shield the
youngster from overattention.
   The 7- or 8-year-old boy, who authorities believe could be an
American survivor of a plane crash that killed his family, had been
scheduled to view some airplanes at El Paso International Airport
so officials could see whether he recognized any.
   Child welfare workers in Mexico postponed the trip indefinitely,
saying the boy was being spoiled by reporters following him around.
   ``Because of too much attention he's been receiving, he's
starting to be a little tiresome,'' said Joel Bustamante, judicial
director of the System of the Integrated Family, the agency caring
for the child in Ciudad Juarez, just across the Mexican border from
El Paso.
   ``He's not acting like himself,'' said Pat Ayala, spokeswoman
for the Texas Department of Human Services, which is working with
Mexican authorities to find the boy's relatives.
   Sabat, as the freckled, brown-haired boy has been named by his
Mexican guardians, has been photographed, stared at and entreated
to draw pictures by reporters from England, France, Mexico and all
over the United States.
   On Thursday alone, reporters from two Oklahoma City TV stations
visited Sabat, in addition to a reporter from People magazine and
two journalists from London, Ms. Ayala said. The day before,
reporters from the National Enquirer took a look at the tyke.
   ``The other kids feel left out,'' Ms. Ayala said.
   Sabat's story is compelling because so little of it is known. He
has impaired hearing and communicates mostly by drawing pictures
and gesturing. His pictures seem to indicate that he survived the
crash of a four-seat, single-engine airplane that killed his
parents and sister.
   He was found wandering near downtown Juarez last November, with
scars that look about 2 years old and could come from home-treated
injuries.
   After Mexican authorities noticed Sabat preferred hamburgers and
hot dogs over Mexican fare and responded more enthusiastically
toward American cartoon characters, they contacted their Texas
counterparts.
   The FBI and Human Services have fielded hundreds of phone calls
from people offering tips and asking whether they can adopt Sabat.
Potential adopters have been told they face long odds.
   ``Unless we're able to make a positive identification as a U.S.
citizen or even a legal resident, he remains in Mexican custody,''
Ms. Ayala said.
   The Center for Missing and Exploited Children has supplied the
FBI's El Paso office with information on approximately 20 young
boys who roughly fit Sabat's description. Footprints from a missing
Illinois boy who looked like Sabat didn't match, and no firm leads
have turned up, officials said.
   There is some conjecture that Sabat is from Oklahoma because he
recognizes the outline of that saucepan-shaped state, said Juan
Ramon Hernandez, director general of the family agency in Juarez.
He also becomes excited and points at himself when he sees a U.S.
flag, Hernandez said.
   When shown an Oklahoma map, Sabat points vaguely to the
northwest corner of the state, Ms. Ayala said, adding, ``It's hard
to tell if he recognizes that part of the state or whether he was
just playing with his finger.''

   City and transit police announced Friday they
will increase patrols of the city's 3,200 subway token booths
following three more threats to set fire to booths with clerks
inside.
   The three threats occurred late Thursday night and early Friday
morning, officials said, only a week after an attack on a booth in
Brooklyn fatally burned a clerk.
   ``Obviously we are extremely upset at what's been going on,''
Transit Authority President David Gunn told a news conference.
   Although fewer than 10 of the 70 attempted booth robberies this
year involved the threat or actual use of a flammable liquid, Gunn
said the TA's aim is to eliminate the possibility of another fatal
attack.
   Beginning Friday night, the TA police department will assign 50
plainclothes and uniformed officers to token booth protection,
according to Vincent Del Castillo, acting chief of the TA Police
Department.
   City police also will increase their patrols of subway booths,
according to David Scott, chief of patrol for the New York Police
Department.

<HEAD>NATO Ministers Call For Soviet Human Rights Improvements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the NATO alliance said
Friday they want Soviet advances in human rights before talks begin
on reducing conventional forces in Europe.
   The 16 foreign ministers, ending the spring meeting of the North
Atlantic Council, also said the alliance should not relax its
defense effort despite the improvement in East-West relations.
   A concluding statement said the conference concentrated on:
   _Discussion of the changing political climate in Eastern Europe.
   _The need for ``significant progress on human rights and human
contacts'' at the current Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe in Vienna, a follow-up to the 1975 Helsinki agreements.
   _Commitments to share equitably the ``risks, burdens and
responsibilities, as well as the benefits,'' of the common defense.
   Spokesmen for several delegations said ministers stressed the
need to get a final statement from the 35-nation Vienna meeting
that includes a strong position on human rights.
   The meeting is one of several held to evaluate compliance with
the Helsinki accords, which were signed by the United States,
Canada and all European countries except Albania.
   Negotiations dealing only with troop reductions in Central
Europe have limped along for 15 years without result. Planned
negotiations between NATO and the seven-nation Communist bloc are
more ambitious, seeking to reduce tensions from the Atlantic to the
Ural Mountains.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged the European allies
not to be lulled by conciliatory gestures from Moscow.
   He acknowledged the European NATO members may have difficulty
convincing their parliaments to maintain or raise defense spending
because of domestic political considerations, but added:
   ``I am not satisified that anyone is pulling their weight
satisfactorily.''
   Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary-general, said there was
``general agreement'' among the ministers to ``keep up our arms
expenditures.''
   Carrington, who will retire at the end of June, added at a
closing news conference there is ``a certain feeling in Europe that
the United States does not fully understand what Europe is doing''
for NATO defense.
   The declaration did not include a specific promise Western
Europe and Canada will contribute more to defense costs. The United
States now pays about 70 percent.
   NATO foreign ministers also welcomed the results of the May
29-June 2 summit in Moscow between President Reagan and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, ``both for their substance and as a portent for the
future development of East-West relations.''
   ``We welcome the unprecedented prominence accorded to human
rights in the joint statement of the summit and hope that a more
forthcoming Soviet attitude will also be reflected'' in the
concluding document of the Vienna conference.

<HEAD>Judge Nixon Portrayed as Innocent Victim of Overzealous
Prosecutors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers asked the House on Friday to
drop impeachment proceedings against imprisoned U.S. District Judge
Walter L. Nixon Jr., whom they portrayed as the innocent victim of
``big prize fever'' gripping overzealous federal prosecutors.
   ``He has committed no crime and has engaged in no impeachable
offense,'' attorney David Stewart told a House Judiciary
subcommittee before it concluded less than two days of impeachment
hearings against the Mississippi judge.
   Nixon, 59, is serving a five-year prison sentence at Eglin Air
Force Base in Florida for lying to a federal grand jury about his
discussions concerning drug charges against the son of a wealthy
investor with whom Nixon had business dealings.
   Nixon, a federal judge since 1968, continues to draw his $89,500
annual salary while in prison. He refused to testify at the
impeachment proceeding Friday on the ground that he had
insufficient time to prepare for questioning.
   Former federal prosecutor Reid Weingarten testified that Nixon
entered into a ``sweetheart deal'' with Mississippi investor Wiley
Fairchild that led to the judge's perjury conviction in February
1986.
   Nixon bought oil and gas rights in three wells from Fairchild
for $9,500 in 1980 and subsequently made a reported $55,000 from
the deal. Nixon testified at his trial that the transaction was
legitimate and that he promised no favors to Fairchild in return.
   Nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity from
Fairchild, but was convicted on two counts of lying to a grand jury
when he denied discussing drug smuggling charges against Drew
Fairchild with the elder Fairchild and with former state district
attorney Paul Holmes.
   The oil well transaction ``was obviously a freebie ... a
sweetheart deal,'' Weingarten said. He quoted Nixon as telling
Fairchild that ``if I can help you I will, and if I can't, I'll
tell you.''
   But Nixon insists that he never spoke to anyone about the drug
case, and says the questions posed when he testified before the
grand jury were ambiguous. Stewart, his attorney, charged Friday
that Nixon ``has been unfairly convicted.''
   Stewart told the House panel that in the early 1980s ``there was
a fever abroad in the public integrity section of the Justice
Department ... to convict a federal judge. You might even call it
big prize fever.''
   He said federal prosecutors embarked on a corruption
investigation based on ``a lot of wild accusations'' by a
government informant that were never corroborated.
   ``For reasons we do not fully understand to this day, Judge
Nixon did become the target of the public integrity section. He
became the big prize,'' Stewart said. ``... The biggest victim of
this fever has been Walter Nixon.''
   Stewart conceded that ``the circumstances are soewhat grim for
Judge Nixon'' because of his perjury conviction and the Supreme
Court's denial of his final appeal.
   Nixon's allegation that he was the innocent target of vindictive
prosecutors is the same defense that another imprisoned federal
judge, Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada, used without success during
his Senate impeachment trial in October 1986.
   Claiborne, who refused to resign even though he was convicted of
tax evasion, was convicted of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' by
the Senate and was removed from office after the first impeachment
trial in half a century.
   The only other federal judge to be indicted while in office is
Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, who was acquitted in 1983 of bribery
conspiracy.
   A separate House Judiciary subcommittee completed three weeks of
hearings Thursday on subsequent charges that Hastings actually
committed the crime and tried to conceal his involvement by lying
under oath and manufacturing evidence at his trial.
   Nixon has been chief federal judge for the southern district of
Mississippi, based in Biloxi, since 1982.

became chief of bureau in Oklahoma City from 1944-46.
   Anderson continued to work in Oklahoma City until his retirement

   Stanley M. Swinton, assistant general manager of the AP at the
time of Anderson's retirement, said in 1968 of Anderson's work in
Oklahoma City that ``much of the bureau's success in that period
had been the result'' of his efforts.
   Memorial services for Anderson are scheduled for Saturday at
First Presbyterian Church in Oklahoma City.

   Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.
appealed to Democratic platform writers Friday to draft a document
that addresses concerns of working families, not a Yellow Pages of
ads ``for every organized group.''
   As a 16-member drafting committee began work, however,
representatives of apparent nominee Michael Dukakis and rival Jesse
Jackson said the ``discussion paper'' they started out with _ a
2,000-word document penned by one-time John F. Kennedy speechwriter
Theodore Sorensen _ was too general.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's emissary, said the Sorensen
paper ``contains almost no specifics.''
   Michael Barnes, representating Dukakis, said the platform will
have to give voters more details on how the Democrats will grapple
with the spread of AIDS and help the homeless.
   ``We need to indicate where we're going and how we're going to
get there,'' he said.
   Kirk, in a brief appearance before leaving this island near
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, exhorted the Democrats to write with
``the so-called swing voters,'' not special interests, in mind.
   ``You never get a second chance to make a first impression,''
said Kirk, who wants a short, visionary platform.
   The Sorensen paper, in the form of a declaration by ``we the
people of the Democratic Party,'' denounces ``voodoo economics,''
condemns ``South Africa's hateful apartheid, government-sponsored
terrorism,'' and mentions in passing a need ``to find more homes
and food for those who are homeless and hungry ... and to find more
aid for those who have AIDS.''
   Kirk said the party needs ``a pragmatic, principled and positive
statement that American people can read and reflect upon and say,
`That's the kind of country I want my kids to grow up in.'''
   He told reporters the party does not need to spell out dollar
figures or precise program goals in its platform.
   ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow Pages, an ad for
every organized group,'' he said.
   Rep. William Gray III, the Philadelphia congressman and Jackson
supporter who is chairing the drafting sessions, assured the panel
members, ``You are going to write the platform.''
   He said his goal was not to produce a document this weekend, but
to build a consensus in preparation for next month's convention in
Atlanta.
   The drafting committee adjourned after a 90-minute afternoon
session in which the members agreed they need strong stands on
civil rights, drugs, housing, health and education.
   Gray then met privately with Barnes, Norton and others to try to
forge common language on those issues. He put off until the weekend
discussion of the economy and foreign affairs.
   Norton expressed discomfort with the pace, telling reporters,
``It is going too slowly. You don't know what differences you have
until you get down to cold language.''
   James B. Booe, secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workers
of America and one of the drafters, said the Democrats need ``a
platform that any Democrat can run with instead of from,'' not one
that would ``get us tangled up with too many specifics.''
   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin said the platform should be a
document school children can read.
   But Leslie McLemore, a political science professor at Jackson
State University in Mississippi, said, ``There are some school
children in my state who cannot read and that's why (on) education
and other issues we have to be specific.''
   McLemore, a Jackson delegate, said, ``Winning is important, but
winning and losing the very heart and soul of this party, and
misleading the American people is not an enterprise that I wish to
be a part of.''
   Gray said there will be a draft ready for the full 186-member
Platform Committee to consider when it meets in Denver June 25-26.
   He said no one expected Sorensen's paper to be the final word.
   ``As we go through the discussion of issues _ drugs, education,
civil rights, health care ... hopefully they'll realize that their
differences are not that great and begin to come to a consensus on
their own,'' Gray said.
   Norton said, ``Our concern would only have been if the two
candidates did not have a free hand to draft the kind of platform
that they and they alone deserve to draft, because they attracted
the largest number of votes.''
   She said Sorensen's language on South Africa was ``one of the
better parts of this document'' but still needed to be stronger.
   ``The motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs. There
probably is more the American people would like to have us say
about drugs,'' she added.
   Sorensen, who will sit on the full Platform Committee, told
reporters he stood ready to help the drafters, but if he was not
needed ``I brought my tennis racket.'

   One day after suffering another budgetary blow,
Gov. Michael Dukakis said Friday the state's worsening money
problems can be managed. But he declined to give new details on how
that might be accomplished.
   ``Obviously, we have an immediate problem,'' Dukakis said,
referring to a shortfall of at least $400 million in the $11
billion budget for the fiscal year that ends in three weeks.
   Nearly $100 million of that total became due suddenly on
Thursday when the state's highest court ruled in favor of a
corporate tax abatement.
   In his first full-fledged news conference on Massachusetts
issues since clinching the Democratic presidential nomination,
Dukakis acknowledged that the current tax shortfall is serious, but
he said the state is not broke and stuck to his view that the
state's economy remains healthy.
   The governor again declined to specify which tax-raising
measures he supports _ if any _ beyond the $70 million he has
proposed to gain by bringing the state income tax code in line with
federal changes.
   Dukakis was asked if he supports a proposed $40 million tax on
cigarettes, or other new taxes.
   ``That's an open question at this point,'' he said. The need for
taxes depends on how much savings government can realize by scaling
back planned expansions for next year and by trimming the cost of
long-term nursing home care, he indicated.
   Dukakis also repeated his desire to capture a projected $38
million in unclaimed bottle deposits held by bottlers, although
legislative leaders have said firmly they hold little hope for
claiming those funds.
   ``All of these issues are on the table; all of them involve
savings and revenue,'' Dukakis said, promising that a solution to
balance the budget would ``evolve.''
   For next fiscal year, Dukakis initially proposed spending nearly
$12 billion, but he has trimmed that request. In May, the House cut
spending plans further, sending an $11.8 billion package to the
Senate, which is drafting its own budget plans now.
   Dukakis said that because the House did not adopt all of his
proposals to reduce spending, there is room for more cuts.

<HEAD>GOP Member of Kerry's Drug Panel Says Hearings Designed to Hurt
Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, the senior Republican on
a Senate subcommittee investigating Latin American drug dealing,
angrily accused panel chairman John Kerry on Friday of using the
issue as a political weapon against Vice President George Bush.
   McConnell accused the Massachusetts Democrat of setting up a
series of hearings into drug-running operations that put Reagan
administration anti-drug efforts in a bad light while refusing to
hear testimony from administration witnesses.
   ``The subcommittee is being conducted as if it were a division
of the Dukakis campaign,'' McConnell said in a reference to likely
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Bush has been a central figure in those efforts, first as head
of the South Florida anti-drug task force, then as chief of the
administration's overall drug interdiction effort.
   The investigation ``has deteriorated into a biased, partisan
agenda designed to selectively criticize and condemn rather than
work toward constructive solutions,'' McConnell, R-Ky., told
reporters.
   ``A year and a half of requests to hear from the administration
witnesses to discuss policy plans and options regarding
international drug trafficking have been ignored,'' he said.
   McConnell accused Kerry and his staff of spinning out a story
told by convicted drug dealers of dubious credibility, of declining
to schedule witnesses who might dispute that story and of leaking
information to the press to suit their political goals. McConnell
has not attended the hearings.
   Specifically, he said, Kerry has declined to allow Felix
Rodriguez, a former CIA agent and friend of Bush, to rebut claims
by one previous witness that Rodriguez was involved in channeling
drug profits to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   In a statement read at McConnell's news conference Friday,
Rodriguez said he had only met the man who made the charge,
convicted money launderer Ramon Milian Rodriguez, on one occasion.
Milian Rodriguez told him ``in passing'' that he might be able to
provide money from the drug operation for the Contras, Rodriguez
said.
   The meeting, on Jan. 18, 1985, was at the office of Raul Diaz, a
former law-enforcement officer and now a private investigator who
put Rodriguez in touch with the drug trafficker, he said. He said
he passed the information to the FBI and the CIA but did not
otherwise follow up. At that time, Rodriguez said, he had never met
Bush.
   Responding to the charges, Kerry accused McConnell in turn of
trying to politicize the drug issue.
   ``I am saddened by my colleague's decision to separate himself
from a serious investigation that has required an awful lot of hard
work over the course of three years,'' Kerry said in a statement.
   ``We have tried to include him in the process. I regret that for
reasons of his own he has chosen to politicize the ongoing work of
the subcommittee as we seek to expose the connections between law
enforcement, foreign policy and narcotics.''
   Kerry said his committee still plans to invite administration
witnesses, including John C. Lawn, head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration. Rodriguez also is expected to be called to testify,
as well as the former head of the South Florida anti-drug task
force, Adm. Daniel Murphy.
   Kerry's chief aide on the investigation, Jack Blum, said he had
been discussing future witness lists with McConnell as recently as
last week and said he was ``astonished'' at the complaints.
   Kerry's Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics
and international operations has held a series of hearings on the
Latin American drug trade, including the widespread influence of
the Colombian Medellin cocaine cartel.
   While McConnell has not been present for the hearings,
Republican New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who is not a member of
the subcommittee, has been present and participated in questioning
much of the time.

   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said Friday his
first 48 hours in the Soviet Union left him uncertain about the
reality of change here, but he voiced hope Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was sincere in his desire for reform.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev is confronted with tremendous problems,''
O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, said in a telephone
interview. ``I think anyone in his right mind prays Mr. Gorbachev
is sincere and wants to bring about a new era.''
   O'Connor and nine other Roman Catholic cardinals are in Moscow
for celebrations marking the 1,000th anniversary of the Russian
Orthodox Church, an event being accorded extraordinary prominence
by authorities in this officially atheistic state.
   O'Connor is the highest-ranking American Catholic in the largest
Vatican delegation ever to visit the country. Evangelist Billy
Graham is also visiting the Soviet Union for the millennium
celebration.
   Earlier Friday, O'Connor and other visiting dignitaries attended
a gala meeting at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre marking the millennium
of the mass baptism carried out in 988 by Prince Vladimir of Kiev,
the rite that founded the Russian church.
   Raisa Gorbachev, the Soviet leader's wife, was also present.
   O'Connor said the presence of Mrs. Gorbachev, who once was a
teacher of Marxism-Leninism, and the official exposure being given
the event here had stunned the leaders of the Russian church.
   O'Connor noted he had only arrived Wednesday and had only had
time for ``impressions and guesses'' about how Gorbachev's drive
for ``glasnost,'' or openness, had affected religious believers in
the Soviet Union.
   ``Anyone who wants to be honest is in a bit of a dilemma,''
O'Connor said. ``Writing it off as a charade would be as tragic as
if we bought it lock, stock and barrel.''
   Soviet authorities are currently rewriting laws on religion to
allow believers more latitude in expressing their faith. But
O'Connor said ``deprivations and persecutions'' continued against
the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which is not recognized by Soviet
authorities.
   O'Connor also said dramatic changes were needed in the treatment
of Soviet Jewry.
   He said he believed Russian church leaders knew that once the
foreign delegations left, ``things could go back to subnormal'' in
Soviet church-state relations.
   O'Connor began his day by celebrating Mass at St. Louis Roman
Catholic Church in Moscow, as he did Thursday, said Monsignor James
McCarthy, the cardinal's secretary.
   Four other cardinals and 12 priests were also in attendance,
McCarthy said, as well as two bishops, one from the Soviet republic
of Lithuania and the other from Vietnam.
   On Saturday, O'Connor is scheduled to take part in an evening
vigil at the Trinity Cathedral of Moscow's Danilov Monastery
conducted by Patriach Pimen, the head of the Russian Church.
   The next day is the Russian Orthodox equivalent of All Saints
Day, known as ``Sunday of All Saints Who Shone Forth in the Land of
Russia'' and one of the holiest days on the church's calendar.
   O'Connor is scheduled to return to New York on June 15.

   The House ethics committee announced Friday it
will conduct an official inquiry into accusations that Seaker Jim
Wright violated House conflict-of-interest rules in his financial
dealings.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the panel _ six
Democrats and six Republicans _ unanimously approved ``a
preliminary inquiry in the matter of Speaker James Wright.''
   ``The speaker of the House has been notified and has pledged his
full cooperation,'' he said.
   Wright proclaimed his innocence and denied using his office for
personal gain. ``My goal, and just about my only professional goal
in living at this point, is to be a good and effective public
servant,'' he said in a statement.
   It was only the second time since the ethics committee was
created 21 years ago that it has investigated a speaker of the
House. Former speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., was
investigated and cleared as part of the Korean influence scandal a
decade ago.
   Wright, accompanied by his lawyer, met with reporters for nearly
two hours before the committee announcement, answering questions
and providing papers he said refuted the charges against him.
   The Texas Democrat repeated his assertion that his troubles were
the result of Republicans seeking to deflect charges of sleaze in
the Reagan administration.
   ``I don't think there's any question but that they're
politically motivated,'' he said of the accusations. Although
Republicans would still be critical even if they were not
themselves under attack, ``I don't think there would have been a
formal charge and all this fanfare,'' he said.
   The committee listed six areas in which ``actions taken by House
Speaker James C. Wright Jr. ... may have resulted in violations of
the Code of Official Conduct, or a law, rule, regulation or other
standard of conduct:''
   _The circumstances surrounding lobbying efforts for a friend and
constituent, Richard Moncrief, with whom Wright had an interest in
a private gas well venture.
   _The circumstances surrounding Wright's intervention on behalf
of Texas Oil & Gas Co. in a matter before the Interior Department.
   _Whether campaign fuds were used to help pay for publication of
Wright's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' from which he
received a 55 percent royalty totaling some $55,000.
   _Whether Wright improperly detailed a congressional aide and
used his office expense accounts to complete work on the book.
   _Wright's use of a condominium in Fort Worth, Texas, which
belonged to a son of his friend and business partner George
Mallick, for which Wright reportedly paid a per diem and expenses
but no monthly rent.
   _The possible exercise of undue influence in dealings with
officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on behalf of Texas
savings and loan institutions.
   The committee went beyond the scope of inquiry suggested by Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed the official complaint against the
speaker.
   Gingrich had cited the book contract and the oil company
dealings. Common Cause, a group that advocates tighter government
ethics, asked for an investigation of Wright's activities on behalf
of the bankers.
   Gingrich said he was pleased with the ethics committee's
decision.
   ``I think it's good for the country, I think it's good for the
House as an institution ... that 12 members, on a bipartisan basis,
have voted to investigate the speaker,'' Gingrich said.
   Wright's lawyer, William Oldaker, said he believed the committee
_ known officially as the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct _ had no need for an outside counsel, as Gingrich had
suggested. Oldaker expressed confidence the speaker would be
exonerated.
   The decision to launch a preliminary inquiry was the normal
procedure when a member presented a case that could, if true,
constitute a violation, Oldaker said.
   The committee has the power to bring charges before the full
House which can result in disciplinary action, the most rare and
severe of which would be expulsion.
   The speaker had been largely unavailable to discuss details of
the accusations until Friday, when he launched what appeared to be
an all-out effort that included lengthy interviews with print and
broadcast reporters.
   He also released a 23-page statement, along with documents he
said supported, point by point, his claims he had done nothing
wrong. After the committee announcement, the speaker's office
released an additional statement regarding the condominium.
   The speaker said he had no financial interest in the oil company
cases, which date from the late 1970s. His efforts included giving
a letter to the late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
   Intervention on behalf of failing Texas savings and loan
institutions, he said, was ``in the nature of my duties as
speaker,'' he said. He had merely asked regulators to hear the
cases of his constituents, he said, and published reports implying
anything else were ``just pure fiction,'' he said.
   Wright defended his book deal, denying that he was given the
high royalties as a return from the nearly $300,000 in business his
campaigns had given the company owned by the publisher, his friend
William Carlos Moore.
   ``There's nothing wrong with the arrangement to publish the
book,'' he said.
   He also insisted that the staff member who worked on the project
did so as a volunteer, and that taxpayers received full value when
they financed the employee's trip to Fort Worth for the project.
   Regarding the condominium, which Wright subsequently purchased
for $58,500, Wright said the owner had no interest in legislation
and that if he had not used it it would have remained vacant.
   ``To the degree I have ever, or may have erred... it would be a
mistake of the head, not a mistake of the heart,'' he said.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., the only former
Democratic presidential hopeful who hasn't made a formal
endorsement, may give Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis his nod
next week, an aide said Friday.
   Mike Kopp, Gore's press secretary, said the Tennessee senator's
staff was ``still working out the details'' for an endorsement of
Dukakis.
   Kopp said he could not discuss the details, but said Gore would
probably endorse Dukakis ``in a few days. It will not be this
week.''
   Three other former rivals for the Democratic nomination _ Bruce
Babbitt, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois _ endorsed Dukakis on Wednesday. The Democratic
front-runner sewed up the nomination a day earlier by winning the
California primary.
   While Gore has not released his delegates, The Associated Press
delegate poll shows 114 have left him over the past four weeks. On
May 13, Gore had 403 delegates while Friday he had 289.

   The army arrested a
26-year-old Palestinian suspected of stabbing an Israeli-appointed
Arab mayor and bulldozed his cinderblock house Friday in the
Jelazoun refugee camp.
   The army said Khamis Jawdat Faraj had stalked Hassan Tawil, 74,
the mayor of El Bireh, and knifed him as an act of Palestinian
nationalism. Tawil was critically wounded.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, troops ordered about 100 Israelis
out of the village of Beita, where the Israelis were planting olive
trees to protest the army's uprooting of orchards and demolition of
14 Arab houses.
   The uprootings and demolitions were in retaliation for an April
6 clash between villagers and Israeli settlers in which two
Palestinians and a 15-year-old Jewish girl were killed.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir returned from a five-day trip to
the United States and told reporters he urged Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to support direct peace talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors.
   The army said in a statement it arrested Faraj on Thursday night.
   A large yellow bulldozer leveled the three-room house where
Faraj lived with his 60-year-old mother. Only an almond tree, plum
tree and rose bush were left standing.
   Before sending about a dozen vehicles and two bulldozers into
Jelazoun, the army imposed a curfew and cut electricity to the camp
where about 5,000 Palestinians live. It is about 20 miles north of
Jerusalem.
   Troops removed belongings from the house and found Marxist and
Palestinian nationalist literature inside. Then one of the
bulldozers rumbled up to the one-story house and knocked it down,
raising a huge cloud of dust.
   ``They are destroying our house _ I don't know what for,'' said
Nozha Faraj as she watched the demolition from a neighbor's home.
   The army said her son had been detained several times previously
for alleged participation in anti-Israeli disturbances.
   According to the daily Haaretz, Tawil, who was stabbed Tuesday,
was able to identify his assailant. Tawil told Israel Television
the man asked him for help in obtaining a passport before stabbing
him.
   In Beita, troops uprooted the trees being planted by an Israeli
group called ``Committee for Beita.'' They threw one of the
saplings onto the highway. The move prompted the Israelis to shout:
``Shoot the trees!''
   The Israeli group seeks reparations to villagers whose homes
were destroyed or damaged by the army in punishment for the clash.
   Jewish settlers and the army initially blamed Arab villagers for
the death of Israeli teen-ager Tirza Porat, but an army report
later determined she was killed by a bullet fired by an Israeli
guarding the group.
   According to U.N. figures, 204 Palestinians and two Israelis
have been killed since the uprising began on Dec. 8. About 5,000
Arabs have been injured and 5,000 arrested.
   After Moslem prayers in Gaza City on Friday, troops fired tear
gas to disperse about 50 protesters who threw rocks at soldiers
from rooftops and chanted ``PLO, Israel No!''
   Also Friday, Arab newspapers reported the army arrested two more
Palestinian reporters and a writer. The army has detained 21 Arab
journalists for six months without trial to try to curb the
Palestinian press, which it blames for inciting unrest.
   Shamir said he told Shevardnadze at their meeting in New York he
opposes an international conference on Middle East peace. ``We know
what we want and we don't think a conference of all kinds of
countries should decide our fate,'' he said.
   The Soviets favor such a conference, which would include
America, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China as the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, but Shamir says
Israel would be outnumbered and pressured to make territorial
concessions.
   The Government Press Office reinstated the press credentials of
NBC television correspondent Martin Fletcher after a six-week
suspension.
   Israel suspended the credentials of Fletcher and Washington Post
correspondent Glenn Frankel on April 26, accusing them of violating
military censorship by reporting that Israel was responsible for
the assassination of PLO military commander Khalil Wazir in Tunisia
on April 16. The government has refused comment on reports of its
involvement.
   Frankel's credentials were returned in May.

<HEAD>Town's Residents Riled By Author's Boring Portrayal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRUM, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This tiny mining town on the Tug River got a
less than flattering portrayal in a book written by a native son
who said Crum was a boring place where nothing ever changes but the
weather.
   ``Crum,'' a novel by Lee Maynard, has been on the bookshelves
for two weeks, but it's hard to find in these parts. The only local
store that stocked it, the Sav-Rite nearby in Kermit, sold its two
copies right away.
   ``I didn't think highly of the book,'' said Crum resident Lorrie
Perry. ``It was not one I'd put on the library shelf.''
   Maynard picked his hometown of 300 on the West Virginia-Kentucky
border as the subject of his first book, published by Washington
Square Press, a division of Simon & Schuster.
   ``During the winters in Crum the days were long, boring and
cold, and during the summers the days were long, boring and hot,''
Maynard wrote. ``In Crum, only the temperature changed.''
   Maynard, 52, said he intended much of the 189-page book to be
funny, but it was based on fact. ``There's a kernel of truth in
every page, in every paragraph,'' said Maynard, who was known as
Amos Lee when he lived in the town.
   Residents disagree, especially about the salty language
Maynard's characters use.
   ``We didn't use language like that. That was shocking,'' said
one resident, who asked not to be named in deference to Maynard's
parents who moved to Kenova, about 30 miles away, when Maynard was
14.
   ``I really had a high regard for him,'' said one upset resident.
``Amos Lee was a very All-American type. It didn't sound like the
Amos Lee I knew.''
   The story follows a nameless protagonist through four seasons of
his high school senior year during the 1950s. He's not the fastest,
smartest or strongest boy in his gang.
   He's just the one who wants out of Crum the most.
   ``I tried for years to figure out how our gang worked and I
guess it was sort of like a stew,'' the protagonist writes. ``The
boys were tasteless chunks of things floating around in the pot,
mostly unidentifiable, but sort of gristly if you bit into them,
with the girls as the spices and the heat.''
   ``Living in Crum made such an impact on me,'' Maynard said. ``To
this day I don't know if the impact was good or bad. I had such a
desire to leave. It was a weight on my shoulders.''
   Ralph Dawson, the principal of Crum Elementary School who was a
year or two behind Maynard in school, said he remembers Crum
differently from the author.
   ``It was a very active community,'' he said.
   Maynard, who now lives in Sante Fe, N.M., has been back only
once.
   ``I drove in, had a cup of coffee and got in my car and drove
away. I got very tense while I was in there,'' he said. ``Have you
been to Crum? It's a strange place.''

   A Defense Department elementary school teacher
who has AIDS has been arrested on charges he received child
pornography through the mail and is the subject of a broader child
molestation probe, officials said Friday.
   The teacher, assigned to the department's Dependents School
program in Panama since September 1985, was arrested on June 4
after voluntarily traveling from Panama to Atlanta, Ga., the U.S.
Southern Command said in a statement.
   He has been assigned to a post outside the classroom since
November.
   The 34-year-old teacher, whom the command identified as Cirio
Lopez Jr., ``surrendered to U.S. authorities in Atlanta for
allegedly using the U.S. mail to receive child pornography.''
   The command said Lopez was a U.S. citizen and second-grade
teacher who is ``an admitted homosexual suffering AIDS.''
   ``Lopez is being charged with violation of Title 18 ... and U.S.
Postal regulations for the possession of two magazines containing
child pornography. The materials were discovered through the U.S.
Postal System in Atlanta.''
   The command said Lopez had begun teaching second grade at the
Diablo Elementary School in the Panama Canal Zone in September
1985, after a previous assignment at a Defense Department school in
West Germany. Earlier, he taught in an unidentified public school
system in Colorado, the command said.
   ``However, Mr. Lopez voluntarily removed himself from classroom
teaching last November after he informed school officials that he
had AIDS. Because of the seriousness of these charges, and Mr.
Lopez' association with school-age male children, an investigation
is under way to determine any further possible misconduct on his
part.''
   The command added that so far, it knew of ``fewer than 10''
older children who had ``associated'' with Lopez by attending
baseball games or movies with him.
   ``A special team will conduct in-depth interviews with students
and parents concerning any possible misconduct on the part of Mr.
Lopez,'' the command added.
   The U.S. Southern Command, based in Panama, is the military
organization responsible for overseeing all U.S. military
operations in Central and South America.
   There are 10 elementary schools along with two junior highs, two
senior highs and one junior college in Panama serving 6,580
students. The system employs about 450 teachers and other workers.
   According to the command, Lopez acknowledged he was a homosexual
after symptoms of AIDS were noted in October 1987 at the Gorgas
Army Hospital in Panama.
   His students and their parents were not informed he had the
disease ``because U.S. law prohibits discrimination against
civilian employees who have AIDS,'' the command said.
   ``We have no legal authority to dismiss any civilian employee
who has AIDS unless he or she is debilitated and cannot perform his
job. The U.S. Public Health Service has stated that casual contact
with AIDS patients does not place others at risk of getting the
illness.
   ``Lopez was offered and accepted an assignment away from the
classroom at the regional DODDS office at Albrook Air Force Station
to work with a curriculum development project. He has not been in
the classroom since Nov. 23, 1987.''
   The command declined to offer details about how or when the
Postal Service discovered the pornographic materials, but described
them as ``magazines containing photos of minor male children.''

   Condemned serial child-killer
Arthur Gary Bishop went to his execution Friday begging
forgiveness, but the families of his victims say it won't come from
them.
   ``I know he (was) sick, but to forgive him? I can't forgive him
for taking my son's life. I just don't understand why he couldn't
have let him go,'' said Debbie Fisher Robinson, whose son, Alonzo
Daniels, 4, Bishop killed in 1979.
   Bishop, 36, was the 99th inmate executed in the United States
since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ended a nationwide
moratorium on capital punishment.
   He was pronounced dead at 12:16 a.m., about eight minutes after
two executioners at Utah State Prison injected him with deadly
chemicals.
   ``Give my apologies to the families of the victims,'' were
Bishop's last words, said Warden Gerald Cook.
   A former Eagle Scout, excommunicated Mormon missionary and a
bookkeeper by profession, Bishop ended all further appeals after
the Utah Supreme Court in February rejected his arguments against
the death penalty.
   He was convicted in 1984 of kidnapping five Salt Lake County
boys between 1979 and 1983. The victims, ages 4 to 13, were
variously shot, bludgeoned, strangled and drowned because Bishop
feared exposure as a child molester.
   A homosexual pedophile, Bishop confessed to police he was glad
he had been caught because he couldn't control his lust for young
boys and would likely have killed again.
   In a hand-written statement released after his execution, Bishop
said he had allowed himself ``to be misled by Satan, and as a
result, my life has been marked by wicked, perverse and depraved
actions.''
   He said that by ending his appeals, he was not trying to be
heroic, but ``accepting my just punishment. ... Though perhaps too
little too late, I am doing the right thing now,'' he wrote.
   Bishop also used his final statement to deny ``pernicious
rumors'' that he was guilty of other slayings than the five for
which he was convicted, and that he was sexually abused as a child.
   Reaction from the families of Bishop's victims was laced with
bitterness.
   Claude and Lora-Lee Petersen said they are struggling to prevent
their pain and anger over Bishop's 1980 slaying of their
11-year-old son, Kim, from consuming them. The Petersens said the
execution offered them no relief.
   ``It's still a form of violence, and we don't want to focus on
that at all,'' they said.
   Shona Cunningham, whose 13-year-old son, Graeme, was Bishop's
last victim, said she could not bring herself to grant Bishop's
plea for forgiveness contained in a February letter to her and
other victim's relatives.
   ``I told him it's not my jurisdiction,'' she said of her written
response, the only one Bishop received from victims' families. ``I
told him he was right, there can't be a happy ending to this one.''
   Hours before Bishop's execution, about 70 people gathered on a
hill overlooking the prison to hold a candlelight vigil protesting
capital punishment. The vigil was sponsored jointly by Amnesty
International and the Utah Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.
   A handful of people favoring the execution stood nearby and
shouted ``Justice has been served.''

   Massachusetts Democrats gather in Boston Garden on
Saturday for a state convention that will be little more than a
political rally for the presidential candidacy of native son
Michael S. Dukakis.
   The setting for the convention is a meaningful one _ the last
political event held at Boston Garden was the election eve speech
delivered by John F. Kennedy to the people of Massachusetts in 1960.
   ``It's a moment in history, a chance to reflect when we go to
the Garden ... to sort of reflect back on a grand and glorious
political tradition in Massachusetts,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins,
chairman of the Democratic State Committee.
   ``It's also a time to anticipate a very exciting future in
Massachusetts politics,'' Atkins said.
   Massachusetts is entitled to bring 109 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month. Eleven are
``super delegates,'' who are automatically included by virture of
their roles in the party.
   Gov. Dukakis won 79 of the pledged delegates in the state's
presidential primary in March, while presidential hopeful Jesse
Jackson won 19.

<TEXT>
   A sports car with an armored
roof, 350 dresses and rugs made from wild animal skins were among a
host of newly discovered items that belonged to the late President
Juan Peron and his wife, Eva, officials disclosed Friday.
   Peron, Argentina's most popular leader of the 20th century, died
in 1974. Mrs. Peron, the vivacious blonde who was the inspiration
for the stage musical ``Evita,'' died of uterine cancer at age 33
in 1952.
   Among the 5,000 items discovered was a white ermine cape worn by
Mrs. Peron when she visited Pope Pius XII at the Vatican. The
sports car, a 1951 Institec with a Porcshe engine, was driven once
by her husband.
   Other items included about 350 dresses; 20 animal-skin capes and
jackets; a kimono given to the first lady by the Japanese
government; rugs, some made from wild animal skins; a double-barrel
Spanish shotgun and three French rifles.
   The long-forgotten items were stored in four city bank vaults
and storage sites shortly after Peron was toppled by a coup in
1955. They came to officials' attention three months ago through an
anonymous tip, Buenos Aires City Councilman Juan Carlos Suardi said.
   Suardi said plans call for transferring the belongings to a
museum being built in the small pampas town of Los Toldos where Eva
Peron was born, about 250 miles west of Buenos Aires. Eva was
Peron's second wife.
   Peron ruled from 1946 until the military coup, when he went into
exile for 18 years. He returned to a tumultuous welcome in 1973,
was elected president but died at age 78 the next year.
   Suardi said Peron apparently made no attempt to get the items
out of storage upon his return.
   The councilman said the Peron goods will be sent to Los Toldos
within 90 days unless Peron's third wife, Isabel Peron, objects.
Isabel Peron, who lives in Madrid, Spain, succeeded Peron as
president on his death but was ousted in a 1976 coup.
   Also in the Peron collection were pieces of silver and gold,
some jewelry, and dozens of pairs of shoes, socks, ties, pants and
handkerchiefs. Suardi said the total value of the items was not
known.
   Eva Peron's birthplace was declared a historic monument last
month by the governor of Buenos Aires Province, Antonio Cafiero,
leader of the labor-backed Peronist Party named for Peron and now
the main opposition party in Argentina.
   One year ago, grave-robbers broke into the tomb containing
Peron's remains, sawed off the hands and demanded an $8 million
ransom for their return. The ransom never was paid and the hands
remain missing.
   Police say the case remains unsolved.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Friday
urged four other North African nations to merge their armed forces
with those of Libya as a step toward ``total Arab unity.''
   Colonial rule ended in the five North African countries more
than 25 years ago but it was the first time the leaders had held
such a meeting. Also present was King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   Delegation sources said Gadhafi made the proposal at an informal
summit at the seaside villa of Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid.
Others taking part were King Hassan II of Morocco, Tunisian
President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali and President Mouaouia Ould Sid
Ahmed Taya of Mauritania.
   Libya once was an Italian colony and the four other countries
were controlled by the French. The five are known as the Maghreb
nations.
   Fahd was invited to the meeting because of the role he played in
the recent reconciliation of Algeria and Morocco following 12 years
of confrontation over the Western Sahara, formerly the Spanish
Sahara.
   After Fahd left the luncheon to fly home, the Maghreb leaders
held an hour-long meeting and each offered proposals for future
collaboration.
   Abdelhamid Mehri, the Algerian ambassador to Morocco, told
reporters the five agreed to set up a special commission to study
all the proposals and the commission will hold its first session in
Algiers July 13.
   A later communique said the commission would study ``the means
to implement the great Arab Maghreb,'' but gave not details of the
proposals put forward.
   Delegation sources said Ben Ali proposed a gradual integration
of some of the region's political institutions, including the five
parliaments, while Hassan suggested a step-by-step approach
beginning with integration of the small multinational corporations
in the five nations.
   The sources said Taya urged a closer relationship and Bendjedid
suggested that Maghreb unity should begin with limited economic
integration.
   All of the leaders at the luncheon took part in the three-day
Arab summit meeting earlier in the week that restated Arab
endorsement of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its
chairman, Yasser Arafat. They Arab leaders also promised a $118
million annual subsidy to support the uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In resolutions on the Iran-Iraq war, the summit accused Iran of
using terrorism in the conflict. That action was denounced Friday
by Iranian President Ali Khamenei.
   At a weekly prayer meeting in Tehran, Khamenei said the
resolutions ``are a disgrace to the Arab world'' and ``will remain
as a stain of shame on the skirts of the Arab reactionary leaders
forever.'' His remarks were carried on Tehran Radio.
   The resolutions condemning Iran said it was trying to create
unrest in the Persian Gulf states and blamed it for attacks on
Kuwait and for instigating riots that led to more than 400 deaths
during last year's Moslem pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
   As Gadhafi left the meeting to fly home he embraced each of the
other leaders. All but Bendjedid are known for their close
relations with the United States.
   At a meeting of the main summit Wednesday, Gadhafi told those
with good relations with the United States they could ``go to
hell,'' but he later apologized.
   Gadhafi long has advocated Arab unity in almost any form. In the
19 years since he seized power he has tried and failed to merge his
country with all of Libya's neighbors and with some Arab nations
far from Libya's borders.
   His proposal for a merger of the armed forces came ``like
lightning out of the blue sky,'' a delegation source said.
   The source, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
reported Gadhafi said the unity of the Maghreb nations would be a
``point of transition toward the total Arab unity to which we
should all aspire.''
   Gadhafi said that at the Maghreb level the unity should begin
with the unification of the region's armed forces followed by the
``economic, social and political integration,'' the source said.
   A merger of the armed forces would create an army of 765,000,
but summit sources said the integration ``does not seem immediately
feasible.''
   Algeria's armed forces are the largest in the region with
350,000 men almost entirely equipped with Soviet-bloc weapons.
Libya also has a Soviet-supplied arsenal but its armed forces total
110,000 military personnel, including auxiliary units.
   Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania have some 305,000 troopers,
equipped mainly with French and American-made weapons.

   Michael Dukakis disparaged Republican George Bush on Friday for
``a losing strategy'' of attacking the Democrat's background, but
Bush retorted that ``I am not going to be deterred from telling the
truth.''
   With the apparent presidential nominees swapping general
election rhetoric, Jesse Jackson denounced continuing questions
about ``what Jesse wants.'' He called such questions ``demeaning,
disrespectful and contemptuous'' and said his supporters aren't
focused solely on whether or not Dukakis chooses him as running
mate.
   ``They do not have a fixation on one position,'' Jackson told
reporters in southern California where he took a brief working
vacation.
   Jackson said he and his supporters have other concerns, even as
Democratic officials meeting in Michigan expressed optimism they
could craft a party platform to Dukakis' liking that would also
meet Jackson's standards.
   Rep. William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting committee
chairman, said at the opening session on Mackinac Island, Mich,
``As we go through the discussion of issues _ drugs, education,
civil rights, health care ... hopefully they'll realize that their
differences are not that great and begin to come to a consensus on
their own.''
   In Boston, Dukakis was asked how he planned to respond to
attacks in which Bush called him an elitist with close ties to
Harvard University.
   ``I don't,'' he said. ``I'm going to campaign on the issues. I'm
going to talk about the future.''
   Asked if he would bring up Bush's background _ which includes
Yale University _ Dukakis retorted:
   ``I really am not interested. I don't think the American people
are interested. I think that's a losing strategy.''
   Bush didn't retreat an inch from the attacks he had made
Thursday, saying the Democrats are trying to hide the Massachusetts
governor's liberal stands.
   ``There's this whole concept that he's a conservative and all,''
Bush said. ``It's a game plan by the Democrats to protect him from
his record.''
   Bush, in Denver for the first of three unity rallies planned
across the country by the Republican National Committee, complained
about Dukakis campaign aides saying he is mudslinging.
   ``You're looking at a guy who's been getting hit for six months,
guilt by association, and all kinds of personal attacks,'' the vice
president said. ``What happens now, they raise the mudslinging
thing. ... This is going to be a fun campaign.''
   In his speech to the GOP faithful, Bush said, ``It's my job now
not just to say what I'm for, but to give the American people the
facts about Governor Dukakis.''
   ``I am not going to be deterred from telling the truth,'' he
said.
   Four of the vice president's former rivals _ Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Delaware Gov. Pete du
Pont and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig _ were on hand
for the Denver rally. Only Pat Robertson said he could not make it.
   The Massachusetts governor faced questions about whether he
would move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv _
a very touchy issue in the Middle East. Jerusalem, a holy city in
three major religious traditions, is claimed by Jews and Arabs in
the regional conflict.
   First, he said the embassy should ``go where the host nation
says its capital is.''
   Pressed on specifics on Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its
capital, Dukakis finally said: ``I'd put our embassy there.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz said earlier Friday that such a
move ``would ruin'' Middle East peace efforts.
   ``It would be a gigantic mistake and it's shocking that anybody
would make such a proposal,'' said Shultz.
   The Massachusetts governor spent the day in Boston, working
mostly on state business, and had lunch with former President
Carter.
   Dukakis said his lunch with Carter was ``terrific'' and that
``lots of things'' were dicussed. The Democratic nominee-to-be
would not be more specific about his talks with Carter, whom Bush
frequently cites as a negative example of the kind of president
Dukakis would be.
   In Michigan, Dukakis and Jackson representatives made it clear
they thought a first-draft platform ``dicussion paper'' prepared by
former presidential speechwriter Theodore Sorensen was short on
specifics. Gray assured the drafters they were in charge.
   ``Our concern would only have been if the two candidates did not
have a free hand to draft the kind of platform that they and they
alone deserve to draft, because they attracted the largest number
of votes,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, representing Jackson.
   Democratic Party chief Paul Kirk was still pushing his dream of
a short, readable platform.
   ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow Pages, an ad for
every organized group,'' he said.
   In Washington, a White House aide suggested Iran might try to
exploit the presidential race ``by some means,'' according to The
Wall Street Journal. The newspaper reported that a National
Security Council memo warned that American hostages held in Lebanon
by groups friendly to Iran could be pawns in an Iranian ploy.
   The paper also said an Iranian official recently tried to
arrange a secret meeting with a Bush aide. Bush, asked about that,
said, ``No, I don't know anything about it, nothing.''

   Two Nobel Prize laureates, novelist William
Golding and biologist Aaron Klug, received knighthoods Saturday
while other honors went to a snooker star and the man in charge of
sweeping the streets around Parliament.
   They were among 679 Britons whose works were rewarded by Queen
Elizabeth II in the twice-yearly ritual known as the honors list.
   
   The latest list, celebrating the monarch's official birthday,
also honored a doctor, a nurse and a hospital porter who helped the
injured in an Irish Republican Army bombing that killed 12 people
in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland in November.
   
   An OBE, or Officer of the Order of the British Empire, went to
surgeon Andrew McKibbin who headed the teams of doctors treating
the injured.
   Emergency nurse Jane Packham became a Member of the Order of the
British Empire for her work in the disaster and porter Patrick
Curry received a British Empire Medal for getting the injured to
hospitals.
   Golding, who wrote the ``Lord of the Flies,'' won the 1983 Nobel
Prize in literature. Klug received the 1982 prize for his work in
molecular biology.
   The knighthoods mean that after a ceremony at Buckingham Palace
later this year, they may call themselves Sir William and Sir Aaron.
   Other knighthoods went to composer Harrison Birtwhistle, veteran
Liberal Party lawmaker Cyril Smith and Police Commissioner Peter
Imbert, head of Scotland Yard.
   Shakespearean actor Michael Bryant became a CBE, or Commander of
the Order of the British Empire, and snooker ace Steve Davis
received an MBE. Sgt. Ronald Lewis, baggage master to Prince
Charles, became a member of the Royal Victorian Order.
   The Victorian order is the monarch's personal gift, unlike the
majority of the honors which are chosen by the prime minister. Some
honors are for political loyalty, but most recognize achievement in
the arts, business, industry, civil service, sports, science,
charity and heroism.
   Many honors reflect the days when Britain ran an empire covering
one-fifth of the globe.
   A British Empire Medal went to Peter Codd, who manages the
street sweepers around the Houses of Parliament and Downing Street,
where the prime minister lives.
   The highest award, a life peerage, went to Sir William
Rees-Mogg, former editor of The Times of London and chairman of a
new Broadcasting Standards Council established to clean up sex and
violence on television.
   It entitles him to join about 1,200 members of the House of
Lords, the unelected upper legislative house. Unlike members of the
elected House of Commons, the peers are members for life. They
cannot make laws but can amend legislation on non-financial matters.
   Lord Carrington, outgoing secretary general of NATO, was made
Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St George.
   The queen also gave personal honors to Sir William Heseltine,
her private secretary; Frederick Waite, head gardener at her
Sandringham estate with Membership in the Victorian Order, and
William Oswald, her chief horse-breeder.
   The monarch's official birthday is the second Saturday in June
and came this year on June 11. Queen Elizabeth's actual birthday is
April 21. She is 62.
   The official birthday, held when the chances for good weather
are better than in April, also is celebrated with the military
parade of the Trooping the Color.

<HEAD>U.N. Tells Kids: Quiet Please, While We Discuss Disarmament</HEAD>

   Children from more than 50 nations filled
the visitor's lobby of the United Nations with songs of peace on
Friday, and U.N. delegates in the General Assembly heard them and
sent a message.
   The message: Quiet down, please, we're discussing disarmament.
   Some 100 youngsters in the lobby accepted the admonition in good
cheer. A ripple of laughter passed through the crowd after a U.N.
official asked for more restraint in calling for world peace.
   A 6-year-old organization called ``Perhaps ... Kids Meeting Kids
Can Make a Difference'' organized what it called a ``children's
summit.'' The week-long gathering coincides with the 159-member
General Assembly's special session on disarmament.
   For the past two weeks presidents, foreign ministers, prime
ministers and U.N. delegates have been addressing the General
Assembly with calls for disarmament.
   On Friday, the children ranging in age from 6 through 14 met in
the lobby to give a representative of Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar a statement after five days of discussions on
peace.
   ``We are happy that countries are now meeting and beginning to
destroy weapons in their nuclear arsenals,'' said part of their
statement. ``We are also aware that new and more sophisticated
weapons are being built to replace them.
   ``We would like you to be aware that we know this and that it
doesn't make sense to us. People should settle their differences by
talking and not by fighting.'' The statement was read by a
sucession of children and then presented to Johan Nordenfelt from
the department of disarmament affairs.
   But before the meeting they sang peace songs and whooped and
clapped in a happy outburst that was heard in the General
Assembly's main hall a few dozen yards away from the lobby.
   ``I have a complaint from the General Assembly,'' said
Nordenfelt, glancing at a slip of paper. ``They hear your shouting
_ very well. Very good. You are the voice of the future. But please
don't shout.''
   ``Perhaps ... Kids Meeting Kids Can Make a Difference'' was
founded in 1982 to bring together Soviet and American children .
   This year the group expanded to include children from other
countries.
   In 1984 the organization began a pen-pal exchange between Soviet
and American children that has grown to include more than 350,000
correspondents, according to the group.
   About 140 children from more than 50 countries attended this
week's ``summit'' that ended Friday.
   Their expenses in New York were paid by the Kids Meeting Kids
organization. All or part of the travel expenses for some of the
younsters from foreign countries, including China and the Soviet
Union, were paid by their governments.

<HEAD>Governing Party Wins Majority in Provincial Council Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing United National Party
won 36 the 53 District Council seats in the southern province,
according to results released Friday by the Elections Department.
   The elections were marred by three days of terrorist attacks
that left at least 12 people dead. Most of the killings were blamed
on extremists of the Sinhalese ethnic majority, who opposed the
elections.
   Fifteen seats went to the United Socialist Alliance, a coalition
of leftist parties, and independents won the other two. The
election was held Thursday.
   The government party has won control of all seven District
Councils for which elections have been held. Those in the
Tamil-dominated northern and eastern regions have been delayed by
fighting between Indian peacekeeping troops and Tamil rebels, but
the government hopes to hold them next month.
   Council elections were required under the agreement Sri Lanka
and India signed last July in an attempt to end the Tamil
separatist war, which has taken more than 8,000 lives since it
began in 1983.
   Guerrillas of the Tamil ethnic minority, who want a separate
homeland in the north and east to be called Eelam, were to lay down
their arms in exchange for more autonomy in those regions.
   The largest group refused, however, and India has more than
50,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka trying to stop the rebellion.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
island's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese, a predominantly Buddhist ethnic group that controls the
government and army.
   Sinhalese extremists contend the peace agreement made too many
concessions to Tamils and said they would kill anyone who supports
the accord. They were blamed for outbreaks of pre-election violence.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Law Restricting Home Video Taping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britons who make videotapes of television programs
would be forced to erase or destroy such tapes within 28 days under
a law proposed by the Conservative Party government.
   The measure, which could become law this summer, is aimed at
preventing viewers from building up home libraries with videotapes
of television shows and films, depriving copyright holders of
royalties.
   Opposition leaders have called the proposal unenforceable.
   ``How is it going to be policed?'' asked Austin Mitchell, the
Labor Party's trade and industry spokesman. ``Are we going to start
marketing tapes that automatically explode 28 days after they have
been used for the first time?''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government made the proposal
as an amendment to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Bill of 1956.
   A House of Commons committee approved the amendment by a vote of
11-7 Thursday.
   Susie Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Department of Trade and
Industry, said Friday the amendment relaxes retrictions on
``time-shifting,'' the taping of programs to be watched later,
because it gives viewers a ``28-day grace period.''
   Time-shifting is illegal under the international Berne
Convention on Copyrights, which Britain signed, but the restriction
is rarely enforced.
   Ms. Hughes said the measure would make time-shifting a civil
crime, clearing the way for copyright holders to sue for damages to
be determined by a court.
   Bob Montgomery, chairman of the Mechanical Copyright Protection
Society, complained that the measure did not go far enough.
   Mrs. Thatcher's consumer affairs minister, Francis Maude, said
the government was trying to balance the interests of viewers and
copyright owners.
   He was asked in a BBC-TV interview how the government would
enforce the measure and he said he thought viewers would comply
voluntarily.
   ``We are not going to set up a force of tape police breaking
into people's homes to investigate their video libraries _ that is
obviously absurd,'' he said.
   Ms. Hughes said the copyright bill probably would complete the
committee stage in a few weeks and then go for a vote of the full
House of Commons.
   It then will go back to the House of Lords, where it originated,
for final approval, she said.

<TEXT>
   South Africa entered a third
year of emergency rule Friday with tighter controls on opposition
activity, and critics predicted that such measures will become a
permanent way of governing.
   President P.W. Botha's third emergency proclamation Friday means
hundreds of prominent activists will remain in jail without charge.
The decree tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activity
and made it illegal to promote a boycott of October municipal
elections.
   The government in February banned the activities of 17 major
anti-apartheid groups. Most of those groups have called on blacks
to refrain from voting in elections held by the white-dominated
government until blacks have equal voting rights on a national
level.
   The Reagan administration, which had opposed imposition of tough
sanctions against South Africa but was forced to act by Congress,
had only a brief comment on the latest development.
   ``This action underscores the need for a dialogue between the
government and the black opposition to bring about a fully
functioning non-racial democracy,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   The emergency, which first went into effect June 12, 1986, now
will be extended for a year.
   Botha's announcement of the extension came two days after blacks
ended their largest and longest general strike against the
government. Black labor federations said Friday that 2,000 workers
who joined the protest have been fired and 1,000 more subjected to
various disciplinary actions.
   Botha said the government hopes conditions will improve so that
the emergency can be lifted.
   But Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the emergency
extension ``is a pointless and bankrupt exercise'' which
``aggravates South Africa's crisis.''
   Helen Suzman, a veteran parliamentarian who opposes apartheid,
said: ``We might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent
state of emergency.''
   The critics included Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of the
KwaZulu semi-autonomous homeland and one of the black leaders whom
Pretoria wants to include in negotiations on a power-sharing system
that would retain white rule.
   ``The tragedy of the South African situation is that nobody
really had any hope that the national state of emergency would be
lifted,'' he said. ``South Africa seems to be caught up in a
situation (in) which dying apartheid requires more defense than it
ever required.''
   The new regulations make it illegal to quote members of the 17
banned anti-apartheid organizations and prohibit newspapers from
quoting any member of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   The ANC is the main group fighting South Africa's government and
apartheid, under which the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
government.
   The regulations also forbid newspapers from saying that their
journalists were ordered away from any scene of unrest and
indicating in other ways that their news stories are incomplete
because of the emergency restrictions.
   Another new section requires local news agencies, except for the
South African Press Association _ the largest _ to register with
the government.
   The small domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive in
their coverage of anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered to
submit all their dispatches to a government censor before
publication, the regulations say.
   The new rules mean ``no information about very important
political movements in the country will be available,'' said Wynand
Malan, former member of Botha's National Party who now leads a
separate movement in Parliament.
   A vigil for the estimated 2,500 detainees currently held under
the emergency was conducted at Johannesburg's Central Methodist
Church. Monitoring groups said 500 to 1,000 of the detainees have
been held for two years.
   White women from the Black Sash civil rights group on Friday
stood along highways in Johannesburg with posters saying:
``Apartheid is the emergency.''
   The ANC said in a statement from its headquarters in Zambia that
the government sought ``to ensure its survival by continuing to
resort to the most brutal repression.'' The ANC called for
comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against South Africa and said
its guerrillas must escalate their attacks.
   The government's Bureau for Information said the emergency had a
positive effect. It said 91 percent of all black local governments
were operating normally and 85 percent of the positions for black
township councilmen were full. Black school attendance was at 80
percent, it said.
   It gave no figures for unrest incidents, deaths and injuries.
But they have been sharply down over the past year.

   The Foreign Office said Britain and Iran reached
agreement Friday on a compensation deal for damage inflicted on
their embassies in violent incidents.
   Iran is expected to net about $1.6 million as a result of the
deal, reached after three days of talks in London between British
and Iranian officials.
   ``Broad agreement has been reached on the basis of the proposals
put forward by the British government in May 1987,'' said a Foreign
Office statement.
   Under those proposals, Iran will pay Britain for damage
inflicted by mobs on the British Embassy and associated buildings
in Tehran in the late 1970s, and Britain will pay a larger sum for
the burning of the Iranian Embassy in London during a 1980 hostage
siege and rescue.
   The Iranian Embassy declined comment on the talks.
   British newspapers and politicians of the governing Conservative
Party have welcomed the negotiations. They say the negotiations may
lead to improved relations with Iran and better chances of freeing
Western hostages _ at least two of whom are British _ held by
pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon.

   Marines in riot gear helped arrest 14
anti-war protesters Friday at the Concord Naval Weapons Station a
few hours after a gathering marked a year of almost daily peace
demonstrations at the base.
   Those arrested were expected to be booked for investigation of
misdemeanor trespassing, said Lt. J.D. Sizemore, a Contra Costa
County sheriff's deputy.
   The confrontation involving the Marines occurred without
violence at a base gate near what the demonstrators say is a bunker
containing nuclear weapons. Base officials do not comment on
whether nuclear material is present.
   The demonstrators marched to the gate after a morning gathering
at which they were addressed by S. Brian Willson, who lost his legs
Sept. 1 when he was hit by a train at the base while protesting
weapons shipments to Central America.
   Willson and other speakers spoke to about 200 people as a fabric
dove of peace flapped above in a gentle breeze. A banner nearby
read, ``Stopping The War Starts Here.''
   ``I feel great,'' Willson told a reporter. ``With all these
people here, how can I not feel good?''
   He bristled when asked what he felt he had accomplished.
   ``I don't base expressions of conscience on what I'm
accomplishing. I'm expressing what I feel and sharing it with the
rest of these people here.
   ``I'm more committed than ever to wage unconditional peace.''
   In his speech, Willson said, ``It gives me great joy to be here
with you all who have made this place so sacred and empowered.
   ``The human spirit and the truth cannot be squashed,'' he said.
``The spirit of Gandhi and King and Jesus and Buddha cannot be
squashed, no matter how many bombs and weapons are manufactured and
unleased in incredible diabolical policies on this earth.''
   The Willson incident and the year-long vigil have spawned
lawsuits, including several charging sheriff's deputies with using
excessive force while arresting demonstrators blocking train tracks.
   Protesters won an injunction barring a county plan to remove
tables and other material from the side of the highway after
complaints and petitions bearing 800 signatures from residents of
the nearby town of Clyde.
   Willson also is suing, seeking damages for the loss of both legs
at the knee when he was struck by a train hauling 2.8 tons of
munitions to the military reservation.
   The train crew has countersued, charging Willson and others
planned to be hit to halt the train and claiming they suffered
mental anguish after the incident.
   House investigators said in March that Willson and base
officials shared equal blame for the accident.
   Willson, a Vietnam veteran, law school graduate and unsuccessful
candidate for sheriff in Chautauqua, N.Y., won praise in Soviet
newspapers and a hero's welcome when he and other activists visited
Nicaragua in March.

   Republican George Bush said Friday that Democratic
rival Michael Dukakis resorted to ``the oldest ploy in the game''
by accusing Bush of using dirty campaign tactics.
   ``Already, we're hearing charges of `mudslinging' from the other
side,'' Bush told a unity gathering featuring four of his
vanquished GOP rivals as well as Republican officials and activists
from Western states.
   Earlier, Bush told reporters he had shifted his campaign into a
more aggressive attack on the Massachusetts governor after
``getting hit for six months'' by the Democrats. ``This is going to
be a fun campaign,'' the vice president said.
   In his speech, Bush said, ``I look forward to the next two
months, because this is the defining time. This is the time when
the American people will begin to focus on who we are and what we
stand for, not compared to others of our party, but compared to
each other.''
   ``Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Pete du Pont, Al Haig ... they're all
good men and tough competitors,'' Bush said. ``I never liked the
strain of finding differences with my fellow Republicans.''
   Before Bush spoke, he was praised by Dole, Kemp, du Pont and
Haig. And television evangelist Pat Robertson sent a letter saying
he couldn't make the event because of a scheduling conflict, but
that Bush had ``earned and deserves'' the support of conservatives.
   ``You've got to have experience, and George Bush has it all over
Michael Dukakis, day after day after day,'' Dole said.
   Kemp said Bush is ``our nominee, and very frankly, I look
forward to working with Bob and Al and Pete and Pat to make sure we
have a Republican in 1988.''
   Bush said his new campaign strategy, beginning with a Thursday
speech in which he cited many differences with Dukakis on specific
issues, ``represented a turning point.''
   ``It's my job now not just to say what I'm for, but to give the
American people the facts about Governor Dukakis,'' he said. Bush
said Dukakis should understand that.
   ``Governor Dukakis is a tough campaigner _ just ask (onetime GOP
gubernatorial rival) Ed King _ and I expect the same from him,'' he
said. ``I am not going to be deterred from telling the truth.''
   Earlier, Bush had said he wasn't surprised that the Dukakis camp
protested his charge of Thursday _ that the Massachusetts governor
is a liberal posing as a moderate.
   But in a chat with reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to
Denver for the unity gathering with some of his defeated Republican
opponents, the certain GOP nominee said Democrats are trying to
hide Dukakis' record.
   At the same time, Bush, a late 1940s Yale graduate, offered no
apology for labeling Dukakis a political figure born of ``Harvard
Yard's boutique,'' saying it was meant as a statement about the
governor's supposed intellectual elitism, rather than as a
statement about class.
   Shortly after Bush attacked Dukakis on a broad range of foreign
policy and domestic issues on Thursday, the governor's press
secretary issued a statement saying Bush was panicked by his
relatively low standing in the polls and was resorting to
``mudslinging and tearing down.''
   Standing on a tarmac at Denver's Stapleton Airport, Bush said
Friday he thought it curious that the Dukakis campaign
``immediately sallied forth'' with the accusation of dirty politics.
   ``You're looking at a guy who's been getting hit for six months,
guilt by association, and all kinds of personal attacks,'' the vice
president said. ``What happens now, they raise the mudslinging
thing,'' he said. ``This is going to be a fun campaign.''
   Aboard the vice presidential jet, Bush noted a statement that
Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., had released Thursday night in defense
of Dukakis' views.
   ``There's this whole concept that he's a conservative and all,''
Bush said. ``It's a game plan by the Democrats to protect him from
his record.''
   Bush said that with Jesse Jackson's long-haul Democratic primary
race, ``I think he's (Dukakis) done a good job during the primary
season of being shoved to the center'' of the political spectrum.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam said Friday a good rice crop
has eased critical food shortages in some areas but that the nation
still needs assistance.
   The communist government has appealed for international aid,
especially for the northern regions. Natural disasters ravaged last
year's winter and spring rice crops.
   ``With the harvest having begun, here and there the food
situation in the food-deficient provinces in the north has eased
visibly, but much remains to be done to bring about a durable and
all-around solution,'' the official Vietnam News Agency said.
   The report said the recent harvest in the Mekong River delta of
the south, Vietnam's main rice-producing area, was estimated at
240,000 to 300,000 tons more than last year.
   Farmers in the north's Red River delta are preparing for the
harvest, which usually comes a month after the southern harvest,
VNA said.
   This year's output is estimated at 6,160-6,600 pounds of rice
per hectare, up from 4,840 pounds last year, the ageny reported. A
hectare is 2.47 acres.
   The agency added, however, that the increase ``is barely enough
to make up for the heavy losses caused by natural calamities in
last year's crop.''
   Twenty percent of Vietnam's people live in the Red River delta
but it accounts for only 5 percent of the cultivated area.

<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco installed eight
new Cabinet members Friday in an effort to halt a wave of violence
caused by leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads, drug barons
and peasant protesters.
   Both his Liberal Party and the opposition Conservatives said
changing the Cabinet was not the solution.
   ``Ministerial patchwork is not going to solve the grave crisis
the country is suffering,'' former President Misael Pastrana, the
Conservative leader, said in a broadcast interview.
   Sen. Alberto Santofimio, a member of the Liberal leadership,
told another radio station: ``A change in policies is needed more
than a change of people.'' Barco, whose four-year term runs until
Aug. 7, 1990, changed eight of his 13 Cabinet ministers Thursday
night.
   Death squads have massacred more than 100 peasants in four
months, drug traffickers have threatened to plunge Colombia into a
bloodbath and guerrillas are conducting their longest sustained
offensive.
   So far this year, guerrillas have blown up the main oil pipeline
41 times, kidnapped 20 mayors, attacked a dozen towns and destroyed
bridges, power pylons and communications facilities.
   Peasants demanding land and investigation of death-squad
activity have held 80 protest marches since Barco became president
Aug. 7, 1986.
   Demands for presidential action came even from Barco's own
Liberal Party after the kidnapping May 29 of Alvaro Gomez, who ran
for president twice as the Conservative candidate.
   It still is not certain who abducted Gomez or whether he is
alive. He is publisher of the Bogota daily El Siglo and the son of
former President Laureano Gomez.
   The new cabinet ministers are Justice Minister Luis Guillermo
Giraldo Hurtado; Agriculture Minister Gabriel Rosas Vega; Labor
Minister Juan Martin Caicedo; Health Minister Luis H. Arraut; Mines
and Energy Minister Oscar Mejia; Education Minister Manuel
Francisco Becerra; Development Minister Carlos Arturo Marulanda
Ramirez; and Communications Minister Pedro Martin Leyes Hernandez.
   Barco retained the men holding the five most important Cabinet
posts: Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes, Treasury Minister
Luis Fernando Alarcon, Defense Minister Rafael Samudio, Public
Works Minister Luis Fernando Jaramillo and Minister of Government
Cesar Gaviria Trujillo.
   Gaviria is in charge of internal security and was acting
president when Barco was in Europe two weeks ago. During that
period, 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in a battle between
soldiers and peasant protesters.
   The protest was one of a half dozen by a total of about 14,000
peasants marching in northern Colombia.
   Meanwhile, a group calling itself Christians For Peace held 30
people hostage Friday at the Latin American Bishops' Conference
headquarters in Bogota, demanding an investigation of the death
squads. The hostages include nine nuns and priests.
   About 80 people, including nearly a dozen children, took over
the three-story Roman Catholic Church building Wednesday.
   Protesters have occupied a dozen embassies, consulates and
offices of international relief agencies in the past five years to
demand action on grievances that often have little to do with the
places occupied. All the sit-ins have ended peacefully.

   Gov. Roy Romer on Friday reluctantly recommended a
permit for a dam that would guarantee a water supply for the
growing metropolitan area at the cost of flooding a scenic canyon.
   ``Colorado should build Two Forks, in my judgment, only as a
last resort,'' the governor told a packed news conference at the
state Capitol. The proposed Two Forks dam and reservoir southwest
of Denver would flood Cheesman Canyon, which Romer would like to
see preserved as a state recreational area.
   ``I am challenging the state to find an alternate solution,''
said Romer, who attached attached several conditions to his
recommendation and said he favored building a smaller dam and
reservoir at Estabrook.
   Romer said the Two Forks permit was ``an insurance policy'' for
metropolitan Denver to be used only if other water sources and
conservation proved insufficient, which he said is unlikely.
   ``We do not need to sacrifice that canyon in order to have
water,'' the governor said.
   The dam project was proposed by the Denver Water Board and a
consortium of 42 metropolitan area water providers and
municipalities.
   Proponents have portrayed the project as crucial to metropolitan
growth. They project that the region's population will grow from
its present 1.5 million to 2.5 million by 2035, outstripping its
supply of water.
   Environmentalists and sportsmen say the project would needlessly
wipe out 20 miles of trout fishing and recreation, and would
threaten whooping crane habitat and irrigators along the Platte
River in Nebraska.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must decide whether to issue a
permit, and is accustomed to considering a governor's
recommendation as an important factor.
   At the Corps of Engineers district office in Omaha, Col. Steven
G. West said Romer's statement was ``one of great importance in the
Corps' decision,'' which he expected in late summer or early fall.
   The 615-foot-high dam and 300-foot-deep reservoir would be built
downstream from the confluence of the South Platte River and its
North Fork, about 25 miles southwest of Denver.
   If permits for the project were issued immediately, it could be
ready for use in 1995, providing 98,000 acre-feet of water to the
area, officials have said. One acre-foot is about 325,000 gallons.
   Romer said he would recommend a 25-year shelf life for the
project, meaning it could be built anytime during that period.
   Romer pegged his approval on several conditions, including the
creation of a metropolitan-area water conservation program and a
Metropolitan Water Authority to plan distribution of water supplies.
   He also would require a plan to replace lost wildlife habitat
and recreational facilities if Two Forks is built.
   He also said he would seek a full study of his proposal to build
a smaller dam and reservoir at Estabrook, about 20 miles west of
Two Forks up the North Fork.
   ``Handing the decision over the Legislature to save the canyon
is a cop-out,'' said Carse Pustmueller, Platte River coordinator
for the National Audubon Society.
   ``We're extremely pleased that the governor endorsed the
issuance of permits and the 25-year shelf life for Two Forks,''
said Ed Pokorney of the Denver Water Department.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr said Romer appeared to want to have it
both ways.
   ``Gov. Romer, I think, has been acknowldedged as somebody who is
a great compromiser,'' she said. ``But with his statement today,
I'd say he is a great fence-straddler.''

   El Salvador's leftist rebels said Friday that
the illness of President Jose Napoleon Duarte has worsened the
political and military crisis in their country.
   A rebel spokesman said the insurgents are preparing for possible
major upheaval in El Salvador and have made new contacts with U.S.
congressmen and El Salvador's right-wing Arena Party.
   ``We're more than sure that the situation in El Salvador will
probably change a lot in the coming months,'' Salvador Samayoa told
a news conference.
   ``It will probably become the most complicated and difficult in
Central America. We think it is dangerous if the United States
doesn't have any options.''
   Doctors revealed last week that Duarte, the United States'
closest ally in Central America, has terminal cancer. Duarte, 62,
is in the last year of his five-year term.
   Samayoa said the rebel alliance has had ``some exploratory talks
with the offices of some senators and congressmen aimed at opening
a dialogue ... so that the new (U.S.) administration, be it
Republican or Democratic, will have options and not dead-end
policies like that of the administration that is ending.''
   The Reagan administration has poured huge amounts of aid into El
Salvador during Duarte's presidency, but failed to help him end the
more than 8-year-old civil war or to shore up Duarte's Christian
Democratic Party.
   Samayoa refused to identify the American legislators or give
details of the talks, which he said were ``preliminary'' and
``exploratory.'' He said both Republicans and Democrats were
approached.
   He said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
guerrilla alliance, also has had exploratory talks with Arena,
which badly defeated the Christian Democrats in National Assembly
and municipal elections in March.
   Coup rumors began circulating in El Salvador after the elections.
   Samayoa said Duarte's illness is deepening El Salvador's
political and military crisis.
   ``I don't know if any of the political parties, if the armed
forces, if the government, if the North Americans see a way out of
the crisis,'' he said.
   The spokesman said the rebels have no formal talks scheduled
with U.S. officials.
   He said the Farabundo Marti alliance also hopes to make contact
with the Honduran armed forces in hopes of defusing tensions along
the border. He accused the Hondurans of cooperating closely with
the Salvadoran armed forces in the Salvadorans' battle with the
rebels.

<HEAD>Italian Ship Seized, Ordered To Remove Toxic Waste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian ship was seized Friday and its
captain ordered to remove toxic waste secretly dumped in eastern
Nigeria, the military government announced. It said Italians and
Nigerians were arrested.
   The vessel M.V. Piave was seized as it docked to discharge its
cargo, said Yusufu Maman, press secretary to the chief of general
staff. He did not say how many people were arrested or give further
details, saying only that the defendants would soon be brought to
court.
   Maman said five shipments of waste had been made to Nigeria
since last September.
   The Ministry of External Affairs said Thursday it was recalling
Nigeria's ambassador to Italy in protest and was asking Italy to
recall its ambassador.
   Italy was asked to remove the 2,000 tons of toxic waste, which
reportedly included radioactive material, discovered by newspaper
reporters in Bendel state. Press reports earlier said the waste was
shipped to Nigeria from Italy.
   In Rome, Foreign Ministry officials said they assured Nigeria
the government will work ``in a spirit of maximum collaboration,
including determining responsibility'' in the case, the Italian
news agency AGI reported.
   The ministry said the Italian company purportedly involved was a
private one, and the case should not involve ties between the two
countries, AGI said.
   Maman told reporters his government viewed ``with great concern
the criminal act of ... (shipping) industrial waste into Nigerian
territory.''
   He said the dumping was meant to embarrass Nigeria for leading a
drive to halt developed countries from disposing of nuclear and
other toxic wastes in Africa.
   A report in Caracas, Venezuela, this week by the Greenpeace
environmental organization said increased waste shipments to Africa
mark a growing trend.
   ``In particular, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America have
become the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers from
industrialized countries,'' it said.
   Dumping of toxic waste in Africa has become a growing scandal.
   The government of Guinea announced Thursday in Conakry, the
capital, that Norway's consul general was arrested for complicity
in the secret dumping of 15,000 tons of toxic waste from the United
States.
   Ibrahima Sory Diaby, Guinean secretary of state for security,
said the waste was shipped from Philadelphia, but did not identify
the company producing the waste.
   Newspapers here reported on Tuesday that security agents sealed
off the dump site in Nigeria, about 150 miles southeast of Lagos.
   Reporters from the Guardian newspaper said they discovered the
site, in the Koko port region of the oil-rich delta region, after
being alerted by letters from Nigerian students in Italy.

<HEAD>Archbishop Says Police Manacled His Wife for Traffic Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu said Friday his wife was handcuffed, chained and threatened by
police when she answered a summons for a traffic violation.
   ``Once they had established her identity they handcuffed her to
a door (at a branch traffic office),'' the black prelate said in a
statement from Cape Town. ``When her hand, after a while became
numb, she hit the door. The response of the officers was to chain
her foot to the door.''
   Tutu said when his wife, Leah, complained about not being
allowed to make a phone call, she was told by the traffic officer
that if she complained any further he would kick her in the mouth.
   Tutu said the officer used the Afrikaans word for an animal's
mouth.
   He said she was then taken to the Johannesburg police
headquarters and was handcuffed to the inside of the car door on
the way. She was then allowed to make a phone call and was released
on $100 bail, Tutu's statement said.
   The archbishop, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize and a
leading foe of South Africa's racial segregation system, said the
incident took place when his wife was in Johannesburg.
   ``I take very grave exception to the treatment that was given
and I want to take the matter further,'' Tutu said.
   He was due to leave the country Saturday for a trip to Moscow to
join ecumenical celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in Russia.
   A police spokesman, Capt. J.J. Slabbert, said after checking on
the allegations, ``Mrs. Tutu was arrested by the traffic department
on a warrant. As far as I know nothing went wrong, there were no
scenes, everything was handled in a very nice way.''
   He said she was released on bail and was to appear in court on
June 20. He said according to his investigation she was not
handcuffed.

<TEXT>
   Josep Tarradellas, one of the few
remaining figures of Spain's 1936-39 Second Republic and former
head of the autonomous Catalonian government, died Friday. He was
89.
   Tarradellas was taken to Barcelona's Quiron Clinic Friday
suffering from a chronic lung ailment and died three hours after
admission, according to a medical bulletin.
   His wife, Antonio Macia, was at his side when he died, clinic
officials said.
   Tarradellas was the last major Republican exile to return to
Spain following the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in
November 1975. He came back in 1977.
   Under Spain's 1978 constitution that restored democracy,
Catalonia recovered its autonomous status lost when Franco's forces
emerged victorious in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War.
   King Juan Carlos named Tarradellas head of the Catalonian
autonomous government of Generalitat in 1979.
   When he fled Spain in 1939, Tarradellas vowed never to set foot
in the country until Catalonian autonomy had been restored.
   During the first years of his exile in France, Tarradellas was
arrested at least 14 times by the Nazi Gestapo and the French
police.
   In 1941 Franco requested his extradition from Nazi-occupied
France, but because of a bureaucratic error Tarradellas managed to
cross the French border into Switzerland.
   He was interned in Switzerland and later freed under the
protection of the Mexican Embassy until the end of World War II.
   A son, Josep, was born during Tarradellas' Swiss exile and is
now a professor at the University of Lausanne.
   Tarradellas was elected head of the Generalitat-in-exile by
Catalonian deputies gathered in the Mexican Embassy in Bern after
Generalitat President Lluis Campanys was returned to Spain from his
French exile and executed in 1946.
   Tarradellas and his family moved to St. Martin Le Beau nears
Tours, France, in 1956 and remained there until 1977.
   Upon his triumphal return to Barcelona Oct. 20, 1977,
Tarradellas stood on the balcony of the Generalitat assembly
building and shouted in the Catalonian language ``Ja, soc aqui!''
Now I`m here!
   Tarradellas retired from politics in 1980.
   The funeral is scheduled for Saturday.

<HEAD>Fifty Nations Announce Progress Toward World Regulation Of Waste</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fifty nations announced Friday that
they are nearing an accord on regulating worldwide movement of
hazardous industrial wastes.
   ``We have advanced rapidly, with a willingness seldom seen in
international conferences,'' said Alain Clerc of Switzerland, the
chairman of a conference sponsored by the United Nations
Environment Program.
   ``We are now confident that a convention can be signed next
year. Now we are about to set rules on this scandalous situation of
(waste) exports going to developing countries unable to process
these materials.''
   Clerc heads a 50-nation group of legal and technical experts
formed to prepare a global agreement on the shipment of hazardous
wastes.
   A preliminary list that was drawn up includes 44 types of waste
produced by most world industry, especially those processing
chemicals and minerals.
   The meeting in Caracas included Western industrial countries and
the Soviet Union. The group was formed last year and is to hold
another meeting later this year.
   Meeting delefates failed to agree on a demand by developing
nations that transit countries be allowed to decide on waste
shipments passing over their territory.
   Clerc said the conference agreed, however, that transit nations
should be granted as much information as that provided to countries
receiving the waste.
   Disagreement remained on how long a transit nation could hold up
shipments over its territory.
   Greenpeace International, one of the 14 organizations attending
the meeting, wanted more than emerged from the conference. In a
statement read at the end of the meeting, representatives of the
environmental organization called for a ``global ban'' on moving
hazardous wastes across boundaries.
   According to Greenpeace, the rate of such movements has
accelerated in recent years. It said the main route for shipping
industrial wastes, historically between industrialized Europe and
North America, ``has exploded into less-industrialized regions, in
particular Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America''.
   U.S. delegate Andrew Senn, representing the State Department,
commented, ``(The) Greenpeace stand is fine if you disregard the
economic element. But there is one.''
   Developed nations insisted at the meeting that processing waste
could involve significant transfer of technologies that eventually
would help ecnomically developing countries.

<TEXT>
   About 140 children fled a Baptist boarding
home Friday and scattered in a nearby town after allegations of
child abuse at the home prompted a judge to put them temporarily in
state custody, authorities said.
   ``Prior to the time we arrived at the Bethel campus, the
children had scattered,'' state Welfare Commissioner Thomas
Brittain said of the Bethel Home for Children in the southeast
Misssissippi town of Lucedale.
   ``We were told they were allowed, if not encouraged, to leave
the campus, and some of the children said they were told to run,''
he said.
   The youngsters were found in private homes, restaurants and
walking the streets of Lucedale, said state police and George
County sheriff's deputies.
   By Friday night, about 60 children, mostly teen-agers, had been
bused to quarters at the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield,
Brittain said. He said they were undergoing physical examinations.
   Brittain estimated 80 youths remained missing and that officers
would be searching for them through the weekend.
   It wasn't known exactly how many children had been at the home
because its operator, the Rev. Herman Fountain, was released Friday
after two days in jail for refusing to give authorities with a list
of the children in his care.
   Brittain said Fountain was at the home when Welfare Department
officials arrived. ``We did not encounter any cooperation from him
there. In fact, it was just the opposite,'' Brittain said. He would
not elaborate.
   The welfare Department workers arrived at the home minutes after
Youth Court Judge Robert Oswald of Pascagoula ruled there was
probable cause to suspect physical and mental child abuse at the
independent Baptist institution.
   A hearing in the case is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Monday in
Lucedale.
   Fountain, and several other ministers who flocked from
Louisiana, Georgia and Texas to support him, claim such boarding
homes are protected from any state regulation because of the
constitutional separation of church and state.
   Oswald ruled that the children were being held in detention
according to the state Youth Act. Detention facilities are required
to notify the state of children placed in their custody.
   Fountain was freed Friday without providing the information when
he agreed there would be an orderly transfer of the children to
state custody.
   Brittain said he wasn't sure what action may be taken against
Fountain.
   The court order gives the state 48-hour temporary custody of the
children, not including Saturday and Sunday.
   Brittain said welfare officials would attempt to locate and
return the children to their parents within that time period. But
he expected it might take longer to find all of the children.
   ``We have information that some folks are trying to help the
kids escape out of state,'' he said.
   Based on experience with the Bethesda Home for Girls near
Hattiesburg, where about 100 residents were taken into state
custody in September 1986, Brittain said the children's parents may
be scattered across the nation.
   Oswald's order Friday followed a week-long hearing on a request
for such action by George County authorities. The hearing also
concerned the legal status of a child who ran away from the Bethel
Home For Children.

   George Washington is called the father of
his country, but he is also called uncle and cousin to ancestors of
hundreds of members of a group in Philadelphia to celebrate their
relation to the first president.
   Members of the National Society of Washington Family Descendants
are holding their annual meeting here this weekend because, they
say, Philadelphia is second only to the commonwealth of Virginia in
importance to Washington's destiny.
   ``He was appointed general here, served in the first Continental
Congress, he was appointed chairman of that (Constitutional)
convention and served most of his presidency in this town,'' said
Elmer E. Lybrand, president general of the society.
   Lybrand said he is Washington's
great-great-great-great-great-nephew.
   The society includes many other nephews several generations
removed _ and nieces and cousins _ some 700 people who trace their
bloodline to Washington's parents, Augustine Washington and Mary
Ball.
   ``They have to turn in their papers and prove each and every
generation _ we have a genealogist that checks it out,'' Lybrand
said.
   Proof is usually established through marriage records, wills and
birth and death certificates.
   The society was formed in 1954 and has met every year since.
This year's meeting in Philadelphia drew 37 members Friday and will
continue through the weekend.
   Participants on Friday went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
of the Revolutionary War for a wreath-laying ceremony attended by
the Marquis Jean Pierre deChambrun, the great-great-great-grandson
of French soldier and Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette.
   Lybrand, 64, a real-estate businessman from Pine Bluff, Ark.,
said the society gathers ``just to visit historical places, hear
speeches, and visit with other relatives.''
   ``We promote the history and memory of General George Washington
and we also learn a great deal ourselves too, which gives us
pleasure,'' Lybrand said.
   The society is important to him and the older people who make up
a majority of the group's membership for other reasons.
   ``I think a feeling of your place in history _ you know that you
are continuous _ that someone came before you and someone else came
after _ it becomes more important as you grow older.''

   The discovery of two more bodies in
the Borken coal mine left only one man missing Friday from the
worst mining disaster in West Germany in 26 years, officials
reported.
   Peter-Carl Ruehland, a spokesman for the Preussen Elektra mine
owner, said search teams were working with ``undiminished
intensity'' to find the missing man.
   Officials have said there is no chance he could have survived
the June 1 gas explosion that ripped through the Stolzenbach mine
in Borken, 72 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   The confirmed death count with the recovery of two more bodies
is 50. Six miners were rescued June 4 after spending 65 hours
trapped up to 500 feet underground.
   Klaus-Peter Moeller, chairman of the Hesse state legislature's
interior committee, told reporters Thursday that officials believe
a ``thorough and comprehensive investigation'' of the explosion
would take about a year.
   A local prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine if
an ``open flame'' may have caused the explosion. Mine officials
have said smoking was strictly forbidden inside the mine.

   At least one out of 10 hearts and livers
removed from donors for transplanting never reaches a dying patient
and is discarded, the national network for organ sharing said
Friday.
   ``We'll never have a perfect system. But we're sure working
toward one,'' said Kelle Straw, a spokeswman for the United Network
for Organ Sharing.
   Organs often have gone unused because they could not be matched
immediately with a patient, and because of insufficient numbers of
transplant surgeons and inadequate hospital space, she said.
   The UNOS study included all hearts and livers recovered from
brain-dead patients from Oct. 1, when a national transplant
registry became active, through May 15.
   During the 7{-month period, 905 hearts and 831 livers were
recovered and reported to the network, Ms. Straw said.
   Nearly 85 percent of the hearts, or 769, and almost 90 percent
of the livers, or 744, were transplanted, she said. The rest were
used for research or thrown away.
   The study, done by computer analysis of the registry, was
prompted by last week's report by the University of Rochester Organ
Procurement Program that up to half of all suitable livers and
hearts donated to the New York program were going to waste.
   The unused organs cited by the Rochester group were not removed
from the donors' bodies. The UNOS study cited organs that were
removed in anticipation of transplant surgery. The difference
accounted for at least part of the large disparity in the
percentage of donor organs used, said officials at both groups.
   UNOS, meanwhile, is tracking the number of all hearts and livers
that were donated for transplantation but were never removed. The
data is expected in about a week, said Ms. Straw.
   ``We had potential donors, with the emphasis on potential, that
we couldn't realize because we couldn't find a recipient for the
organ,'' the University of Rochester's Dr. John Ricotta said Friday.
   Ricotta told the American Society of Transplant Surgeons on June
3 in Chicago that a leading obstacle to matching donor organs with
recipients is outdated patient lists, including insufficient
information about patients' blood type and body size.
   Some organs were turned away because transplant teams were too
busy or too tired and hospital space was limited, Ricotta said.
Some hospitals preferred waiting for a local donor, while still
others said they didn't think the organs suited their needs.
   ``There are a lot of reasons why an organ might not be used,''
Ms. Straw explained. ``We're doing the best that we can here, and
we're looking into different areas to make it fair and equitable
and to improve transplantation.''
   Procedures in compiling the patient waiting lists are evolving,
and Ricotta said it's too early to know whether the Rochester
center is making better use of the hearts and livers offered to it.
   The Virginia-based UNOS has a federal contract to run the
national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which links
by computer all transplant centers and organ procurement agencies.
   ``UNOS maintains the national computer system, however, it is
the responsiblity of the transplant center to see that data of its
recipients is accurate and current,'' said Gene Pierce, the
network's executive director

   A 16-year-old boy accused of taking
part in a satanic human sacrifice of a 15-year-old girl, was
convicted of murder Friday and sentenced to life in prison.
   The jury deliberated less than three hours before convicting
Robert McIntyre. The life sentence, imposed by Superior Court Judge
Robert L. James, was mandatory because the state did not seek the
death penalty.
   Krontz called prosecution star witness Terry Belcher a
``demented child'' and a liar. Belcher, 15, was convicted of murder
last month in the Jan. 17 slaying of Theresa Simmons.
   Belcher, who has been sentenced to life in prison, McIntyre and
Malisa Earnest, 17, were charged in the slaying, accused of
strangling her and then performing a crude Satanic ritual over her
body.
   Miss Earnest is to be tried later this month.
   McIntyre's lawyer, Kenneth Krontz, rested his case without
calling a witness and unsuccessfully sought a mistrial.
   Krontz complained the prosecution used allegations of devil
worship to cloud the case and improperly introduced evidence such
as rock music records with alleged references to Satan.
   ``They have taken a murder trial and turned it into a virtual
witch hunt,'' Krontz said.

<HEAD>Cricket Captain Replaced Over Woman In Hotel Room</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new captain was picked for England's
international cricket team on Friday after his predecessor was
ousted for inviting a woman to his hotel room.
   John Emburey, 35, took over the prestigious post from
31-year-old Michael Gatting, who was dismissed Thursday following a
series of sex scandal stories in Britain's tabloid press. Gatting
will remain as batsman on the team.
   Gatting, who is married and the father of two children, denied
allegations in the tabloids that he had taken a woman to his hotel
room for sex last weekend during a five-day game against the West
Indies in England. He said he was suing the newspapers for libel.
   The game's governing body, the Test and County Cricket Board,
announced it believed Gatting's assertion that there was no
``sexual impropriety'' but said he acknowledged inviting the woman
to his room for a drink. In doing this, the board said, Gatting
``behaved irresponsibly''
   Cricket has been played in England for more than 700 years and
an insistence on impeccable behavior on and off the playing field
is a deeply imbedded tradition.
   In addition to the allegations about the captain, the
mass-circulation Sun said two other players had sex with two women
on the lawn outside their hotel at the same game.
   Four players from the team were summoned Friday to Lord's
cricket ground, the Mecca of the sport in London, to take part in
the cricket board's inquiry into the matter.
   After the meeting, the board said the four players had not been
accused of any offense, and their behavior was ``above reproach.''
   Because of the scandal, Gatting stepped down from the team for
the next match, starting June 16, but he is not barred from later
participation.
   Team manager Mickey Stewart defended the decision to fire
Gatting, saying he had ``paid the penalty'' for making himself
vulnerable to the tabloid press.
   Gatting has played for England 59 times and has captained the
team since June 1986.

   A bodybuilder who claimed steroids
drove him insane the night he tortured and killed a hitchhiker two
years ago was sentenced Friday to life in prison, plus 30 years for
armed robbery.
   Horace Williams, 24, claimed the anabolic steroids he had been
taking for more than a year to make his muscles bigger made him
insane when he and another man tied Michael Sean Patterson to a
pole, beat and robbed him and left him to die.
   The 12-member jury rejected his defense and found him guilty.
   ``What you did is beyond description,'' Judge Michael Miller
said as he delivered the sentence. ``This is one of the most brutal
cases in all my years in the business. ... It goes back to the Dark
Ages.''
   Williams will spend at least 25 years in prison for the murder
before beginning his 30-year robbery sentence.

<HEAD>Local Workers To Take Over Red Cross Relief In North</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The local Red Cross will take over relief efforts
for victims of drought in northern Ethiopia after foreign relief
workers were ordered to leave because of rebel insurgencies, the
world Red Cross body said Friday.
   The revived relief program is to provide food aid for at least
500,000 people in Tigre, Eritrea and Gondar provinces, the League
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.
   An estimated 3.2 million people face starvation in Eritrea and
Tigre, where secessionist wars rage.
   Ethiopian authorities have said no major foreign aid worker
presence in the north will be allowed until the rebellions in
Eritrea and Tigre are ended. It accused the all-Swiss International
Committee of the Red Cross of running covert operations in the
region and of supporting the guerrillas.
   The Committee says it is pledged to strict neutrality.
   The Ethiopian Red Cross has agreed to run the operation under
supervision of the League, the Geneva-based worldwide Red Cross
coordinating body, spokeswoman Ann Naef said.
   The League said it will appoint a special coordinator for the
program.
   The accord will replace the International Committee of the Red
Cross in northern Ethiopia. The Committee on Tuesday announced
formal suspension of its aid effort after the government ordered
its delegates and other foreign aid workers out of the region in
April, citing security reasons.
   Ethiopian authorities later pressed the International Committee
to turn over relief supplies locked up in northern Ethiopia.
   The agency is now asking permission from donors to turn over
those supplies to the League ``so aid can resume without further
delay,'' the League said.
   ICRC stocks in Ethiopia include 36,000 tons, mostly grain, worth
$15 million. The agency has 208 vehicles, including 91 trucks.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials blamed leftist rebels for explosions
Friday night that caused temporary power blackouts across central
Peru, including sections of Lima.
   There were conflicting reports about possible sites of the
explosions.
   Police in Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, reported three
explosions and said they were investigating.
   Radio Programas, a news station, quoted officials of the state
utility firm Electro Sur-Medio as saying rebels had sabotaged
transmission equipment near Huancayo, 130 miles east of Lima.
   The station, carrying reports from correspondents in several
cities, said the blackout began at 6:40 p.m. (7:40 p.m. EDT) in
about half of Lima and in a 600-mile zone reaching from the coast
into the central highlands.
   It said power was restored in most areas within a half hour.
   Peru's utility network has been a frequent rebel target, causing
widespread blackouts.
   Thursday night, guerrillas fired three 60-mm mortar rounds at
the U.S. Ambassador Alexander Watson's residence but police said
there were no injuries and there was only minor damage to the roof
of the two-story building.
   Shortly before midnight Thursday rebels threw explosives at four
Lima automobile firms, according to police who reported no injuries.
   Officials blamed Thursday's attacks on guerrillas of the
pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
   Peru has a shortage of auto-truck replacement parts, mainly
because of a lack of foreign currency. Critics have accused the
government of mismanangement and also claim distributors have been
speculating in spare parts.
   Tupac Amaru guerrillas have been active since 1984, but most of
their attacks have been made against targets and during hours when
few casualties would be inflicted.
   The Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement emerged in 1980 and
has waged a bloody campaign of bombings and assassinations to
overthrow the government.

<HEAD>Agreement Halts Use of Herbicide Except For Limited Use In
Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government approved a settlement Friday
under which the last two companies making a weedkiller that can
cause birth defects must halt sales of the product except for use
on certain crops in the Northwest.
   Under the agreement approved by Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Lee M. Thomas, the two manufacturers must cease most
sales and distribution of dinoseb, but can sell existing stocks for
limited purposes.
   The herbicide may be used for the rest of 1988 on dry peas,
lentils, chickpeas and green peas in the states of Washington,
Oregon and Idaho. It may be used in 1988 and 1989 on berries in
Washington and Oregon.
   Dinoseb can cause birth defects and poses a hazard to men's
ability to have children, said EPA spokesman Al Heier.
   He said Thomas decided to allow limited continued use of dinoseb
into 1989 because there is no substitute herbicide to treat weeds
affecting certain plants in the Northwest which ``would have been
rather devastated'' if the weedkiller had been banned.
   Heier said the exceptions were small and would result in
relatively little further use of the chemical under tight
restrictions designed to prevent people from being exposed to it.
   The EPA in October 1986 issued an emergency ban on use of the
weedkiller, but two companies _ Cedar Chemical Corp. and Drexel
Chemical Co., both near Memphis, Tenn. _ went through hearings to
challenge the ban. The agreement approved Friday was reached
between EPA lawyers and those last two manufacturers.
   Several environmental groups had opposed any further sales of
the weedkiller and any provision allowing for the use of existing
supplies.
   Heier estimated that it could cost the EPA $40 million to
purchase all chemical companies' existing supplies of dinoseb, and
another $155 million to dispose of it. Federal law requires EPA to
buy up and dispose of pesticides and herbicides that it bans as an
emergency.

<TEXT>
   City officials and Hispanic leaders on
Friday agreed to work together to ease tensions triggered by the
fatal shooting of a Hispanic man by an off-duty police officer.
   For the first time in three nights, the streets of Perth Amboy
were quiet. On Wednesday and Thursday nights rock-throwing rioters
broke windows, looted and toppled a car in a display reminiscent of
the 1960s.
   Some said the rioting was the work of opportunist troublemakers
using the recent shooting as an excuse to wreak havoc in this
normally quiet industrial community evenly divided between whites
and Hispanics.
   The breakthrough in easing tensions came in a three-hour meeting
of Hispanic community leaders with Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan
Rockoff, Mayor George J. Otlowski and police officials.
   After the meeting Rockoff said that his office will investigate
the shooting and present the case to a county grand jury.
   ``I think the people are satisfied with the response of the
authorities, especially the prosecutor's office,'' said the Rev.
Richard Todd of Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church.
   The church held a funeral Mass for the slain man Thursday night
that was attended by more than 1,000 people.
   The two sides also agreed to form a commission to investigate
bias in the city and to form a community council to hear grievances
against the police, Rockoff said.
   Otlowski decided Friday against a curfew or closing bars and
liquor stores, saying that would only increase tensions. He said
Hispanic leaders should work with members of their community to
restore calm.
   Hispanic leaders responded by calling for the ouster of the
police chief.
   The violence was touched off when off-duty narcotics officer
Allen C. Fuller shot and killed Carmen Coria and critically wounded
Coria's brother, Matteo, outside a bar early Monday.
   Authorities are still investigating the case, but Fuller has
said he fired at the men because he believed his life was
threatened by Carmen Coria, who he said approached him holding a
bottle. Fuller was suspended with pay pending the outcome of the
investigation.
   Rockoff said his office will present its findings to a grand
jury.
   On Wednesday, small bands of people leaving a city council
meeting threw rocks through store windows and burned out trash cans.
   The problems worsened Thursday night when 1,000 marchers at a
funeral for Coria confronted police, who wore riot gear in
anticipation of trouble. Small bands of people also dispersed
through the business district, smashing store windows with
rock-filled plastic bags and toppling at least one car.
   Police arrested 20 people and some officers were hospitalized
after being hit with rocks.
   Hispanic leaders called for a special prosecutor to investigate
the shooting, but Otlowski said the county prosecutor could handle
the case.
   Members of the Hispanic community interviewed Friday said
Coria's shooting brought to a head tensions between the police
department and Hispanics.
   ``This is just the result of years of abuse,'' said Sam Cruz, a
member of the Hispanic Community Ad Hoc Committee and one of
Thursday night's marchers. ``We couldn't control them in the
streets. We don't want no violence.''
   Eddie Rodriguez, a lawyer for the Coria family, called for
police Chief Edward Mullen to step aside, blaming Mullen for
Thursday night's clash.
   ``We have communicated to the mayor the desire of the community
to end all real or perceived police overaction or inaction in many
instances where our people have been mistreated,'' Rodriguez said.
   On a street corner near the riot scene, a Hispanic man
identifying himself only as Manny said police officers frequently
abuse suspects by pushing them roughly, using bad language and in
some cases punching and kicking them.
   ``They should have a little moderation. They should have a
little more justification when they're throwing a guy around.
That's all. Be a little more moderate,'' said Manny.
   The mayor declined to comment further on Fuller, but said the
109-member police force had at least 12 allegations of brutality in
recent years and ``three or four'' officers had been fired or
resigned because of such allegations.
   Otlowski and police officers who spoke on condition they not be
identified said most of the rioters were people commonly in trouble
with the law, taking their frustrations out against the city for
reasons that have nothing to do with racial tension.
   ``Some of these guys last night I see every day,'' said one
officer who asked his name not be used. ``Some of them don't even
live here.''
   In August 1966, an anti-loitering ordinance appeared to set off
four nights of violence after a Hispanic man was arrested.
Hispanics said the ordinance violated their custom of visiting with
friends on the street. They also complained then of rough treatment
by police and of being ignored by the community.

   A 31-year-old Filipino man was
fined $155 after his wife accused him of infecting her with a
venereal disease contracted during a visit to a prostitute, a
newspaper said today.
   The Filipino, whose name was withheld by a Sandakan court,
pleaded guilty to infecting his wife and was given a choice between
paying the fine or spending five months in jail, the New Straits
Times reported.
   In asking for leniency, the husband said he had already spent
$1,554 on medical treatment.
   Sandakan is 1,030 miles east of here on Borneo island.

<HEAD>Senate Sends Death Penalty for Drug Dealers Measure to House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato says he's going to try to
overcome the opposition of a House committee and win passage this
year of legislation that would impose the death penalty on
convicted drug dealers who kill.
   The Senate passed the election-year bill Friday, voting 65-29
for the measure and ignoring critics' pleas that the measure would
be immoral, ineffective and do little but pander to the public's
frustration with illegal drugs.
   ``It's society's way of saying we've had enough,'' said D'Amato,
R-N.Y., who sponsored the legislation.
   The liberal leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, which will
consider the legislation, have a history of quashing death penalty
bills.
   But bills can be pried out of committees if a majority of House
members sign a petition requesting that the measure be brought to
the floor. D'Amato conceded that because of the opposition of
Judiciary Committee leaders, the seldom-used discharge petition
procedure would probably be necessary.
   He said if that did not work, he would attach the provision to
other drug legislation to be considered later this year. If the
legislation fails to receive House approval by the time the new
Congress begins in January, lawmakers would have to begin the
process anew.
   There was no need for prodding in the Senate, where a majority
of lawmakers from both parties _ 27 Democrats and 38 Republicans _
supported the legislation. D'Amato acknowledged to reporters later
that the fact this is an election year ``may be some kind of an
influence, and I'm not going to guess how much.''
   Opponents tried unsuccessfully to weaken the bill with several
amendments. One would have substituted life imprisonment for the
measure's death penalty. Another would have limited its
applicability to drug dealers who kill law enforcement officers.
   Yet another, sponsored by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., would have
mandated that executions occur in public and be televised.
   ``It's a repulsive amendment to a repulsive proposal,''
Hatfield, who opposed the legislation, said of his amendment
shortly before it was rejected on a voice vote.
   The legislation allows the death penalty to be imposed on people
who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring and are
then separately found guilty of killing law enforcement officers or
private citizens. In addition, any person who commits a felony
violation of federal drug laws who then kills an officer could face
capital punishment.
   Morton H. Halperin, director of the American Civil Liberties
Union's Washington office, called the bill ``an election year
campaign platform and not a piece of serious legislation.''
   D'Amato told reporters he believed the legislation would apply
to ``hundreds and hundreds of potential cases.''
   The senator's office, citing FBI statistics, said 57 law
enforcement officers were killed between 1977 and 1986 pursuing
suspects involved in drug cases. Twenty-three of those officers
died in 1986 alone.
   Three years ago, federal legislation was enacted establishing
the death penalty for military personnel convicted of espionage
during peacetime. Under federal law, the death penalty can also be
imposed for airplane hijacking. No one has yet been executed under
the laws.
   Thirty-seven states have death penalty laws. Since 1976, when
the Supreme Court resumed permitting executions after a four-year
lull, 99 people _ all convicted murderers _ have been put to death
in the United States.
   The Senate passed legislation in 1984 establishing the death
penalty for attempts to kill the president and for murders
committed on federal property, but the House never approved the
bill.

   Dry weather prevailed across much of the nation Friday as a
large high pressure system responsible for record low temperatures
pushed moisture that had been over the eastern half of the nation
out to sea.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued along the southern Atlantic
Coast, generating a tornado that ripped off the roofs of two houses
in Orange Park in north Florida.
   A wind gust to 39 mph and small hail were reported at
Jacksonville, Fla., and pea-size hail fell at Fernandina Beach, Fla.
   Thunderstorms developed Friday afternoon in the central and
southern Rockies and in the Del Rio, Texas, area.
   Showers continued in parts of Washington state, with a half-inch
of rain at Bellingham and around a quarter-inch at Tacoma and
Seattle in the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Scattered frost and freezing temperatures were expected Saturday
morning in some of the valleys of the northern and central
Appalachians.
   Afternoon temperatures were in the 60s and 70s over a large part
of the nation. Readings were only in the lower 60s along the
Carolina coast because of low clouds and occasional rain.
   The northern and central Appalachians and the Washington and
Oregon coast registered some 50s while North Dakota and eastern
Montana had readings well into the 90s. Williston, N.D., reached
102 degrees, tying a record for the date.
   Record low temperatures for the date included Allentown, Pa.,
43; Asheville, N.C., 44; Beckley, W.Va., 38; Birmingham, Ala., 50;
Calico Rock, Ark., 42; Columbus, Ohio, 41; Elkins, W.Va. 33;

Rochester, N.Y., 37; Syracuse, N.Y. 37; Topeka, Kan., 43; Wilkes
Barre-Scranton, Pa. 37; and Wilmington, Del., 46.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Pullman, Wash., and Mullan, Idaho, to 101 degrees at
Miles City, Mont. The nation's low Friday morning was 27 degrees at
Franklinville, N.Y.
   Saturday's forecast called for thunderstorms scattered over the
Rocky Mountain states and southwest Texas, showers over parts of
Washington and Oregon, and scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms in central and southern Florida.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s across most of
the nation, except 60s in parts of the Appalachians, along the New
England coast, in the Pacific Northwest and in northwest Montana;
in the 90s in northwest Minnesota and the western Plains; near 100
degrees in eastern Montana and 105 degrees in the Big Bend area of
southwest Texas; and 90s to near 105 degrees in the desert
Southwest.

   AIDS education is paying off, with more than
two-thirds of adults recently surveyed saying children with AIDS
should be allowed to attend school with other youngsters, the
American Medical Association said today.
   In addition, 80 percent of 1,500 adults surveyed in February
said they knew ``a lot'' about AIDS, compared with only 69 percent
who said they knew ``a lot'' or ``a fair amount'' in a similar
survey last year.
   ``It is gratifying to see that the AIDS education efforts of the
past year have helped,'' said Dr. James H. Sammons, AMA executive
vice president, in a statement accompanying results of the survey.
   ``Although we are encouraged by the progress, the AMA will
continue to work toward having 100 percent of the public confident
in their knowledge about AIDS,'' he added in the statement in the
organization's weekly newspaper, American Medical News.
   The February survey found that 68 percent of adults said
children with AIDS should be allowed to attend regular class; 18
percent said they should not; and 14 percent were unsure.

   Sex for sale at Harrods? Prince Charles's polo
manager in a massage parlor? Sex frolics in a parliamentary shower
room? England's cricket captain fired for having female company in
his hotel room?
   Recent weeks have yielded an unusually rich harvest of lurid
tales for London's anything-goes tabloid newspapers. With the
firing of captain Michael Gatting on Thursday, it seems that not
even the genteel world of cricket is being spared.
   Gatting, 31, was summoned by the team selectors to answer
newspaper allegations that two of his players had sex on a lawn
outside their hotel Sunday night, and that he took a woman to his
room for sex.
   The alleged offense, as far as the selectors were concerned, was
that it happened while a five-day game, or test, was in progress
against the West Indies in Nottinghamshire.

   The House ethics committee announced Friday it
will conduct an official inquiry into accusations that Seaker Jim
Wright violated House conflict-of-interest rules in his financial
dealings.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the panel _ six
Democrats and six Republicans _ unanimously approved ``a
preliminary inquiry in the matter of Speaker James Wright.''
   ``The speaker of the House has been notified and has pledged his
full cooperation,'' he said.

   The Senate on Friday approved an election-year
bill that would allow the death penalty for drug dealers convicted
of murder, accepting arguments that ``society has a right to say we
are outraged.''
   The measure passed on a 65-29 vote, attracting a majority of
lawmakers from both parties: 27 Democrats and 38 Republicans.
   It now goes to the House, where it will be handled by a
Judiciary Committee that has been hostile to capital punishment
legislation in the past.

   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim
Burnley called Friday for drug tests for up to 5 million drivers of
interstate trucks, passenger buses and vehicles carrying hazardous
materials.
   ``We must act to identify those commercial drivers who abuse
drugs and get them off the roads. When one drugged truck or bus
driver goes out on the road, he not only puts the lives of many
people in danger, he gives the entire work force a bad
reputation,'' Burnley said.
   His announcement at a news conference here follows similar
proposals unveiled in March for the aviation industry and in May
for railroads.

Korea for reunification talks. Radicals hurled rocks and firebombs,
trying to fight their way through.
   About 60,000 riot police blanketed the South Korean capital and
roads leading north to disperse students trying to reach the border
30 miles away. Fierce street clashes erupted at Yonsei University
as about 5,000 screaming students tried to fight their way out.
   An estimated 8,000 troopers surrounding the school fired
hundreds of tear gas bombs into the charging students. Both sides

   Following the collapse of the Nicaraguan peace
talks, a Contra leader on Friday called for a resumption of U.S.
military aid to the rebels, saying the alternative could be
Sandinista annihilation of his forces.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., urged the White House to
propose an aid package for the Contras that matches the amount of
military assistance he said the Soviet Union provided to the
Sandinista government during the first three months of this year.
He put the amount at $105 million.
   The Contra leader, Adolfo Calero, indicated he felt that was a
reasonable amount. The rebels have received no military aid since
Feb. 29. President Reagan's last military aid request for the
Contras was rejected by the House on Feb. 3.

   Despite the biggest increase in food costs
since January, wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.5 percent in May,
the government said Friday, supporting beliefs that inflation is
accelerating but not dangerously.
   The rise in the Labor Department's producer price index for
finished goods in May was halfway between a 0.4 percent increase in
April and a 0.6 percent jump in March.
   But if it continued for 12 months, the annual rate of inflation
would amount to 5.8 percent, nearly triple the 2 percentage points
it has risen in the past year.

   Heavy smokers tend to snack more than
non-smokers, and men who smoke heavily are more likely to be
overweight, says a government study that seems to run counter to
the perception that tobacco helps hold weight down.
   While much medical and media attention in recent years has
focused on the dangers of smoking itself, the new report observes
that people who smoke also tend to have other bad health habits.
   Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to sleep less than six
hours daily, to skip breakfast, to be physically inactive and to be
heavier drinkers, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics.

   space war by simulating combat conditions thousands of miles up.
   Such projects are bolstering local economies hit hard by oil and
agricultural slumps.
   ``We have in (Colorado) over 1,000 high-tech companies that
together gross more than $10 billion a year and employ tens of
thousands of people,'' said U.S. Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo.
   A new plant in Colorado Springs will build the next generation
of super computers, Cray Research Inc. announced recently.
Production of the Cray-3, which could become the brain of Star
Wars, will employ up to 1,000 people in the 1990s.
   The Air Force Space Technology Center's Weapons Laboratory in
Albuquerque currently lays claim to the world's fastest computer,
Cray-2 No. 11, which is used to simulate the effects of nuclear
explosions as well as solve SDI problems.
   New Mexico has more Crays than the rest of the country combined,
scattered among Los Alamos, Sandia, the Weapons Lab and
``underground places nobody knows,'' according to one Air Force
computer expert.
   The enthusiastic science jocks flocking to Oppenheimer's Los
Alamos National Laboratory consider Star Wars their generation's
version of the Manhattan Project.
   Stan Schriber works on a project its creators hope will produce
a space-based machine capable not only of destroying enemy
missiles, but also of detecting decoys.
   He points to the snow-covered Sangre de Cristo range on the
horizon and says his task is to create a beam capable of picking a
lift ticket off a skier 50 miles away. He also enthuses about new
frontiers in physics that promise to yield medical wonders.
   ``Star Wars, all this work, is going to impact a lot of other
things,'' Schriber said. ``This is a lot like the space program was
in the '60s. Technology is really advancing.''
   The I-25 corridor has evolved through quirks of fate, a little
elaborate planning and the capricious genius of a few men.
   The town of Cheyenne and the cavalry outpost that would become
F.E. Warren AFB, headquarters for the nation's MX force, sprang
from the meeting on July 4, 1867, of a Union Pacific Railroad
official, a representative of President Andrew Johnson and an Army
general beside Crow Creek in Wyoming Territory.
   Colorado Springs was founded in 1871 by Gen. William Jackson
Palmer, the first of a long line of real estate speculators who
built their fortunes off the town's newcomers.
   Always, the land has drawn the people. Fanning out from
Challenger Point are reminders of civilization's march through the
ages, as well as harbingers of things yet to come.
   East of I-25, buried under empty grasslands, are a few precious
flint tools left behind by Folsom man in the last ice age.
   In the West, the abandoned ruins of vanished Anasazi people
erode with the seasons.
   Deep inside Cheyenne Mountain, to the northeast, hundreds of
disciplined warriors scan TV screens for hints of impending
annihilation.
   To the southwest, alone in the silent desert, enormous antennas
listen for alien voices from space.
   Since migrating man discovered the easiest path alongside the
mountains, the I-25 corridor has attracted adventurers searching
for wealth, power, security and a better life.
   ``Most of this technology has come to New Mexico because of
those wide open spots along the road,'' said Jim Mitchell of Sandia
Labs. ``It's not bunched up like Boston. It's the same reason
Goddard came to Roswell to start rocket tests. It's the same reason
Oppenheimer came _ there are not a lot of people around.''
   But like small voices in a wilderness, some residents wonder if
the buildup will be long-term economic panacea or fleeting bonanza.
Some people who live beside I-25, especially near any military
installation euphemistically described as a ``Class A Resource,''
meaning an enemy's nuclear target, adamantly oppose the military
might around them.
   ``I think the military buildup people and the pacifists share
one same view _ that the world is becoming a very dangerous
place,'' said Sydney Spiegel, a Cheyenne, Wyo., high school teacher
and MX opponent. ``Where we part company is on how we're going to
make it safer. They say more, we say less.''
   These voices, however, are few compared to the thousands who
work at plants and offices along I-25 in three states. Some are
transplanted Californians from an overcrowded Silicon Valley and a
polluted, grid-locked Los Angeles. Others are bailing out of the
high-priced, overbuilt New England-to-Virginia chute.
   ``I was tired of terminal sophistication,'' said H. Pike Oliver,
executive vice president of Aries Properties, who moved to Colorado
Springs from southern California two years ago.
   ``Here I'm bettering my family's quality of life and it only
takes me 15 minutes to get to an office where I can create a
development from a 33-square-mile blank sheet of paper,'' said
Oliver, whose company plans a residential-office complex on 24,485
acres just east of the city.
   ``This place is on the verge of taking off. I saw it happen in
Tucson, Orlando, Austin and Raleigh-Durham. I'm ready for it.''
   For dreamers, there's still land left beside The Nuclear Highway.

   Guided by the longest list of computer
instructions ever written, it would destroy Soviet missiles with
laser beams and projectiles as small as a coffee can.
   But five years after President Reagan called for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, popularly called ``Star Wars,'' some scientists
still challenge it as a fantastical system unlikely to do the job.
   The problems are more complex than those conquered in putting an
astronaut on the moon, they say, because SDI must deal with future
strategies of an opponent determined to foil it.
   As a result, ``it's difficult to say if we can build a system
that will work well against the offense which might exist 10 or 15
years from now,'' said Kumar Patel of AT&T Bell Laboratories.
   Other experts inside and outside the Pentagon express confidence
the problems can be overcome, providing a system effective enough
to discourage the Soviets from attacking.
   Dozens of SDI projects are on drawing boards and in test
laboratories up and down a single stretch of interstate that links
New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. The scientists and military
experts working on Star Wars along I-25, America's Nuclear Highway,
are enthusiastic. They say this is their generation's Manhattan
Project _ this generation's chance to make a startling change in
the nation's defense.
   The best-known candidates for SDI weapons are ``directed
energy'' devices such as the laser, which would burn a foot-wide
hole in a missile in less than few seconds.
   But current devices would need so much more development to
become SDI weapons that it might take eight years or more before
scientists know if they would be feasible, said Harvard physicist
Nicolaas Bloembergen, co-chairman of a recent study of such weapons
for the American Physical Society.
   The weapons would have to be much more powerful than current
versions, he said, and in building them bigger ``new fundamental
problems can crop up,'' he said.
   One problem involves the fact that fluctuations in the
atmosphere can throw a laser beam out of focus. Researchers can
overcome that with low-power beams, Bloembergen said, but nobody
has shown such an ability with beams as strong as SDI would need.
   ``Fundamentally, we don't know how to take care of large
distortions,'' and it is difficult to predict when that problem may
be solved, said AT&T's Patel, who co-chaired the physical society
study with Bloembergen.
   But Gregory Canavan, assistant physics division leader at Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, believes it will take
only a few years to show lasers can work as part of the SDI system.
   ``I can't tell you feasibility is established. What I can tell
you is there don't appear to be any established barriers to
demonstrating feasibility,'' Canavan said.
   SDI lasers would be teamed with kinetic energy weapons, which
would fire projectiles to create high-speed collisions.
   Kinetic weapons are feasible in principle, but ``what you don't
know is whether you can build them small enough (to launch) and
cheap enough, and whether it will work well enough to make it an
interesting system,'' said John Pike, associate director for space
policy of the Federation of American Scientists.
   Projectiles launched from space would need to be about the size
of a coffee can, while those shot from Earth would be as big as a
6-foot human. But the projectiles tested so far have been about as
big as a Volkswagen, Pike said.
   They also cost far more than is feasible and don't have the
maneuverability needed for an effective weapon, he said.
   Col. Raymond Ross, director of the Kinetic Energy Office at the
Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, said current
projectiles are only for demonstrating the technology. Smaller ones
will be available for actual weapons design, he said.
   Smaller projectiles save money by using smaller rockets to
launch them, he said. Nobody knows what the cost of the actual
weapons would be because the figure depends on results of current
testing, he said.
   As for manueverability against Soviet missiles, ``we are
proceeding on the correct path to accomplish that,'' Ross said.
   SDI would also include software and instructions to tell
computers how to spot and track targets, coordinate the firing of
weapons, and do other tasks.
   Large software packages must be tested to see how well they
work. ``The fundamental problem with the SDI is you can't really do
that kind of full-scale operational testing without having a
nuclear war,'' said software researcher David Redell of Digital
Equipment Corp.
   Capt. John Donegan, program manager for the planned first phase
of SDI, replied that military systems are now tested with a
combination of physical and computer-generated targets. A similar
approach could effectively test early SDI software and probably the
versions to follow, he said.

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, LaserLogo
   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Up and down Interstate 25 an economic boom is
underway, not because of gold or oil but because of a military and
technology explosion. It has brought billions of dollars to towns
big and small in New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. And even if
``Star Wars'' funding is cut, businessmen, scientists and
economists say the laboratories are here to stay, the science still
to be pursued. The second story in a four-part series, ``America's

   With an office here and one in Denver,
Tony Montoya's small high-tech firm designs electronic circuit
boards and provides scientific expertise for local customers.
   Business is booming, you might say, because along America's
Nuclear Highway, Interstate 25, the local customers are not your
average computer or stereo shops.
   Montoya's customers create nuclear weapons.
   ``There have been some real odd shapes _ real compact,'' Montoya
said with a chuckle. ``We don't always know what they do with our
boards. But we have an idea.''
   The son of a New Mexico rancher has seen his enterprise, L&M
Technologies, triple its number of employees in three years, and
sales have risen four-fold to $3.6 million in 1987.
   L&M, which also designs components for satellites and the space
shuttle, is just one small part of the economic boom along I-25,
which links wide open rangeland around from Las Cruces, N.M., to
the Bighorn Mountains near Buffalo, Wyo.
   This decade, between the Reagan administration's military
buildup and the promise of ``Star Wars,'' known formally as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, billions of dollars have poured into
the corridor that connects Albuquerque and Denver, creating rapid
growth and some economic shelter from hard times in oil and farming.
   ``Our work is speckled all the way through _ all the way up and
down I-25,'' Montoya said. ``I'd rather be here than anywhere
else.''
   Last year, about $30 of every $1,000 the United States spent on
defense and energy was spent along I-25 _ more than $8.4 billion in
all. Per capita military spending in New Mexico is twice the
national average, and Colorado's per capita figure is one-third
higher. Wyoming, its role in I-25's military might largely confined
to the care and keeping of 200 missiles, receives less.
   In New Mexico, the largest employers are Los Alamos National
Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories and Kirtland Air Force
Base _ all involved in nuclear weapons and Star Wars.
   As military appropriations rise and fall in Washington, so, too,
does the economy of this state.
   ``The federal government is the major industry in New Mexico. It
accounts for 15 percent of all jobs in the state,'' said Brian
McDonald, director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research
at the University of New Mexico.
   ``Since 1976, we've had explosive growth,'' McDonald said.
Federal spending in the state, adjusted for inflation, has
increased 50 percent, he said.
   Spending has grown steadily over the decade, officials said,
because much of the SDI groundwork was done here _ even before
there was an SDI.
   The money tap ``didn't get turned on when the president
(introduced Star Wars) in 1983. There was $1 billion being spent
already on research,'' said Sidney Singer, associate director for
defense research and applications at Los Alamos.
   And entrepreneurs like Montoya, who did electronics work at
White Sands Missile Range near Las Cruces, N.M., before striking
out on his own, eagerly took advantage of all the government-funded
research and development.
   Sandia National Labs, where scientists design the devices to arm
nuclear bombs and conduct research into a host of weapons and
energy projects, spent $575 million in the ``commercial community''
in the last fiscal year, according to Jon Bedingfield, director of
procurement.
   Some $280 million of that came to the Albuquerque area, a
portion to Montoya's company.
   To help spread the greenbacks in the state, New Mexico
established research groups to aid ``technology transfer'' from
government to private business and set up a computer network that
links research projects all over the state.
   The idea was ``using the national labs for economic
development,'' said Martha Buddecke, one of the founders of
Technet, which enables a researcher at Las Cruces to use
supercomputers at Los Alamos hundreds of miles away.
   The spending spigot has not enriched every town and business
along I-25.
   Some cuts have been made in Star Wars programs, resulting in
more modest timetables, even layoffs. Other weapons research, of
course, continues regardless of decisions on SDI, merely the latest
project to capture the research spotlight.
   But government largesse on SDI and other defense projects helps
soften the blow to economies such as Colorado's, where the plunge
in petroleum and farm prices has been sorely felt.
   ``Our economy is still somewhat flat, but we feel we've bottomed
out on the no-growth of the past few years,'' said Curt Wiedeman,
assistant director of state planning and budgeting.
   Unlike New Mexico, where federal megalabs drive the economic
engine, Colorado relies heavily on civilian manufacturing and
business as well as mining and oil.
   But military installations in Denver and Colorado Springs, as
well as a growing high-tech alley paralleling I-25 along the Front
Range, play an increasingly important role in the state's overall
economy.
   Just as oil and farm prices began to drop, SDI spending kicked
in, keeping the state economy healthier than it might have been.

   A recent Census Bureau analysis shows federal spending in
Colorado has grown 64 percent since President Reagan took office.
Most of that increase has been military _ in Colorado, it jumped
from about $2 billion in 1981 to $4.3 billion last year.
   Colorado Springs, a prime beneficiary, is one of the fastest
growing metropolitan areas in the country. Due to a half-dozen
military installations and more than 100 aerospace, computer and
scientific research firms, the city has increased its population to
more than 350,000 people from 236,000 in 1970 and has been adding
about 6,000 jobs a year.
   ``When we saw we were running out of telephone numbers in the
303 code area, we decided to put the new area code, 719, in
southern Colorado,'' said Abel Chavez of Mountain Bell
Telephone.``We see a lot of things happening there.''
   The military is building a $100 million SDI complex in Colorado
Springs that will eventually house $1 billion worth of computer
wizardry to test Star Wars. The National Test Facility at Falcon
Air Force Station, also home to the Consolidated Space Operations
Center, is expected to employ up to 2,000 people by the end of 1992.
   In all, more than $2 billion in SDI contracts have been
earmarked for I-25's three states, estimates the Federation of
American Scientists, based in Washington, D.C.
   The federation, gathering information from a variety of sources,
including the Strategic Defense Initiative Office and Department of
Defense publications, has compiled a computerized data bank on SDI
contracts. It says its figures are current to March 1.
   By far the region's biggest recipient of Star Wars dollars is
New Mexico, said federation spokesman David Bourns. The federation
estimates contracts worth $1.59 billion have been awarded within
the state since SDI research and development began, with $773
million already spent.
   In Colorado, the federation said contracts totaling $751 million
have been assigned, with $191.8 million of that spent.
   Wyoming's SDI work, by comparison, is miniscule. Just $1 million
in contracts have been assigned there, with $34,500 spent so far on
research at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.
   In terms of military dollars coming into Wyoming, which has been
seriously crippled by energy and agriculture slumps and a steady
loss of population, F.E. Warren Air Force Base accounts for less
than 2.4 percent of state revenue.
   The anticipated installation of 100 MX missiles around Cheyenne,
along with resultant increases in personnel, construction and
services, was expected to produce a windfall for the region. When
Reagan's request was cut in half and just 50 MXs were scheduled,
the four-year project produced only $1.38 million in tax benefits.
   In addition, ``a lot of dollars that come into that base are
never making it off base,'' said Dick O'Gara, director of the
Center for Economic and Business Data in Cheyenne. ``(It) has its
own medical facilities, food, housing and recreation facilities.''
   For New Mexico, the driving force in its economy was created
quite by accident. The laboratory at Los Alamos was established by
J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, as his base for
the Manhattan Project.
   It was an area Oppenheimer knew from summer vacations to the
mountains near Santa Fe. And when he needed a secluded spot for
secret research, Oppenheimer came to New Mexico. The lab at Los
Alamos grew and now has nearly 9,000 employees _ the largest single
payroll in the state.
   About 160 miles away, the spot where the atomic bomb was tested
became White Sands Missile Range, where most conventional weapons,
missiles and SDI gizmos come to be tried out. White Sands has more
than 6,000 employees and, like the other labs, has Star Wars
construction under way.
   Sandia Labs found a home near Los Alamos and the air force base
used to service the area.
   Albuquerque, near both Los Alamos and Sandia, was chosen for the
Air Force Weapons Lab, which has a $342 million annual budget (60
percent of it for Star Wars), 1,000 employees and a mission to
explore ``any kind of energy source that would ruin the other guy's
day,'' according to spokesman Rich Garcia.
   And the pattern continues today. Six years ago, when the Air
Force established a Space Technology Center, it chose Albuquerque.
Add $197 million each year.
   ``This is where Sandia and Los Alamos were, and they do the
nuclear work. So it made sense for us to be located with them,''
said Garcia.
   Montoya would say much the same.
   ``Everything starts from that _ the first atomic bomb. The
high-tech movement here started way back in those early times. And
the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy grew into
this area,'' he said.
   About 90 percent of L&M's business is tied to Defense Department
money.
   ``We're bursting at the seams, and we're attempting to expand,''
he said.
   Those in business here could see SDI on the horizon and gear up
for the boom, he said. ``Certain tests were accomplished in the
late '60s that I was involved in _ like the first airborne laser
tests. I could see it coming.''

   Here are some of the major Strategic Defense Initiative projects
underway along Interstate 25, America's nuclear highway.

<HEAD>NPB _ Neutral Particle Beam</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Different from traditional laser beams, a neutral particle beam
has one big advantage for SDI use, scientists say: It can penetrate
objects and discriminate between real missiles and decoys.
   Theoretically, it can also destroy objects as fast as 10 per
second in space.
   The initial concept actually came from the Soviets in the 1970s.
It was picked up at Los Alamos National Laboratory and carried much
further.
   ``We don't think the opposition has anything like this,'' said
Stan Schriber, project director. ``This technology wasn't
understood theoretically until two years ago. It had been a mystery
in the scientific community for 10 years.''
   In a neutral particle beam, a stream of charged hydrogen
particles receives an added electron then is accelerated to great
speeds. Before release, the extra electron is stripped out,
creating a neutral beam, one unaffected by magnetic fields.
   A Ground Test Facility for an NPB is under construction outside
Schriber's office. It will be a prototype for a weapons system.
   ``If the funding stays, this could be deployed by the year
2000,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BEAR _ Beam Experiment Aboard a Rocket</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BEAR, a small neutral particle beam machine on a rocket, will be
here next year.
   Already under contruction at Los Alamos, the 44-inch-diameter
machine will be loaded onto an Aries rocket, launched from the
White Sands Missile Range on a sub-orbital flight and fired.
   ``The primary goal is to take one of these complicated things
into space _ it's never been done before,'' said Kenneth McKenna,
deputy project manager. ``We have to know we can operate in space.''
   The SDI command has accelerated BEAR's timetable so decisions
can be made on the most promising technologies, McKenna said. His
team is already working nights and weekends.
   While Schriber works to make a bigger NPB machine, to prove it
can be made powerful enough to destroy missiles, McKenna tries to
make it smaller _ to prove it can work in space. The technologies
would later be merged.
   ``I am very confident it will work when we get it up there,'' he
said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PHASER _ Phased Array Experiment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At the Air Force Weapons Lab, researchers have combined laser
beams in a phased array. And instead of getting the sum of the
power of the individual lasers, they get much more.
   What they envision is a set of seven lasers in space that, when
combined, give the power of 49 lasers.
   ``We can make a small laser act as a big one and shoot down
missiles,'' said Air Force Lt. Dave Russell, electro-optics
engineer. ``You can't manufacture something great big and put it in
space. But you can put up a whole bunch of little ones.''
   In just four years of SDI work, the Air Force has combined three
lasers, produced the power of nine, and moved the beam from target
to target.
   ``We've got the basic idea in hand,'' Russell said. ``It's just
a matter of time before someone makes a decision to deploy or not.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PBFA II _ Particle Beam Fusion Accelerator II</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PBFA II is a merry-go-round-like contraption 108 feet wide with
36 arms arranged around a circular center. The Sandia National
Laboratories machine is designed to fire an ion beam at a target
pellet and ignite a nuclear fusion _ but it has yet to be done.
   By creating small nuclear explosions in the laboratory,
scientists say they'll be on the road to making fusion energy
available for commercial use and being able to test nuclear weapons
and materials in the laboratory instead of with underground
explosions.
   Fusion, combining two atoms, is the power of nuclear warheads.
Fission, splitting an atom, is the power of old atomic weapons and
of today's nuclear power plants. Fusion, if ever harnessed in the
laboratory, could yield almost limitless energy without as much
hazardous waste.
   At PBFA II, controllers sit in a small room fashioned after a
ship's bridge, with operators at screens labeled ``Commander
Spock,'' ``Capt. James Kirk,'' and ``Lt. Sulu.''
   ``We get closer to fusion every day,'' said senior technical
aide Guy Donovan.
   At full power, PBFA II's output would be 50 times the world's
existing electrical generating capacity for the extremely short
time it would be fired, billionths of a second.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GBFEL _ Ground-Based Free Electron Laser</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eighty acres of New Mexico desert have been cleared of sage and
brush for construction of a free electron laser, a machine capable
of firing a beam at the speed of light into space. Once up there,
the beam would be bounced off orbiting mirrors to intercept Soviet
missiles within minutes of launch.
   ``The technology is available today. The problem is getting it
to this level and this size,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Lloyd Young,
the assistant project manager.
   By 1995, the military hopes to conduct an experiment in space
with the GBFEL, but this year's funds were cut and work has been
delayed.
   Two kinds of free electron lasers are competing _ one at Los
Alamos, tied in with Boeing, and one at Los Alamos' sister
laboratory, Lawrence Livermore in California, which is working with
TRW.
   A choice will be made next year, Young said, on which beam to go
with.

<HEAD>R2P2 _ Rapid Retargeting Precision Pointing Simulator</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Already in operation at the Martin Marietta Astronautics Group
facility at Denver, R2P2 is a ground-based simulator that measures
how fast a space-based laser could retarget an object.
   The SDI contract, worth $20.9 million, specifies Martin Marietta
operate R2P2 for all ongoing Star Wars experiments for the next
three years.
   President Reagan toured the R2P2 simulator laboatory last
November.
   ``R2P2 is designed to duplicate the extreme precision needed to
track objects in space, a vibration-free environment,'' said
program manager Robert Sampsell. ``It is built on the most
seismically stable base on the North American continent, a rock
formation 28 miles long, 8 miles deep and a half-mile wide.''

<TEXT>
   When the Red Scare, the Cold War and the
arms race were on in the 1950s, residents here enthusiastically
embraced the idea of a defense program coming to a rocky expanse
east of the Flatiron Mountains.
   It was there, between Golden and Boulder, that the government
built a nuclear weapons plant, and residents saw security and
opportunity in the news, not danger.
   It's a different story now.
   The Rocky Flats plant, which makes weapons components from
plutonium, has become the target of safety and environmental
concerns over the years. There have been fires, lawsuit settlements
and studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium contamination.
   Suburbs have stretched out toward plant gates over the years,
bringing the population closer to potential danger.
   And even though the plant has grown to a $500 million-a-year
operation affecting 20,000 jobs, some residents wish the facility,
once so warmly welcomed, would just go away.
   ``The people who live near and who work inside these facilities
have the right to be free of fear,'' said U.S. Rep. David Skaggs, a
Democrat whose district includes Rocky Flats.
   Rocky Flats is an example of the dilemma faced along America's
Nuclear Highway, Interstate 25. With the work on nuclear weapons
and even ``Star Wars' research come not only jobs and growth, but
also danger and health hazards.
   The plant spawned its own boom. A planned community, Broomfield,
sprouted in nearby fields. Superhighways like I-25 and U.S. 36 _
the Denver-Boulder Turnpike _ were under construction nearby, and
the plant's responsibilities grew along with the nation's nuclear
arsenal.
   Even accidents like a 1957 fire that blew through more than 600
air purifying filters to release a plutonium-laced cloud of smoke
did not cause much concern, only worry that the plant's work might
be interrupted.
   A 1969 fire did millions of dollars in damage, but again the
reports stressed the potential production delay. A fireman exposed
to plutonium was interviewed several days after the blaze and was
reported doing fine.
   But concern about plant safety did grow, and plant officials
began regular briefings with municipal and government officials.
They also upgraded the plant to keep plutonium, which ignites when
exposed to air, in an inert atmosphere to prevent fire.
   A series of studies by Carl Johnson, then director of the
Jefferson County Health Department, showed plutonium contamination
on land and water downwind from Rocky Flats, a higher incidence of
cancer than average in the region and serious problems with
contaminated land and water from the residue of the plutonium
processing at Rocky Flats.
   The operation, originally under Dow Chemical but now run by
Rockwell International under contract to the Department of Energy,
rebutted Johnson's findings, but people began to worry about their
neighbor.
   As the 1980s arrived, with homes built close enough for
homeowners to stand in their backyards and see the rows of
prison-type yardlights illuminating Rocky Flats at night, the
demand for scrutiny and oversight of the plant grew to a clamor.
   In a precedent-setting decision in 1986, Rockwell and DOE agreed
that the Colorado Department of Health could review and regulate
hazardous wastes at the plant.
   At the same time, work-related lawsuits by former employees
began cropping up in court. Two employees won settlements after
claiming that prolonged exposure to radioactive materials had
caused their cancer.
   A lawsuit over traces of radioactive materials in neighboring
fields triggered a decade-long battle that ended with a $10 million
settlement.
   Skaggs and U.S. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, a Denver Democrat, have
suggested creation of an independent panel to regulate
environmental, health and safety concerns.
   ``DOE wants to say these are the levels (of emissions) that are
safe and we don't have those levels, therefore we are safe,''
Schroeder said. ``That's the crux of the whole debate. (I've) never
gotten what I would call independent data.''
   Rocky Flats management cays it's working toward that goal.
   ``We're happy about it (more attention),'' said Rockwell
spokesman Pat Etchard. ``We can't release everything for obvious
reasons. (But) putting things up for public debate usually clears
things up and gets issues out front.''
   Meanwhile, communities near Rocky Flats are trying to grapple
with the dilemma of depending on jobs while fearing the hazards.
   Arvada's compromise was to call for a shutdown of plutonium
operations, but to add workers for cleanup duties. Broomfield
officials endorsed the plant's safety efforts after meeting with
plant officials.
   Because of the long time span estimated needed for a move _ 20
years _ local governments are concerned but not worried about the
potential loss of jobs. The required cleanup operations at the site
if it were closed would keep workers busy for many years.
   But the price tag of a move _ put at around $4 billion by
Rockwell _ is a major obstacle.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., has suggested delaying $380 million in
scheduled improvements at Rocky Flats until its future is pinned
down.
   ``We should not be embarking on an expensive program ... without
having a thorough plan for the future of the nuclear weapons
complex,'' he said.

   From the migrations of aboriginal
Indians to the days of Buffalo Bill and Calamity Jane, the path
that became Interstate 25 has attracted more than its share of
explorers and warriors.
   So it is today. I-25, America's Nuclear Highway, bustles with
modern man's search for defense and his reach for the stars.
   The 3 million people for whom I-25 is Main Street are finding
their neighborhood now includes super-secret research, deadly
weapons, transplanted scientists and technological wonders.
   The locals, even the sandwich shop owners and auto salesmen,
follow budgetary debates in Washington, knowing some of the
trillions will trickle down to their cash registers.
   Some who come to this slice of the country seek science, some
fortune. Some work for peace, others prepare for war.
   They are people like the anti-nuclear activist who works without
pay for a cause, or the general who must inform the president of a
nuclear attack, or the Old World glassblower whose talent carries
high-tech research to new frontiers.
   Some, like the owner of the ``The Star Wars Deli'' or the new
Air Force officer with a vision of working in a space station, see
their future here.
   Others, like the retired couple living with a stockpile of
nuclear weapons literally in their backyard or the scientist who
spent a decade building warheads and now toils to find ways to
shoot them down, find calm amid what others might find dangerous.
   These are the stories of some of the people who live beside The
Nuclear Highway:

<DATELINE>WHITE SANDS RANCH, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When G.B. Oliver's father set out
to buy land for a family ranch in the 1940s, friends told him not
to buy across the border because the Mexican government could take
it away at any time.
   Instead, he bought 1,280 acres in New Mexico _ and the American
government took half of it away.
   ``It's hard to believe what happened,'' Oliver said. ``My dad
said about the military that it was like watching a snake swallow a
rabbit. They wrapped around us until they got us in a position
where we couldn't do anything, then they slobbered all over us and
then they finished us off.''
   The government took half of the Olivers' land on a 20-year lease
for part of the White Sands Missile Range, a vast Army proving
ground for everything from the world's first atomic bomb to today's
highspeed aircraft, bombs, missiles and even ``Star Wars'' lasers.
   Like other ranchers, the Olivers were paid only a portion of
what the acreage was worth. And, like others, they continue to
fight, only this year losing the latest round in court.
   ``We're fighting the battle now for the second generation,''
Oliver said. ``And my feeling is that we're fighting for the
precedent of the thing. That's what's dangerous _ that the
government could put anybody out of business just like that.''
   About 120 ranching families have carried on the fight over the
land, seeking a total of $25 million-$50 million in compensation.
Some lost entire ranches; some, like the Olivers, lost only a
portion of the prairie to the missile range.
   Their trouble began in World War II, when the Army decided it
needed 2 million acres in southern New Mexico for weapons testing.
   The ranchers, forced to vacate and sign 20-year leases, were
told the land would be returned. But by the time the leases
expired, the buildings at White Sands were permanent; even though
the war was long over, weapons testing continued.
   The land was condemned.
   Over the years, the ranchers have demonstrated, appeared before
congressional panels and pursued their lawsuits. They acknowledge
that the way the law is written, the Army can condemn the land and
pay whatever it wants.
   Only two months ago, the U.S. Claims Court in Washington
concluded the ranchers ``do not have a legal or equitable claim
agaist the United States and that any payment to them would be a
gratuity.''
   The ranchers just don't think it's fair.
   ``They took our lives from us. They just said get off and fend
for yourself,'' said rancher Howard Wood.
   Wood's family had more than 50,000 acres of land worth at
minimum half a million dollars. After the Army took it, his mother
had to work as a waitress in Tularosa, N.M., to support the family.
At age 84, she now lives in a government housing project.
   ``If they bought it outright as a ranch at an amount that a
fellow could take and get another ranch, that would have been OK,''
Wood said. ``If they had gone ahead and taken the thing outright
and never told us we'd get it back, that might have been better,
too.
   ``But they let the thing linger on, and we kept holding on
hoping to go back, and it turned out the contract we had was not
worth the paper it was written on.''
   Oliver blames the dispute for his father's death of a stroke in
1972, one day after a heated meeting with a U.S. Corps of Engineers
official.
   Like others, the elder Oliver spent 20 years with his life on
hold, awaiting the day he could get back the half of the ranch
behind the wire fence. And, his son said, he never gave up hope.
   ``It killed Dad,'' Oliver said. ``He could not believe his
government would do him like this.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two families, more than 1,000 miles apart, find
themselves torn by the nuclear age. The conflicts are deep and
painful _ the Kirkbrides have MX missiles on their ranch; the
Church family lost its land to the Manhattan Project, then saw all
three sons go to work for the bomb-makers. Their stories are told
together as the final installment of a four-part series, The
Nuclear Highway.

   As Lindi Kirkbride kneeled in her garden to
admire the first flowers of spring, a black shadow passed overhead,
blotting out the sun.
   ``It's them,'' she said, not even bothering to look up.
   ``Them'' was an Air Force helicopter that stuck out like a big
bug against a sky as blue as a robin's egg.
   The chopper was patrolling a few of the 12,600 square miles that
the 90th Missile Wing of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command
oversees in southeastern Wyoming, northeastern Colorado and
southwestern Nebraska.
   But on that sunny day its flight over some of Harding-Kirkbride
Ranch's 66,000 acres was a reminder that just beyond the gentle
hills surrounding Lindi's home the world's deadliest weapons are
poised beneath the prairie.
   ``Spiritually, morally, ethically, I'm against the MX,'' said
Mrs. Kirkbride, 39. ``When I drive by those three MX sites on our
land I force myself to think about them, and I pray. I pray that
God has angels on them, holding the missiles down.''
   Each MX is fitted with 10 ``independently targetable'' nuclear
warheads carrying the equivalent of 300 kilotons of TNT apiece _
more than 20 times the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. By
year's end, the Air Force plans to have completed deployment of 50
MXs in silos buried 80 feet deep on the Wyoming plateau.
   In addition to the MXs, the 90th Missile Wing headquartered at
F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, 35 miles southwest of the
Kirkbride ranch, maintains 150 Minuteman III intercontinental
ballistic missiles scattered in the 12,600-square-mile corner where
Wyoming meets Nebraska and Colorado, an area larger than Belgium.
   Ever since America's first ICBM, the Atlas, was deployed in
1959, Lindi Kirkbride's family and neighbors have lived with The
Bomb.
   ``The city of Cheyenne was so proud to be a part of the
country's new defense system that an addition was made to local
road signs (reading) `Welcome to Wyoming, home of Frontier Days and
the Atlas Missile,''' according to ``Peacekeepers of the Plains,''
the title of the missile wing's official history and also its
nickname.
   No one opposed the ICBMs. City fathers welcomed the revenue and
jobs. Ranchers gladly sold land for missile sites and were happy to
see new roads.
   When the Atlas was declared obsolete, it was replaced with the
Minuteman series. Then came the MX.
   ``We were so naive, so silly,'' recalled Mrs. Kirkbride. ``I
didn't know diddly-squat about this issue. I suspected I didn't
want to know; it was too complex. I felt powerless.''
   A fledgling group calling itself ``Wyoming Against MX'' held its
first meeting in January 1981.
   ``I finally got off the fence,'' Mrs. Kirkbride said. ``But even
then I knew I didn't have to win anything, I just had to do the
right thing.''
   From that moment, nothing was the same for the close-knit
Kirkbride clan founded in Wyoming five generations ago by a Scot
who arrived with $5 and a rocking chair.
   Lindi, a Texan who met her husband, Alan, at the University of
Wyoming where she majored in social work and he studied
agriculture, became a spokeswoman for Wyoming Against MX. She
testified at hearings and wrote letters to newspapers. She went to
the Soviet Union with a group called Ranchers for Peace. This wife,
mother of three, homemaker, churchgoer, guest on ``Nightline,''
came home from Moscow a pariah.
   ``Nobody asked me a single question about my trip,'' Mrs.
Kirkbride said quietly. ``The local paper crucified me, people
called me a Communist, accused me of being like Jane Fonda.''
   Party invitations from the conservative, patriotic Cheyenne
establishment dried up. Her children told her, ``Mom, you're weird
sometimes.'' Relations became increasingly strained between Mrs.
Kirkbride and her husband's family.
   ``I told my whole family, `If I can't get along with you I have
no business going to the Soviet Union, talking to the Russians,'''
she said. ``Therefore, I will continue to try to communicate with
you even though sometimes it is hurtful and painful.'''
   There were blowups.
   ``We discuss all this in our family and we disagree,'' Shirley
Kirkbride, Lindi's mother-in-law, said tactfully. ``But we all love
each other. ... We love Lindi. She's never been anything but
gracious. She's respectful and she studies a lot about it. She
doesn't just lash out emotionally. This is her thing, and I support
her right to do it.''
   To the windowsill above her kitchen sink, Lindi Kirkbride has
taped a poem she reads daily.
   ``My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the
road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor
do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following
Your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.''
   The first MX was deployed in December 1986.
   ``When I heard the news, I felt like I'd been kicked in the
teeth. I wanted to throw up,'' she recalled.
   That Christmas she placed a wreath at the missile site 4 miles
west of her house and began fighting a new battle.
   The Pentagon wants to deploy ``Rail Garrison,'' a mobile defense
system that would, in times of international crisis, shuttle 50 MXs
around the country aboard 25 trains to confuse the enemy. The Air
Force wants the system based at F.E. Warren.
   ``We've come a long way,'' said an ever-optimistic Lindi
Kirkbride. ``We may stop it this time.''
   Meanwhile, the helicopters fly overhead and armed guards in
military vans patrol the ranch's gravel roads. Beneath the ground,
24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in bunkers built to withstand
nuclear fallout, young officers sit trained and ready, awaiting
orders to launch.
   ``Sometimes, especially in the spring, I look out over the
valley at the new grass and the cattle and I try to visualize what
the prairie was like before the missiles came. That's what I wanted
to pass on to my children,'' said Mrs. Kirkbride.
   ``Instead, I see what we get when we don't trust one another,
when we hate. We get an imperfect, deadly world. People say we
can't go back, we have to accept this monster, this mutant.
   ``My vision is to say `No, we don't.'''

   Ted Church knew something was up that
December. He was 17 and the year was 1942, the year when war came
to the secluded mesa his family called home.
   Trenches were dug. The Army rolled in. Ted and his younger
brothers needed passes to come and go.
   It was war, yes. But never a shot was fired. This was the
Manhattan Project, the effort that created the world's first atomic
bomb.
   Ted's parents, Peggy Pond Church and Ferm Church, ran the Los
Alamos Ranch School, an elite private academy for boys. It was
their life and their livelihood, and that December, it was taken
away by one man's vision.
   The ranch school was condemned and the family evicted by the
government, which paid only $7.69 an acre. A mesa created in a
volcanic eruption became almost overnight the secret home of the
Manhattan Project.
   Peggy Pond Church, author and poet, wrote about peace and the
death-maker created on her homestead until she died 20 months ago.
Her three sons _ Ted, now 63, Allen, 59, Hugh, 56 _ are still
bitter.
   Yet in a quirk of history and destiny, all three sons grew up to
work for the bombmakers, on federal nuclear weapons programs here
at Sandia National Laboratories, less than 100 miles from the mesa.
   They carry on the work of J. Robert Oppenheimer even as they
carry the anger of losing their land to Oppenheimer, who knew the
serene beauty of the ranch school from summer trips.
   ``Life is one big conflict,'' Hugh Church said. ``There are
certain feelings of distress at times with what would happen if all
these devices here were ever used. But striving to keep them from
being used is a major effort here, too.''
   Today, the 54,000 acres of family land remain the home of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, the top-secret center responsible
for nearly every nuclear warhead of the 1980s.
   Sandia is a cousin laboratory of sorts, where work proceeds on
arming and fusing the weapons, as well as on their safety and
reliability.
   Over long careers, all three brothers have returned to New
Mexico and worked on nuclear projects. Government is the major
employer along Interstate 25, America's Nuclear Highway, and
warheads are its primary task.
   ``I had a good offer so I came here, and I've been here ever
since,'' said Allen Church, who works in Sandia's arming and firing
division.
   But like the others, Allen never set out to work here. He
studied to be a veterinarian but struggled with organic chemistry.
He went to Hollywood and worked on six movies but decided acting
was too unstable. He was drafted for the Korean War and later
studied electrical engineering at Stanford University. Then he came
back to the Southwest, to New Mexico, to Sandia.
   ``This is part of my spirit, this part of the country,'' he said.
   Ted wanted to go into stage lighting but first served in the
Navy. He worked in electronics and communications then went to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He had offers from
electrical engineering firms, but he, too, wanted to get closer to
home. So it was Sandia, where he studies health and safety issues.
   Hugh studied physics and meteorology, earning a master's degree
at UCLA. He worked for the U.S. Weather Bureau then returned to New
Mexico in 1957, working on atmospheric weapons effects such as
blast, fallout and, more recently, ``nuclear winter,'' a possible
consequence of nuclear war in which smoke from weapons blasts and
fires would encircle the Earth and block much of the sun's light
and heat.
   Over the years, the brothers have wrestled with the ethics of
nuclear weapons. They passionately disagreed with their mother, but
they always made peace.
   ``She was always upset that the three of us ended up together
here,'' Ted said. ``But she was quite tolerant of it. She made her
feelings known.''
   Ten years ago, Ted became a Quaker, joining a faith with a basic
tenant that war is wrong. He believes the faith fits with the work
he does.
   ``As long as nuclear weapons exist, they demand a response from
me,'' he said. ``Many engineers and scientists just say, `It's up
to the politicians.' But I feel engineers and scientists have a
responsibility to help the public understand.''
   All three talk of the responsibility borne by those who work
with man's most deadly creations.
   ``People on the outside have terrific imaginations,'' Allen
said. ``People say, `What about all those crazy people who work
with nuclear weapons?' I say we're not crazy. I find people here to
be very sincere; they take it with a great deal of responsibility.
I'd rather be a part of it than leave it to someone else.''
   The brothers say they were too young to fully understand what
was happening when the family received the eviction letter Dec. 7,
1942 _ exactly one year after the Pearl Harbor attack.
   ``We really knew nothing about what was going on, but we knew it
had something to do with the war effort, and it was all
frightening,'' Ted said. ``My parents knew Oppenheimer, and I
suspect my father knew exactly what was happening.''
   The family had been told they could move back when the war
ended. They left behind personal belongings in the rush to vacate
and never recovered some Indian blankets, pottery and other
treasures.
   It still hurts.
   ``We're displaced persons. We were not asked. We were told,''
Ted said.
   ``We were promised return of the land when the war was over, and
of course, it wasn't,'' Hugh said.
   Ferm Church tried to restart the ranch school at another site
but failed. He wound up building power lines all over New Mexico
but never taught again. He died in 1975.
   Peggy Pond Church once said: ``We played the game and hid the
soreness in our hearts as best we could. ... I try not to sit in
judgment on the world. But I don't go back to Los Alamos now
because it's so ugly I can't stand it.''

   The nuclear deterrent that haunts the Church
family in New Mexico and divides the Kirkbride clan in Wyoming is
the main motivation for the crews who work deep underground in
blast-proof capsules, safeguarding the ``health'' of deadly
missiles, ever alert for the command that might send the warheads
on their way.

   They call themselves
Missileers, Cold War warriors who sit 80 feet underground in atomic
bomb-proof bunkers, girded for World War III.
   ``Our mission is peace through deterrence,'' said Lt. Michael
Luft, 29. ``I'm a missileer because I know I'm contributing to my
nation's security.''
   The ties that bind are steadfast belief in the job and deep
faith that if the president of the United States orders the launch
of MX and Minuteman III missiles, they'll do it.
   ``Long before a possible crew member gets to (training), that
person's reliability has been judged,'' said Luft. ``That's to
insure that individuals with only the highest amount of integrity
actually man the missiles.''
   The nation's 50 MX missiles are deployed alongside Interstate
25, America's nuclear highway, and buried under Wyoming's high
plains. The missiles are controlled by this air base in Cheyenne.
   The 4,000 men and women assigned to the 90th Strategic Missile
Wing, including 1,200 crack security police, maintain and guard the
most powerful land-based ICBMs in America's arsenal. They also
oversee 150 Minuteman IIIs.
   Officers are paired off to staff 20 launch control sites around
the clock. Each pair, a captain and a lieutenant, are responsible
for 10 missiles called a ``flight.''
   The crews work 24-hour shifts 80 feet underground in a capsule
the size of a budget hotel room. It is suspended on shock
absorbers. No one but the crew can open its blast-proof doors.
   There's a bed, television set and toilet, but the compartment is
dominated by twin consoles. A bank of lights and buttons monitors
the missiles' ``health'' every 40 seconds. It's the missileers' job
to interpret the computer diagnosis.
   ``We are always busy monitoring the system,'' said Luft. ``We
don't just sit out there with our hands on the keys.''
   The keys. The heart of the matter. On each console, 12 feet
apart, is a keyhole. The keys that could initiate a launch are
locked in a bright red box, along with secret papers necessary to
send the warheads on their way. Each officer has a confidential
combination to the box. It takes both to open it.
   Additionally, crews must dial a 16-digit code to ``enable'' the
missiles for launch. Only the president or his successors have
those numbers.
   The order to fire would come in a spoken code from the Strategic
Air Command over two loudspeakers. The missileers practice the
drill constantly.
   Fail-safe procedures abound. Only after the code is correctly
dialed can the officers use their keys. They must be inserted and
turned simultaneously, while another crew in a different capsule
also turns its two keys at the exact moment. The keyholes are
spring-loaded, requiring constant key pressure to make them work.
   ``Looking Glass,'' the airborne command post that routinely
checks the missiles' peacetime functions, can override any launch
command.
   ``We like redundancy in our business,'' said Lt. Col. Gerald
Perryman, 39, the missile wing's assistant deputy commander for
operations. ``Every day the seals which cover the keyholes are
examined to ensure they haven't been tampered with.''
   The missileers consider themselves an elite force. Currently all
those assigned to Warren AFB are men, although some female missile
officers are based at Minuteman III installations elsewhere. The
Air Force recently changed its policy to permit co-ed launch
control crews.
   Like Luft and Perryman, Capt. Steve Wagner, 30, trains to keep
in rock-hard shape. With their short haircuts, lean physiques and
starched dark-blue uniforms set off by white cravats, the
missileers cut dashing figures.
   ``If an officer is not pilot- or navigator-qualified, or an
engineer, he's likely to be assigned to missile crew duty,'' said
Perryman. ``Missile crewmen have a good track record for promotion
in competition with air crew members.''
   In today's military, where space and Star Wars are top
priorities, that means ``Watch out, Top Gun, here comes Top
Rocket.''
   By the time young officers are assigned to a launch control
capsule, they have been put through psychological tests to
determine if they will obey orders to fire nuclear weapons.
   Potential missile officers watch graphic films detailing the
aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima.
   ``We also get lectures about the effects of nuclear war,'' said
Wagner. ``We have to sign a statement after we view the movies.
After we practice our first key turn we have to sign another
statement of personal reliability.''
   Asked if he thought the missileers would survive incoming
warheads, Lt. Aaron Wilkins said, ``It's hard to say what would
happen in a degraded environment. Nobody wants that to happen.''
   In a worst-case scenario, with World War III in progress and all
his missiles launched, what would Wilkins do next?
   ``I don't know, it hasn't happened. I guess we would await
further orders.''

<HEAD>Billy Joel Special on ABC Is More Than a Rock Video</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rock memorabilia display in New York's Hard
Rock Cafe recently acquired a small, rather beat-up electric piano
that bears the inscription ``Trashed in the U.S.S.R.''
   The piano belonged to Billy Joel, and his tantrum is one of the
highlights of the 90-minute documentary by Martin Bell, ``A Matter
of Trust: Billy Joel in the U.S.S.R,'' which can be seen Wednesday
on ABC.
   The film is, in fact, what prompted Joel's well-publicized
attack on the innocent instrument. He explained later he thought
the camera lights were intimidating the audience.
   In order to pay for the tour, Joel commissioned two movies, a
concert film for HBO, directed by Wayne Isham, and the documentary
by Bell, an Englishman whose documentary on runaways,
``Streetwise,'' was nominated for an Oscar in 1985.
   The hey-look-they're-just-like-us impact of Bell's film is
perhaps faded somewhat in the wash of publicity from the Moscow
summit. But it is still a lovely travelogue and an interesting
backstage portrait of a rock tour. There's also plenty of
behind-the-scenes footage of Joel, his wife, Christie Brinkley, and
their infant daughter, Alexa Ray, to satisfy the most avid fan.
   ``It's difficult making films about rock 'n' roll in general,''
Bell said in a telephone interview. ``Because of films like `Spinal
Tap,' that form is so well-parodied. But the thing that was
interesting to me was the Soviet Union and also Billy's music.''
   Surprisingly, he said, it was not that difficult to work in the
Soviet Union, except for the difficulty of changing travel plans,
since Aeroflot is demandingly prompt and always fully booked.
   ``The other problem is, it's difficult getting food after 10
o'clock at night. So you're limited to vodka and caviar and
sturgeon. How difficult can it be?
   ``The interesting thing to me,'' Bell said, ``was that it wasn't
at all what I expected it to be. I mean I really did go with an
idea of what the place would look like. I thought it would be dull
and gray and uninteresting. It wasn't. It was the opposite _
lively, full of color and the people incredibly warm.''
   One of the most profound moments in the film comes when Joel
visits the grave of Russian folk singer Vladimir Visotsky, who died
in 1980. People stand in line all day just to glimpse the grave.
``That's popular,'' Joel says admiringly. Later, he meets
Visotsky's mother, who is enormously impressed that an American
rock star would visit her son's grave.
   There is also some nice footage of Joel and his backup singers
trading riffs with a Georgian men's singing group.
   The piano-hurling came on the second night of the tour. During a
song, Joel shouts, ``Quit lighting the audience!'' When there is no
response from the lighting people, he throws the piano over, then
attacks a microphone stand, breaking it in two.
   ``Thank goodness he did it, because it's very dramatic in the
film,'' said Bell.
   At another concert, Joel confounds his Soviet fans by going out
into the audience and lying down on top of them. At first
perplexed, they eventually get into the spirit and pass him, hand
by hand, over the tops of their heads back to the stage. ``I can't
believe I did that!'' cries Joel.
   ``The thing I am pleased about most in the film is that in a
sense you're just seeing the people,'' said Bell. ``You're seeing
people respond directly to that music, and they look just like us.
I don't know why that should be such a surprise, but in a sense we
haven't seen the Soviets like that.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   ATTACK OF THE `MEMOIRS THING' _ Former CBS anchor Walter
Cronkite has a major task looming _ ``the memoirs thing,'' as he
calls it. He said he hopes to get to work this year or next. ``I'm
not really intending to do another expose on CBS,'' he said.
``That's not my intention.'' There's a flurry of such recently,
including ``Prime Times, Bad Times'' by former CBS News President
Ed Joyce and ``Who Killed CBS?'' by New York Times reporter Peter
Boyer. ``I thought Joyce's book was very, very interesting,'' said
Cronkite. ``A great deal of it I thought was pretty accurate, but
no question it was his own view of it and self-serving.'' ...
   FROM `ST. ELSEWHERE' TO ELSEWHERE _ Ed Begley Jr., who played
fawning Dr. Ehrlich on NBC's ``St. Elsewhere,'' has a new role as a
United Nations interpreter in a made-for-TV action comedy for CBS
that also stars Harry Anderson of NBC's ``Night Court,'' Linda Purl
and Wendy Crewson.

<HEAD>``Friday the 13th'': There's Gold In Them Thar Killings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Amid all the hoopla over Mick Dundee, John
Rambo, Willow Ufgood and other heroes of the new film season, the
infamous Jason might be overlooked.
   Not by Paramount Pictures.
   ```Friday the 13th' is a gold mine that keeps on rolling
along,'' declares Sidney Ganis, president of worldwide marketing
for Paramount. The studio reports that the first six films in the
series have grossed over $172 million, not to mention the big
videocassette sales, cable TV, syndication and a TV series.
   In its first 18 days, ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New
Blood'' sold almost $16 million worth of tickets in the United
States and Canada. Since the film cost $3.5 million _ about 1@18th
the budget of ``Rambo III'' _ it should already be solidly in the
black.
   ``Part VII'' profited by premiering on Friday the 13th of May;
the series always does better business when released on that
fateful day.
   ``Jason has become part of the vernacular,'' Ganis said. ``Why?
I think because he is genuinely frightening, and teen-agers
genuinely love to be frightened. My own daughter loved `Friday the
13th III.' Now she has seen `VII' and then she goes to see (the
more arty) `The Moderns.' A whole generation has grown up on Jason
and keeps going back.''
   Jason began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980, in a
low-budget thriller created by producer-director Sean Cunningham.
Ironically, Cunningham devised the title when he was planning a
children's television show. He figured it might work for the title
of a feature film, and he was right. ``Friday the 13th'' grossed an
amazing $40 million.
   Cunningham, who is now filming another horror film, ``Deep
Six,'' signed over his rights to Paramount, and the series has had
five other directors. The formula remains the same as in the
original, which starred Kevin Bacon, later of ``Footloose'' fame,
Harry Crosby, son of Bing, and Betsy Palmer as Jason's mother.
   The action _ lots of it _ always takes place at Camp Crystal
Lake. Jason returns from the dead, wearing a hockey mask and
wielding an ax to pay back a grudge. Many years ago when he was a
camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors
were making love in the bushes. Jason's vengeance is wreaked upon
the human race in general, with special emphasis on oversexed
counselors.
   John Carl Buechler, a special effects expert who became a
director (``Troll,'' ``Cellar Dweller''), directed ``Friday the
13th VII'' from a script by Daryl Haney. Buechler (pronounced
Beekler) says he saw possibilities of applying two new twists to
the same saga.
   ``One, I thought it would be good to have a main character in
the story, someone the audience could cry and cheer for, and follow
her through the nightmare world,'' he said. ``She is the teen-ager
(Lar Park Lincoln) whose special powers release Jason from his
grave at the bottom of the lake. Telling the story from one
person's viewpoint had only been done once before (in Part V).
   ``Two, I added a substantial element of the supernatural. Before
Part VII, Jason was a mindless man who jumped out of closets and
killed people. Since he was resurrected by electricity in Part VI,
he was now, practically speaking, a ghost. That made him a
virtually unstoppable humanoid.
   ``So I thought it would be fun to fill the last two reels with
false endings. I wanted the audience to say, `Oh, he's up, now he's
down, he's dead. No, he's up again!' My aim was more fantasy than
reality.''
   Even with the innovations, Buechler was careful not to tamper
too much with the ``Friday the 13th'' formula.
   ``I was hired to satisfy the producers; if I was hired to do a
James Bond picture, I would certainly follow the Bond formula,'' he
said.
   ``Friday the 13th VII'' inevitably found disfavor with the
ratings board of the Motion Picture Association of America, which
immediately branded the film with an X for extreme gore. This would
have made the movie unsalable since a film rated X prevents anyone
under age 17 from being admitted to the theater.
   Like Jason, though, the filmmakers kept coming back again and
again with new cuts.
   ``They gave us an X six times until we finally got an R,''
Buechler said. ``I understand `Robocop' holds the record at eight.''
   Stunt man Kane Hodder is the seventh portrayer of Jason, which
might seem a thankless acting job since he doesn't speak and is
hidden behind a mask. Hodder doesn't agree.
   ``I've always wanted to play that character ever since the first
film,'' says Hodder, who has coordinated stunts for ``House,''
``Ghost Town'' and other thrillers. ``I've always believed that he
should be played by a stunt man.
   ``I think Jason is more of a challenge because he has no
dialogue. I tried to get across the feeling of menace just by using
certain head movements and body movements.''
   If the ``Friday the 13th'' films are stiumlating to teen-agers,
they are an ordeal for reviewers, whose vituperation has no
apparent effect on the audience.
   ``Critics hate the movies,'' Buechler said, ``but surprisingly,
we've had mixed reviews on VII. The common pattern is for the
reviewer to comment that Jason is here to stay, then to review the
previous one in the series and conclude, `If you liked them, you'll
like this one.'''

   What a groovy guy that Jason Voorhees is _ ahead
of his time with that goalie mask fashion look, and ever so
creative with axes, knives and spears.
   He's a real human slice-and-dice machine, but not not too many
people like him. Still, they flock to see his movies _ seven so far
_ and he doesn't even have a speaking part.
   Here's a look at Jason's life and death and life and death in
the ``Friday the 13th'' sagas:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th'' (1980):
   Six frisky camp counselors reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which has
been closed for over two decades after a rash of unsolved murders.
A seventh, who hitchhikes to the camp, never quite makes it: She's
turned into a forest pizza. The other college-age dimwits romp
about until they, too, are carved into human kindling. Alice, the
last of the lot, runs into Mrs. Voorhees who lives nearby. She
promises to drive the hysterical girl to safety but instead talks
about her son, Jason, who drowned years ago while his counselors
made love in the woods. She turns on Alice with a hatchet; Alice
finally decapitates the madwoman and makes her way to a canoe which
drifts to the middle of the lake. In a blink, the drowned Jason
reaches up from his watery hell and grabs her. Alice abruptly
awakens in a hospital room to be told by police that Jason's body
was never found. Alice says: ``Then he's still there.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part 2'' (1981):
   A new batch of hot-blooded morons begin counselor training at
Lake Region, near Camp Crystal Lake. The camp leader, Paul, talks
about Jason _ an icon by now _ and says he's really alive, living
off wild animals and waiting to avenge his mother's death. One by
one, and two by two the randy counselors-to-be encounter Jason, who
enthusiastically dispatches his victims with a curved machete, a
spear thrust through two bodies, a hammer. Finally, only Paul and
his girlfriend, Ginny, are left. Thinking Paul dead, Ginny tries to
flee. She ends up at Jason's cabin where she finds a shrine to his
dead mother containing her decapitated head. Paul shows up,
struggles with Jason, and Ginny slices up the ``dead'' boy's body
with the machete. Paul and Ginny return to the cabin, and Jason
crashes through the window. Ginny wakes up in an ambulance.
``Where's Paul?'' she asks.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part 3 _ 3-D'' (1982):
   Yet another group of idiots heads for the lake, amid newscasts
of mass murders. Three bikers show up to taunt them and are
promptly dispatched by our Jason, who picks off the vacationing
college kids with his usual finesse: He shoots an arrow through a
head, cleaves a body, electrocutes one guy, slits a neck, thrusts a
hot fireplace poker through a chest. As usual, one hysterical
female is left, Chris. After a struggle, she imbeds an ax in
Jason's head, runs to the lake and paddles a canoe to the center _
silly girl. When she awakens in the morning, Mrs. Vorhees' body,
dripping with rotted flesh, explodes from the water and pulls Chris
under. Police take a deranged Chris away and we catch one last (?)
glimpse of Jason, the ax still rooted in his skull, his fingers
twitching.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th _ The Final Chapter'' (1984):
   Ten people have been slaughtered at Crystal Lake. Jason also
lies dead. The bodies are taken to the morgue where Jason, perky as
ever, rises up, slits the throat of an attendant and guts a nurse.
Back at the lake, Mrs. Jarvis and her two children, Trish and
Tommy, are in their summer home. A group of teen-agers has moved in
next door. The party's soon over, though, as they're harpooned,
crucified, hacksawed and otherwise minced. But Tommy is a horror
freak who has a makeup collection, masks and clippings about Jason.
He saves his sister and himself by putting on a hockey mask,
confusing Jason and grabbing the machete. Tommy whacks his personal
hero again, and again and again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th _ A New Beginning'' (1985):
   Tommy Jarvis is now 18 and has nightmares about Jason. He lives
at a halfway house after being released from a mental institution.
Then the murders begin with axes, hunting knives and hedge shears
as the weapons du jour. Finally, Tommy comes face to face with
Jason who falls from a hayloft onto the steel spike teeth of a
tractor harrow. Rain washes away makeup from the corpse's face and
reveals the killer as a paramedic pretending to be Jason. Tommy,
who still has nightmares, is back in the hospital. He smiles
knowingly, pulls a hockey mask from his bureau, hides behind the
door and waits.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part VI _ Jason Lives'' (1986):
   Crystal Lake has changed its name to Forest Green. Tommy Jarvis
is now an adult and still haunted. He believes that the only way he
ever have a normal life is to make sure Jason is REALLY dead. So he
returns to Crystal Lake to see Jason's grave. He pries open the
coffin during a storm, and a bolt of lightning hits the crowbar
he's used, sending a charge through the decayed corpse. The
rejuvenated Jason works his way back to the lake leaving a trail of
blood and guts. Tommy follows him, lures him to the lake and
somehow traps Jason in chains and rocks so that he sinks to his
original watery grave.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood'' (1988):
   Tina Shepard is telekinetic. While at Crystal Lake, her father
dies and she tries to bring him back. Instead, she accidentally
brings back Jason, who sets about doing what he does best.
Ultimately, Jason and Tina face off. Only this time when she does
some fancy brain work, she brings back her dead father, who
struggles with Jason and pulls him back to the depths of the lake,
where they set up housekeeping together until the next time?

   It's not exactly a role actors would kill for,
but kill indeed they do.
   Seven men have portrayed Jason Voorhees, the masked and
multilated corpse who refuses to stay dead in the seven ``Friday
the 13th'' movies.
   The Jasons have ranged from a professional trapeze artist to a
nightclub manager who had no acting experience:
   1. Ari Lehman was 14 when he launched Jason's blood binge in
``Friday the 13th.'' In the movie that made sequels a thriving
business, he's only seen in two scenes: a flashback when Jason
drowns as a child in Crystal Lake, and at the end of the film when
his rotting corpse rises from the lake to grab the lone survivor of
his mother's murder rampage.
   Now in his 20s, Lehman has left acting and plays with a
funk-rock band.
   2. Warrington Gillette, the evil killer in ``Part 2,'' majored
in economics at Villanova University. He studied acting with Lee
Strasberg in New York before going to California where he joined
the Hollywood Stunt Man's Association. He's worked in comedy
workshops, did a movie documentary on Saratoga, N.Y., and has
appeared on the TV soap opera, ``General Hospital.''
   3. Richard Brooker, Jason in the 3D version, is a professional
trapeze artist who has appeared in cirucuses throughout the world.
He also does high wire, juggles and works on the trampoline. He
studied acting at such theater companies as The Stage and Riverside
Studio and has appeared in commercials.
   4. Ted White, a stunt man and actor who played Jason in ``Part
IV,'' had never seen a ``Friday the 13th'' movie. His credits
include ``The Creature From the Black Lagoon.''
   5. Richard Wieand, who plays a paramedic posing as Jason in
``Part V,'' does soap operas and commercials.
   In an interview with People magazine, he talked about his
audition for the part: ``The director told me to stare at an empty
desk and react as if I saw my son laying there hacked to bits.''
   6. C.J. Graham, who managed a nightclub, was the sixth Jason. He
got the part after portraying Jason for a club performance by an
illusionist who was a friend of the company that did special
effects for the ``Friday the 13th'' movies. He suggested Graham,
who had no acting experience, as the next Jason. 7. Kane Hodder, a
stunt coordinator, stunt man and actor, has performed stunts in
over 25 movies and more than 40 TV shows. He might be the last
Jason, but who knows?

   Even after the crash last fall, stocks still
rank as the standout investment of the 1980s.
   But longer-term statistics cast doubts on some traditional
assumptions about the results stocks are likely to achieve in
comparison to bonds and other interest-bearing investments.
   Those are the principal conclusions that emerge from an annual
investment scorecard compiled by the Wall Street firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   In posting a 14.5 percent compound annual rate of return from
1980 through June 1 of this year, stocks outperformed 13 other
types of assets, analyst Robert S. Salomon Jr. said.
   Bonds ranked second, at 12.8 percent, followed by Treasury
bills, at 9.8 percent.
   The also-rans were diamonds, up 5.4; Old Masters paintings, up
4.9; housing, up 4.8; coins, up 3.9; Chinese ceramics, up 2.9;
foreign exchange, up 2.4; U.S. stamps, up 2.0; gold, down 2.5;
farmland, down 3.3; oil, down 3.4; and silver, down 9.3.
   For the same period, the Consumer Price Index rose at a compound
annual rate of 4.6 percent.
   As these figures show, several kinds of collectibles and other
tangible assets that are supposed to serve as inflation hedges have
not lived up to that billing in recent years.
   They did perform handsomely in the 1970s, when the Consumer
Price Index soared at a compound annual rate of 7.8 percent. But
they have had trouble keeping up with the less rapid inflation of
the 1980s.
   With stocks, bonds and Treasury bills in the top three
positions, the 1980s have clearly established themselves as ``a
decade for financial assets,'' Salomon observed.
   ``We expect the good relative performance of financial assets to
persist,'' he added. ``Inflation is likely to remain moderate.
   ``There will be some cyclical pickup in the months ahead, but
the rate of gain will not reach the levels experienced in the
1970s.''
   While Salomon's latest data for the 1980s may contain no big
surprises for active investors, his figures for the past 20 years
do show something unexpected.
   Since 1968, both Treasury bills, with a compound annual return
of 8.5 percent, and bonds, with a compound annual return of 8.1
percent, beat out stocks, which were up 6.8 percent a year.
   As Salomon notes, this flies in the face of an old piece of
accepted wisdom in the financial world: Over long periods of time,
stocks are supposed to compensate their owners for the risks
involved by outperforming interest-bearing investments.
   It can be argued that the period in question is an anomoly,
because stocks in 1968 were at a very high level, near the peak of
a long bull market.
   Nevertheless, Salomon says, the fact remains that ``stock and
bond returns were very close in the 1970s and in the 1980s _ two
distinctly different periods.''
   The high return posted by Treasury bills over the past two
decades seems especially remarkable when you consider that bills,
which have lives of one year or less, are considered one of the
lowest-risk investments anywhere in the world.
   Salomon said he believes this unusual phenomenon stemmed from
``the unprecedented expansion in debt that has taken place over the
past 20 years.''
   When demand for credit is heavy, lenders _ in this case, owners
of Treasury bills and bonds _ can command a generous return.

<HEAD>Lawn Care: Doing it Right or Getting Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Having a well-groomed lawn can be a suburban
status symbol, but it's a goal often achieved at high cost in time,
effort and money.
   So why bother?
   Well, a thick green lawn makes the home more appealing, prevents
soil erosion, provides a cooling effect in hot weather and even
reduces noise pollution.
   Getting those benefits means raising a crop of turf grass, a
basically simple plant that will thrive if properly mowed, watered
and fertilized.
   But those endeavors must be done regularly. Erratic watering and
mowing can harm the lawn, according to grass experts.
   The Council of Better Business Bureaus has compiled some
research on lawn care _ both suggestions on doing it yourself and
on what to look for in a professional.
   ``Tips on Lawn Care and Lawn Care Services'' is available for $1
plus a long, self-addressed, stamped envelope. Write to the CBBB,
1515 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22209.
   Watering and mowing, seemingly the simplest of tasks, can have a
great effect if not done properly, the booklet warns.
   Once you start watering, keep it on a regular schedule, the
council urges.
   ``Irregular watering can be harmful, as it might train the roots
to grow too close to the surface, leaving them more vulnerable to
the scorching sun,'' the booklet states.
   Watering at night tends encourage insects and diseases which
perfer a dark, damp environment. Daytime watering is better.
   Turning to mowing, the booklet notes that while the best height
varies according to the type of grass, ``cutting grass too short is
extremely harmful and can encourage certain varieties of weeds.''
   Often people cut grass short to avoid mowing it as often, the
booklet says. But longer grass is better able to withstand the hot
sun and trampling feet, and also can choke out many weeds as they
sprout.
   Keep the blade sharp on the lawn mover, the booklet goes on.
Grass sliced evenly suffers the least damage, while chopping or
shredding the tips of blades leaves them more prone to damage by
the sun, insects and disease.
   ``Grass should be cut in dry weather and in the early evening.
If it is too wet from rain, dew or fog, the grass has a tendency to
clump and not cut evenly. The clippings will also stick together,
suffocating sections of the lawn.
   ``Last, grass suffers the least amount of damage when mowed
during the cooler parts of the day,'' the booklet reports.
   Soil conditioning and fertilization needs vary from area to
area, the booklet points out, suggesting having the soil tested by
local cooperative extension agents. Those offices can also offer
advice on what type of pest control may be needed, and how to do it
safely.
   For some people, hiring a professional lawn care service proves
to be the answer, saving them time and work. Some customers have
complained to local BBB offices about billing problems with these
services, however, as well as companies that did work without
permission and then charged for it.
   When choosing the company, ask about the qualifications of the
workers, particularly the professionals in charge. Make sure they
have proper business licenses and any certificates needed to apply
chemicals.
   Get estimates from several firms, but remember cheapest isn't
always best.
   Ask for references from other customers, check with the local
Better Business Bureau and consumer affairs office for complaints
from past customers and find out if the firm is a member of a
professional lawn care association with a code of ethics.
   Ask for a written agreement from the firm you finally choose.
Check to see if it renews automatically each year or if you have a
choice. If renewal is automatic, make sure you know how to cancel
it, should that become necessary.

<HEAD>Venice Economic Summit Was One Reagan Would Like to Forget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year's economic summit in Venice is one
that Ronald Reagan probably would like to forget.
   Already hobbled by the Iran-Contra affair at home, the president
suffered a string of disappointments as America's major allies
turned a deaf ear to many of his initiatives.
   The defeats were particularly galling because Reagan had enjoyed
a number of policy successes only the year before at the Tokyo
summit, which he labeled the best economic gathering he had
attended.
   But in Venice, there were few expectations for major policy
breakthroughs as the leaders of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada gathered in the ornate
library of a 17th century monastery for their discussions.
   The parley was labeled the ``lame-duck summit'' even before it
began because so many of the participants were in the final stages
of their administrations.
   Prospects are similarly scaled down for Reagan's final economic
summit, June 19-21 in Toronto. Few new policy initiatives are
expected as U.S. allies prefer to wait and deal with Reagan's
successor.
   The president went to Venice last year hoping to convince
America's allies to take a hardline stand on guarding the Persian
Gulf oil lanes.
   Instead the seven major industrial democracies issued a lukewarm
declaration endorsing the principle of freedom of navigation in the
Persian Gulf that fell considerably short of the administration's
wishes for a stern warning to Iran.
   A year later, the U.S. Navy is still in the Persian Gulf
providing escorts for 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. Recently, the
administration announced it was expanding American protection to
cover neutral merchant ships who are attacked and who seek U.S.
help from Navy warships.
   The Venice summit basically reiterated the call strong
condemnation of state dealings with terrorists that was hammered
out over two days in Tokyo the year before. The partners did add a
new sanction, however, banning airline flights to countries that
refuse to extradite hijackers.
   The allies also gave cautious approval to the quickening pace of
U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, an area where Reagan will be able to
report substantial progress.
   During the Moscow summit, Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev exchanged ratification papers for the medium-range
missile ban treaty although the talks failed to produce any
breakthrough on an accord to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by
as much as 50 percent.
   On economic issues, the administration claimed significant
progress was made in Venice on international cooperation. Critics
were less kind, however, labeling the final economic communique a
``do-little'' document which failed to reassure financial markets
that two years of sluggish world growth would not worsen into a
global recession.
   When stock markets from New York to Tokyo crashed in October,
many economists believed their worst fears were coming true.
However, subsequent events have proven the doomsayers wrong. The
seven nations head into the Toronto summit enjoying some of the
fastest growth rates in years.
   Trade imbalances, long a source of friction, are easing as well.
While the United States suffered a record merchandise trade deficit
of $170.3 billion last year, the imbalance between U.S. exports and
imports has shrunk significantly in the first three months of this
year as U.S. manufacturers enjoyed record export sales.
   The turnaround represents a belated victory for Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker, who in September 1985 reversed
administration policy and came out with the Plaza Accord, a joint
effort with the other summit countries to hasten the dollar's
decline.
   Since that time, the dollar has fallen by about 50 percent
against the currencies of Japan and West Germany, a fact that has
contributed greatly to the increased competitiveness of American
goods overseas.
   Last year, the United States and its allies became worried that
the dollar had fallen too far and could frighten away the foreign
investors the United States needs to finance its budget deficits.
   While their efforts to brake the greenback's fall were largely
unsuccessful in 1987, they have had far better luck this year,
helped out by coordinated waves of intervention, the process by
which governments enter the market to buy and sell currencies out
of their own treasuries.
   The United States in Venice won a consensus that the $200
billion being spent annually on farm subsidies were
counterproductive, but since that time U.S. negotiators have had no
success in getting agreement on just how to go about eliminating
those subsidies.
   Reagan proposed in Venice scrapping all farm subsidies within 10
years, but European officials have vigorously resisted this idea.
The issue will again be on the table in Toronto but given the
intransigence of the positions, little headway is expected.

   Some farmers hit hard by a soil-parching
drought in northwestern Ohio have appealed to a higher source in an
effort to get the soaking rain they will need for their crops this
year.
   ``It's the worst drought I have ever seen in my life. It is the
worst drought the elderly people have seen in their lives. The
fields are drying up like it's August,'' Marjorie Reiter said last
week.
   Mrs. Reiter, who farms about 200 acres near the Seneca County
village of New Riegel, was one of 250 people who attended a special
prayer vigil at St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church in Frenchtown,
near New Riegel.
   About 750 people attended a pray-for-rain service held at SS.
Peter and Paul Catholic Church in the Putnam County city of Ottawa.
   Sister Mary Christine Pratt, director of rural life ministries
for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo, said the services were
``not a superstition thing.''
   ``It's a case of the community coming together to support each
other. No matter what happens, this sense of community well-being
will continue,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reiter agreed, but added that some farmers' prayers were
answered a couple weeks ago, at least temporarily.
   ``Our prayer service was on Wednesday night and on Thursday
morning we received three-tenths of an inch of rain,'' she said.
``The people were just joyful. We were just hugging each other and
just so thankful.
   ``But we know we need more rain.''
   Mrs. Reiter said the St. Nicolas service was attended by
Catholics and people of other faiths.
   ``The church was full for the people. This is affecting many,
many people. It's very serious,'' she said. ``The farmers have been
been very down. It's been very depressing.''
   This has been one of the driest springs on record in Ohio,
agricultural and weather service officials said. In some areas,
precipitation is 6 to 9 inches below normal for the year.
   The dry spell has meant that young crops aren't growing, corn
and soybean seeds aren't germinating, and herbicides, which are
activated by water, are not killing weeds.
   ``If we don't get rain soon, we don't have much potential for a
fall harvest,'' said farmer Dale Hoepf of New Riegel.
   ``That's really going to hit us hard because there are too many
dollars laying out there that are not going to work for us at all,
and it's going to be lost,'' he said referring to money spent for
seed, chemicals and fertilizer.

<HEAD>Drought Faces Montana's Blue-Ribbon Trout Streams</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Drought Rdp</HEAD>

   For the second year in a row, drought is
stalking the blue-ribbon trout streams of Montana, and wildlife
experts and fishermen hope last year's record-low flows will not be
repeated.
   ``A lot is going to depend on what kind of moisture we have for
the remainder of the spring and summer,'' said Larry Peterman,
research chief of the state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
   ``If we have average or a little-above-average moisture, we
might be able to get by without too many problems,'' he said. ``On
the other hand, if it turns dry again and we go through what we've
been going through, then some of our problems would be more
widespread.''
   Most early summer riverflow in Montana comes from melting snow
in the Rocky Mountains. But the spring snowpack averaged about
70-75 percent of normal, said Rich Brasch of the state Department
of Natural Resources and Conservation.
   In addition, ``with the warm weather, we're losing snowpack much
quicker than anticipated, and so we're looking at a possible
critical situation by mid-June or late June,'' said Phil Farnes,
the state snow survey supervisor for the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service.
   ``It's going to take more than normal moisture into August,'' he
said. ``If we get just the normal amounts, we're going to see some
problem areas.''
   Low water can pose serious threats to trout and other game fish.
Jim Vashro of the fish and wildlife department, said fish are
forced to move to the deeper holes in streams and rivers for
protection.
   ``The fish are concentrated more, so the predation and food
competition goes up,'' he said. ``There's a larger mortality rate
and less oxygen. As the water temperatures go up, the oxygen needs
of the fish go up, and they become stressed, their growth rate is
slowed, or they die.''
   Part of the Ruby River in southwestern Montana dried up last
year due to heavy irrigation usage and little return flow because
of the dry ground and the low water table.
   The result, said Jerry Wells in FWP's Bozeman office, was the
death of ``several hundred fish, and those were just the ones we
found.''
   ``I think there's been some changes made, and we have reason to
believe that we can avoid the river going dry,'' he said. ``We had
a lot of rain during the early part of the irrigation season, which
took a lot of the pressure off. And the groundwater is better.''
   State officials cite other potential problems in the Bitterroot
River, near the Idaho border, and the upper Clark Fork River, a
major tributary of the Columbia River.
   Vashro said two major reservoirs in northwestern Montana _
Hungry Horse and Lake Koocanusa _ already have been hurt by low
water and that could mean fewer fish in the future.
   Lake Koocanusa is a popular fishery for kokanee salmon and
cutthroat, rainbow and bull trout. Hungry Horse, next to Glacier
National Park, is known for its cutthroat and bull trout.
   At its lowest point in late March, Vashro said, Lake Koocanusa
was only 40 percent of normal volume. And Hungry Horse was at only
13 percent of its normal volume when the water level hit its low in
late April.
   ``We need rain now and for the next year,'' Vashro said. ``If we
don't get a normal precipitation year, we will be in even worse
shape next year.''

<HEAD>Third-World Debt, Trade and Drug Abuse on Agenda of Economic
Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Third world debt, trade and drug abuse will be on the agenda but
little is expected in the way of new initiatives when President
Reagan meets next week in Toronto with leaders of six major
industrialized democracies.
   Here is a sampling of what each participant in the annual
economic summit hopes to address at the meeting:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNITED STATES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Toronto meeting will be President Reagan's eighth and final
economic summit and adminstration officials are predicting that his
policies will be centerpiece of the agenda.
   But at the same officials predict no dramatic breakthroughs for
his agricultural or trade initiatives. With Reagan leaving office
next January, many summit participants would prefer to wait until
his successor is elected.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. delegates
expect considerable discussion of policies, pushed by Reagan and
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, designed to promote
coordination among the powers in the pursuit of economic growth.
   Fitzwater said Reagan's proposal that agricultural subsidies be
eliminated by the year 2000 is expected to be ``a major focus'' of
the summit, but it is an ``open question'' whether any commitment
will be made.
   ``It still is a controversial item among countries,'' he said.
``Every country subsidizes its agriculture to a considerable
degree, every country has enormous political pressures at home to
continue those subsidies, and so how much progress can be made ...
we just can't say in advance.''
   The spokesman said the free trade agreement negotiated last year
by the United States and Canada is expected to be ``a model for
discussion'' of the free trade issue, but he would not predict any
breakthroughs.
   ``They are going to have at least one session where they take a
look at the progress of the last several years and from that try to
project what some of the future problems may be,'' said Fitzwater.

<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Britain is seeking marked progress toward curbing trade
protectionism and agricultural subsidies, according to Mrs.
Thatcher's aides. The country, which has few farmers and thus gains
little from the subsidies, has been a prime critic of the 12-nation
European Economic Community's runaway farm budget.
   ``We want to see a reduction in agricultural subsidies all
round. I think everyone has something to contribute,'' said a
Thatcher aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There are signs of Anglo-French rivalry in jockeying for
initiatives on wiping out the poorest countries debts. British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has welcomed a French
proposal that the summit agree to wipe out a third of the debt, but
said he has made similar proposals since 1987.
   Lawson said he had lobbied particularly for longer repayment
periods on export credit loans for the poorest countries and
reduced interest rates, while Britain itself has written off 1
billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of poor country debt. ``I am now glad
to see the French have responded,'' Lawson said.
   British officials point to the signal by France that it will
relax its opposition to concessional interest rates. This month the
United States said it has dropped its opposition to other countries
granting interest rate relief.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANADA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Ending the farm subsidy war and keeping the global economy on a
stable course after last October's stock market crash are Canada's
principal goals at the summit.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney says Canada, the world's largest
exporter of wheat after the United States, cannot compete with
``the vast cashbox of the European Community and the U.S.
Treasury'' in subsidizing farmers.
   But he said progress on the issue is likely to come ``in small
bites,'' at best pointing the direction for the current
renegotiation of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade which governs world trade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Canada backs a U.S. proposal to phase out all agricultural
subsidies by the year 2000. The 12-nation EEC is cool to the idea.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson says there will be no major
announcements at the summit, but warns that leaders will have to
``maintain a watchful guard against any resurgence of inflation,''
as the current economic recovery continues.
   Canada has prepared an agenda calling for new coordination of
so-called ``micro'' economic policies such as tax reform,
deregulation and store opening laws.
   The Canadian government recently wrote off $971 million ($796
million U.S.) in loans to the poorest African nations, but the six
major Canadian commercial banks are owed a whopping $26 billion
($21 billion U.S.) by 34 developing countries. Mulroney would like
a consensus from summit partners on reducing Third World debt
without destroying markets or further impoverishing those most in
need.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   French President Francois Mitterrand wants the summit
participants to agree to wipe out one third of the debts owed them
by the world's poorest nations _ and said France will do this
anyway.
   ``It has never been so urgent and so necessary to act to help
the countries of the Third World, while the gap between rich
countries and poor countries continues to grow,'' Mitterrand wrote
in a letter to the other heads of government.
   He suggested the summit agree to consolidate existing debt at
market interest rates, but extend repayment periods from 20 to 25
years. He also listed as other options:
   _Consolidating the debt at a special rate of no more than half
the market rate, but with repayments over about 15 years.
   _Forgiving one-third of the total public or
government-guaranteed commercial debt, with the rest consolidated
at normal market terms.
   ``With its menu of options, it gives us reason to hope for a
consensus,'' Mitterrand's special counselor, Jacques Attali, said.
   To qualify under the French proposal, a nation must be extremely
poor, deeply in debt and in the process of improving the management
of its economy.
   The plan would not apply to the world's most indebted nations,
such as Mexico and Brazil, because they are not among the poorest.

   Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita hopes to focus attention on two
issues in particular at the summit: drug abuse and pollution.
   De Mita said he would like to see multilateral cooperation on
the anti-drug front, said an adviser who spoke on the condition he
not be identified.
   The premier also wants a greater commitment to study the problem
of underdeveloped countries where drug production is a major source
of income, the adviser said. Under the proposal, developed
countries would help such countries switch from reliance on drugs
to production of other farm products.
   The adviser said De Mita also would like summit participants to
discuss environmental problems in industrialized nations, which are
the major producers of pollution.

   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita wants to focus
attention on his country's contributions to the international
community.
   Takeshita also will stress that Japan has contributed to the
improvement in the global economy through its macroeconomic
performance. A new economic plan has forecast a growth in the
country's gross national product of 3.75 percent.
   ``Our economy is in very good shape. The external imbalance ...
is now being adjusted and Japan is contributing to better
management of the world economy,'' a government official said at a
news conference Thursday. He said imports of manufactured goods
were rising, the country's markets were opening and the
distribution systems were changing.
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
Takeshita and Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno ``will take concrete
action to advance the Uruguay Round at the Toronto summit.''
   Japan will also urge other summit participants to put out a
``strong message'' against the rising trend in protectionism.
   To demonstrate its growing role as a bridge between Asia and the
West, it will argue on behalf of the newly industrialized economies
(NIEs) of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
   ``We have to admit that the NIEs have positively contributed to
the advancement of the world economy ... that they are the hopes
for the developing world,'' the official said.

<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said before the meeting that
he expects the summit to produce a ``clear signal toward achieving
stability and trust of the markets.''
   He said he will press the United States to reduce its budget
deficit and Japan to open further its markets.
   Kohl said West Germany would intensify efforts to boost its
domestic demand in an effort to reduce trade imbalances.
   He said he will propose a series of measures to further reduce
the debt burden of the world's poorest nations at the summit.
   West Germany this month announced that it was forgiving 86
million marks ($50.5 million) of debts owed by some of the world's
poorest nations.
   A senior government official said West Germany expected the
summit to be ``one of relative harmony,'' focusing on long-term
ways to solve major world economic problems.
   Kohl is also expected to urge caution in the cutting of European
agricultural subsidies.
   On agricultural subsidies, West Germany is more cautious than,
say, the British. Kohl has warned that cuts agreed by the 12-nation
European Economic Community decision in February to cut
overproduction ``will not be easy to implement.''

   Droughts are parching pastures and cutting crop yields from the
northern Plains across the Midwest, letting wells go dry in parts
of the Southeast and imposing rationing on irrigators and
homeowners in California.
   ``I've never seen apple trees wilt in May in my life. But I have
this year,'' said horticulturalist Mike Thomas of Paw Paw, Mich.
   ``In my judgment, there hasn't been a drought like this since
the '30s,'' North Dakota Gov. George Sinner said last week after
touring scorched areas of his state.
   ``We'll probably starve the grasshoppers to death if we don't
get rain. That's the good part,'' said Ken Solberg, who owns a
livestock auction market in Rugby, N.D.
   An unusually dry and hot spring is to blame on much of the
Plains and Midwest. But in the Southeast, the Tennessee Valley is
heading into its fourth dry year.
   The West Coast has had two dry winters, especially in the
mountains where the snowpack supplies much of the region's water,
and irrigation districts and municipal systems are adopting
voluntary or mandatory water saving.
   In Georgia, almost every government in the Atlanta area has
restricted the hours when lawns can be watered and cars washed, and
people are snitching on neighbors who break the rules. State
wildlife biologist Bill Cooper says coyotes have taken to raiding
watermelon patches in the area.
   Indiana Cities Water Corp. threatened to disconnect service to
homeowners who ignored a ban on lawn sprinkling. Communities across
Illinois also are pleading for conservation.
   ``This is supposedly our rainiest season of the year,'' said
forecaster Al Morrison in Chicago, where only 1.77 inches of rain
had fallen since April 7, when 7.74 inches is normal.
   Total crop loss won't be known until harvest time. For now, crop
damage is showing up largely in shriveling leaves and plants
stubbier than expected for this time of year.
   ``Within the next week, if we don't get rain, our small-grain
crop is going to be 75 percent lost,'' said Don Friederich,
executive director of the Minnesota Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service.
   In some places, plants never had a chance.
   On his tour last week, North Dakota's governor kneeled in dusty
fields and dug up wheat and barley kernels that had never
germinated. What crops had sprouted had grown just a few inches.
   In some hard-hit areas of northwestern Ohio, some farmers have
plowed crops under rather than face sharply reduced yields while
still bearing the costs of fertilizing, said Alan Brugler of the
140,000-family Ohio Farm Bureau Federation.
   The effects of the heat and lack of rain appear sooner in early
maturing hay crops.
   ``Normally, we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year. The
yield from the first cutting was way down, and there won't be much
of a second cutting,'' said Don Keyes of the Minnesota Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Much of the state has less
than half normal rain this year.
   Dry pastures forced David Rendahl, who farms 2,800 acres near
Fillmore, N.D., to let his 70 cows graze clover he was going to
save for the winter, he said. ``That's supposed to be January hay,
and I'm eating it now,'' Rendahl said.
   The Department of Agriculture is already allowing farmers to cut
hay or let animals graze land that was set aside for crop reduction
or conservation in struggling counties in Montana, the Dakotas,
Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana
and Ohio.
   The grain futures market in Chicago has surged upward as traders
bet on a smaller and smaller harvest. Soybean futures rose 25
percent in a month and on Friday broke the $9-a-bushel barrier,
highest since late 1983. Oats traded last week up to the daily
limit _ 10 cents, raised to 15 cents at midweek _ four of the five
days.
   The only down day of the week was Wednesday when the market
opened sharply lower after reports that parts of Iowa got rain,
with more than 5 inches at Coon Rapids and almost 2 at Des Moines.
But the showers were spotty and the forecast was for continued
warm, dry weather.
   A report by the state statistical bureau said Iowa pastures were
at their June 1 driest since 1956.
   Rain that falls on most of the area between the Rockies and the
Appalachians ultimately drains into the Mississippi River, and the
water level has been dropping, the Coast Guard said. The river fell
almost 2 feet on June 5 and 55 barges were reported grounded the
next day near Memphis, Tenn.
   ``A lot of the towboat companies are starting to restrict the
size of the tows going through and starting to restrict the draft
of the barges,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Tony Buancore of Memphis.
   In the Southeast, western North Carolina is in the grip of a
near-record drought. State officials say the next two to three
weeks are critical, although it may already be too late to save
some crops.
   ``Corn is just laying there. Not enough moisture to germinate
it,'' said Buncombe County, N.C., extension agent Bobby Peek.
   ``A lot of our wells have gone dry, too,'' Peek said. ``They
usually come back in winter. But many didn't come back this winter.
The few wells we have are now going deeper. Five to six years ago,
150 feet was considered pretty deep for a well; now we go twice
that depth.''
   Tennessee Valley Authority reservoirs are dwindling, said
spokesman Richard Urban. Through May, the seven-state Tennessee
River basin got 13.7 inches of rain, against a normal 23 inches.
   The worst-hit lake in the TVA region is Fontana Lake in western
North Carolina, which is 45 feet below normal, said Urban.
Tennessee's Douglas Lake, one of TVA's major tributary storage
reservoirs, is 22 feet below normal.
   Small-grain production in South Carolina has probably been cut
by at least one third by the weather, said Jake Barker, the
Anderson County extension service agent. ``Most of our fescue
pastures are burned or grazed out; corn is beginning to feel the
pressure, and soybean planting hasn't even begun.''
   In California, drought plagues a state where water demand is
growing with the population. San Francisco and Los Angeles have
ordered water rationing. Some emergency regulations pack stinging
penalties.
   ``February and March were the driest for that period this
century in the northern Sierra, which supplies more than half the
water the state uses,'' said Maurice Roos, chief hydrologist at the
state Department of Water Resources. ``That's what put a real hole
in the water supply picture.''
   That lack of snow has also left hydroelectric reservoirs falling
on the Columbia River in Washington, while at the same time water
must be released to help migrating salmon.
   Growers, who have been notified that irrigation allotments will
be as low as 35 percent of normal, are planning to use techniques
learned in the last drought and to pump water from underground,
said California Farm Bureau spokesman Mike Henry.
   Water storage was estimated in late May at about 80 percent of
normal in California's 151 largest reservoirs, but that includes
levels of just 47 percent of normal in the five North Lahontan
reservoirs in the eastern Sierra.

this year and next for the nation's salaried workforce, narrowly
outpacing expected inflation, according to a survey.
   The Conference Board, a private business-information group,
reported Thursday that salaries of workers who were covered by
overtime and other labor law provisions, such as clerical workers,
would rise an average of 4.8 percent this year.
   Salaries of exempt workers, such as management and
professionals, would rise an average of 5 percent, while executive
salary increases would average 5.4 percent, the group reported.

   Financier Carl C. Icahn has tripled to $300
million the money he would forfeit if he failed to raise the
necessary financing for his takeover offer for Texaco Inc.
   Texaco's largest shareholder also pledged in a statement on
Thursday that the money would go to Texaco stockholders, rather
than the company's general treasury.
   Icahn's bid of $60 a share, which values Texaco at $14.6
billion, has failed to impress Wall Street. Since it was announced
last month, shares of the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant have
traded $9 to $10 below his offer.
   In nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues
Thursday, Texaco closed at $51.37{, down 12{ cents a share.
   Texaco's board rejected Icahn's bid for the 85.2 percent of the
company's shares he does not already own. It also refused to put
the matter up for a vote by stockholders at the annual meeting June
17.
   On Thursday, a company statement said Icahn's latest move
``changes exactly nothing.''
   ``And nothing is exactly what he is offering the Texaco
shareholder,'' it added. ``Because he has attached such a jungle of
strings, conditions and red tape to his so-called guarantee, it
doesn't matter what number he attaches to it _ he's never put up a
dime and we are convinced he would never have to.''
   Icahn's proposal includes provisions that the money would not be
forfeited if another bid in excess of $60 per share materialized,
or if the Internal Revenue Service failed to approve his proposal.
   Those provisions duplicate others in his original bid, except
that in that case, Icahn only offered to put $100 million into
escrow and said it would be forfeited to the company if he could
not finance the offer.
   On Thursday Icahn said he would triple that amount _ but changed
the potential recipient of the money to Texaco's shareholders,
instead of the company.
   ``The guarantee is $1.50 in cash per share to all Texaco
stockholders of record for a special stockholder meeting we are
seeking,'' Icahn said in a statement.
   Icahn is joining four colleagues in running for five board seats
up for election at the company's annual meeting.
   He says he wants the seats on the 14-member board to pressure
the board to put his takeover proposal before the company's
approximately 211,000 shareholders.
   Both sides have been waging intense efforts to woo the
shareholders' support in the proxy battle.
   Since Monday, the company has announced several developments in
its plan to sell $5 billion worth of assets, including the sale of
its West German subsidiary for $1.2 billion and a pledge to
distribute a third of the proceeds from all of the sales to
shareholders.
   The company was vague about exactly how those proceeds would be
spread, saying it would come in cash, some form of security or in a
stock buyback plan. But it promised shareholders would see their
third of the proceeds by the end of the year.
   On Thursday, Icahn said he was sending letters to Texaco
shareholders telling them they had everything to gain and nothing
to lose with his proposal.
   ``Even if for some reason you do not want Icahn on the Texaco
board for the long term, you have nothing to lose by voting for us,
because either you will get $60 or better or he will be off the
board,'' Icahn wrote.
   He was referring to an earlier pledge that the slate would
resign if his bid is rejected in a subsequent shareholder vote.
   In his announcement on the $300 million guarantee, Icahn took
another swipe at management, saying his side had ``absolutely no
confidence that (it) would or could use the funds in a manner
beneficial to stockholders.''
   ``Management has shown us that they are unable to generate an
acceptable rate of return on assets,'' he said.
   Texaco, in its response, characterized the financier's recent
moves as ``desperate ploys,'' saying that ``in contrast, Texaco has
already taken real action to build real value for all its
shareholders.''

   Oil futures prices have slipped lower, as
traders remain apathetic in a market devoid of any price-supporting
news.
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
fell 26 cents per barrel to finish at $17.07 on Thursday.
   Among refined products, contracts for July delivery of wholesale
unleaded gasoline settled down 0.64 cent at 49.70 cents a gallon,
and wholesale heating oil closed at 44.90 cents a gallon, down 1.03
cents.
   ``Most of the declines have been on relatively light volume,''
said John O'Connell of the commodities firm Refco Inc. ``There's
just no buyers.''
   Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said the selloff
in crude accelerated late in the session when prices dipped below
technical support levels, and speculators began liquidating
positions.
   Prices were depressed by a lack of developments deemed
supportive of prices, and by perceptions that OPEC producers still
had not unified over production controls that could help boost
prices, according to market analysts. Oil ministers of the
13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will begin
talks in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday.
   They are expected to discuss possible production cuts to defend
the official price target of $18 a barrel.
   Deepening the underlying bearish sentiment was the lack of any
agreement about production quotas during meetings of six Arab
members of OPEC oil-producing nations in Algiers. The meetings,
which took place during a three-day Arab summit, broke up Thursday.

   Computer chiefs at some of the nation's biggest
companies have nice things to say about IBM, or nothing to say at
all, according to a survey in the forthcoming issue of
InformationWeek.
   Ninety-three percent of the corporate information managers who
responded to the InformationWeek survey agreed that International
Business Machines Corp. is a positive influence on the marketplace,
while none disagreed and 7 percent said they were undecided.
   But of the 50 executives invited to participate in the survey,
19 declined to participate in spite of promises of anonymity. Their
names were chosen from the top echelon of the Fortune 500 and
InformationWeek's own list of the 100 biggest computer users.
   On other questions, 26 percent said IBM exerts unfair influence
on the competition while 58 percent disagreed and 16 percent said
they were undecided.
   Sixteen percent said IBM was too big, while 58 percent disagreed
and 26 percent were undecided.
   Sixty-four percent said IBM was fairly treated by the media,
while 13 percent disagreed and 23 percent were undecided.
   The report is part of the magazine's special IBM issue, due out
Monday. Because of the small and select size of the sample, the
results are not necessarily applicable to computer users in general.

   The dollar fell slightly against major currencies
in quiet European trading early today, and gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said traders were cautiously looking
ahead to Tuesday's release of U.S. trade figures for April.
   ``People aren't willing to open big positions ahead of the
figures, unless they have a strong opinion,'' said one dealer at a
large West German bank in Frankfurt.
   Some said the figures were causing particular trepidation
because, for the first time, they would be issued on a seasonally
adjusted basis, as well as an unadjusted basis.
   Mid-morning rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7150 West German marks, down from 1.7230; 1.4305
Swiss francs, down from 1.4370; 5.7905 French francs, down from
5.8155; 1.9259 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9330; 1,275.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,280.50; and 1.2175 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2211.
   The British pound rose to $1.82 from $1.81.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.85 Japanese yen, down from
125.43 yen. In London trading later today, the dollar held steady
at 124.85 yen.
   London's main bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
mid-morning of $457.10 a troy ounce, up from $455.25 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold traded at a bid of $456.90, up from $455.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $457.99, up
from $456.59.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $7.14 a troy ounce,
up from $7.08.

   Share prices and the dollar fell in Tokyo trading
today after an overnight drop on Wall Street.
   The dollar finished the week at 124.85 yen, down 0.58 yen from
Thursday's close.
   After opening at 124.72 yen, the U.S. currency dipped farther
and briefly touched 124.60, its low today, in early morning
trading. The dollar recovered the loss in the afternoon, peaking at
124.95 yen.
   The dollar was stronger than expected throughout the day, said
Hiroaki Shukuzawa of Sumitomo Bank. He said Japanese trust banks
actively bought the dollar to sustain the level, but profit-taking
kept it from reaching the 125-yen level.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected
issues, the exchange's main barometer, plunged 151.66 points, or
0.50 percent, from Thursday's close to end the week at 27,920.36.
   ``Investors were tiring of continuous record highs and seemed to
have set up a new position,'' said a broker at a major securities
firm. ``There was also profit-taking. But large shares, like steel
and heavy electric shares, are still doing well,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume was a heavy 2.2 billion shares.

   Consumer prices, restrained by a novel
inflation-fighting campaign, rose 1.9 percent in May to register
the smallest increase since November 1981, the government reported.
   It was the fourth consecutive month that the inflation rate had
eased.
   The Bank of Mexico, the nation's central bank, on Thursday
attributed the brighter price picture to the government program
unveiled by President Miguel de la Madrid in mid-December.
   The results, it said, ``show clearly that, as a consequence of
the Economic Solidarity Pact, the inflationary process has been
deaccelerated in a sustained manner.''
   De la Madrid announced the program after officials became
worried that the nation was on the verge of spiraling into
hyper-inflation, a problem that has plagued other Latin American
countries.
   Consumer prices skyrocketed a record 159.2 percent last year. In
January, those costs soared 15.5 percent for the biggest one-month
gain.
   Prices climbed 8.3 percent in February, 5.1 percent in March and
3.1 percent in April.
   The report said overall consumer prices rose 1.1 percent in the
last two weeks of May.
   The producer price index _ those costs paid by producers of
goods and services _ went up 1.0 percent in May.
   A key component of the inflation-fighting program is a freeze on
the minimum wage, prices of government-regulated goods and services
and the exchange rate of the peso currency.
   At the end of last month, the government announced the freeze
would be extended through August.
   The economic program, as initially drafted, called for the
monthly indexing of wages and prices. But administration officials
reworked the program into a mini-shock plan featuring the wage and
price freezes.
   Prices on government-controlled goods and services, such as
tortillas, subway fares and gasoline, have been held steady since
March.
   The exchange rate for the peso currency also has been frozen
since then, continuing to trade at about 2,260 pesos to the U.S.
dollar.
   In April, the government froze the minimum wage for unskilled
workers at 8,000 pesos a day or about $3.50.

<HEAD>Payless Officials Consider Leveraged Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior officials at Payless Cashways
Inc. are exploring a leveraged buyout of the building materials
retailer, the company says.
   But New York financier Asher B. Edelman, who is leading an
investor group considering a takeover of Payless, said he planned
to ask the company to share information so his group can consider a
competing offer.
   Payless made the announcement late Thursday in response to
rumors earlier in the day that management was considering a buyout
at $30 a share.
   The company said in a statement members of its senior management
were considering submitting a leveraged buyout proposal to a
special committee of the company's board of directors. The proposal
``contemplates per-share consideration valued in the mid-20s,'' the
statement said.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out a
company and then pay off the debt with the target company's cash
flow or the sale of its assets.
   The company said there was no guarantee that an offer would be
made or, if so, how it would be structured. Officials declined
further comment.
   If a cash offer of $25 a share is made, it would cost about $840
million to buy all of the company's stock.
   Payless stock closed at $24.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Thursday.
   Edelman said he planned to talk to his attorneys and then
request the information that Payless' senior management was using
to evaluate the company's worth.
   ``They have put the company up for sale, and it should go to the
highest bidder,'' Edelman said. ``I would hope to be among the
bidders. We want the information that the leveraged buyout is being
based on in order to have the ability to compete on a level and
illuminated playing field against the company to acquire the
company.''
   Payless has been considered a takeover target of a group led by
Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a privately owned
competitor of Payless. The group has not made an offer for the
company.
   The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless' largest shareholder,
with about 3.34 million shares, or about 9.9 percent of the
company's outstanding shares.
   David Stanley, chairman of Payless, has said an
Edelman-Sutherland takeover would not be in the best interests of
the company or its shareholders.

   A federal jury began its fourth day of
deliberations today in the trial of three cigarette makers sued
over the lung-cancer death of a woman who smoked their brands over
40 years.
   The six-member panel asked no questions Thursday during about
seven hours of talks over the claims of Antonio Cipollone.
Deliberations, which began Tuesday, were scheduled to continue
today.
   Cipollone is seeking damages for the 1984 death of his
58-year-old wife, Rose. He claims Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris
Inc. and Lorillard Inc. misled the public and his wife about the
dangers of smoking cigarettes.
   The companies say she made her own decision to smoke, knowing
the risks. They also say smoking is not a proven cause of cancer,
and that in any case, her cancer was not linked to the type usually
associated with cigarettes.
   On Wednesday, the jurors asked to see a copy of Mrs. Cipollone's
testimony to lawyers before she died.

<HEAD>An Effort to Make American Grain As Clean as the Competitors'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for Weekly Farm.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If a group of farm-state lawmakers has its
way, the government will soon start paying more for less _ less
dirt in grain, that is.
   Legislation approved by the House last month would establish a
pilot project to pay some farmers a higher price for cleaner grain.
The idea is to keep grain free of dust, broken kernels, chaff and
foreign materials such as weed seeds. The Senate Agriculture
Committee endorsed a similar proposal last Wednesday.
   ``I just think we need to build incentives into our whole grain
delivery system that encourage farmers to deliver a cleaner product
and encourage the handlers of grain to keep the product clean once
it's delivered to them clean,'' says Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., a
sponsor of the measure.
   He and others contend that the United States needs to improve
the cleanliness of grain it offers to foreign buyers. Canada and
Australia, two major wheat exporters, have established reputations
for selling high-quality, clean grain.
   ``The global grain market is going to become increasingly
competitive in the 1990s and I don't want to see American farmers
lose the sale of one bushel of grain because cleaner grain was
available someplace else,'' says Slattery.
   Wheat delivered to Japan between 1983 and 1987 from the United
States contained almost twice as much foreign material and
``dockage'' as that arriving from Canada and nearly 2.5 times as
much as from Australia, according to information from U.S. Wheat
Associates and the Japan Food Agency.
   Under the current U.S. system, federal standards call for
discounts on dirty grain but allow for a certain amount of foreign
material in shipments of grain.
   To take advantage of the system, the industry blends clean grain
with dirtier grain, which is purchased at lower prices, to form
average shipments selling at market prices. In fact, it is through
this blending of grain that the industry largely earns its profit,
critics say.
   Gary Gilbert, a Clay Center, Kan. elevator operator, is an
outspoken advocate of cleaner grain, which he says is cheaper to
store and transport.
   The grain takes up less space. Drying and aeration costs less.
Clean grain also is safer to handle because there is less of a
hazard from explosive dust. Cleaning grain also reduces insect
damage. Insects feed on and live in the fine trashy materials at
issue in the clean grain controversy.
   From his county elevator perspective, Gilbert sees the solution
as a system that removes the profit-making incentives for grain
blending and instead provides premiums for the delivery of clean
grain by producers and in keeping it clean all the way to export
terminals.
   ``We have to have an incentive program there that everytime we
handle it we want it to be the very best,'' says Gilbert.
   Under the House legislation, higher prices would be paid to
farmers in some areas for clean wheat, corn and soybeans placed
into the government price support loan program, which allows
farmers to forfeit their grain to the Commodity Credit Corporation
and keep the federal loan monies.
   A pilot project would be established for the 1989 crop year in
at least three multi-county areas: one in a wheat-growing region;
one in corn country and one in a soybean-producing region. The
Senate proposal by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., calls for six
experimental zones, two in each commodity.
   The House proposal provides for the secretary of the agriculture
Department to determine the areas, the amount of the premiums and
the grain cleanliness standard. The measure does not provide for
additional discounts for dirty or average grain. It also would not
apply to grain sold in commercial markets.
   Slattery's original bill called for a nationwide system of
higher prices for exceptionally clean CCC-stored grain, but that
was scaled back in order to build support.
   ``If the pilot project proves successful and if we can work the
kinks out of the concept, I hope that we can make this part of the
farm bill in 1990,'' says Slattery.
   Not everyone in the grain industry is sold on the legislation.
   ``I have some doubts on how helpful it might really be,'' says
Bob Petersen, president of the National Grain Trade Council. ``It's
probably a noble idea but looks to be incredibly complicated to
administer.''
   Under current grain standards, he maintains, foreign buyers can
specify extremely clean grain if they want to pay for it. Petersen
also says that the number of complaints about U.S. grain quality
has dropped this year.
   ``In a down market foreign complaints tend to assume a lot more
visibility than they do in a seller's market,'' he says.
   David Frey of the Kansas Wheat Commission says the success of
the proposal will depend upon the premiums fixed by USDA. He
worries that the experiment is too limited and will not provide
enough information to lawmakers on whether a price-incentive system
will work nationwide.
   ``The concept is excellent. I'm sorry that it's going to be just
in certain areas because I'd like to see it go across the
country,'' says Frey. ``There is the potential for it to very
significantly affect the way grain is physically handled in the
U.S.''

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.93 to 2,100.28 in

came in about where analysts had expected it to be.
   Brokers said there was quite possibly a feeling of relief among
investors that the news wasn't worse.

<HEAD>Arab Oil Ministers Fail to Agree on Production Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab oil ministers failed this week to
agree on production cuts called for in discussions with several
non-OPEC oil-exporting countries, officials said Friday.
   The Arab oil exporters remained divided between a
Western-oriented group resisting a 5 percent cut by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group led by
Algeria and Libya that supported it.
   The ministers met during this week's Arab Summit here.
   At a meeting in April, seven non-OPEC nations agreed to reduce
their exports by 183,000 barrels per day _ a 5 percent cut _ if
OPEC would implement a matching 5 percent cut.
   The OPEC countries, which have a current overall production
ceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day, offered to match the
proposed non-OPEC cut barrel-per-barrel, but could not agree on an
overall 5 percent cut that would have lowered their ceiling by
about 750,000 barrels per day.
   Algeria and Libya advocate production cuts while Saudi Arabia
and the Gulf emirates have defended their production levels.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers expressed the hope their differences could be overcome at
the meeting scheduled to open in Vienna on Saturday between OPEC
and non-OPEC producers.
   The Algerian News Agency distributed a statement that the Arab
oil ministers had reached an agreement ``on the need for all OPEC
member countries to adhere to their undertaking to respect their
production quotas and their defense of oil prices.''
   The statement appeared to be an attempt to present an appearance
of unanimity.
   The non-OPEC members involved in the dialogue with OPEC are
Angola, China, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Oman and Malaysia. Norway
is attending the meeting as observer, while Britain is not
represented.
   The oil ministers attending the Arab Summit, which closed
Thursday, were those of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates, Libya and Algeria.

weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-week layoff for 1,200 Chrysler Corp.
production workers in Kenosha will start Aug. 1 because of shortage
of steel and other materials.
   Doug Nicoll, Chrysler's manager of manufacturing public
relations, said Thursday the shortage resulted from a switch in
plans for building Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in Kenosha.
   Chrysler had announced in January it would halt such production
in mid-July, putting 5,500 employees out of work.
   ``We advised our suppliers accordingly,'' Nicoll said.
   But the automaker decided in late April to contine building the
L-body cars in Kenosha through the end of the year.
   ``We again advised our suppliers,'' Nicoll said. ``But our
suppliers had to get back on board and gear up their production.''
   There will be about a four-week time lag, he said.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Sharply Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with new buying
prompted by forecasts for hot, dry weather in the Midwest through
at least the middle of next week.
   Oat futures advanced their 10-cents-a-bushel daily limit,
soybean meal touched limit-up at the opening, and even wheat
futures advanced despite a bearish harvest projection issued
Thursday by the Agriculture Department.
   The USDA reduced its 1988 winter wheat production estimate by 3
percent to 1.57 billion bushels, but most analysts had expected a
lower number.
   Soybean contracts were up more than 20 cents in early trading
and the near-month contract, for July delivery, hit $9 a bushel for
the first time since late 1983.
   Corn futures also jumped but not as high as soybeans. Analysts
said soybeans, with a 30-cents-a-bushl daily price limit, tend to
attract more speculators than corn, which is restricted to moves of
10 cents a day.
   ``When people say `I want to buy something that's going up,'
they buy the beans,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   In early trading, wheat was 4{ cents to 6\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 3 cents
to 7} cents higher with July at $2.61 a bushel; oats were 5 cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.60 a bushel; soybeans were 7{
cents to 24{ cents higher with July at $9.07 cents a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .37 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at
72.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .28 cent
higher with August at 74.90 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent to
.35 cent higher with June at 51.35 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .67 cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at 50.20
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mostly lower on Thursday.

<HEAD>Former ZZZZ Best Vice President Pleads Guilty To Tax Fraud,
Conspiracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former executive of Barry Minkow's ZZZZ
Best Co. carpet-cleaning company pleaded guilty to four counts of
tax fraud, insider trading and conspiracy, saying he wants to make
amends for his crimes.
   Jack N. Polevoi, a former ZZZZ Best vice president, also
admitted in court Thursday he maintained a $200,000 slush fund for
Minkow's personal use and gambled away $42,000 in a frenzied
attempt to launder cash through Las Vegas casinos as the
once-mighty company crumbled.
   ``For several months, I convinced myself that I didn't do
anything wrong, but I tell you now, I know I did,'' an emotional
Polevoi told U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian. ``I want to pay
my dues. I want to get on with my life.''
   Polevoi was among 12 original defendants indicted on bank fraud,
securities fraud and racketeering charges in connection with ZZZZ
Best's sudden fall from a hot Wall Street commodity to bankruptcy.
   On the insider-trading charge, Polevoi said he and his brother,
Jerry, made $225,000 by selling 54,200 shares of ZZZZ Best stock
after they learned Minkow intended to resign because the company
was falling apart.
   Several company employees have admitted they helped Minkow carry
out a scheme that made it look like ZZZZ Best's earnings were
strong enough to qualify for millions of dollars in bank loans.
   Minkow, 22, the so-called ``whiz-kid'' who started the business
at age 15 in his parents' San Fernando Valley garage in California,
was forced to stage the fraud by organized crime figures, his
attorney said Thursday.
   Unable to post $1.5 million bail, Minkow is jailed at Terminal
Island, awaiting his Aug. 23 trial.
   Polevoi told the court that on Minkow's orders he kept a fund
prosecutors have estimated at more than $200,000 from which Minkow
allegedly bought cars, jewelry and, on occasion, concert tickets
for as many as 50 people.
   During ZZZZ Best's final days, Minkow asked Polevoi to take
$712,000 in cashiers' checks from corporate accounts and bank
drafts and convert them to cash in Las Vegas, Polevoi said.
   He told the court he briefly questioned the source of the money,
but ``When I heard Las Vegas, sparks just started flying. I didn't
care,'' Polevoi said.
   Sentencing was scheduled for Oct. 17. Polevoi faces a maximum of
16 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

<HEAD>NBC Amends Plans for Putting Business News Program on Cable TV</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5 grafs for 15th graf pvs, A call ... not returned., to
update with comment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Broadcasting Co. has decided against
buying the cable channel Tempo Television for its proposed business
news service but plans instead to lease time on the channel for the
new programming.
   The General Electric Co. unit, which owns the NBC Television
Network, cited tax considerations for its change in strategy.
   Buying the cable channel was seen as part of NBC President
Robert Wright's oft-stated plans to broaden the broadcasting
concern's business base.
   NBC announced last month it had signed a letter of intent to buy
Tempo Television, and would use it for new business news and sports
programming.
   Tempo Television, a unit of Tempo Enterprises Inc. of Tulsa,
Okla., currently provides outdoors, travel and informational
programming to about 12 million subscribers.
   NBC had planned to acquire the channel from Telecommunications
Inc., a Denver-based cable operator which is in the process of
buying Tempo Enterprises in a deal expected to close in the third
quarter.
   On Thursday, NBC and Telecommunications said they were
restructuring their plans to minimize ``tax and other complications
that arose from trying to separate Tempo Television from its
parent, Tempo Enterprises.''
   Under the new plan, the companies said NBC would lease time on
Tempo Television for a business news service that would run from 6
a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, starting in early 1989.
   ``Under the new arrangement, NBC will still own and manage the
business news service, but will reach existing Tempo TV subscribers
without actually purchasing Tempo TV,'' the announcement said.
   It said that Tempo Television would try to help the business
news service succeed by paying the first year's affiliation fee on
behalf of all current Tempo TV affiliates who continue to carry
Tempo fulltime after the launch of the business news service.
   John Draper, a spokesman for Telecommunications, said the new
arrangement ``gives NBC the same thing that they were after'' when
it planned to buy the cable channel _ access to a large base of
subscribers.
   He declined to specify how much NBC would pay for the lease. It
had been reported that NBC had agreed to pay about $20 million to
buy the channel.
   The statement did not indicate what the new plans were for
introduction of the proposed sports programing that NBC previously
said it would put on the cable channel.
   John Malone, president of Telecommunications, said in the
statement that his company will ``continue to explore with NBC the
best format for sports and other possible programming for a prime
time and weekend service.''
   Thomas S. Rogers, the NBC executive overseeing the Tempo deal,
was unavailable for comment.
   But Joseph Rutledge, an NBC spokesman, said today that the
change to a lease arrangement posed no obstacle to NBC
accomplishing what it set out to do.
   ``Some people choose to lease a car. Some people choose to buy a
car. Both people end up with transportation. We are ending up with
the very outcome we sought,'' he said.
   The new arrangement will give NBC access to cable subscribers, a
solid relationship with Telecommunications, which is the nation's
biggest cable operator, and an opportunity to develop two new
programming services for cable TV, Rutledge said.
   He said that NBC continues to talk with cable operators about
what they would like to see in a sports service and that NBC hopes
to begin developing sports programming for cable TV soon after the
business news service goes on the air.
   Wright was quoted in the statement as saying, ``The cable
industry has been very encouraging and we are enthusiastic about
our plans going forward.''

   Share prices rose on the London Stock Exchange
Friday for a second straight day, led higher late in the session by
a strong start on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 8.3
points, or 0.45 percent, higher at 1849.8.
   In New York, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
12.27 points at 2105.62 when London trading closed.
   London dealers said share prices were boosted by the
announcement that the U.S. producer price index for May rose a
modest 0.5 percent, slightly higher than April's 0.4 percent gain
and in line with most market expectations.
   ``The market reacted very well to some potentially bad news in
the PPI, which is a clear change of sentiment from the recent past
of taking good news and turning it around,'' said one British
analyst.
   ``People's estimates of PPI had been creeping up over the past
couple of days, so over time, it wasn't unanticipated,'' said Bob
Semple, an equities strategist at County Natwest WoodMac Ltd.
   Several dealers saw encouraging signs that Wall Street did not
lose the gains chalked up over the past week. ``People have been
loathe recently to take big positions but we're seeing a bit more
interest after this week's successful period of consolidation,''
one analyst said.
   ``There was some trepidation that Wall Street would erase
Wednesday's 50-point rise Thursday, and when that didn't happen, we
all breathed a sigh of relief,'' he said.

   Texas investor Robert M. Bass succeeded in
derailing Macmillan Inc.'s restructuring plan Friday when a state
judge in Delaware ordered the publishing giant to refrain from
paying a special dividend.
   Jack B. Jacobs, a judge in Chancery Court in Wilmington, Del.,
issued a temporary restraining order preventing Macmillan from
paying the $52.35-a-share dividend, which was to be the first phase
in a restructuring plan that also included splitting the company in
two.
   The move put pressure on the Macmillan board to either seriously
consider Bass's $1.9 billon buyout offer or to top it in some other
fashion. Earlier this week the board rejected Bass's offer as
inadequate.
   Analysts had expected some form of delay and said Macmillan was
now on the defensive.
   Macmillan stock, which had fallen $2.25 a share Thursday, jumped
$2.37{ a share to $75.87{ in afternoon trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   ``The market is saying that this is going to go back and forth a
few times yet,'' said Bruce Thorp, an analyst at Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia.
   Macmillan spokesman David Jackson said: ``I have no comment.
There's nothing to say.''
   Jacobs, who heard arguments at a crowded hearing for several
hours late Thursday, issued his decision the day Macmillan planned
to begin paying the dividend. The order will be in effect until a
hearing is held on whether a preliminary injunction should be
issued.
   Macmillan put a value of $64 a share on its restructuring, which
called for the special dividend and dividing the company's
publishing and information services operations into separate
publicly held concerns.
   Under the plan, Macmillan management would control 39 percent of
the new information company and would be provided lucrative
financial protections against losing their jobs after any takeover.
   Bass has offered to acquire Macmillan for $73 a share in cash,
or, alternatively, to pay a $58-a-share dividend in his own
restructuring. He already owns 9.1 percent of the company's 26
million shares outstanding.
   His attorneys argued that Macmillan's board breached its
fiduciary duties by failing to get the best price for its
shareholders.
   According to lawyers present at the hearing, Jacobs said
Macmillan shareholders could be harmed if the restructuring went
through.
   Coniston Partners, which controls 4.9 percent of Macmillan and
supported Bass's legal efforts, expressed pleasure at the judge's
decision.
   ``We're happy about it, but it was pretty patently obvious,''
said Coniston general partner Paul E. Tierney Jr. ``There's still a
law against stealing, and management was attempting a
recapitalization that transfered control to them without their
paying.''
   Principals of the aggressive New York investment firm value
Macmillan at between $85 and $100 a share and have said they are
seeking a ``full auction'' for the company.
   Analysts said the next move was Macmillan's. ``The whole point
of the injunction is to force Macmillan to respond to Bass's
offer,'' Thorp said.
   Both Bass and Coniston are likely to ``wait and see what
Macmillan comes back with'' before taking any further action, he
said.
   ``We have built our investment on the theory that ultimately the
shareholders'' will win out, Tierney said. ``We are vigilant
observers but have no comment on any action on our part.''
   Macmillan has its own legal action pending in federal court in
New York, where it has charged Bass and his affiliates with
violating securities laws, repeatedly filing and disseminating
false information and engaging in a ``creeping tenders.''

<HEAD>Western Union Accuses Former Executive of Setting Up Spy Network</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top Western Union Corp. executive
set up a network of ``double agents'' to establish a rival to the
troubled telecommunications company and used his position to steal
Latin American business from it, Western Union charges.
   But a lawyer for the executive, John Lanzelotti of Port Reading,
N.J., said Friday the suit was in retaliation for fee and expense
claims by Latin American agent companies, and denied the charges.
   Some of the defendants, who include former Western Union South
American sales agents and an Israeli company, illegally tried to
supply helicopters and other equipment to armed forces in Peru and
Ecuador and other countries, said the suit, filed Wednesday in
federal court in Newark.
   The suit also charges that defendants bribed communications
authorities in Latin American nations including Ecuador, Bolivia
and Suriname, to gain their business.
   Western Union claims that Lanzelotti, who left the company Feb.
12 after six years, worked on behalf of the alleged
``racketeering'' enterprise while he was Western Union's regional
vice president for the Western Hemisphere.
   ``It is our allegation that while Mr. Lanzelotti was a Western
Union employee, we are certain ... that he had put into place a
number of agents in Latin America that were truly double agents,''
said Western Union lawyer Susan Littman.
   The defendants had ``worldwide aspirations'' to set up a rival
telecommunications company to supply telex and electronic mail
services, she said. They used telex services Western Union provides
free to its employees to further their goals, even selling it to
others and keeping the money, the complaint said.
   The complaint provided little detail on the allegations about
helicopter sales, and Ms. Littman would not comment further.
   ``We know that (the defendants) were involved in these
activities as part of the conspiracy,'' she said.
   Lanzelotti, reached by telephone at his attorney's office in
Carteret, N.J., referred questions to his lawyer, Louis J.R. Kady.
Kady denied the claims but said he would not address them
specifically.
   ``Our position is that while he was working for Western Union,
(Lanzelotti) was working for Western Union, and did what he was
supposed to do for them,'' Kady said.
   He said the company was retaliating against firms that were
seeking expenses and fees from it.
   Lanzelotti had a ``substantial financial interest'' in
Woodbridge, N.J.-based Intelco International Inc. and related
companies in Panama and Venezuela, and ``announced'' he had become
Intelco's president on Feb. 11, the day he was fired, the suit said.
   Kady said Lanzelotti owns a third of Intelco's stock, but only
acquired it after leaving Western Union.
   He helped plan Western Union's strategies in dealing with Latin
American governments and communications authorities, and used his
position to steer business to Intelco and other defendants, the
suit said.
   When he learned last year that Western Union was bidding to
supply services to Brazil, Lanzelotti _ pretending to represent his
employer _ traveled there and tried to seize the opportunity for
himself and his alleged co-conspirators, the suit said.
   The defendants also tried to divert Western Union's business by
pretending Intelco was acting on its behalf, the complaint said.
   Western Union, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., recently
reorganized to avoid having to file for bankruptcy protection.

   Oat futures prices scored limit gains Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade while most other grain futures advanced
only slightly and soybeans closed mixed.
   New forecasts for rain in the western Grain Belt late this
weekend and early next week prompted heavy profit-taking in most of
the agricultural futures contracts late in the session, analysts
said.
   ``But if it's hot and dry over the weekend, we'll probably be
limit-up on Monday,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Karlin said plummeting futures prices for silver and crude oil
on other exchanges encouraged the sell-off in soybeans, corn and
wheat, all of which had traded sharply higher for most of the
session.
   Oat futures refused to retreat, reflecting the damage done to
the U.S. oat crop by drought conditions in the upper Midwest. The
contracts for July and September delivery closed up the
10-cents-a-bushel daily limit.
   ``We stayed locked limit-up all day,'' said Jay Homan, an
independent oat trader. ``Some opening orders never even got
filled.''
   At the close, wheat was 8 cents lower to 2} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.74 a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3\ cents higher with July at $2.57 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 10 cents higher with July at $2.60 a bushel; soybeans
were 5 cents lower to 9{ cents higher with July at $8.82 a bushel.

   The stock market gained ground today, extending
its recent rally in a relatively quiet session.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
producer price index of finished goods rose 0.5 percent in May.
   While the figure tended to confirm expectations that
inflationary pressures have increased slightly of late, it also
came in about where analysts had expected it to be.
   Brokers said there was quite possibly a feeling of relief among
investors that the news wasn't worse.
   In the bond market, which is especially sensitive to changes in
inflation expectations, interest rates were steady to slightly
lower.

<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers began arriving Friday
for their regular mid-year gathering, prepared to grapple again
with their biggest problem: how to deal with the world oil glut.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' 13 members
nations, most of whose delegations arrived a day before Saturday's
opening session, are deeply divided over ways to boost prices
through production cuts.
   The cartel is split over whether to change an existing agreement
among 12 of its members to limit daily production to 15.06 million
barrels. The pact, which was extended in December and is due to
expire June 30, was aimed at supporting oil prices at $18 a barrel,
but OPEC oil has been selling for about $1.50 below that.
   Iraq refused to sign because it wants a quota equal to that of
its enemy Iran.
   Oil experts predicted the cartel would be unable to reach a
consenus on how to tackle the problem and would end up extending
its existing agreement through the rest of the year.
   ``It will be a rollover of what they've got,'' said Harry
Neustein, a New York-based oil trader attending the OPEC meeting.
   The oil futures markets also showed little optimism Friday.
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
closed down 34 cents a barrel to $16.73 on Friday.
   Oil prices have been weak amid reports that many OPEC members
have exceeded the daily production cap and as worldwide oil
reserves continue to rise.
   In addition, some non-OPEC oil nations, which produce around
23.2 million barrels a day, failed in late Arpil to get OPEC to
agree to jointly cut production. That was the first major effort to
form a worldwide alliance among oil producers to boost prices.
   These competing non-OPEC producers, which are producing more and
more of the world's oil and now account for 60 percent of output,
also have been making significant new oil discoveries.
   Meanwhile, rumors have been circulating _ particularly out of
the Arab summit in Algeria this week _ that Iran and Iraq might be
close to agreeing to end their 8-year-old Persian Gulf war. That
would result in a sharp increase in the two countries' oil ouput,
putting further pressure on oil prices, experts said.
   OPEC's other members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.
   Longer-term, all oil producers are being asked to meet less of
the world's energy needs in the face of competition from other
sources _ natural gas, nuclear energy, coal and others.
   Crude oil provides about 50 percent of the world's energy.
Consumption of crude oil in non-Communist nations has fallen to 50
million barrels a day from a peak of 57 million barrels a day in
1979.
   Even though oil demand is expected to increase in the second
half of the year, ``you're living in a wash of energy now, not a
shortage of energy,'' said Neustein.

<HEAD>SEC Moves to Tighten Definition of No-Load Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Friday moved toward tightening the requirements for deciding
whether mutual funds can describe themselves as ``no-load'' funds.
   Mutual funds collect money from investors to purchase stocks,
bonds, precious metals or other securities or commodities and most
charge a management fee. The broker or agent who sells shares in
the fund also gets a sales fee.
   However, in no-load funds, which many investors prefer, the
shares are usually purchased directly from the fund and no sales
fee is charged. But, since 1980, no-load funds have been allowed to
use some of the money from investors to pay for certain sales and
promotional expenses.
   The commission voted 4-0 Friday to ask for comment on a proposal
that would tighten regulation of how these so-called ``12b-1''
expenses are assessed against mutual funds. It would also prohibit
funds that assess these hidden distribution charges from describing
themselves as no-load funds.
   SEC officials are expecting great interest from investment
companies on how the rules are structured. But Kathryn B. McGrath,
director of the division of investment management, said, ``We hope
individual investors would communicate with us on these rules'' as
well.
   In other action, the commission voted 4-0 to propose and ask for
comment on two measures designed to make it easier to trade U.S.
stocks internationally.
   Regulation of that area has become increasingly complex in
recent years with the explosion of new technology and the
globalization of financial markets.
   The first proposal would exempt foreign brokers from registering
with the SEC provided the broker lives outside the United States
and conducts all trading outside the country.
   However, if foreign brokers want to solicit sales from U.S.
institutional investors like pension and mutual funds, they would
have to work with a broker registered in the United States and
records relating to the sales would have to be kept within the
country.
   Unregistered foreign brokers would also be prohibited from
targeting sales at U.S. citizens abroad, such as personnel on
military bases.
   ``The thrust of this rule is to loosen up access to our markets
to foreign brokers, but when you come right down to the bottom
line, they have to have a connection with a U.S. broker,'' said SEC
Commissioner Aulana Peters.
   In the second measure, the SEC is proposing a new regulation
governing initial sales of U.S. corporate stock abroad. Stock
issued for sale to U.S. citizens has to be registered with the SEC,
but U.S. stock intended only for sale to foreigners need not be
registered.
   The proposal provides a 90-day period in which ``backflow''
sales to U.S. citizens would be restricted. The procedures are
aimed at preventing stock issuers from selling stocks abroad solely
as a means of circumventing SEC registration requirements.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures to be Traded on Comex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's leading exchange for platinum
futures, faced with a shortage of elbow room, has accepted an offer
to move its platinum trading pit to the floor of the world's
leading gold and silver exchange, officials said Friday.
   The agreement between the Commodity Exchange, the premier market
for gold and silver futures, and the New York Mercantile Exchange
will require approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
officials said.
   The Comex and the Nymex, New York's two largest futures
exchanges, operate side-by-side along with three other futures
exchanges in the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.
   Space is at a premium, but the Comex has found itself with an
empty trading pit or ``ring'' since the failure earlier this year
of a corporate-bond index contract, said Gina Greer, a Comex
spokeswoman.
   ``Since everyone is so crowded here, we thought we'd be nice
guys and offer them, at a price, that ring,'' she said.
   Nymex Chairman William M. Bradt said the Nymex board accepted
the proposal on Wednesday and was awaiting final approval from the
Comex board.
   Under the agreement, Comex members would be allowed to trade
platinum futures for their own accounts but not for clients, Bradt
said.
   In return for the use of its pit, Nymex would pay Comex half of
the annual platinum clearing fees or $1 million a year, whichever
is more.
   Bradt said the change would probably stimulate greater trading
volume in both platinum and gold futures.
   The Nymex board also voted to continue merger discussions with
Comex, he said.

   Gold prices fell sharply Friday as a late flurry
of selling took hold after the metal had posted gains overseas.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$449 a troy ounce as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, down from $456.75 an ounce
late Thursday.
   Traders said weaker commodity prices pushed gold sharply lower.
One trader described the drop as ``a big shakeout for gold.''
   Oil prices took another hit, falling below the $17-a-barrel mark
as the upcoming meeting of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries kept the market under pressure.
   Dealers also cited a report that surfaced late in the day that
Venezuela plans to sell up to a million ounces of bullion as
helping to push gold prices lower.
   On the currency front, the dollar rose in domestic dealings
after falling overseas as traders wound down their positions ahead
of next week's report on the U.S. trade deficit. Traders said the
Labor Department's report Friday that wholesale prices rose a
moderate 0.5 percent in May had no impact on the currency market.
   ``There was absolutely not much going on,'' said Lou Calvello, a
trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``There was the basic squaring of positions going into the
weekend, and ahead of the trade figures,'' he said. The government
is schedule to issue its merchandise trade report on Tuesday.
   ``We should see a lot of action after the trade figures are
released, depending on what they are,'' Calvello said.
   Trading also was quiet in Europe, where the dollar finished
lower.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 124.85 Japanese yen, down
from 125.43 yen. In London late Friday the dollar traded at 124.85
yen, the same level as in Tokyo.
   But in New York, the dollar closed at 124.88 yen, up from 124.60
yen on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8175 late Friday, more
expensive than Thursday's late $1.8117. Later in New York, it cost
$1.8178 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8215 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.7211 West German marks, up from 1.7143;
1.4390 Swiss francs, up from 1.4308; 5.8135 French francs, up from
5.7935; 1,278.88 Italian lire, up from 1,274.50, and 1.2200

<HEAD>Offer for Centel Still Stands Despite Rejection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor said Friday that his group's $2.8
billion cash bid to take over Centel Corp. still stands, despite
rejection by the company's chairman.
   The investment group led by Asher B. Edelman and George L.
Lindemann had set a June 10 deadline in a letter announcing their
bid late last month.
   Centel Chairman John P. Frazee Jr. dismissed the offer when it
was received May 31 after consulting the company's board of
directors and investment bankers, and has not reconsidered,
spokesman Bill White said Friday.
   ``The proposal was not a credible offer,'' White said. ``We said
at that time we believed that the offer ... was a tactical device
designed to affect the outcome of the proxy fight.''
   Edelman's group has proposed a three-man slate of directors to
fill slots on Centel's 11-member board. Shareholders will have a
chance to decide between those candidates and a three-man slate
nominated by Centel at the company's annual meeting on June 28,
White said.
   Edelman, a New York-based financier whose group holds 5.5
percent of Centel's stock, denied that the takeover bid was a
maneuver in the proxy fight.
   But he said in a telephone interview Friday, ``I think the
shareholders certainly will look hard at what we've done about our
position in our company.''
   Edelman said Frazee's ``unilateral turn-down of our offer ...
will show the shareholders exactly what type of person he is and
what he thinks of their interests.''
   In the initial letter to Centel management, Edelman and
Lindemann, chairman of a New York-based mobile phone business
called Metro Mobile CTS Inc., said their group was willing to pay
$65 a share for each of Centel's approximately 43 million shares
outstanding.
   But they conditioned the offer on Centel's canceling an
agreement to pay $763 million to buy United Telespectrum, the
cellular telephone subsidiary of United Telecommunications of
Kansas City. They said they would drop the bid to $60 a share if
Centel held to the deal, which was announced in late May.
   Frazee said at the time that the company's plan to acquire
United Telespectrum and its $9.5 million debt would provide a far
better return for investors than any short-term gain under the
Edelman group's proposal to sell off Centel assets to boost stock
values.
   Centel is going ahead with plans to acquire United Telespectrum,
White said.
   Edelman called the United Telespectrum deal ``overpriced'' and
said if it's completed, his group would tender its lower offer for
Centel.

<HEAD>Soybeans Slump on Rain Forecasts; Oat Rally Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oat prices rose the maximum allowed Friday, but most other grain
future contracts advanced only slightly and soybeans fell in a
volatile session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, energy prices fell sharply; precious metals
decreased; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index
futures fell.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 agricultural and
industrial commodities slipped .55 point to 257.65.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, new forecasts for rain in the
western Grain Belt over the weekend and early next week prompted
heavy profit-taking in most of the agricultural futures pits late
in the session, analysts said.
   ``But if it's hot and dry over the weekend, we'll probably be
limit-up on Monday,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago, referring to the limits on daily
changes in contract prices.
   Trading in the soybean pit became hectic in the final hour,
which saw the soybean contract for July delivery plunge from a
contract high of $9.14 a bushel to $8.56 before rebounding to
finish at $8.84.
   Oat futures bucked the trend for grains, however, reflecting the
damage done to the U.S. oat crop by drought conditions in the upper
Midwest. The contracts for July and September delivery rose the
daily limit of 10 cents a bushel.
   ``We stayed locked limit-up all day,'' said Jay Homan, an
independent oat trader. ``Some opening orders never even got
filled.''
   The National Weather Service's 6-to 10-day outlook called for
above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal rainfall for
the Midwest during the latter half of next week.
   Wheat settled 7 cents lower to 2} cents, higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.73} a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 4 cents higher, with July at $2.57} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 10 cents higher, with July at $2.60 a bushel; and
soybeans were 8 cents lower to 5{ cents higher, with July at $8.84
a bushel.
   Crude-oil futures fell below $17 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, bringing the decline for the week to about 75
cents.
   Technical factors and skepticism about the mid-year meeting of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries kept the energy
markets under pressure, analysts said.
   News reports ahead of the OPEC meeting, which begins Saturday in
Vienna, Austria, have highlighted the rift between members who want
to limit oil production and those who think quotas should be
raised, said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   The disagreement is not new but ``when you've got a market
that's hungry for information, it's going to react to what it's
been given,'' he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 35 cents
lower, with the July contract at $16.73 a barrel; heating oil was
.06 cent to .67 cent lower, with July at 44.25 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .48 cent to .68 cent lower, with July at
49.22 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures posted steep losses on New York's
Commodity Exchange on technical factors and in response to the late
drop in soybean futures, analysts said.
   Some traders who had been expecting a strong inflation signal
were disappointed by the government's report of a 0.5 percent rise
in wholesale prices last month, said Peter Cardillo, commodity
trading adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   ``There were those that were looking for a higher number,'' he
said.
   Gold settled $8 to $9.20 lower, with the August contract at
$453.30 a troy ounce; and silver was 16.5 cents to 16.6 cents
lower, with July at $7.015 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures
retreated, while feeder cattle were mixed, reflecting expectations
that cash cattle prices have passed their seasonal peak, said
Charlie Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   Hog futures were mixed despite low cash prices, with support
stemming from technical buying after two days of losses at the
maximum allowed, he said.
   Frozen pork bellies declined sharply as the market continued to
seek a level that will stimulate demand for the near-record number
of bellies in cold storage, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .57 cent lower, with the June
contract at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent lower
to .25 cent higher, with August at 75.25 cents a pound; hogs were
.20 cent lower to .78 cent higher, with June at 51.15 cents a
pound; and frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to 1.15 cents lower,
with July at 50.07 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures finished slightly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settling .35 point lower at 271.10.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were narrowly mixed Friday, showing
little reaction to the government's report of moderate inflation
during May but finishing below the day's highs following a late
selloff.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 3-32 point in price, with its
yield unchanged from late Thursday at nearly 9.04 percent.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that wholesale prices rose
a moderate 0.5 percent in May, roughly the same as in the two
previous months.
   Buyers of fixed-income securities such as bonds watch indicators
like the government's producer price index for signals of
accelerating inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
investments. But Friday's report largely was in line with forecasts
of economists and prompted little movement in bond prices, analysts
said.
   Analysts also noted that bond prices, which move inversely from
interest rates, hit their highs of the day as oil futures prices
fell late in the trading session.
   Furthermore, analysts said, bond prices may have been aided by
sluggishness in the federal funds rate, the interest charged on
overnight loans between banks and a widely watched indicator of
short-term rate trends. Fed funds traded at 7 5-16 percent late
Friday, up only slightly from 7\ percent late Thursday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were
unchanged to 1-16 point higher and long-term issues rose [ point,
according to the Telerate business information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.04 to 109.77. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.31
to 1,148.70.
   Among corporate issues, industrials were up \ point and
utilities rose [ point, both in light trading, according to the
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.58 to 281.55.
   Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, general obligations were up ]
point and dollar bonds were \ point higher. Trading was active.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was up 3-16 point at 88 23-32 as of 3 p.m.
EDT. The average yield fell to 8.05 percent from 8.07 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up one basis point at
6.44 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.64 percent and one-year bills
were up 1 basis point at 6.95 percent.

<HEAD>Icahn Forming New Holding Company For Possible Texaco Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn said Friday he
was forming a new holding company to act as his sole vehicle for
acquisitions, including a possible hostile takeover bid for Texaco
Inc.
   Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder, said the holding company
intended to raise up to $3.25 billion through an offering of $500
million to $750 million in common stock and about $2.5 billion in
debt securities.
   The Icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the
holding company, including its 36.1 million shares of Texaco and
its interests in Trans World Airlines Inc. and ACF, a leasing
company.
   In a news release issued late Friday, Icahn indicated that
acquisitions to be pursued by the new holding company included the
possible pursuit of Texaco, in which Icahn controls a 14.8 percent
stake.
   Texaco has rejected Icahn's proposal for a buyout of the company
for $60 per common share, which values the company at $14.6 billion.
   Icahn also is running himself and four colleagues for five board
seats up for election at the company's annual meeting in an attempt
to pressure Texaco to let its shareholders vote on his buyout offer.
   Icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the
board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer, he would
consider making a hostile bid through the new holding company at
yet to be determined terms.
   Texaco stock rose 62{ cents to $51.87{ a share Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   A spokesman for the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant said
Texaco had no immediate comment on Icahn's announcement.
   Icahn has indicated previously that he might consider a hostile
bid for Texaco, but had yet to make any public moves in that
direction until Friday.
   Separately, a federal judge in White Plains ordered Icahn's
proxy solicitors to stop making false statements in soliciting
support from Texaco shareholders in the board election.
   U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel made the ruling after viewing
a videotape of Thursday's MacNeil-Lehrer Report on the Public
Broadcasting System.
   On the program, an unidentified employee of D.F. King, an Icahn
proxy solicitor, said Icahn had $100 million in escrow to return to
shareholders should he be unable to finance his takeover bid.
   Icahn has stated that if Texaco put his $60 a share offer to a
shareholder vote he would end his proxy fight and put the $100
million in escrow, for payment to shareholders in the event he
could not arrange financing for the bid by the date of the
shareholder vote. On Thursday, he raised the guarantee to $300
million.
   The money has not yet been placed in escrow, contrary to the
D.F. King employee's remarks on the broadcast. Texaco sought an
outright correction, but Goettel said an evidentiary hearing must
take place first and only enjoined solicitors from making false
remarks.

<HEAD>DOT Administrative Law Judge Recommends That United Retain Route</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Department of Transportation law judge said
Friday there was ``no public interest reason'' to yank the
Seattle-Tokyo air route from United Airlines and recommended that
applications by American and Continental airlines to take over the
route be rejected.
   The department now has 90 days to reach a final decision in the
bitter dispute over the route flown by United since 1983.
   Judge Burton Kolko said that if United were to be replaced on
the route he would recommend that American take its place, but
Kolko said he could find no reason to do so.
   ``The only calls for United's removal are from those who would
profit in its stead,'' said Kolko. ``If United is deficient in
meeting passengers' needs ... then it has managed to fool a lot of
people.''
   While conceeding that both American and Continental could
``operate profitably on this route,'' Kolko said United had a
proven record of sucessful operation of the route.
   ``With this decision from Judge Kolko, we are confident that the
Department of Transportation will rule in our favor and allow
United to keep this route in which we have invested heavily over
the past 21 years,'' said Stephen Wolf, United president, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Kolko said that United had strong support from the Seattle
community and elected officials and its connecting route network in
both the Far East and domestically was broader than the other two
airlines.
   Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman and president, said
Kolko's decision was ``antithetical to the U.S. national
interests.''
   ``We simply cannot understand why the law judge _ despite the
fact that DOT has repeatedly called for competition in the Pacific
from several West Coast hubs by multiple U.S. carriers _ would
recommend leaving all three West Coast gateways in the hands of a
single airline,'' Crandall said.
   Kolko said that even though some ``pooh-pooh'' the importance of
United's other routes in Asia ``it is a major public interest
matter'' for those traveling to the Far East.
   Kolko rejected arguments from both Continental and American that
the lower fares they planned to introduce would increase
competition.
   ``Only the most Pollyanish can believe that the fare proposals
in this case will ever see the light of day,'' Kolko said, adding
that because of Japanese resistance to lower fares the proposals
from American and Cotinental were ``pie-in-the-sky.''
   Kolko also dismissed statements from the other airlines that
United had tried to ``blackmail'' Seattle officials and the
department into supporting its effort to retain the route by
threatening to scale back operations at Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport if it wasn't sucessful.
   ``It is clear that this community wants United for reasons that
transcend `route case blackmail,''' Kolko said.
   During hearings before Kolko earlier this year, Wolf said it
would be unfair for the department to strip his airline of the
route after it spent years trying to acquire it, sunk millions of
dollars into developing it and at a time when it was just becomming
profitable.
   Crandall told Kolko that United, which also flies between Los
Angeles and Tokyo, and San Francisco and Tokyo, wanted to retain
the Seattle route just to block other airlines from gaining a
foothold in the Far East market.
   Crandall said that if American were awarded the route, it would
expand aggressively into Asian markets and was committed to
building a new hub at Sea-Tac at a cost of between $100 million and
$150 million.
   United had previously warned that it would have to cancel its
Seattle-Hong Kong route if it lost the Tokyo route and transfer
many of its 3,000 workers based at Sea-Tac.
   A $20 million United expansion at Sea-Tac was also put on hold
pending a decision on the route.
   Continental Chairman Frank Lorenzo told Kolko that his airline
was prepared to introduce vigorous price competition into the
Pacific market if it was awarded the Seattle-Tokyo route including
one-way fares as low as $299.

<HEAD>Pentagon Canceling Electronic Warfare Equipment Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force on Friday accused one of its
large contractors of defaulting on a key electronics contract,
saying it was canceling the order and would demand repayment of $39
million in progress payments.
   It also vowed to force the company, the Eaton Corp., to cover
any extra costs the government incurred in finding a new contractor
to perform the work.
   The Air Force said it was ``terminating for default'' an $81.5
million contract awarded four years ago to Eaton's AIL Division in
Deer Park, N.Y., for development of a new tactical jamming system
for its EF-111A jet aircraft.
   The EF-111A is an electronic warfare version of the F-111
bomber, meaning it is specially equipped to fool or jam enemy radar
and radio systems during bombing attacks. The Air Force had planned
to upgrade its fleet of 42 such planes after Eaton developed the
new jamming system.
   Eaton was selected for the development work in October 1984
after it won a bidding contest with the Grumman Corp.
   The Air Force said Friday it was terminating the contract
because Eaton was now estimating it would cost $153 million to
perform the work _ or an overrun of $71.5 million _ and an extra 30
months beyond the specified completion date of July 1987.
   ``The contractor was terminated for failure to make progress, so
as to endanger performance, and for failure to meet a required
delivery,'' the Air Force said in a statement.
   ``Alternatives to this contract are now being addressed by a
high-level steering group convened by the commander of the Air
Force Systems Command,'' the service added.
   Renald Romain, a spokesman for the Cleveland, Ohio-based Eaton,
declined comment beyond asserting: ``The the company believes it
has meritorious defenses against claims which the Air Force may
assert in connection with this termination.''
   Eaton has been attempting to sell its AIL Division since last
October, to date without success. That division had earlier come
under fire for technical deficiencies in producing similar
electronic warfare gear for the new B-1B bomber.
   According to Gerda Parr, an Air Force spokeswoman, Eaton AIL had
received progress payments totaling slightly more than $39 million
since winning the contract in 1984.
   As far as the Air Force is concerned, only $19,500 worth of work
was delivered ``and we will immediately demand repayment of the $39
million in progress payments,'' she said.
   ``The government's position also is that AIL is legally
responsible for any additional costs that the government may incur
as a result of reprocuring from another contractor.''

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers and a Brighton car
customizing firm continued contract talks Friday aimed at ending a
650-worker strike that has halted production of the Ford Mustang
convertible and other vehicles.
   ``They're pretty close. We're still hoping we can get that thing
settled,'' said Stan Marshall, director of UAW Region IC, which
includes Brighton.
   Workers at C&C, which stands for Cars & Concepts, voted to be
represented by the UAW earlier this year but company protests
delayed certification of the union until April 1, Marshall said.
   When negotiations on C&C's first UAW contract bogged down,
leaders of newly formed UAW Local 4077 set a strike deadline for
midnight Tuesday, then extended it 10 a.m. Wednesday, when workers
walked out.
   Marshall said the two sides still had to settle differences over
wages, seniority rights, pensions and other benefits. Wages for
jobs in the same classification can range from $4 an hour to $11 an
hour.
   The UAW wants workers who do the same job to be paid the same
wage, Marshall said.
   C&C Inc., which also is modifying Chrysler Corp. models for
export to Europe and working on four-wheel-drive chassis for
General Motors Corp., is owned by Masco Industries Inc.
   The strike interrupted production of the Ford Mustang
convertible, which Ford spokesman Rod Seib said was the
best-selling convertible in the United States during 1987.
   Seib said the strike is costing Ford and its dealers about 160
Mustang convertibles a day during the height of the convertible
selling season. Ford sold 25,212 of the convertibles in 1987 and
has room to build about 33,000 in 1988.
   All Mustang models remain in short supply _ 35 days' worth
compared to the industry norm of 60-65 days' worth _ but the
convertibles are particularly scarce, Seib said.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said earlier that the strike
could force Chrysler to find another company to modify cars for its
re-entry into the European market, which began about six weeks ago.
Chrysler hopes to export 5,000 to 10,000 cars a year to Europe.

<HEAD>Major Braniff Shareholder to Sell to Paine Webber</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. may soon have a new owner, if a
buyout offer made to Dalfort Corp. is approved by the boards of
directors of both companies.
   Officials of Dalfort, the majority shareholder of Braniff,
announced Friday the company will sell its shares of the
Dallas-based airline to an investor group formed by Paine Webber
Group Inc. of New York.
   Officials of Dalfort and its parent, Chicago-based Hyatt Corp.,
declined to comment on the acquisition. Braniff President J.
Patrick Foley and spokesmen from Paine Webber did not return
numerous telephone calls.
   Dalfort, which owns about 64 percent of the issued and
outstanding common stock and all of the Series A preferred stock of
Braniff, has agreed in principle to a proposal from the Paine
Webber group to buy all of Dalfort's shares.
   But the acquisition still must be approved by the boards of
directors of both Dalfort and Braniff.
   The Paine Webber group is offering Dalfort $7 a share in cash
and a pro rata share of 20 percent of the acquiring company for
each share of Braniff common stock.
   The acquisition is expected to take place as soon as possible.
   The proposal states that Braniff will distribute $2 a share for
common stock shortly after the acquisition and become the surviving
corporation. After the transaction, Braniff will issue an
additional $5 a share in cash and a pro rata share of the surviving
company to all common shareholders except Dalfort.
   Braniff would offer Dalfort a three-year extension on Dalfort's
contract to perform heavy maintenance on Braniff's fleet.

   American Isuzu Motors Inc. is
voluntarily recalling all 22,591 of its 1988 Trooper II cars to
correct a brake defect, a company official said Friday.
   The company isn't aware of any accidents or injuries resulting
from the problem, which causes a loss of braking power in the rear
wheels, spokeswoman Susan Cain said.
   Owners of the Jeep-like vehicles are being notified by mail and
can take the cars to a dealer for repairs, the company said.
   The defect is in a component of the rear disk brakes, which has
come loose during shipping in some cases, causing a partial loss of
braking power.

<HEAD>Labor Department Provides Good News On Inflation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has released more positive news on inflation,
reporting that prices on the wholesale level rose a modest 0.5
percent in May.
   On Wall Street, stock prices were helped by Friday's report. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed 8.36 points higher
Friday at 2,101.71. Brokers said there was a feeling of relief
among investors that the news wasn't worse.
   Bond prices were mixed while the dollar rose in domestic trading
after falling overseas. Gold prices plunged.
   The growth in the Labor Department's producer price index for
finished wholesale goods in May was halfway between a 0.4 percent
increase in April and a 0.6 percent jump in March.
   If it continued for 12 months, the annual rate of inflation
would amount to 5.8 percent, nearly triple the 2 percentage points
it has risen in the past year.
   Still, economists said Friday that concerns of runaway inflation
are unfounded.
   ``There clearly is some inflation in the system, but the fears
of an inflationary boom are overblown,'' said Larry Chimerine,
president of the WEFA Group, formerly Wharton Econometrics, an
economic forecasting consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   The White House also took comfort from the May numbers.
``Inflation remains low and under control,'' said spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Food replaced energy as the primary impetus behind higher
wholesale prices last month, according to the report. At the prices
paid by grocery stores, food rose 0.9 percent in May _ the biggest
increase since a 1.7 percent jump in January.
   Energy prices, which had surged 3.1 percent in April, rose only
0.2 percent in May, largely because of a 3.8 percent drop in
natural gas prices, the report said.
   In other economic developments Friday, oil futures prices fell
amid concerns about the upcoming OPEC meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, fell 34 cents a
barrel Friday to close at $16.73 a barrel.
   The market was jittery in advance of the 13-nation Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries' meeting that begins today in
Vienna, Austria. OPEC oil ministers are expected to discuss
possible production cuts to defend their official price target of
$18 a barrel, but chances for an agreement appeared to be slim.

   Anxiety about the upcoming OPEC meeting coupled
with technical market factors have sent energy futures prices
skidding.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, the July contract
for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, fell 34
cents per barrel to close at $16.73. On Thursday, the key contract
fell 26 cents.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, contracts
for July delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 0.48 cent
lower at 49.22 cents a gallon, and wholesale heating oil closed at
44.25 cents a gallon, down 0.65 cent.
   ``Sellers completely dominated the market,'' said Madison
Galbraith, senior energy specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   Technical factors were behind the decline, but the market was
also jittery in advance of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' meeting that was opening today in Vienna,
Austria, Galbraith said.
   ``You can't take a position aganst the meeting unless you are
really gutsy,'' Galbraith said.
   OPEC oil ministers are expected to discuss possible production
cuts to defend their official target price of $18 a barrel, but
chances for an agreement appeared to be slim.
   During a meeting in April, the cartel was unable to agree on a
production-cutting proposal put forth by non-OPEC producers, and
Arab OPEC members who met this week in Algiers, Algeria, also were
unable to reach an agreeement.
