   Rescuers used a helicopter Friday to lift
the bodies of three climbers from the snowy face of Mount Ranier,
bringing the death toll on the mountain described as ``Everest ...
on a minature scale'' to 54 in the last 90 years.
   The three bodies recovered at the 10,000-foot level of the
14,410-foot mountain were identified as those of Craig Loyal
Adkison, 37, of Kirkland; David Kellokoski, 30, of Tahoe-Paradise,
Calif.; and Greg Remmick, 32, of Citrus Heights, Calif., said
Pierce County Coroner's spokesman Stewart Rankin.
   The three, described as experienced climbers, began their trek
May 9 and were supposed to have completed it last Saturday. A
search was begun Tuesday, and the bodies, still roped together,
were spotted from the air Thursday.
   Since 1981, nine people _ including the three latest victims _
have died on the steep and strenuous Liberty Ridge on the north
face of Rainier, a dormant volcano.
   Cy Hentges, Mount Rainier National Park spokesman, said the
ridge's appeal has increased since its inclusion in a 1979 book on
classic North American climbs. Prior to 1981, there were no
reported deaths on the ridge.
   But the entire mountain is something to be reckoned with,
Hentges said.
   ``The American Everest team trained on it,'' Hentges said.
``That should tell you something. It's on a miniature scale, but it
provides anything and everything that Everest does, except it's not
that high.
   ``You can walk up sometimes, roped with proper equipment but in
shorts. But all it takes is one storm to come in _ and this has
happened many times _ to kill people.''
   ``It looks so lovely and so beautiful, and yet it can be a devil
that shows pity on no one,'' he said.
   Hentges said it was likely the Adkison, Kellokoski and Remmick
hit bad weather and unstable fresh snow and fell 2,000 feet to
their deaths in an avalanche.
   Because of continued avalanche danger, the helicopter did not
land near the bodies but snagged the rope still connecting them,
lifted them and flew to a safer spot where they could be loaded and
flown off the mountain.
   Edward Cabelera, owner of an exercise equipment company that
Remmick worked for, said that not long before his friend left on
the climb, ``I asked him why he wasn't going on a guided trip. He
told me he didn't want anybody to hold his hand.
   `` `If I don't make it, that's the way I want to go.' That's the
last thing he told me,'' Cabelera said.
   Ironically, rangers said, the latest deaths will probably
attract more climbers.
   ``News like this tends to bring more people to the mountain
...,'' Chief Park Ranger Bill Jensen said. ``It's a very dangerous,
hazardous route and that's what attracts people _ the thrill of
danger.''
   About 8,000 people attempt to climb Rainier each year, most of
them up the south side, and about half of them make it.

<TEXT>
   A beached baby whale who had followed his
dying mother onto a North Carolina beach has died at Sea World,
where officials blamed stress, undernourishment and dehydration.
   The complications causing the 5-foot pygmy sperm whale's death
Friday are ``common symptoms among stranded marine mammals,'' said
Daniel Odell, research biologist at the Orlando tourist
attraction-research center, where the whale was taken Thursday.
   Tests showed ``it was on the verge of kidney failure and other
things. It was a very sick little whale,'' said Odell, who had not
expected the 140-pound animal to survive.
   Historically, baby whales who beach themselves die within days.
One lasted a month at Sea World last year. Older ones survive a
little longer, Odell said.
   The baby whale, dubbed Sophia by its rescuers near Wilmington,
N.C., before it was found to be a male, beached itself with its
mother. The mother was dying when they were discovered, and
veterinarians killed it.
   Odell said the usual reason for adult whale beachings is
congestive heart failure.

   A fire broke out in a prison shoe
factory where more than 100 inmates were working, but all of them
escaped to other parts of the prison unharmed, officials said.
   ``There are no injuries that we know of, but there was heavy
damage, a lot of smoke,'' said Shelly Zent, Department of
Corrections spokeswoman.
   She said 133 inmates and five employees were in the Ellis 1 Unit
factory at the time of the blaze Friday. The building is not
connected to any other prison building.
   The inmates were back in their cells, she said.
   The fire started in a factory storage area on the second floor,
but the cause has not been determined, Ms. Zent said.
   There are 1,971 inmates, including death row prisoners, at the
maximum-security prison.
   Inmates work in the factory, where nearly all of the boots and
shoes issued to state prisoners are made.

   A white man convicted of assaulting a black
man after a huge civil rights march last year was sentenced to
eight years in prison.
   Superior Court Judge Richard S. Gault on Friday also ordered
Randall Allen Norton, 31, of Toccoa be placed on seven years of
probation for the assault on Dennis Alfredo Edwards of Smyrna.
   Norton was convicted Wednesday of aggravated assault.
   Norton and his brother, Roger Dale Norton, 29, also of Toccoa,
were arrested in July 1987 and charged with hitting Edwards with a
piece of concrete after the January 1987 march. Roger Norton is to
be tried in July.
   District Attorney Rafe Banks III said Edwards has a piece of his
skull missing as a result of the attack.
   The civil rights march, which attracted more than 20,000 people,
was a response to attacks by Ku Klux Klan members and other
bystanders on a smaller march held the week before in virtually
all-white Forsyth County north of Atlanta.

   A retired teacher who lived frugally and was
befriended by a library worker has left $135,000 to the Tulsa
Library Trust, the largest bequest it ever has received.
   Ethel Crate taught high school English for 40 years in Tulsa. In
1968, special services librarian Gerry Hendon began delivering
books to Miss Crate at her third-floor walkup apartment.
   Ms. Hendon said she and Miss Crate shared a love of books.
   ``Ethel was a senior citizen without family ties in the city of
Tulsa,'' Ms. Hendon said Thursday, when the bequest was announced.
``And I guess I fulfilled a need for her.''
   When Miss Crate died in 1986, she left the money to be used for
classical literature and music at the library.

   Ticket scalpers, familiar outside rock
concerts and sports events, have invaded unlikely turf: a dance for
middle-school students.
   The dance scheduled for Friday night was canceled after the
Vernon Junior Women's Club discovered that the $3 tickets were
being sold for as much as $10 apiece by student scalpers.
   The league sponsors dances with the Parks and Recreation
Department. A limited number of tickets are sold because the dances
are held in a gym that can accommodate only 250 people. There are
about 1,100 middle-school students in town.
   That situation led to students' duplicating tickets and now
selling them at inflated prices, club President Peggy Jackle said.
   She said she hopes the cancellation of the dance will serve as
notice to the scalpers that the future of the dances depends on
their conduct.

<TEXT>
   As Angelo Abbate addressed a golf
ball with a nine-iron at Hollywood Lakes Country Club, a herd of 13
buffalo addressed him with wide-eyed stares.
   ``I got kind of scared there for a second,'' said Abbate, 73,
who blames his bogey on the bison.
   Buffalo have roamed Broward and Dade counties for two months
after a horse thief inadvertently freed 250 of them from a ranch.
Since then, they have surprised motorists on Interstate 75, hung
around farmers' fields and even grazed on the greens at golf
courses. Last week, a buffalo died after it was hit by a
tractor-trailer in Dade.
   State troopers and wildlife officers say the buffalo problem is
getting out of hand.
   ``It is just a question of time before someone is going to get
hurt,'' said cattle farmer George Williams. ``What they need to do
is catch them in a steel pen that can hold them once and for all.''
   Officers from the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission
rounded up the bison at the golf course Wednesday and put them
inside a barbed wire fence on Williams' nearby pasture.
   But the free-spirited buffalo broke through the fence Thursday
morning and headed to civilization, clogging rush hour traffic on
Interstate 75 until wildlife officers chased them off the road.
They were moved to another fenced-in field in Broward County, where
they remain.
   The buffalo saga began March 20, when horse thieves cut a hole
in the fence surrounding Chi-O Ranchero in Miami Lakes.
   While the thieves made off with 26 horses, about 250 buffalo
escaped from the 2,000-acre pasture, said Arnold Oper, a Chi-O
stockholder.
   Oper has hired free-lance cowboys to track down the buffalo,
valued at $2,000 each. About 200 of the bison have been rounded up
so far.
   Oper and his partners invested in the buffalo with the hope the
meat would become popular in Florida.
   Wildlife officers charged Oper with a second-degree misdemeanor
of housing wildlife in an unsafe manner and allowing them to
escape, said Jim Huffstodt, the wildlife commission's information
officer.
   Bob Harper, the golf course superintendent at Hollywood Lakes,
said buffalo have twice left tracks on the links during the past
two weeks.
   ``At first nobody believed me when I told them there were
buffalo out there,'' he said. ``The police thought I was crazy. The
farmer out back thought I was crazy. (But) I'm from Kansas. I grew
up around farms and cattle. I know buffalo.''

   Senate leaders are expressing growing doubts
the chamber will ratify the U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons treaty
before President Reagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Moscow eight days from now.
   Unless the Senate speeds up its pace, ``the chance of having
that little package with the blue ribbon tied around it in the
president's pocket by the time he goes to Moscow are going to
diminish daily and hourly,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., said late Friday.
   The problem is that conservative Republicans opposed to the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty have used Senate
rules to delay action, according to Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of
Kansas.
   ``Right now, it looks like Republicans may be dragging their
feet,'' Dole said. ``I'm optimistic, but less so than I was
yesterday.''
   The Senate has to approve the treaty itself and then separately
approve the resolution of ratification. It is now considering the
treaty and opponents have blocked efforts to move on to the
resolution.
   ``As I see the situation, if the Senate doesn't complete work on
the treaty on Monday, it is going to be increasingly difficult to
wrap up work on the resolution of ratification by next Saturday,''
Byrd said.
   A frustrated Dole noted that opponents have refused even to say
how many amendments they will offer.
   ``There shouldn't be any mystery, if you have five amendments or
10 or 50 or just three. ... My view is that as long as everybody is
up front, we know where we are. That's all that I ask. ... When
nobody will communicate, it's pretty hard to tell how many
amendments there are.''
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8, provides for the elimination within
three years of all atomic-tipped missiles with a range of 300 to
3,400 miles.
   In votes Friday, the Senate:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Rejected, 73-8, an amendment by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, D-N.H.,
to delay implementing the INF treaty until the president certifies
that NATO has increased its ammunition stocks from the present
seven days to at least 15 days.
   The Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies have superior numbers
of non-nuclear weapons.
   ``Since I cannot hope to succeed in the adoption of this
amendment, I hope to clarify the effect of this treaty on the
security of NATO and in particular on the 325,000 U.S. troops in
Western Europe,'' Humphrey said prior to the vote.
   ``Without nuclear weapons in Europe,'' he said, ``our forces
would be annihilated or at best captured. ... That's why we have
nuclear weapons there, to prevent the annihilation of our troops.''
   The treaty would remove medium-range missiles carrying nuclear
warheads from Europe and elsewhere. But it would leave thousands of
battlefield and other nuclear weapons with ranges shorter than 300
miles in addition to U.S. nuclear warheads on aircraft.
   _Rejected, on five votes by overwhelming margins, a plan by Sen.
Steve Symms, R-Idaho, that would have barred the INF treaty from
going into effect until Reagan certified the Soviets were in full
compliance with five previous arms control agreements. Although
Reagan has said the Soviets violate those agreements, the White
House opposed Symms' amendments.
   All five sections of Symms' proposal were rejected in
back-to-back roll call votes of 85-11, 87-10, 86-11, 82-15 and 89-8.
   Dole called the proposal a ``killer amendment,'' and other
senators denounced it as an obvious attempt to slow Senate
consideration of the INF treaty.

Headaches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The latest government figures on federal
spending and tax receipts indicate chances of avoiding
election-year budget headaches are growing increasingly dim,
private analysts say.
   Sharply lower income tax receipts in April and continued
increases in federal spending left the year-to-date budget deficit
24.6 percent higher than in the same month of 1987, the Treasury
Department said Friday.
   Private analysts said the April report indicates the government
will have a tough time avoiding a large jump in the deficit, let
alone achieving the reduction envisioned by the two-year budget
deal sealed by lawmakers and the president in December.
   The government collected $13.9 billion more than it spent in
April, helping to hold the deficit for the first seven months of
the 1988 fiscal year to $105 billion. But that was more than $20
billion higher than the $84.3 billion gap for the same period a
year ago.
   Nevertheless, the administration still is officially projecting
that the tide of red ink will recede from $150.2 billion in 1987 to
$146.7 billion when the budget year ends Sept. 30.
   Now even the $157 billion forecast of the Congressional Budget
Office appears unreachable, analysts said.
   ``I think they've got problems,'' said John R. Williams, an
economist with the Bankers Trust Company in New York. He warned
that rising interest rates would increase the cost of financing the
$2.5 trillion national debt and predicted a deficit of $165 billion.
   Budget Director James C. Miller III, looking ahead to the 1989
fiscal year, warned Tuesday that an across-the-board cut in federal
programs this fall was ``perilously close'' under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law if Congress continues to spend above the
limits agreed to in last year's budget pact.
   In April, government revenue totaled $109.3 billion, 11 percent
lower than April 1987. Spending totaled $95.4 billion, 13.6 percent
ahead of the same month a year earlier.
   For the first seven months of this fiscal year, revenues totaled
$522.1 billion, up 3 percent over the same period in fiscal 1987,
while spending was $627.1 billion, up 6.1 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   ``It just looks as if we haven't been able to corral spending to
any significant degree yet,'' Williams said. ``It's not rising as
rapidly as it had in some previous years, but it's still charging
upward.''
   Michael K. Evans, head of an economic forecasting service in
Washington, predicted the 1988 deficit will be between $170 billion
and $175 billion.
   ``April's the big month. After that, it's all arithmetic. ...
The belief that it was going to stay below $150 billion was just
pure fiction,'' he said.
   The April surplus, bolstered by $53.3 billion in individual
income tax payments, was about $5 billion less than expected by
private economists.
   Some had been hoping the new income tax law would provide a
small windfall, although none expected a balance approaching the
record $38.7 billion surplus of April 1987.
   Individual income tax payments ballooned to $71.8 billion a year
ago because taxpayers rushed to sell assets in 1986 before the
favorable rates on capital gains disappeared under the new tax law.
   However, no mini-windfall showed up this year.
   ``People who used deductions and shelters paid more than they
did the year before, but the rank and file paid less,'' Evans said.
   Personal income tax collections of $237.6 billion for the first
seven months of this fiscal year are running 2.7 percent behind
last year. That has been only partially offset by an 8.4 percent
increase in corporate income tax collections to $50.6 billion.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in April were the
military, followed by Social Security, other programs in the
Department of Health and Human Services and interest on the
national debt.
   Military spending totaled $26.1 billion last month and $168.4
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 6.3 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $16.3 billion last month
and $121.3 billion for the past seven months, up 5.7 percent from
the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is
exempted from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman law and
most months has been showing faster spending increases than the
other categories.
   The other programs in the Department of Health and Human
Services, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent $15.7 billion in
April and $93.2 billion so far this budget year, a 6.5 percent
increase over 1987.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $14.9 billion last month
and $120.1 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.5
percent over the same period last year.

   Join the Senate and see the world. Tel Aviv,
Amsterdam, Johannesburg, Las Vegas _ name the place and it's likely
some senator has found a reason to take an expenses-paid trip there.
   Being in the 100-member Senate has other compensations, too, in
the form of unusual gifts.
   Here is a sampling of gifts picked up and senatorial trips for
which someone else paid the way during the year 1987, according to
the senators' annual financial disclosure forms released Friday:
   Among the gifts: Thad Cochran, R-Miss., got a framed
illustration of the Battle of Corinth; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a
$180 case of scotch; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., two clock radios
and a Navajo rug; Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a $150 ring to commemorate
Texas A&M's Cotton Bowl championship; Kent Conrad, D-N.D., World
Series tickets valued at $320 from baseball Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., a $233 pair of Tony Lama boots;
J. James Exon, D-Neb., a fishing trip in Saskatchewan. For a speech
in Hawaii, Exon reported, he was paid $1,000 plus $934 for
``mounting of fish for Mrs. Exon.''
   Paul Simon, D-Ill., listed a painting from the Formosan
Association for Public Affairs, a pewter box, porcelain vase,
telephone and two tickets to a play.
   William V. Roth, R-Del., and his wife, Jane, a federal judge,
traveled to Amsterdam under the Atlantic Exchange program _ he to
study the legislative system, she to study the judicial system.
They also went to Taiwan, and he took trips to Seoul and Tokyo.
   Seoul was a popular place. In addition to Roth, other senators
who took expenses-paid trips there were Charles E. Grassley,
R-Iowa; Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; and Don Nickles, R-Okla.
   Israel, too, was an attraction. Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D.,
visited there. So did John B. Breaux, D-La., and Mitch McConnell
Jr., R-Ky., (who also went to Turkey).
   Jake Garn, R-Utah, and his wife went on an expenses-paid Grand
Canyon-Colorado River trip, had complimentary lodging in Mazatlan,
Mexico, and got free trips to Tokyo and Hong Kong.
   Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., took a three-day trip to London and the
Soviet Union, courtesy of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.
   Harry Reid, D-Nev., and his wife went to San Juan, Puerto Rico.
They also reported receiving a gift of free lodging at the Circus
Circus Hotel in Las Vegas.
   Jesse Helms, R-N.C., gave four speeches in South Africa, paid
for by the South African Agriculture Union.
   Sam Nunn, D-Ga., had two foreign trips among the 22 for which he
received reimbursement. One was for a Soviet-U.S. relations seminar
in Jamaica and the other for a seminar on Eastern Europe, held in
Switzerland.
   Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., accepted a trip to Curacao with his
wife at the invitation of that Caribbean island's chamber of
commerce.
   J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., and his wife spent 10 days in St.
Thomas and San Juan over Christmas and New Year's, paid for by a
pharmaceutical firm.
   The financial disclosure forms showed that at least 14 senators
are millionaires. There most likely are more of them, but it is not
possible to tell from the disclosure statements because senators
are allowed to report income, assets and liabilities within broad
ranges. For example, a $10 million investment need be reported only
as exceeding $250,000.
   On that basis, John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., the Standard Oil
heir who could be the Senate's richest member, is shown as having a
net worth that could be as little as $132,000. Another millionaire,
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., put no dollar value on the trusts that
make up the bulk of his wealth although he reported income of at
least $596,747.

   A woman opened fire in an elementary
school, killing one child and critically wounding five others
Friday. She was found dead when a SWAT team stormed a nearby house
where she had wounded a seventh person.
   ``I've just received information that the suspect has been found
and she is dead,'' Police Chief Herbert Timm said nearly nine hours
after the shooting began at Hubbard Woods Elementary School. ``The
situation is over.''
   She shot herself once in the head with a .32-caliber pistol,
Timm said. ``She indicated (in a telephone call to her parents)
that she had shot some people and felt very sorry about that,'' he
said.
   The woman, identified as Lori Dann, 30, was carrying three
handguns around 10:45 a.m. when she opened fire inside the
one-story, red-brick school, killing a child and wounding five
others, police said.
   ``There was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked
over'' as the children panicked during the 15 minutes the shooting
lasted, said Glencoe Patrolman John Ceglieski.
   ``Kids were lying around in very serious condition,'' in the
school, Timm said. ``Kids were hiding under the desk as well as
well as they could.''
   She then ran to a nearby house and wounded one of its occupants
in a struggle. Hostage negotiators arrived moments later and Ms.
Dann spoke by telephone to her parents, brought to the house in
hopes of talking her out.
   Asked why police had not attempted to storm the house earlier,
Timm replied, ``We've had seven people shot already. We're not
going in there without taking every precaution.''
   Timm said he decided to send the SWAT team into the house after
repeated efforts by police and Ms. Dann's parents failed to contact
her. The team was accompanied by FBI agents with sound detectors
probing for movement in the house.
   Timm said police had yet to establish a motive for the rampage.
Ms. Dann allegedly set a fire earlier Friday, eight blocks away at
the home of a couple where she worked as a housekeeper in this
affluent North Shore community.
   She reportedly was upset, having been told she was losing her
job because the family was moving, police said.
   Timm, reconstructing a day of violence at an evening news
conference, said Ms. Dann set two fires and carried a gasoline can
to the door of a day-care center before embarking on the shooting
spree.
   Before going to the school Friday, police said, Ms. Dann went to
the home of Padraig and Marion Rushe on Forest Glen to take two of
their children, 4 and 6 years old, to the zoo.
   Instead of going to the zoo, however, Timm said Ms. Dann took
the children to Ravinia School in neighboring Highland Park, where
she set off one of several incendiary devices she carried in her
car Friday.
   Authorities found one of the devices burning there, but
extinguished it before it could cause any damage.
   Timm said Ms. Dann drove next to a day-care center, where she
went to the front door carrying a can of gasoline. ``But she was
met at the front door by a staff member who asked what she was
doing _ and she took off,'' said Timm.
   He said Ms. Dann returned to the Rushe home, talked with Mrs.
Rushe and the children in a family room in the basement, then went
upstairs and set off another incendiary device.
   While the fire raged upstairs, Mrs. Rushe managed to push her
two children through a small window in the basement, then crawl out
herself. Ms. Dann, meanwhile, made her way about eight blocks to
the school, police said.
   Timm said several other incendiary devices were found in Ms.
Dann's car in the neighborhood near the house where the standoff
took place.
   The FBI said it had ``an investigative interest'' in Ms. Dann
and Madison, Wis., police Lt. William Sprague said she had been
arrested there March 14 on a charge of retail theft. He gave no
further details.
   Keith Wilson told the Wisconsin State Journal from his home in
Los Angeles that he had roomed across the hall from Ms. Dann when
they attended the University of Wisconsin. He described her as
``just an absolutely bizarre lady'' and said ``sometimes she'd
wander the halls and try to open doors.''
   Timm, the police chief, said when the woman walked into the
school around 10:45 a.m., her first stop was a boys' bathroom,
where she shot a youngster.
   ``She left him and ran into one classroom, telling the teacher
there that a boy had been wounded,'' said Timm. ``Then she entered
a second classroom, announced she had a gun and opened fire.''
   Police recovered a .357-caliber Magnum revolver from the school,
for which Timm said Ms. Dann had been issued a permit. ``How did a
woman with that kind of background get licensed to carry a gun?''
Timm said.
   Joe Sumner, director of Winnetka police operations, said the
woman then ran through the woods from the school and entered the
home, where four members of a family and their maid were present.
   ``Apparently, she just walked in and confronted the
homeowners,'' Sumner said. ``The mother came running out and said,
`There's a woman in my home with a gun.'
   ``Then we heard a shot. The son came out, holding a gun, and
fell over in the driveway,'' Sumner said.
   The son, 20-year-old Philip Andrew, apparently struggled with
the suspect, grabbed one of her weapons, and was shot in the chest,
Sumner said. The father, maid and grandfather fled by a side door,
leaving her alone inside.
   Wilmette police Sgt. Michael Geier said the woman was believed
to have set fire to the home where she worked while a mother and
her children were in the basement doing laundry.
   ``This woman set a fire in the house, trapping the people in the
basement,'' he said. ``They escaped, got out, apparently without
serious injury.''
   Eight-year-old Nick Corwin died of his wounds at Highland Park
Hospital, said spokesman Mark Newtwon.
   Another 8-year-old boy and Andrew were in critical condition at
the hospital, said spokeswoman Sue Masaracchia.
   The four children at Evanston Hospital were reported in critical
but stable condition with gunshot wounds following surgery, said
spokeswoman Mary Ash. They were identified as Mark Tebourek, 8,
Robert Trossman, 6, Lindsay Fisher, 8, and Kathryn Ann Miller, 7,
said another spokeswoman, Cheryl Soohoo.
   At the school, parents clustered in groups, consoling each
other. Village Manager Robert Buechner said children were released
in small groups throughout the afternoon to ensure their safety.
   Ann Arnold, who lives across the street from one of the wounded
children, said her own 7-year-old son made sure the doors were
locked after he came home.
   ``He's still scared something else is going to happen,'' Mrs.
Arnold said.

<HEAD>Hungry Contras Leaving Nicaragua In Search Of Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contra guerrillas are leaving Nicaragua
``at a high rate'' because they are hungry and searching for food
in neighboring Honduras, the head of the U.S. foreign aid program
says.
   The American-supported Contras are moving because they have been
blocked from receiving supplies at their jungle bases in Nicaragua,
said Alan Woods, administrator of the Agency for International
Development.
   Woods told a Senate subcommittee Friday that ``there are people
inside Nicaragua who are desperate ... we've had reports of people
eating tree roots.''
   Woods declined to estimate how many people were involved, but
other administration officials have said that up to 3,000 rebels
have fled into neighboring Honduras in recent weeks to look for
food.
   The administration plans to give cash to the Contras to buy
food, at the rate of $1 per day per rebel, Woods said. The money,
which will be sent in by couriers, will be in the form of cordobas,
the Nicaraguan currency.
   ``We have taken this particular step as a last resort,'' he
said, adding that the United States wants to keep as many Contras
inside Nicaragua as possible.
   The Contras and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government are in
the middle of peace talks, and keeping the Contras inside the
Central American nation will keep the pressure on Nicaragua, U.S.
officials say.
   A March 23 agreement between the Contras and the Sandinistas
allows humanitarian aid to go to the guerrillas during the peace
talks. But Woods said there has been a dispute over how to
distribute the aid and the impasse has blocked any help from being
sent.
   Direct shipments of food have not begun because the two sides
cannot agree on a neutral distribution organization, a requirement
spelled out by Congress in March when it voted $48 million in
humanitarian aid.
   Woods said the International Red Cross has been rejected by the
Contras as a delivery agency, but he didn't know why.
   ``The simple bottom line ... is that if they'd reach agreement,
we'd start delivering food,'' he said.
   The cash plan is a substitute, he told the Foreign Relations
western hemisphere subcommittee.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the subcommittee,
raised a number of questions about the cash plan.
   Dodd called it ``a pretty weak accounting system'' and suggested
the proposal raises ``serious questions about compliance with
existing legislative restrictions.''
   Woods responded that ``we're doing the best we can under the
circumstances'' to account for the money.
   When Congress approved the humanitarian aid, it barred using any
of the money for weapons. It would be difficult to use the cordobas
to buy guns because the currency is not generally accepted outside
Nicaragua, Woods said.
   Two Republicans on the subcommittee, Sens. Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota and Paul Trible of Virginia, praised Woods' efforts.
   Boschwitz said, ``It really is a difficult situation.''
   Trible added, ``It's very easy to criticize, but you're
operating under very difficult circumstances.''

<HEAD>Aide Says Vice President Didn't Follow Up On Early Drug
Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush was told as early
as 1983 of allegations that Panamanian officials were involved in
the drug trade, but did not follow up on them, says Bush's top
foreign policy aide.
   The aide, Donald Gregg, testified in a deposition Friday that
then-Panamanian President Ricardo de la Espriella mentioned the
allegations to the vice president at the close of a December 1983
meeting in Panama, but the Panamanian official also told Bush the
stories were untrue.
   Bush, then chairman of a task force to combat the flow of drugs
into south Florida, ``said he had not been aware (of the charges)
or he would have raised them'' with de la Espriella, Gregg
testified in a deposition for a private civil lawsuit.
   After returning to Washington, ``We did nothing to follow that
up'' Gregg said. ``It was not yet as clear to us as it has
subsequently become, who was involved.''
   The meeting also was attended by Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
general who now is Panama's de facto leader and who was indicted in
Florida in February on drug charges. Bush has said he received no
reliable information connecting Noriega to drugs until the
indictment.
   Gregg also testified that he was aware in 1983 that the
government of Panama had been helpful to the United States in
getting military supplies to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   The testimony came during a daylong deposition taken for a $24
million suit by the Christic Institute, a liberal policy group,
charging that a list of defendants, some of whom were involved in
the Iran-Contra affair, supplied the Contras with weapons in trade
for cocaine, and conspired in a failed attempt to assassinate a
maverick Contra field commander, Eden Pastora.
   Richard Stearns, Gregg's Justice Department attorney, objected
repeatedly to the questioning, charging that it ranged far from the
subject of the suit and was being done for political purposes.
   ``I think it's quite clear you have some other agenda in mind,''
he told Michael Withey, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
   On Thursday, another Bush aide, Col. Samuel J. Watson, had
invoked executive privilege and declined to answer when asked
during a similar deposition what Bush and the U.S. ambassador to
Panama, Everett Briggs, discussed about narcotics at a meeting on
Dec. 16, 1985.
   When Withey questioned Gregg on Friday about the same meeting,
Gregg agreed to discuss it but said his recollection was not
specific.
   ``I think we came away from the meeting with Ambassador Briggs
with the sense that Noriega was a growing problem _ politically,
militarily and possibly in the drug area,'' Gregg testified. But he
said any drug problems involving Noriega ``were not highlighted''
by Briggs.
   Later in the day, Withey asked Gregg: ``The fact that General
Noriega may have had some involvement in the narcotics problem,
that was coming out of the December '85 meeting at that time, isn't
that correct?''
   Gregg responded: ``It would have been part of the general
picture of Noriega as a political problem, as corruption, and as a
general policy problem, yes.''
   But talking with reporters later, Gregg said he did not recall
any discussion of Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking. ``I am
saying that narcotics as a problem in Panama was part of the agenda
of the meeting. ... There was no discussion of any direct
connection between that and Noriega.''
   Gregg also testified that a State Department briefing paper
would have been prepared for Bush's meeting with Briggs outlining
the background of the ambassador's concerns, and that the paper
would have been placed in Bush's briefing book.
   That document is among papers sought by the plaintiffs in the
suit, but which have not been turned over by the government.

<HEAD>Federal Land Bank In Louisville To Get $90 Million In Assistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new government board created to help the
financially troubled Farm Credit System has taken its biggest step
so far by approving $90 million for the Federal Land Bank of
Louisville, Ky.
   Eric P. Thor, chief executive officer of the Farm Credit System
Assistance Board, said Friday the Louisville bank will receive
assistance through the sale of up to $90 million in preferred stock
to the Financial Assistance Corp., which will raise funds for that
investment by selling 15-year bonds.
   The board and corporation were created by last year's
Agricultural Credit Act to help bail out the financially distressed
Farm Credit System, a network of cooperatively owned farm banks and
associations.
   Thor said the Louisville bank, which serves borrowers in Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, applied to th board for financial
help in February. He said the board and the bank have ``reached
agreement on a number of steps which will continue to strengthen''
the institution's financial management.
   Although the Louisville bank had presented ``a well-thought-out,
workable plan for financial recovery,'' its stock had dropped to 65
percent of par value and the bank was unable to implement the plan
without federal help, he said.
   ``The bank has made substantial progress in resolving its own
financial problems over the past two years,'' Thor said.
   Programs included an asset-liability management program in 1986
to control interest rate risks and reduce costs, and a market-based
loan pricing system in 1987 to provide competitive rates to
borrowers. Also, he said, the bank ``reduced its non-performing
loans and inventory of acquired property by 30 percent, and
projects a similar reduction this year.''
   Jeanne Kling, a spokeswoman for the board, said the $90 million
for the Louisville bank was ``the first full-blown'' assistance
designated under the new law.
   Earlier this year, the board approved $25 million in ``limited
purpose'' assistance in short-term funding to help the Federal Land
Bank of Jackson, Miss., stay in business. And $20.5 million was
provided to retire stock in six financially troubled production
credit associations in the Omaha, Neb., and Spokane, Wash.,
districts.
   ``But this is the first one that we've done under the general
context of helping the bank'' in general, Ms. Kling said.
   The 1987 law gave the board broad authority to work with
institutions of the Farm Credit System. The board consists of the
secretaries of Agriculture and Treasury, with a third member still
to be confirmed by the Senate.

   One reason for an upturn in U.S. wheat exports
has been bad weather in Europe and the Soviet Union, says an
Agriculture Department report.
   The adverse weather ``kept competitor production down and import
demand up,'' the department's Economic Research Service said
Friday. As a result, U.S. wheat exports are expected be at their
highest level since 1981.
   ``Rail car shortages have plagued grain shippers since June
1987, but the total distribution system may yet meet domestic and
export commitments,'' the report said.
   The brief report included much information released May 10 when
USDA's new 1988 winter wheat forecast was issued, including
supply-and-demand figures showing that the total wheat carryover on
June 1 for 1988-89 may be around 1.23 billion bushels.
   ``While still equivalent to more than 5{ months of anticipated
use, almost 60 percent (of the June 1 carryover) is expected to be
in Commodity Credit Corp. inventory or the farmer-owned reserve,''
the report said.
   Wheat held by the CCC or under price support loan in the
farmer-owned reserve is effectively locked out of the free market
and doesn't have an impact on price movements.
   The 1988-89 season average market price of wheat is forecast at
$2.89 to $3.20 per bushel, up from $2.55 in 1987-88 and $2.42 in
1986-87, the report said.

   Farm-raised catfish production in April
totaled 20.8 million pounds, down 22 percent from a year ago, says
the Agriculture Department.
   The decline helped boost the average price paid to catfish
farmers to 75 cents per pound, liveweight, up 10 cents from April
1987.
   Despite the April decline, catfish production for the first five
months was up from a year earlier, totaling 102.8 million pounds
against 97.5 million in the same period of 1987.

<HEAD>U.N. Command Accuses North Korea of Scheming To Disrupt Olympics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) = The U.N. Command charged today that
North Korea of scheming to disrupt the Olympic Games in Seoul with
false claims that war could break out on the divided Korean
peninsula.
   U.S. Rear Adm. William Pendley told a news conference that
communist North Korea is trying to stir up tension to scare other
nations away from the Olympics.
   ``Although the north wants the world to believe the DMZ
(Demilitarized Zone) is aflame and war is imminent, that is just
not the case at all,'' said Pendley, a senior official of the
United Nations Command.
   Pendley said North Korea has made a barrage of false claims in
recent months, accusing U.S. and South Korean forces of preparing
for war and opening fire with artillery and machine guns on the
border.
   All the North Korean charges have been investigated and none
were substantiated, Pendley said. He said they were clearly
propaganda and lies to undermine the Olympic Games, scheduled for
Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   ``North Korea would like to scare off Olympic teams and fans,''
he said.
   The Olympics have become a major symbol in the bitter struggle
between the two Koreas. The south sees the games as proof of how it
has outstripped the north in almost every field.
   Pendley said the U.N. Command is making every effort to preserve
stability on the border and avoid confrontation with the north.
Peace is vital to ensure the safety of the Olympics, he said.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the games because South
Korea and the International Olympic Commmittee rejected its demand
to co-host the event. South Korea has offered to let the north
stage up to five Olympic events.
   On Friday, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung proposed that South
Korea and North Korea hold talks on co-hosting the games.
   He said such an arrangement would benefit the south by ensuring
the security of the Olympics and forcing north to open its closed
society, promoting chances of national unification.
   But today, Kim retracted the call, saying ``I have no intention
of carrying my point alone if other parties oppose it.''
   The idea had invited immediate opposition from the government,
which denounced it as ``a irresponsible political maneuvering''
that would help the north disrupt the Olympics.
   Pendley said he was confident the Olympics would be a success
and the participation of 161 nations, including North Korea's
communist allies, should discourage any provocation by the North.
   The adminiral represents the U.N. Command delegation at meetings
with North Korean and Chinese delegates under the Military
Armistice Commission.
   The commission polices the cease-fire that ended the Korean War,
which ended in 1953, three years after beginning when the north
invaded the south.
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in the south as part of a
mutual defense pact against the north. The U.N. Command consists of
the United States, South Korea and other nations that fought
against the north.
   In reply to a question, Pendley said there were no unusual North
Korean military movements to indicate they expected trouble or were
preparing for war.
   But South Korean and U.S. forces based in the South would take
every security precaution to guard the games, Pendley said. `
   `You can never be assured as to what the north will do,'' he
said.
   South Korea, the United States, Japan and dozens of other
nations contend North Korea was responsible for the Nov. 29 bombing
of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board.
   A woman, who said she was a North Korean agent, said she had
bombed the plane as part of efforts to disrupt the Olympics.

   The country music group Alabama took a trip
south _ downtown, that is _ where the musicians fed the hungry at a
soup kitchen in the city's Lower East Side.
   Group members Randy Owen, Mark Herndon, Jeff Cook and Teddy
Gentry donned white hats Friday to serve fried chicken, salad and a
strawberry dessert at the Bowery Mission. Then they stopped to chat
with the lunch crowd.
   Alabama is a featured act on the Marlboro Country Music Tour,
which ends today at New York's Madison Square Garden. One dollar
from each ticket sold along the 30-city tour goes to Second
Harvest, a national food bank for the hungry.

   The man who invented Nautilus exercise
equipment says he will donate nearly $8.5 million to the Health
Science Center and Center for Exercise Science at the University of
Florida.
   ``I have a longstanding interest in physical training and
wellness, and my support of the University of Florida will boost
the research of lower back pain, one of man's most nagging
problems,'' said inventor Arthur A. Jones.
   Jones, who is credited with revolutionizing the exercise
industry, sold his Nautilus empire in 1986 to devote his time to
his MedX Corp., which began marketing the Lumbar Extension Machine
later that year.
   The college's exercise center is testing Jones' latest
invention, a computerized machine designed to evaluate and
rehabilitate the lower back.
   ``As the beneficiary of the largest gift in the history of the
University of Florida and our state university system, we welcome
the opportunity to join in his crusade against lower back
problems,'' University President Marshall Criser said Friday in
accepting the donation.

   About 200 people gathered at a high school
in Jimmy Stewart's hometown to celebrate the actor's 80th birthday
by watching ``The Philadelphia Story'' and eating cake.
   Stewart was in Beverly Hills, Calif., where he said his wife,
Gloria, had ``fixed up a party.'' But he sent greetings in a letter
to some of his friends.
   Stewart received the Academy Award for best actor in 1940 for
his role in ``The Philadelphia Story,'' and the Oscar for years was
displayed in the window of his father's hardware store on
Philadelphia Street in this small southwestern Pennsylvania town.
   The film was shown Friday night in the auditorium of the Indiana
Area Senior High School, and a birthday cake was served to
Stewart's fans in the lobby. The cake depicted a statue of Stewart
that was unveiled in front of the county courthouse during a
three-day bash held for Stewart's 75th birthday.

   Hall of Fame outfielder Willie Mays made a
pitch for his book, ``Say Hey,'' at a local bookstore, but balked
at interviews with two broadcasters who hadn't read the
autobiography.
   Fans stood in line an hour or more Thursday as Mays signed
copies of ``Say Hey.''
   Mays, 57, wouldn't sign baseballs or baseball cards, just books.
Many people bought three or four copies; a few bought six or seven.
   But when sportscasters Howard Eskin of WTAF-TV and Scott Palmer
of WPVI-TV asked for on-camera interviews, Mays asked if they had
read the book.
   Neither had.
   ``Scan through the book and then ask some questions,'' Mays told
Eskin. ``You should be prepared.''
   Palmer met a similar fate.
   Mays played for the Giants, first in New York and then in San
Francisco, before finishing his 22-year career with the New York
Mets.

   The Duke of Gloucester, cousin of Queen Elizabeth
II, will visit the British fortress colony of Gibraltar next week,
his office announced.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, reported that the
duke will stay four days and, as a patron of the Friends of
Gibraltar Heritage Trust, tour the naval dockyard and other
historic sites. It did not say when he would begin his visit.
   The agency said it will be the first Gibraltar visit by a member
of the royal family since the Prince and Princess of Wales began
their honeymoon cruise from the colony in 1981.
   Spain claims sovereignty over the colony, and Spanish King Juan
Carlos stayed away from the royal wedding because the couple made
Gibraltar the first stop of their honeymoon.

   Children's Hospital of Philadelphia says it
will honor U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, formerly the
hospital's chief surgeon, by establishing a chair in his name.
   Hospital board members, colleagues, friends and former patients
contributed $1.5 million to endow the C. Everett Koop Chair in
Pediatric Surgery, the first of many chairs the institution plans
to create as funds are raised, hospital spokeswoman Shirley Bonnem
said Friday.
   The chair's first occupant will be Dr. James O'Neill Jr., the
hospital's current surgeon-in-chief, Bonnem said.

<HEAD>Report: Soviets Might Expand Syrian Facility Into Permanent Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is poised to turn its naval
repair facility in Syria into a permanent base in a move cementing
the military alliance between the two nations, Jane's Defense
Weekly says.
   The expanded base at Tartus would serve as home for the Soviets'
Mediterranean navy, according to today's issue of the respected
magazine.
   Jane's based its report on diplomatic sources, which it did not
identify.
   The report said the development of Tartus ``indicates a
consolidation of the Soviet Union's military relationship with its
key Middle East ally.''
   Jane's said a number of high-ranking Soviet military officials
had visited Tartus recently, port calls had increased and
deployment of aircraft had been expanded.
   It said Western analysts were particularly concerned because the
Soviet admiral in charge of Tartus supervised the development of
the Soviet's Cam Ranh Bay base in Vietnam.
   Cam Ranh Bay has been described by U.S. intelligence sources as
the ``largest Soviet naval forward deployment base'' outside the
Soviet Union, the report said.
   It said the Soviets have used Tartus, about 35 miles north of
the Lebanese border, since 1969 as a limited repair and maintenance
facility. But their presence increased markedly in 1976 after they
were expelled from Egyptian bases.
   The magazine said Tartus is now the Soviets' primary maintenance
facility for submarines and the deployment of anti-surface warfare
and reconnaissance aircraft has increased.
   Jane's said the Soviets pay no rent for the base.

<HEAD>Bush Steps Back From Noriega Policy; Dukakis Says He'll Talk With
Jackson</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS top 2 grafs to clarify that Dukakis comments referred to
Reagan administration dealings with Noriega, not plan to drop drug
charges.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush took another step away from President
Reagan's controversial negotiations with Panama's indicted leader
Manuel Noriega on Friday. Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
said the ``American people want an explanation'' of why the Reagan
administration was dealing with Noriega.
   Dukakis, campaigning in California, said ``somebody in the
administration'' should tell the American people ``who it was who
thought it was in the interests of the American people and this
country that we do business with somebody who was a known drug
peddler and who was suspected of murder.''
   He added, ``Unless and until we have that explanation, I'm not
going to be satisfied.''
   Bush said nothing publicly on Noriega, but his maneuverings came
two days after he declared that he would not negotiate with accused
drug runners in this country or on foreign soil. At the time, he
did not mention either Panama or its indicted leader, Noriega, by
name.
   But following the publication of a story Friday in The
Washington Post, the vice president's chief of staff, Craig Fuller,
issued a statement saying that ``the administration sources who
have suggested that the vice president favors ending the
negotiations and bringing the envoy back to Washington are
essentially correct.''
   The statement was issued just hours before sources disclosed a
tentative agreement for Noriega to relinquish power and leave
Panama temporarily in exchange for the Reagan administration
dropping the drug indictment.
   The Fuller statement was as close as Bush has come to publicly
uttering words of disagreement with Reagan over his Panamanian
policy, and came after several days of slippage in the public
opinion polls and with many Republican allies urging him to air his
differences with the president.
   The issue of Panama and drugs also arose in a court deposition
given by Donald Gregg, Bush's national security adviser.
   Gregg said in the sworn statement that the president of Panama
told the vice president in December 1983 that allegations of drug
running among government officials were untrue.
   ``The vice president said he had not been aware of the charges
or he would have raised them'' during the session, Gregg testified
in a deposition for a private civil lawsuit.
   He added, ``We did nothing to follow up.'' The vice president
was chairman of the South Florida Drug Interdiction Task Force at
the time.
   Spokesman Stephen Hart had no comment on Gregg's deposition.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, repeated his criticism of U.S.
negotiations with Noriega but made no reference to the reported
tentative agreement.
   ``Noriega is not plea bargaining with Reagan and Bush. Reagan
and Bush are plea bargaining with Noriega,'' Jackson told more than
500 supporters at a San Francisco church.
   Jackson, the sole remaining rival to Dukakis for the Democratic
nomination, said, ``We need to know what's going on. Send a special
prosecutor to Panama. Send a congressional delegation to Panama.
Hear both sides of an ugly story.''
   Dukakis also campaigned in California in advance of the state's
June 7 primary.
   He said he and Jackson met on Sunday and will ``be meeting
regularly.'' The Massachusetts governor did not say what he and
Jackson would discuss in their talks, but his challenger has been
pressing for a greater share of votes from ``super delegates'' to
the Democratic National Convention. These party and elected
officials, who are automatically entitled to attend the nominating
convention, have largely been lining up behind Dukakis.
   At home, the Dukakis administration announced new proposed
spending cuts, efficiency steps and revenue plans designed to
improve the bottom line of Dukakis' $11.9 billion state budget
proposal for next year by $217 million.
   Faced with a shortfall in tax collections, Dukakis is proposing
to cut $92 million from expansions he had previously proposed in
dozens of individual programs. He also signed off on a hoped-for
$47 million in savings through improved government operations. He
also hopes to raise millions more through bottle deposits and a
higher tax on cigarettes. Friday's sobering budget news could hurt
Dukakis' attempts to campaign on earlier balanced budgets.
   Democratic platform writers met in suburban Washington, where
Sen. John Glenn of Ohio said the public is under ``the great
misconception'' that nuclear arms treaties may allow the United
States to spend less on conventional weapons.
   Glenn, mentioned as a possible running mate on a Dukakis ticket,
said the truth was ``exactly the opposite. ... We may have to spend
more instead of less.''
   Rep. Ron Dellums of California, representing both the Jackson
campaign and his own views, said the Democrats should find ways to
reduce the burden of the Pentagon's $299 billion budget, which has
doubled since 1980.
   Dellums said the United States should call home some of its
325,000 troops in Europe and scrap a wide range of weapon systems,
from the MX missile, the Midgetman and Trident II to research on
Star Wars.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk, meanwhile, unleashed a
stinging attack on Bush as a ``quintessential elitist establishment
Republican country clubber.''
   In a speech before the Association of Democratic State Chairs
meeting in Atlanta, Kirk said the vice president has been
``applauding in the dark shadows of this Republican administration
as it turns thumbs down on the Civil Rights Restoration Act, thumbs
down on a simple 60-day notice to working men and women who are
about to lose their jobs.''
   He said Bush ``has neither the toughness to govern nor the
compassion to care.''

<HEAD>Congressional Negotiators Reach Compromise On Medicare Drug
Benefit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators moved a giant step
closer to final agreement on catastrophic health insurance
legislation by reaching a tentative compromise on a new Medicare
prescription drug benefit.
   Rep. Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., said Friday he was hopeful that
resolution of the complicated drug issue by a House-Senate working
group of eight legislators could pave the way for final votes on
the overall legislation next week.
   Although several other differences have yet to be worked out in
the first major expansion of Medicare in its 23-year history, Stark
said they are not likely to be as sticky as the drug benefit.
   Both the Senate and House versions of the underlying legislation
contained a prescription drug benefit.
   However, the House version was more expansive and _ from the
Senate perspective _ had far fewer controls to keep the potentially
unpredictable costs of a new program from outstripping revenues
collected to pay for it.
   Medicare does not now cover any outpatient drugs except for a
handful of particularly costly medications such as anti-rejection
drugs for transplant recipients.
   The compromise being recommended to the full House-Senate
conference committee by the working group calls for the new drug
benefit to be phased in starting Jan. 1, 1991.
   After a $600 deductible is met, Medicare would pay half the cost
of any other prescription drugs in 1991. The Medicare share _ still
after a $600 deductible _ would rise to 60 percent in 1992 and to
80 percent in 1993 and thereafter.
   In a cost-control measure pushed by the Senate, the premiums
charged beneficiaries to cover the new drug benefit would be
indexed each year to cover the cost of the program and to keep a
special drug payment trust fund solvent.
   In the first two years of the program _ until the indexing
mechanism could be put in full force _ the secretary of the
Department of Health and Human would have broad powers to keep
costs within projected income.
   Thereafter, the indexing feature would cover additional costs.
   The initial level of those premiums and details of the indexing
are to be worked out in subsequent negotiations of the full
conference committee.
   Although the full conference also has several other differences
to resolve, there is broad support for the underlying legislation,
which passed both houses of Congress overwhelmingly.
   Administration sources have indicated President Reagan, whose
original proposal did not contain a prescription drug benefit, is
likely to sign the measure if it has adequate safeguards to protect
against runaway drug costs.
   The basic legislation does not make provisions for basic,
long-term nursing home care under Medicare, but would shield
Medicare beneficiaries against financially crippling out-of-pocket
doctor and hospital bills.
   While the cap is one of the issues still to be resolved, it is
expected to be between $1,043, the latest House offer, and $1,370,
the latest Senate offer. Medicare would pick up all hospital and
physician costs for a beneficiary after the cap was met in a given
year.
   Medicare now pays full costs for 60 days of a hospital stay in a
given year, minus a first-day deductible, and pays 80 percent of
doctor bills, no matter how high they range.
   On the cost side, the major disagreement is how to distribute
the additional costs Medicare enrollees will have to pay _ both a
flat monthly fee that will be imposed on all and a so-called
supplemental premium that is tantamount to an income tax surcharge
for the estimated 60 percent of Medicare recipients with enough
income to make them subject to federal income taxes.

   A California congressman says Democratic
platform writers should be mindful that ``a significant wing'' of
the party shares the Jackson campaign's view that Pentagon budgets
should be pared by $200 billion over the next four years.
   ``Either we're a party advocating peace or we're a party
advocating war,'' Rep. Ron Dellums, representing both Jesse
Jackson's campaign and his own views, told the party's platform
committee Friday.
   He proposed sharp cuts in military weaponry and calling home
some of the 325,000 U.S. troops in Europe. Fears of a land war
breaking out with the Soviets are a ``gross absurdity and great
waste of resources,'' he said.
   But two Democratic senators who are mentioned as possible
running mates for front-runner Michael Dukakis said the party must
stand for a strong national defense.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia said ``there is some reason for hope''
for an era of improved relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``But in terms of designing a U.S. defense strategy ... we must
acknowledge that under (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, Soviet
military power has not gone down. (It) has increased,'' said Nunn,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``We must measure our defense commitment not against Soviet
intentions, which can change overnight, but against Soviet military
capabilities,'' Nunn said.
   Sen. John Glenn of Ohio said the public was laboring under the
misconception that breakthroughs in nuclear arms talks will free
the United States to cut the Pentagon budget.
   Glenn said the truth was ``exactly the opposite. ... We may have
to spend more instead of less,'' at least in the short term, on
conventional weapons.
   But Dellums drew loud applause from the audience of 100 at the
forum on defense policy with his call for reducing planned
increases for the Pentagon. The military budget has doubled from
$144 billion in fiscal 1980 to $299 billion for fiscal 1989.
   ``I represent a point of view that is a significant wing of the
Democratic Party,'' said Dellums. ``I don't believe that we can
tiptoe into the White House. ... I don't believe that we can
continue to play the game of `Me too,''' on defense spending.
   Bill Myrtetus of Ardmore, Pa., a Pennsylvania state Democratic
committeeman and member of the platform panel, said that from what
he has heard back home, grassroots Democrats could have written
Dellums' speech.
   ``People say cut the military budget,'' Myrtetus said after the
meeting.
   Both Jackson and Dukakis oppose the MX and Midgetman missiles
and have sharply criticized the Reagan administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative missile defense program. But Dukakis has talked
of bolstering conventional U.S. forces.
   Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, a Senate candidate who
moderated the forum, told reporters afterward, ``We can't simply be
against everything. We have to articulate a vision of what we will
do positively to defend this country.''
   Nunn said, ``We have a worldwide commitment whether we like it
or not. There's no one going to take our place in the free world.''
   But Nunn added, ``The time is overdue for a review of the
relative defense burden of the United States and our allies.'' He
said Japan should defend sea and air lanes within 1,000 miles of
its coast, and help Third World countries staggering under debts.
   ``We should say to the Japanese: `It's your turn for a Marshall
Plan,''' said Nunn.
   The platform writers also heard presentations on terrorism,
nuclear arms proliferation and other military and foreign policy
issues.

   Democrats Jesse Jackson and front-runner
Michael Dukakis are going head-to-head on spending in the home
stretch of the presidential primary season as Vice President George
Bush coasts along with a comfortable bank account.
   Jackson, who once had to scrimp along while Dukakis surpassed
all the other Democrats in fund-raising, actually matched the
Massachusetts governor in money from contributors during the month
of April. Both men collected $1.9 million, reports filed Friday
showed.
   With federal matching funds and a $624,000 loan added to his
receipts, Jackson raised more than Dukakis overall in April. The
reports showed he had a total of $4.2 million in receipts,
including $1.7 in matching funds, while Dukakis took in $3.4
million, including $1.1 million in matching funds.
   Dukakis has borrowed no money, and has been the Democratic money
leader since he entered the presidential race. The figures show
continued growth in Jackson's fund-raising capability, which
started out very weak but has steadily improved.
   Looking toward the costly battles in California and New Jersey,
Dukakis and Jackson each entered May with $1 million-plus bank
accounts.
   While Dukakis is collecting delegates at a pace that will land
him the Democratic nomination, Jackson still is waging a
high-stakes fight.
   Jackson actually spent more than Dukakis during April, but a
good chunk of it _ $804,570 _ went to pay off loans, according to
the financial disclosure report he filed with the Federal Election
Commission. Jackson spokesman Tom Schade said the borrowing and
repayment figures reflected a rotating line of credit for Jackson's
operating expenses.
   Jackson reported spending $4 million during the month that saw
costly races in New York and Pennsylvania, while Dukakis spent $3.7
million.
   Jackson ended the month with $1.1 million in cash on hand and
$548,741 in debts. Dukakis had $1.4 million on hand, and $699,906
in obligations.
   On the Republican side, Bush had $4 million in the bank at the
end of April, after raising $2 million for the month _ including
$1.2 million in matching funds _ and spending $1.7 million. Bush
also reported taking out a $20,000 loan for general election
campaign start-up costs.
   Bush's only remaining rival, religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson, suspended his campaign last week. Robertson reported a
debt of $1.4 million at the start of this month. He raised $1.1
million, with $341,523 of that in federal matching funds, and spent
$1.1 million during April. Robertson had $29,473 in the bank.
   Dukakis' campaign said he has raised $23.6 million from the
start of his campaign through the end of April, including $6.8
million in matching funds, which are based on the amount a
candidate raises on his own.
   Jackson's campaign total through April was $11.7 million.
   Dukakis' campaign has been wearing a tight belt lately in order
to save enough for the expensive June 7 California primary and
still be able to spend on its summer convention operations without
surpassing the $27 million cap on the amount primary candidates are
allowed to spend.
   Among the also-rans, Democrats Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri each have campaign debts of
$1.6 million, their reports show. Republican Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas was left with a $1.2 million debt after he dropped out of
the race.

<TEXT>
   Government regulators are holding out hope of
an early reopening date for the Jackson, Miss., Federal Land Bank,
whose doors have been closed as a result of long-running financial
problems.
   The bank will reopen under the management of a receiver ``as
soon as it is practicable,'' Farm Credit Administration Chairman
Frank W. Naylor Jr. said Friday in a statement.
   He announced that the billion-dollar Farm Credit System bank was
being closed and that Ronald E. Watkins of Jackson was being
appointed as a receiver to manage its strained finances.
   Officials formally closed the doors of the bank and its 90
branches in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana at 5:30 p.m. EDT on
Friday.
   The institution is the most troubled component of the $50
billion Farm Credit System, a nationwide network of borrower-owned
banks and lending associations that represents a major credit
source for American agriculture.
   Financial woes that have plagued the Farm Credit System through
the 1980s prompted Congress to pass a major bailout law last year.
The Jackson bank earlier received $30 million under the plan to
raise loan money but had been losing $4.7 million a month since the
first of the year.
   The loan portfolio totaled $1.68 billion a year's end, but 40
percent of that amount was classified as either nonperforming or
high risk. Meanwhile, liabilities climbed to $1.9 billion on March
31.
   In closing the bank's doors and naming a receiver, authorities
moved to reassure both borrowers and creditors.
   ``We have taken this prudent action in order to enable the Farm
Credit System to continue to provide a full range of credit
services to the borrowers in the three-state area,'' Naylor said.
His agency regulates institutions within the system.
   ``Borrower stock is protected by the recently passed
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 and will be retired by the receiver
with funds provided under the act,'' Naylor said. He said earlier
legislation ``provides mechanisms to assure that there will be no
disruption of payment of principle and interest on the banks'
outstanding securities.''
   REW Enterprises Inc., headed by Watkins, issued a letter saying
that ``every available effort will be made to continue serving ...
all the borrowers.''
   Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, issued a statement calling it ``unfortunate
that the situation in regard to the Jackson Federal Land Bank has
come to this stage.''
   ``But I have been assured by FCA personnel that the liquidation
procedure will be similar to the procedure that the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation uses when closing a commercial bank,'' de la
Garza said. ``In fact, FDIC personnel are assisting with the
liquidation arrangements today.''
   ``Borrower stock and rights will be protected and operations
will begin almost immediately under a new bank structure,'' he
said. He added that he had been ``assured that other banks will
assist in providing necessary credit so that there will be no
interruption in providing for the needs of farmers.''

   The second of two reactors at the Braidwood
nuclear plant near Chicago should be in full operation by summer
under a full-power license granted by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Commonwealth Edison Co. says.
   The NRC voted 5-0 on Friday to grant the license, five months
after it had approved a permit for low-power testing at the
reactor, commission spokesman Frank Ingram said.
   ``We're very gratified by the fact that the commissioners voted
unanimously,'' utility spokeswoman Deborah Vestal said. ``We feel
very confident we'll maintain that kind of the support from the
NRC.''
   She said tests of the reactor will continue and it will be
brought up to full power gradually, producing 1.1 million kilowatts
of electricity a day when fully operational in the summer.
   The first of Braidwood's two reactors, located about 20 miles
southwest of Joliet, Ill., was licensed for full-power operation on
July 2, 1987.
   Ingram said the time between issuance of low-power and
full-power licenses for the second Braidwood unit was somewhat
longer than usual because of equipment problems that have since
been resolved.

   An aging Pioneer spacecraft that
gave scientists their first close-up look at Venus continues to
yield secrets of the cloud-shrouded planet 10 years after its
launch, NASA says.
   The Pioneer orbiter has revealed many previously unknown
features of Venus, whose thick veil of sulfuric acid clouds has
kept Earth's telescopes from seeing its 800-degree surface.
   ``It challenges our thinking to try to understand why did Venus
evolve in such a different fashion than Earth,'' project scientist
Larry Colin said Friday. ``And are there any lessons to be learned
there in terms of the direction our own climate is evolving?''
   The probe, with some adjustments, should continue to send data
until it burns up in the Venusian atmosphere when its fuel runs out
in the summer of 1992, said Colin and project manager Richard
Fimmel.
   The two NASA officials quietly celebrated the 10th anniversary
of the probe's launch with a news briefing at NASA Ames Research
Center here, 35 miles south of San Francisco.
   The Pioneer orbiter, one of a series of space probes developed
at Ames, was launched at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 20,
1978. Pioneer originally carried five probes, which separated from
the orbiter and descended into Venus' atmosphere on Dec. 9, 1978,
studying the atmosphere before they burned up.
   Radar data from the $200 million probe provided scientists with
detailed maps of 90 percent of the planet's surface. The
information also helped them understand weather patterns in Venus'
dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and how the solar wind affects it.
   While Venus has been called Earth's twin because it is similar
in size and density, the planet is inhospitably hot because of what
scientists call a ``runaway greenhouse effect,'' or overheating
caused when the atmosphere trapped solar radiation.
   Pioneer revealed hints of old volcanoes on Venus, since
confirmed by radar studies from Earth and by the Soviet Union's
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft.
   But the orbiter is beginning to show its age.
   ``Like people, spacecraft get old, and Pioneer Venus has its
aches and pains,'' Fimmel said.
   The probe's solar cells, which power the craft and its
scientific instruments, are degrading, partly due to a natural
process, partly to bombardment by high-energy sun particles, Colin
said.
   When the orbiter had full power, scientists could run all the
instruments at once, but now they must operate them at different
times, he said.
   The probe, a cylinder 8 feet in diameter and 4 feet high and
topped with a yard-wide antenna dish, is now about 1,200 miles
above the planet's surface.
   Scientists are looking forward to the culmination of the mission
in 1992, when the probe's orbit will bring it within 93 miles of
Venus, into the upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere.
   Pioneer has been unable to take measurements in the planet's
atmosphere since its arrival because of a varying elliptical orbit.
During its fatal re-entry, the probe will be able to detect major
changes since then, Colin said.
   The orbiter also has studied several comets, including Halley's,
Encke, Giacobini-Zinner, Wilson, McNaught and
Nishikawa-Takimizawa-Tago.
   The Venus orbiter is one of six Pioneer probes still operating.
Sun orbiter Pioneer VI, launched in December 1965, is the oldest.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega says he
wants recognition of his president and a reduction of U.S. forces
in Panama before he agrees to end his standoff with Washington.
   Though a White House official said Friday that a tentative deal
had been worked out under which the general would step down as
Panama's military leader, Noriega stridently repeated conditions he
has insisted on for weeks.
   He spoke Friday during a dedication of a grandstand and
sportcasters' and dignitaries' box at an athletic complex in this
working-class suburb nine miles northeast of Panama City.
   ``There cannot be conversation if the (U.S.) aggression
continues, aggression at whatever level, whatever magnitude,
whether it is psychological or economic aggression,'' Noriega said.
   ``Second, (there must be) respect for the government of the
president of the republic, Manuel Solis Palma. And there cannot be
conversation, there cannot be a solution if an exaggerated number
of troops remain on our territory as psychological aggression,'' he
said.
   Neither can there be a solution, he said, unless the government
that remains is recognized by Panama's military.
   About 10,000 U.S. troops are normally stationed at 10 U.S.
military installations along the Panama Canal. About 2,000
reinforcements have been added in recent months as tensions rose
between the United States and Panama.
   Noriega did not refer to a report in Washington that U.S. and
Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls
for the general to leave Panama for nine months beginning in August.
   In return, the United States would drop federal drug smuggling
charges against Noriega, according to a Reagan administration
official in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, controls
the civilian government. The Reagan administration has imposed
sweeping economic sanctions against the country in an effort to
force his ouster.
   The United States still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle, who has
been in hiding, as Panama's legitimate president. Noriega
engineered Delvalle's dismissal on Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle
tried to fire Noriega.
   Noriega spoke to supporters in San Miguelito from the new
dignitaries' box. On the field were several hundred members of the
so-called Dignity Batallions, volunteers formed to confront what
the Noriega regime says is the danger of a U.S. invasion.
   About three dozen volunteers armed with World War II-era rifles
ran through an obstacle course, then battered a dummy dressed in
olive green during a demonstration of their training skills.
   Noriega said the militias would fight any invaders.
   ``Those powerful ones who think they can come to this territory
without getting a whipping are mistaken,'' he said.
   The master of ceremonies who introduced Noriega told foreign
reporters: ``If there is an invasion, you won't be filming
Panamanian cadavers, but the cadavers of North American soldiers
that we will send home to North American mothers.''
   Noriega concluded the list of conditions for a U.S.-Panamanian
solution by saying: ``If I have said nothing, it is because I know
them (the Americans), and because I know them, I remain silent.''
   He also denounced corruption in public administration.
   ``What we need,'' he said, ``is punishment similar to Islamic
punishment. He who puts his hand in the till should have it cut
off. We must reach that kind of radicalization.''
   About 400 militia members were at the combination soccer and
baseball field. Scores of Panamanian flags fluttered in the slight
breeze.
   A similar number of residents were in the grandstands and around
the playing field.
   Several folk groups danced and sang traditional songs. One dance
company featured women in long flowing skirts performing folk tunes
played on guitars and tamborines.

   Here is a chronology based on reports by
authorities of the events in a rampage by a 30-year-old woman
identified by police as Lori Dann. All times are Central Daylight
Time.
   Friday, 9 a.m. _ The woman plants an incendiary device at
Ravinia School in suburban Highland Park. It is discovered burning
by a worker, but does no damage.
   10:30 a.m. _ A fire starts at a residence where Ms. Dann was
employed as a housekeeper. A mother and two children trapped in the
basement escape through a window, avoiding serious injury. An
unexploded incendiary device is recovered.
   Police said Ms. Dann apparently planted a number of incendiary
devices in North Shore communities.
   10:45 a.m. _ The woman enters the Hubbard Woods Elementary
School and goes into a boys' bathroom, shooting one youngster
there. She then walks into a classroom and tells one teacher a boy
has been wounded. She walks into a second classroom past the
teacher, announces she is carrying a real gun, and opens fire,
striking five children.
   11 a.m. _ The woman leaves the school and heads three blocks
across a wooded area to a home on Kent Road.
   11:30 a.m. _ She chases away four of the home's occupants, but
struggles with a young man, who suffers a gunshot wound in the
chest while wresting away one of several weapons she carries.
   Police arrive with SWAT and hostage negotiating teams, and
maintain a vigil outside the house. They are unable to establish
contact, although they say Ms. Dann spoke with her parents, who
live in the nearby suburb of Glencoe.
   6:40 p.m. _ Police Chief Herbert Timm tells reporters that Ms.
Dann's parents have been brought to the house in an attempt to talk
her out of the residence. He says police are prepared to ``take
action'' if her parents are unsuccessful.
   7:30 p.m. _ Timm reports that a SWAT team searching the house
has found Ms. Dann dead on the second floor. Timm says she shot
herself once in the head with a .32-caliber pistol.

   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, demanding to know why the Reagan administration
is doing business with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega: ``I
and the American people want an explanation. ... Unless and until
we have that explanation, I'm not going to be satisfied.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, assessing the negotiations with Noriega:
``Noriega is not plea bargaining with Reagan and Bush. Reagan and
Bush are plea bargaining with Noriega.''
   
   CRAIG FULLER, the vice president's chief of staff, responding to
the publication of a story in The Washington Post concerning George
Bush's position on negotiations with Noriega: ``The administration
sources who have suggested that the vice president favors ending
the negotiations and bringing the envoy back to Washington are
essentially correct.''
   
   PAUL KIRK, Democratic National Chairman, unleashing a stinging
attack on Bush before the Association of Democratic State Chairs
meeting in Atlanta: ``(he) has neither the toughness to govern nor
the compassion to care.''

<HEAD>Tutu Says Evil of Apartheid Can Only Be Likened To Nazism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu told
students that apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical
and unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil
system _ Nazism.''
   At his installation Friday as chancellor of the University of
the Western Cape, the nation's most militant university, the black
Anglican clergman also defended his appeals for tough Western
sanctions against South Africa.
   ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable,
non-violent alternative,'' said the prelate, who is the Anglican
spiritual leader for all of southern Africa and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Tutu said he accepted the position of chancellor on behalf of
detainees, political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of
``this vile and obscene system'' of apartheid, the country's race
segregation system under which the black majority has no voice in
national affairs.
   The prelate returned home Thursday from a month in Europe and
the United States during which he asked for punitive sanctions
against this country.
   The calls were widely covered here in the news media and
denounced not only by the government but by white and black
moderates who say sanctions will increase black unemployment
without inducing whites to accept reforms.
   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' Tutu
said Friday. ``I want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can
be done away with without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''
   Tutu was greeted by hundreds of cheering students upon his
arrival.
   As chancellor at the University of the Western Cape, Tutu will
be the honorary leader of a university that the government
established for mixed-race students in 1960 as part of its
segregated educational system.

   A man who apparently thought he was being
evicted from his room at a YMCA went on a rampage and injured three
people, two of them with a sword, before police shot and wounded
him, police said.
   David Hughes, 48, was shot once in the abdomen Friday outside
the downtown YMCA as he brandished the sword at officers who tried
to disarm him.
   Hughes was listed in serious condition at Grant Medical Center
after undergoing surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said Friday night.
   ``It was a case of another mental (mentally disturbed person) on
the streets of Columbus,'' said Police Chief Dwight Joseph. ``The
officer shot him when he refused to drop the sword.''
   Police charged Hughes with one count of felony assault.
   Hughes had lived at the YMCA for four years and had caused no
trouble, said Marty Nowell, the YMCA communications director.
   Hughes went on the rampage when a letter announcing a tenants
meeting was placed on the door of his sixth-floor room, police
said. He apparently thought the letter was an eviction notice.
   Hughes went to the lobby carrying the sword and a nunchaku, a
martial arts weapon made of two sticks connected by a chain, police
said. They said he argued about the letter with YMCA employees
before attacking the YMCA's housing director and two other
residents, one of whom is blind.
   One man was stabbed twice in the chest, another was stabbed in
the stomach and the third was struck in the head with the martial
arts sticks. They were treated at Grant Medical Center and released.
   Officer Gary Hall fired one shot at Hughes after he left the
building and confronted officers with the sword. No officers were
injured.

   China has approved new regulations to give
foreign-funded businesses greater freedom in hiring and firing
workers, the official China Daily newspaper reported today.
   The move comes as China energetically seeks to boost foreign
investment to advance its economic development.
   The new rules buck the country's state-controlled industrial and
business enterprises, known as ``work units,'' which have often
blocked people from changing jobs and resisted dismissals for
anything short of serious crimes or work violations.
   The newspaper said the new rules approved by the State Council
let foreign-funded businesses recruit their own workers and
managerial staff. They will no longer need permission from local
labor offices to hire workers from outside the area where the
businesses are located, the newspaper said.
   Workers recruited by such businesses will be able to resign from
their present jobs even if their work units raise objections, it
said.
   The regulations also say foreign-funded ventures can fire
employees according to their contracts and without being subject to
outside intervention.

   The U.S. and Panamanian governments are
weighing a proposed agreement that calls for the temporary
departure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from Panama in August in
return for the dismissal of drug smuggling indictments against him,
an administration source says.
   Michael G. Kozak, a State Department official who has spent much
of the past several weeks in Panama, left for Washington on Friday
to explain to his superiors the details of his negotiating effort
with Panamanian authorities.
   The draft agreement would allow Noriega to visit Panama for
holidays and to return permanently following a nine-month stay
outside Panama that ends after presidential elections are held in
May 1989, said the official, who asked not to be identified.
   The official expressed strong objections to the agreement partly
because it would allow Noriega to play a role in the formation of a
transition government that would assume power before his
resignation in August as commander of Panama's Defense Forces.
   The State Department confirmed Kozak's departure from Panama but
declined further comment.
   The administration source emphasized that no final agreement has
been struck and this was confirmed by a White House spokesman and
by an attorney for Noriega in Florida.
   Noriega, speaking Friday at the dedication of a sports facility
near Panama City, said that before an agreement is possible, the
United States must agree to recognize Manuel Solis Palma as
Panama's president and must reduce the number of U.S. troops in
Panama.
   ``There cannot be conversation if the (U.S.) aggression
continues, aggression at whatever level, whatever magnitude,
whether it is psychological or economic aggression,'' Noriega added.
   The proposed agreement is expected to touch off heated debate in
the administration, mostly because of the stipulation that drug
smuggling indictments against Noriega be dropped.
   According to the official, Vice President George Bush already
has registered his objections.
   The official said he shared Bush's reservations, contending that
``if it (the agreement) gets accepted, it gives Noriega everything
he wants.''
   The official said there were no assurances that Noriega was
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the
defense chief might have no intention of resigning his post, as the
agreement specifies.
   Associates of Noriega have said in recent weeks that he sees
Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the fifth
anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense Forces.
   The State Department view is that dropping the indictments
against Noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in Panama.
   It contends that if Noriega's price for leaving Panama is
dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low-cost way of
resolving the 12-week-old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in Panama.
   According to a published report earlier this week, the United
States would reserve the right to reinstate the charges once
Noriega returns to Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been calling on Noriega to step
down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega on Feb. 25
but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega
National Assembly. The United States continues to recognize
Delvalle as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   Bush made known his reservations about the administration's
negotiating position on Wednesday, asserting that, as president, he
would not bargain with drug dealers whether on U.S. or foreign soil.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, confirmed Friday that the
vice president also favors ending the negotiations and bringing
Kozak back to Washington.
   Reports last week of the administration's willingness to dismiss
the indictments generated political turmoil here. The Senate voted
86-10 against that concession.
   U.S. apprehensions about Noriega were heightened on Thursday
when a pro-government newspaper published photographs of U.S.
Embassy employees and their families so that Panamanians will
``know the Gringos who are starving us to death'' _ a reference to
U.S. economic sanctions against Panama.
   The supplement in the newspaper Critica, a propaganda organ of
the government, said the Americans ``think the walls of their
embassy are impregnable.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the supplement
has been ``noted with concern'' and that appropriate security
measures have been taken.
   He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any
Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated.

<HEAD>Study Says Inadequate Job Assistance May Lead To Underclass</HEAD>

   A Senate Republican study group says the
United States is developing an underclass of unskilled workers
because displaced laborers are not receiving adequate job search
assistance, training, counseling or benefits.
   The Senate Republican Conference task force on education and job
training, in a report released Friday, said Congress should enact a
$980 million education and job training program that consolidates
two current programs _ the Job Training Partnership Act and the
Trade Adjustment Assistance Act.
   The group said the new program would serve an estimated 700,000
workers and ``seek to eliminate some of the costly duplication of
effort as well as the delays by the current ... certification
process.''
   ``The new program would also provide substantially greater
emphasis on actual retraining,'' the report said. ``Workers who are
unable to find new jobs which utilize their existing skills require
programs that offer opportunities to update their skills or to
retrain for new occupations.''
   The task force report said of the more than one million American
workers displaced annually, more than one-third of them have
extended periods of unemployment while some never return to the
work force.
   Of those who do return, almost one-half take pay cuts, according
to the study group which was chaired by Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I.
   The United States ``is faced with the creation of a growing
underclass, increasingly made up of former manufacturing and
industrial workers without the skills to enter (the work place),''
the report said.
   The report said projections for the next 15 years indicate that
millions of Americans are not only ill-prepared for existing jobs
but will have even more difficulty in the future ``unless the work
force is retrained and continuously prepared for marketplace
change.''
   The GOP conference is an organization made of all 46 Republican
senators.

   New spending restrictions are in effect at the
Pentagon until at least June 30 to make sure the military stays
within the bounds of a deficit-reduction compromise crafted by
Congress and the president in December.
   The restrictions, ordered Friday by Deputy Defense Secretary
William H. Taft IV, put a halt to purchases of office supplies,
banned overtime and limited civilian hiring for at least the next
six weeks.
   All new contracts for research and development work also have
been put on hold temporarily, as have purchases of everything from
magazine and newspaper subscriptions to television sets, library

<HEAD>Law Makes It Easier For WWII Veterans To Receive Disability
Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law will make it easier for an estimated
300,000 veterans of World War II to receive disability benefits for
exposure to radiation from the atomic blasts in Japan or from
nuclear test explosions.
   Legislation signed Friday by President Reagan bypasses in some
cases the usual requirement that veterans claiming disability
benefits must prove the disability was connected with their
military service.
   The new law applies primarily to cancer of various organs. The
Office of Management and Budget said more than 300,000 veterans
would be affected by the legislation, and the first-year cost was
estimated at $65.6 million.
   Norman Solomon, Washington spokesman for the Alliance of Atomic
Veterans, called the new law ``a long overdue step toward taking
care of a very large and serious problem.''

<HEAD>Better Explanation Required On Adjustable Rate Mortgages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings institutions have until Oct. 1 to
begin complying with new rules that require them to offer better
explanations of their adjustable-rate mortgage programs.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates 3,120
federally insured savings institutions, said S&Ls must provide the
information either when a mortgage application form is offered or
before the borrower pays any non-refundable fees, whichever occurs
first.
   Lenders must include a historic example of how mortgage payments
would have changed over the past 15 years using the index or
formula on which interest rate changes are based. S&Ls must also
notify borrowers at least 25 days in advance of any change in
monthly payments.
   The new rules were adopted last week and became effective
Monday, however the bank board did not announce adoption of the
regulation until Friday.

<HEAD>VA Mortgage Interest Rate to Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration is raising its
maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home mortgages to
reflect recent increases in interest rates in financial markets.
   The agency said Friday the rates would rise by one-half
percentage point to 10.5 percent, effective Monday.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Friday that the
national average for 30-year, conventional mortgages _ those
without government guarantees _ rose to 10.52 percent this week
from 10.40 percent last week.
   The VA said that effective Monday a variety of other mortgage
rates will also rise by one-half percentage point. Graduated
payment mortgages will increase to 10.75 percent, home improvement
loans will rise to 12 percent and loans for mobile homes will
increase to 13 percent.
   The VA rates apply to new loans, not existing ones. VA mortgages
peaked at 17.5 percent in September 1981 before beginning a decline
and reaching a low for this decade of 8.5 percent in January 1987.

<HEAD>Bahamian Government Says It Will Confiscate Lehder's Property
Itself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bahamian government has its own
ideas about the property of Carlos Lehder Rivas, whose conviction
on U.S. cocaine-smuggling charges led to a jury ruling that the
Colombian should forfeit his Bahamas assets to the United States.
   The Bahamas _ whose leader reportedly is a potential target of
the Lehder trial prosecutor _ plans to move to confiscate Lehder's
property itself, according to a statement released Friday by the
Bahamas Information Service.
   The Bahamas has laws that allow it to confiscate the land of
those convicted of drug trafficking outside the Bahamas and it will
use these provisions to confiscate Lehder's Bahamian assets, the
statement said.
   The statement lauded Lehder's conviction Thursday of charges
that he smuggled about 3.3 tons of cocaine from Colombia to the
United States via the Bahamas.
   A week ago, the Bahamian government took out full-page
advertisements in several major U.S. newspapers rebutting charges
by some U.S. officials and news media that it hasn't done enough to
stop drug smuggling and that its officials were bribed by smugglers.
   A federal jury found Lehder guilty of all 11 counts, ranging
from conspiracy to import cocaine to engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise. Lehder has been identified as a leader of the
violent Medellin Cartel of Colombia.
   The panel deliberated another 10 hours Friday on a second phase
of the trial that resulted in the forfeiture of Lehder's Bahamian
assets.
   The convicted drug smuggler owned a large portion of Norman's
Cay, a Bahamian island about 40 miles southeast of Nassau. His
holdings included a 3,000-foot airstrip, three homes on Norman's
Cay and a condominium in Nassau. Lehder, 38, paid about $1.3
million for the property in the late 1970s, and prosecutors said
Lehder used Norman's Cay as his smuggling base. U.S. Attorney
Robert W. Merkle called it ``an aircraft carrier of cocaine.''
   ``The island is wrecked. But that is not to say it would not be
of some future value,'' Merkle said after the verdict on forfeiture.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller had urged the jury to
require Lehder to forfeit all his Bahamian assets.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton set sentencing for July 20.
Lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines. Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, who was found guilty on one
count of conspiracy, faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars and
$25,000 in fines.
   But Lehder attorney Edward Shohat told Melton after the jury was
dismissed that under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in existence at the
time of Lehder's extradition, his client should face a maximum of
only 30 years in prison. Merkle disagreed, and the judge asked both
sides to submit briefs on the question.
   Merkle refused to comment on reports that Bahamian Prime
Minister Lynden O. Pindling _ who trial witnesses said received
million-dollar bribes from Lehder _ is his next target.
   Pindling and his aides have denied the allegations, but have
said they understand a Florida grand jury is investigating the
matter.
   Lehder was extradited to the United States last year after a
firefight and his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin
mansion.
   U.S. drug enforcement officials have warned that while Ledher's
conviction is important, it alone will not stop the narcotics flow.
   ``You've got an awful lot of heads on the Hydra you have to cut
off,'' U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr Jim Simpson said Friday. ``Lehder
was one of them.''
   The Medellin Cartel still ships up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine
imports. The DEA considered Lehder one of the four managers of the
cartel until his arrest early last year. The others have evaded _
and sometimes defied _ Colombian and U.S. justice.

<HEAD>Administration Dealings With Noriega Serve As Fodder On Campaign
Trail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's dealings with Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega continue to attract attention on the presidential
campaign trail, as Michael Dukakis demands an explanation and
George Bush tries to distance himself from the policies of his boss.
   Democratic front-runner Dukakis, campaigning in California, said
Friday that ``somebody in the administration'' is going to have to
tell the American people ``who it was who thought it was in the
interests of the American people and this country that we do
business with somebody who was a known drug peddler and who was
suspected of murder.''
   ``Unless and until we have that explanation, I'm not going to be
satisfied,'' said Dukakis, who has focused on the Reagan
administration drug policy and dealings with Noriega as he
campaigns in advance of California's crucial June 7 primary.
   U.S. and Panamanian officials on Friday reportedly reached a
tentative agreement for Noriega's departure from the Central
American nation in August in exchange for dropping drug charges
against him in the United States.
   According to an administration source who disclosed the
tentative agreement, Bush already has registered his objections to
the plan.
   Dukakis' Democratic rival, Jesse Jackson, repeated his criticism
of U.S. negotiations with Noriega but made no reference to the
reported tentative agreement.
   The American people have received ``too much talk and too little
information,'' about what's going on concerning dealings with
Noriega, Jackson said at a church rally in San Francisco.
   ``Noriega is not plea bargaining with Reagan and Bush. Reagan
and Bush are plea bargaining with Noriega,'' Jackson told more than
500 supporters at the rally.
   Jackson was scheduled to appear at a shipyard rally with labor
groups in the San Pedro port of Los Angeles today.
   Bush was saying nothing publicly on Noriega, but the vice
president's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, issued a statement Friday
confirming published reports ``that the vice president favors
ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy back to Washington.''
   Fuller's statement, issued before the latest tentative deal was
disclosed, was the closest Bush has come to publicly disagreeing
with President Reagany over the administration's Panamanian policy.
Two days earlier Bush said, without mentioning Noriega by name,
that he would not negotiate with accused drug runners in this
country or on foreign soil.
   The subject of Panama and drugs arose again Friday when another
Bush aide, Donald Gregg, said in a sworn court deposition that
during a December 1983 meeting, the president of Panama told Bush
about allegations of drug running among Panamanian officials and
also told the vice president the stories were untrue.
   ``The vice president said he had not been aware of the charges
or he would have raised them'' during the session, Gregg testified
in a deposition taken in Washington for a private civil lawsuit.
   In Atlanta, the Democrats' top hired gun opened fire on Bush on
another front, calling him ``a quintessential elitist establishment
Republican country-clubber'' and a do-nothing public official.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said during a
meeting of the Association of Democratic State Chairs that Bush is
a mere functionary ``applauding in the dark shadows of this
Republican administration as it turns thumbs down on public ethics,
thumbs down on the Civil Rights Restoration Act, thumbs down on a
simple 60-days' notice to working men and women who are about to
lose their jobs.''
   The challenge for Democrats is to ``make sure that when people
go to the polls in November, George Bush will have a rendezvous
with his own record,'' Kirk told the party leaders.
   Democrats also took up the issue of military spending as the
party's platform committee met Friday in suburban Washington.
   California Rep. Ronald Dellums told the panel ``a significant
wing'' of the party shares the Jackson campaign's view that
Pentagon budgets should be trimmed by $200 billion over the next
four years.
   ``I represent a point of view that is a significant wing of the
Democratic Party,'' said Dellums. ``I don't believe that we can
tiptoe into the White House. ... I don't believe that we can
continue to play the game of `Me too,''' on defense spending.
   ``Either we're a party advocating peace or we're a party
advocating war,'' Dellums added.
   But two Democratic senators who are mentioned as possible
running mates r front-runner Michael Dukakis _ John Glenn of Ohio
and Sam Nunn of Georgia _ told the committee the party must stand
for a strong national defense.

   A man police say was drunk when his pickup
truck rammed a church bus has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of
murder, while a pastor told 1,200 mourners that the ``tragedies
ultimately will be turned into triumphs.''
   Larry W. Mahoney, 34, entered the plea Friday through a lawyer
in a hearing in Carroll District Court at Carrollton, near the site
of the May 14 crash. Mahoney was silent and kept his head bowed or
eyes lowered during the hearing.
   Meanwhile, in Radcliff, friends, family and community members
packed the First Assembly of God Church, where the Rev. W. Don
Tennison told an evening mass funeral service that people around
the world have offered condolences.
   ``The world is grieving with us in this tragedy,'' he said, his
voice wavering at times. Church members say phone calls have been
received from as far away as Honduras, Japan, Germany and Argentina.
   Youth evangelist Dave Roever of Fort Worth, Texas, in a spirited
benediction, promised those in attendance to turn the tragedy
``into triumphs'' against the use of alcohol. His words were
greeted with thunderous applause.
   The Radcliff church, which owned the bus and lost 13 members,
was filled with 1,000 mourners, while another 250 stood outside in
the setting sun, embracing one other and holding hands, listening
to eulogies and music from speakers.
   Inside, carnations, roses and lilies lined the altars and
surrounded eight caskets. Pictures and personal mementos were
placed around each casket _ a baseball from one boy's first home
run, a blue mortar board graduation cap for a high school senior
who would have graduated next week.
   Pictures of four other victims were placed on pedestals near the
coffins. Two of them, including the bus driver, will be among the
four remembered in funerals today.
   ``My heart is crushed,'' Tennison told mourners. He recited a
poem he wrote that said in part, ```We rejoice together in
blessings, weep together in losses ... because we are family, we
will rise again out of this tragedy.''
   The victims were killed the night of May 14 when their bus was
hit head-on by Mahoney, who was driving on the wrong side of the
road on Interstate 71. Police say Mahoney's blood-alcohol level was
2{ times the legal limit at the time of the crash.
   The victims, mostly teen-agers, were returning from a daylong
outing at Kings Island amusement park near Cincinnati.
   Of 67 people on the bus, 40 children escaped, but 11 remain
hospitalized, including five in critical condition.
   After Friday's hearing in Carrollton, Mahoney was taken to the
psychiatric unit at the Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange,
where doctors will determine whether he is competent to stand trial.
   Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty.
   During the hearing, Mahoney's mother, Mary, wept occasionally,
while his father, John, also wiped tears from his eyes. Mahoney was
permitted 10-minute, private meetings with family members after the
hearing.
   About 50 people, some of them friends, gathered outside the
courthouse door as Mahoney was led to a state police cruiser, some
shouting ``Larry, we're with you'' and ``Hang in there, Larry.''

   An unprecedented Soviet newspaper article
describes life as being so demeaning and dreary in one women's
penal colony on the Volga River that inmates are driven to drugs
and lesbianism.
   A prisoner identified only as Kutsyenkova, a former college
lecturer, told the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya of the desperation
among prisoners in Corrective Labor Women's Colony No. 65-15 in
Kuybyshev, 620 miles southeast of Moscow.
   ``The regime of the colony gives rise to a destructive process
in a woman,'' says Kutsyenkova, whose crime leading to her
imprisonment was not disclosed in the article.
   ``Marching in formation, ugly clothes, banging of iron,
commands, meatless diet _ this makes one insipid, dull, leads one
to search for emotional relief at any price.''
   Inmates could fight off ``a breakdown'' for five years at the
most, Kutsyenkova says in the Friday article _ but ``then the
organism catastrophically weakens'' and convicts seek solace in
smoking, lesbianism and narcotics.
   The prisoner ``experiences an atrophy of will and initiative, a
growing of uncontrollable rage,'' says the woman, whose doctoral
dissertation had been about the family.
   According to the article, punishment of prisoners often
backfires, causing them to get into more trouble instead of leading
them to rehabilitation.
   Some inmates don't want to be freed after serving long prison
terms because they no longer have families on the outside,
Kutsyenkova said. The article told of two freed prisoners who slept
for several nights right outside the colony, ``praying to be taken
back'' because they could no longer live on their own.
   It was one of the first articles about conditions in women's
prison camps. Conditions at the Soviet Union's notorious penal
colonies and labor camps for men, described in the books of exile
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, were once taboo subjects for Soviet news
media.
   However, the policy of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev of
open discussion of the nation's problems has produced reports
exposing deficiencies in the criminal justice system.
   Alexander V. Vlasov, who as minister of internal affairs
oversees the prisons, acknowledged in a commentary accompanying the
article that improvements are needed.
   ``Quite a few problems have piled up in the system of corrective
labor institutions. Perestroika is needed also in this sphere in
which the human factor should be made predominant too,'' he writes.
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's term for his overhauling of Soviet
society.
   The article said inmates of Corrective Labor Women's Colony No.
65-15 had murdered husbands and children, taken bribes or engaged
in other forms of corruption. Sovietskaya Rossiya said one woman
had been an engineer-economist, another a chief bookkeeper, a third
the director of a large store. Several had been senior lecturers at
colleges.
   As prisoners, they had to work up to 10-12 hours a day in sewing
shops with poor ventilation, the article said.
   If a prisoner went out without a shawl, smoked in a prohibited
area or said goodnight too loudly to cellmates the punishment might
be 10-15 days in an isolation cell.
   Vlasov said his ministry was trying to improve the quality of
its staff at the colonies and labor camps. He said new codes were
being drafted to make the punishment more appropriately fit a
convict's crime and to provide in some cases for a reduction of
sentences.
   Time off for good work and good behavior is being planned as one
experiment.
   Vlasov did not specifically address the problems of lesbianism
and drug addiction among women inmates.
   The official Tass news agency carried a report a year ago saying
life in one camp outside Moscow was hard, but that prisoners were
treated fairly and given free time and an opportunity to get an
education.
   Soviet officials say the camps are designed to make inmates take
a conscientious attitude toward work and teach them to live by the
law.
   Western organizations estimate the camps hold 1 million people.

<HEAD>Sandinistas and Contras Agree on New Date for Talks But Not on

   Government and rebel leaders have
agreed to resume peace talks next week before their tenative truce
expires, but remain at odds over where to meet.
   Jorge Rosales, spokesman for the U.S.-supported rebels known as
Contras, said from Miami on Friday that rebel leaders had agreed to
the government's proposal that the third round of talks begin
Wednesday.
   He said Contra leaders plan to meet with representatives of the
leftist Sandinista government at the southern frontier post of
Sapoa, where the sides signed a 60-day cease-fire on March 23.
   But Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said in a note to rebel
official Roberto Ferrey that the meeting must be held in Managua.
   To meet outside the capital would be ``to go back on the
advances that, with great difficulties, have been achieved,'' he
said in the letter released by the presidential press office.
   The Contras have objected to keeping the talks in Managua, where
the first two rounds were held, because they said their movements
were restricted by the Sandinista government. The rebels said they
were unable freely meet with domestic opposition leaders.
   The sides are trying to forge a lasting peace under the Sapoa
accords, which provided for the temporary truce that expires May 30
and promised the Contras a role in the political future of a more
democratic Nicaragua.
   But little progress appears to have been made and rebel fighters
have been reluctant to move into designated cease-fire zones agreed
to by negotiators.
   Tinoco told reporters Friday that the government had proposed
halting the fighting for another month, but the rebels have not
responded. The Sandinistas have threatened to mount a major
offensive if the truce is not extended.
   The Contra leadership has in the past month suffered from
infighting over the military leadership of Col. Enrique Bermudez.
But rebel officials now say the rifts have been healed.
   On Friday, a Costa Rican official said Bermudez would attend
next week's peace talks. He has not previously taken part in the
discussions.
   Sources say thousands of rebel fighters have moved toward the
border with Honduras, through which the U.S. Agency for
International Development is providing them humanitarian aid.
   As part of the Sapoa accords, rebel fighters have been permitted
to receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization.
   The Sandinistas have said the insurgents can receive food,
medicine and clothes distributed by the International Red Cross.
But the Contras rejected that, saying the organization sympathizes
with the government.
   Meanwhile, the government on Friday temporarily barred
church-run Radio Catolica from airing a news program that had
broadcast an interview with a rebel chief.
   The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the station
should have cleared the interview with the government and that the
news program could not resume broadcasting until Tuesday.
   Radio Catolica and two other privately owned radio stations were
temporarily prohibited from broadcasting news programs earlier this
month because of their reports on a workers' strike.

   A baby sitter who killed one child and
wounded five others before killing herself was remembered by some
as a quiet woman who loved children, while others recalled an
eccentric with deep psychological problems.
   ``She was a sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in that she had
mood swings up and down,'' said John Childs, whose former
girlfriend, Lori Wasserman Dann, was found dead in a barricaded
house after the shooting spree that began Friday at an elementary
school. She also wounded a 20-year-old man.
   Ms. Dann, 30, ``had her own idiosyncracies,'' said Childs, 34.
She loved children, for example, but had ``little compassion'' for
handicapped people, he said.
   Ms. Dann's parents ``feel absolutely destroyed by this,'' said
Herbert Timm, the police chief in this affluent Chicago suburb.
Only a caretaker answered the phone at the home of her parents,
Norman and Edith Wasserman.
   Ms. Dann, had ``some very deep psychological problems'' and had
been seeing a psychiatrist, Timm said. She also had earlier brushes
with the police in Illinois and Wisconsin.
   After the shooting rampage, she telephoned her parents.
   ``I have hurt some children. I've done a bad thing. I'm sorry.
Please help me,'' she said, according to Timm. She later shot
herself once in the head with a .32-caliber pistol.
   In Madison, Wis., where Ms. Dann lived during the past year,
people remembered her as an eccentric.
   She was dubbed ``the elevator woman'' because she rode the
elevator for extended periods _ night and day _ in the high-rise
residence where she lived earlier this year, Keith Wilson recalled
in a telephone interview with the Wisconsin State Journal.
   Wilson, now a Los Angeles resident, lived across the hall from
her in the building near the University of Wisconsin campus.
   Another acquaintance, Brian Soifer, told WMAQ radio, ``I never
really saw her talk to anybody, never saw her eat dinner with
anybody. ... (She) watched TV all the time.''
   School officials said they had no record of her as a student
after 1977, and Wilson said he never saw her study.
   She attended the University of Arizona in the late 1970s, the
school said.
   ``I had to move out because I couldn't live with her,'' former
roommate Lois Wander told the Journal from her home in Highland
Park. ``She was always very weird.''
   But residents of Glencoe and neighboring suburbs who knew Ms.
Dann couldn't believe the news.
   ``I am terribly, terribly shocked, it's unbelievable,'' said
Childs' mother, Alexandra, who recalled that Ms. Dann visited her
home half a dozen times when she was dating her son, often playing
with her grandchildren.
   The Wassermans live around the corner from the Childs family in
a large, white one-story ranch house in Glencoe, a North Shore
suburb of about 9,000 residents that is the nation's
20th-wealthiest suburb with a per-capita income of $35,632 per year.
   ``She was a pretty girl, intelligent but reticent ... a listener
more than a talker,'' Mrs. Childs said. ``She might have been a
little different than average, but not in my wildest dreams could I
have imagined this.''
   Craig Bayless of Winnetka, a real-estate broker, remembered Ms.
Dann as ``a fine baby sitter'' who looked after his daughter
several times last summer.
   ``We had no real problems at all. Our daughter, who was 3 ...
liked her just fine. She was a nice, quiet girl,'' Bayless said.
   Yet, Ms. Dann had had several brushes with the law.
   Lake County authorities said she was a suspect in the May 1986
stabbing of her estranged husband, Russell. She was never charged.
   Ms. Dann was arrested on disorderly conduct charges by the Lake
County state's attorney's office, suspected of making threatening
and harassing phone calls. Those charges were dismissed.
   In March, she was arrested in Madison, Wis., for shoplifting.
   Timm said the FBI had also been preparing to seek charges
against Ms. Dann for making death threats to someone in Colorado,
possibly her boyfriend.

   The parents of Nicholas Corwin, the
8-year-old boy slain when a woman went on a shooting rampage in his
classroom, expressed their grief _ as well as pride in their son _
in a brief handwritten eulogy.
   The statement was handed Friday to reporters who gathered in
front of the home of Joel and Linda Corwin.
   The statement read, in part:
   ``Nicholas Brent Corwin, nicknamed Nick, a gifted athlete, a
gifted artist, a gifted student, a child full of love and honor, a
child who made his parents weep with joy at his talent and his
attractiveness. He loved people; he loved organizing games; he
played basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer; he drew pictures that
showed a keen eye for detail and a vivid imagination; a sweet and
loving child who always had concern for others, who always tried to
smooth ruffled feathers and always supported his classmates and
friends.''
   The statement concluded:
   ``Nick enjoyed the role of helping others and lending support
whenever he could. He was a very tough competitor in his athletic
games, but a sensitive and kind child off the field or court. He
brightened our lives with such a brilliant light that we cannot
believe he is gone.''
   A neighbor, Dave Agnew, stood on the Corwin family lawn Friday
evening and talked with reporters.
   ``He was an outstanding young man,'' Agnew said of the slain
boy. ``A lot of people saw in him a great deal of challenge _ as
much as you can see in a second-grader.''
   Agnew said that the boy's father is an attorney in downtown
Chicago and that the Corwins have two other children, Michael, 11,
and John, 6.

   A woman about to lose her baby-sitting job
went on a shooting spree that left an 8-year-old dead and six
others wounded, then killed herself after apologizing to her
parents for the carnage, authorities said.
   The nearly nine-hour rampage of Lori Wasserman Dann, 30, began
at an elementary school in this wealthy Chicago suburb and ended
late Friday, when a police SWAT team found her body in a house
where she had confronted a family at gunpoint, officials said.
   Ms. Dann, who had a history of bizarre behavior, shot herself in
the head with a .32-caliber gun after telephoning her parents,
Police Chief Herbert Timm said.
   ``I have hurt some children. I've done a bad thing. I'm sorry.
Please help me,'' she told them, Timm said.
   The FBI had been preparing to seek charges against Ms. Dann for
making death threats against someone in Colorado, possibly her
boyfriend, he said.
   Earlier Friday, Ms. Dann tried to set fire to a home and another
school, police said. Police also believe she tried to serve
contaminated milk to the children she baby-sat.
   Then, about 10:45 a.m., she entered a boys bathroom at Hubbard
Woods Elementary School in this affluent Chicago suburb and shot a
youngster, Timm said.
   She next entered a second-grade classroom, said ``This gun is
real,'' opened fire and fatally wounded the 8-year-old boy and
critically wounded four other children, authorities said.
   ``There was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked
over'' as the children panicked during the 15 minutes the shooting
lasted, said Glencoe Patrolman John Ceglieski.
   ``Kids were lying around in very serious condition,'' in the
school, Timm said. ``Kids were hiding under the desk as well as
well as they could.''
   Police recovered a .357-caliber Magnum revolver from the school.
Ms. Dann had been issued a permit for the gun, despite the fact she
had been investigated for possible criminal acts in several states,
Timm said.
   Lake County authorities said Ms. Dann was a suspect in the May
1986 icepick stabbing of her estranged husband, Russell, who was
attacked at his Highland Park home while he slept. She was never
charged.
   Ms. Dann was arrested on disorderly conduct charges in Lake
County, suspected of making threatening and harassing phone calls.
Those charges were dismissed.
   In March, she was arrested in Madison, Wis., on a shoplifting
charge.
   Before the school shootings, Timm said, Ms. Dann went to the
home of the couple who had told her she was losing her baby-sitting
job because the family was moving. Ms. Dann was to have taken the
two children of Padraig and Marion Rushe on an outing.
   ``We have evidence that the milk in the Rushe home had been
tampered with and containers of that milk had been taken with the
two children,'' Timm said.
   The children, ages 4 and 6, did not drink the milk, police said.
The milk was being analyzed.
   Police found books about poison in Ms. Dann's Madison apartment.
   Ms. Dann took the children to Ravinia School in nearby Highland
Park, where she set off a small container of flammable liquid, Timm
said. Firefighters extinguished the burning device before it caused
damage.
   Ms. Dann next drove to a day-care center, where she went to the
front door carrying a can of gasoline, Timm said.
   ``But she was met at the front door by a staff member who asked
what she was doing _ and she took off,'' he said.
   Ms. Dann returned to the Rushe home, talked to the family in the
basement, then went upstairs and set off another incendiary device,
he said.
   While the fire raged, Mrs. Rushe pushed her children through a
basement window, then crawled out herself.
   Ms. Dann then drove to the school and opened fire.
   Eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin died of his wounds several hours
after he was shot in his classroom.
   The five other injured children remained in critical but stable
condition early today, except for a girl who was in critical but
unstable condition with a serious chest and abdominal wound,
doctors said.
   After the school shooting, Ms. Dann crashed her car on a
dead-end street, then ran through woods to a home and confronted
four members of a family and their maid, said Joe Sumner, police
operations director.
   ``Then we heard a shot. The son came out, holding a gun, and
fell over in the driveway,'' Sumner said. Police had surrounded the
home by that point.
   In the struggle with Philip Andrew, 20, she lost the second of
the three guns she carried during the spree. Andrew suffered a
chest wound, and the other occupants of the house fled.
   The police siege then began.
   ``I just heard police surrounding the house, calling, `Lori,
let's get it over with.' I didn't hear any response. Then I heard a
shot, a blast I would say,'' said Hildegard Oberstoetter, a
housekeeper next door.

<HEAD>Courts Reduce Sentences for Three Solidarity Activists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court has reduced the prison
sentences of three Solidarity activists jailed during this past
month's widespread labor unrest. The two still being held are to be
freed on Wednesday.
   Gdansk activists Bogdan Lis and Czeslaw Nowak, arrested May 4 on
charges of urging strikes in the Baltic port city, on Friday had
jail terms reduced from three months to three weeks.
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, originally
sentenced May 7 to six weeks in prison but freed Monday pending
appeal, was instead ordered to perform 20 hours of public service.
   The three were arrested during more than two weeks of strikes
and street protests that ended May 10.
   The protests, triggered in part by steep price increases, posed
the most serious challenge to Poland's Communist leaders since
their 1981 martial law crackdown on Solidarity.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said one day after the final
strike ended peacefully May 10 at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk that
the government would follow a ``non-repressive policy'' toward the
strikers.
   The last of 38 strikers arrested May 5 when police stormed the
strikebound Nowa Huta steelworks in southern Poland were freed
Monday.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said even the shortened sentences
meted out by the appeals court Friday were unjustified.
   ``I don't know what to think about these sentences,'' he said
from his home in Gdansk. ``It is ridiculous.''
   Onyszkiewicz had been charged with spreading false information
intended to cause public unrest. The mathematics instructor at
Warsaw University said he was put on trial as a warning to people
not to speak to the Western press.
   ``This is glasnost Polish-style,'' he said.
   Solidarity, the only independent labor federation ever allowed
in the Soviet bloc, was banned in 1982.

   Children here need to be convinced that
school is a safe place, officials said, following a woman's
shooting rampage that left one child dead and six other people
critically wounded.
   ``It's an incident the violates all of us,'' Winnetka
Superintendent Don Monroe said late Friday night after meeting with
parents, children, clergy and social workers.
   More meetings are planned throughout the weekend, as the shocked
community of 12,500 tries to work through what one parent called
the ultimate nightmare.
   ``The intent of all of our activities is to work together so
that children will once again feel that there are familiar adults
in school that care about them,'' Monroe said.
   A woman identified as Lori Wasserman Dann, 30, was found dead in
a house where she had barricaded herself for nearly nine hours
after she went on the shooting spree Friday morning at Hubbard
Woods Elementary School, killing one child and wounding five
others. She later wounded an adult. Police said she killed herself.
   Ms. Dann, a baby sitter, had entered the school about 10:45
a.m., shot a youngster in the bathroom and then entered a
second-grade classroom, where she opened fire, police said.
   Eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin died of his wounds at Highland
Park Hospital. The other five children were taken to two hospitals,
along with a 20-year-old man who tried to wrestle a gun away from
Ms. Dann.
   Ann Arnold, who lives across the street from one of the wounded
children, said her 7-year-old son made sure the doors were locked
after he came home from school.
   ``He's still scared something else is going to happen,'' Mrs.
Arnold said.
   Adults, too, were in shock.
   ``I don't feel comfortable being outside,'' said Anne Belmont.
   Monroe, his shirt stained with blood, tried to reassure anxious
parents immediately after the shooting at the sprawling, one-story
brick school.
   ``We never have a drill for something like this. But we do have
fire and tornado drills, so the kids were on the floor in the other
classrooms'' after the shooting, he said.
   Parents who arrived on the scene after the shooting helped
entertain children until social workers arrived.
   Standing outside school at the end of the day, Jim Romey said
his 7-year-old daughter was in another classroom when the shooting
occurred.
   ``The kids are calm,'' said his wife, Blanche. School officials
``told us to take them home and let them talk because they've been
talked to a lot today,'' she said.
   Parents also were told not to push their children to talk, but
to give them time to react to the tragedy.
   Winnetka, a northern Chicago suburb, is marked by large homes
and comfortable incomes. A survey released last year by a Roosevelt
University urbanologist ranked it as the nation's 22nd-wealthiest
suburb with an estimated per-capita income of $35,406.
   ``The community has responded beautifully,'' Monroe said.
``There's a high level of cooperation and people are coming
together to try to put this in perspective.''
   Families of four of the injured children gathered at Evanston
Hospital, which assigned a special team of doctors and social
workers to meet with them.
   ``All four families were together in one room,'' said John
Bozeday, a social worker.
   ``One of the things that has happened,'' he said, ``is that
they've kind of pulled together and formed a larger family of their
own.''

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has shut down a television
station that criticized President Vinicio Cerezo's administration
during a news report.
   Mario David Garcia, director of the station's newscast ``Here,
the World,'' is one of five civilians and six military officers
charged in a May 11 coup attempt. He was a presidential candidate
for the rightist Authentic National Center party in the 1985
elections won by Cerezo.
   Max Kestler Farnes, president of Channel 3 television, read a
letter over the air Thursday from the government's National Radio
and Television Department that said the station had broadcast
``material considered dangerous for state security'' and would be
closed ``until further notice.''
   Enrique Hernandez, acting director of the department, confirmed
Friday he had signed and sent the letter.
   The station, which has been broadcasting for 32 years,
interrupted the film ``The Ten Commandments'' to read the letter
and then left the air.
   Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, is the first civilian president
since 1970 and the second in more than 30 years of military and
military-dominated governments.
   Two weeks before the May 11 coup attempt, Garcia read on the air
a communique that said the political process ``has been betrayed by
a corrupt clique'' of communists, military leaders and Christian
Democrats.
   In a speech Thursday, Cerezo denied the charge.
   ``Everyone who says those lies is an enemy of stability and
wants Guatemala to return to violence, which favors the subversive
groups who want to destroy democratic society and establish
authoritarian society,'' he said.
   The term ``subversive'' is commonly used by Guatemalan officials
to refer to leftist guerrillas fighting for 27 years to overthrow
the nation's governments.
   An estimated 100,000 people have died since 1954 and 40,000
disappeared in the past 20 years in violence by the extreme right
and left, a guerrilla war and a brutal army anti-rebel campaign in
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   In another development, the Secret Anti-Communist Army claimed
responsibility for an attack Wednesday on the home of the
correspondent for the Soviet news agency Tass.
   Two grenades exploded at the home, shattering windows,
destroying a metal door and damaging his vehicle, correspondent
Alejandro Trouchine said.
   The communique, published Friday in local newspapers, also
expressed support for the news program ``Here, the World'' and
threatened to take action against the Nicaraguan ambassador and
Christian Democrats if attempts are made to arrest the five
civilians accused in the coup attempt.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $1.5 Million To Man Who Claimed Lesbian Nun Broke Up
Marriage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $1.5 million to a man
who claimed his marriage was destroyed by a lesbian nun who seduced
his wife, and that church officials did nothing to prevent it.
   Steve Woolverton sued former Sister Mary Kregar and the Catholic
Diocese of Brownsville, alleging that an affair between Ms. Kregar
and his wife, Mary Woolverton, broke up his 12-year marriage in
1984.
   Woolverton's personal-injury lawsuit, filed in 1986, also
claimed church officials were negligent by allowing Ms. Kregar to
serve as a nun in Port Isabel and continue serving there after
Woolverton told them of the affair.
   ``The jury has returned a verdict finding not only the conduct
on the part of the nun (was negligent), as we had stated in our
lawsuit, but also the conduct on the part of the parish priest in
not attending and responding to this in a timely fashion,'' Edwin
Randolph Fleuriet, Woolverton's lawyer, said after Friday's verdict.
   Ms. Kregar came to Our Lady Star of the Sea Church in Port
Isabel in September 1983 and became director of the choir, for
which Mrs. Woolverton played the guitar. Ms. Kregar left the
Franciscan order of nuns in August 1984.
   The Woolvertons, who have three children, separated in May 1984,
and Woolverton claimed in his suit filed two years later that Ms.
Kregar ``used her fiduciary position of trust to commence a
seduction of plaintiff's wife.''
   Jurors deliberated for five hours before awarding Woolverton
$500,000 in actual damages, $500,000 in exemplary damages from Ms.
Kregar and $500,000 in exemplary damages from the diocese.
   The Rev. Ben Verbrugge, then parish priest; Bishop John J.
Fitzpatrick; Ms. Kregar; and Sister Cecilia Rolling, a nun at the
Port Isabel church, were found guilty of ``gross negligence'' by
failing to intervene in the matter after Woolverton told the priest
of the lesbian relationship.
   Although Woolverton had sought $5 million in damages, Fleuriet
said he was pleased with the judgment.
   Defense lawyers never denied that there had been an affair
between Mrs. Woolverton and Ms. Kregar. Most of the trial testimony
took the form of videotaped depositions from Ms. Kregar, Mrs.
Woolverton, church officials and a family friend.
   Darrell Barger, lead attorney for the diocese, contended during
the trial that the suit was for ``money, money, money'' and that
when Bishop Fitzpatrick became convinced of the lesbian
relationship in March 1984, he acted quickly to remove the nun.
   Ms. Kregar left the Rochester, Minn.-based order in August 1984
by a ``mutual decision,'' primarily because of her inability to
lead a celibate life, said Sister Mary Franchon Pirkl, executive
councillor of the Franciscan Order.
   Woolverton said he convinced the bishop of the relationship with
a secretly recorded conversation between his wife and the nun,
described as sexual in nature. He also employed a private
investigator to watch his wife.
   Woolverton now lives in Durango, Colo. His ex-wife lives
elsewhere in that city with their children, and Ms. Kregar is a
social worker in Pueblo, Colo.
   ``I'm glad it's over for everybody,'' Woolverton said. ``I'm
going back with my kids and help raise them.''
   He declined further comment.
   Church officials quickly left the Cameron County Courthouse
after the jury's decision, and could not be reached for comment
later. Ms. Kregar and her attorney, Virginia Raymond, declined to
comment.

   Chinese television viewers are snapping up
videocassette recorders far faster than factories can churn them
out, the official daily newspaper said today.
   The Economic Daily said the country will produce 44,000 of the
recorders this year, up from 10,000 produced last year. It said
3,299 VCRs were purchased in Beijing alone in February, a 27
percent increase from the previous month.
   But although 300,000 VCRs are in use nationwide, only one in
every 1,000 Chinese households have the machines, the paper said.
   In contrast, it said, 77 percent of Japanese households have the
recorders. The A.C. Nielsen Co. reported in October that 50.9
percent of the U.S. households have VCRs.

<HEAD>Mofford `Stands Behind' Gifts; Prosecutors Investigate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford has defended her
expenditure of thousands of dollars in state funds on gifts and
other items, including diet food, a $530 watch and a joke-writing
service.
   The Maricopa County Attorney's office said Friday it will
broaden an ongoing investigation into Mrs. Mofford's finances while
she served as secretary of state to include the new disclosures.
   Mrs. Mofford declined to answer questions about the disclosures
Friday. However, in a brief interview with radio station KFYI, Mrs.
Mofford defended the expenditures.
   ``I never misspent a penny,'' Mrs. Mofford told the station.
``It was appropriated for VIP gifts, and I used it for that type of
purpose. I never used anything for personal gain.''
   ``As has been the practice to date, the items to be purchased
were also available to the executive, legislative and judicial
branches of government,'' the governor's office said in a
seven-page statement released late Friday.
   Mrs. Mofford, 65, became governor April 4 when elected Gov. Evan
Mecham was convicted in a Senate impeachment trial of misusing
state funds and obstructing justice. Mecham was automatically
removed from office.
   Her chief of staff, George Cunningham, said he had not found any
record of who received the gifts but would request a legislative
staff audit to ensure public confidence.
   Records examined by The Associated Press showed Mrs. Mofford's
gift expenditures totaled at least $50,000 during her last five
years as secretary of state.
   The governor and her aides said the spending had legislative
authorization, but lawmakers and staff budget analysts said they
were unfamiliar with the authorization.
   The state constitution bars the state from giving anything of
value to an individual without public benefit, and state law makes
unauthorized expenditures of public funds a felony.
   House Speaker Joe Lane, who launched the impeachment probe of
Mecham, said he would wait to hear from Attorney General Bob Corbin
and Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins before deciding whether to
launch a similar investigation of Mrs. Mofford.
   Since Corbin is next in line to succeed Mrs. Mofford, he has
turned over to Collins an investigation of her financial disclosure
practices. That investigation stemmed from an AP report that while
secretary of state she had failed to include a number of her
business dealings in the state-required reports.
   Mrs. Mofford used state funds to pay for such things as
paintings, watches, Indian kachina dolls, clocks, flags and
knickknacks, typically charging them to ``other operating
expenses'' or ``supplies.''
   The Legislature's official records show $2,400 in unspecified
``other'' expenses for the secretary of state was approved in 1980
and $2,500 in 1981. More recently, the Legislature provided
lump-sum allocations for the operation of the secretary of state's
office with little direction as to how the funds were to be divided.
   Cunningham said Mrs. Mofford believed the Legislature had
granted her gift-giving authority and had actually expanded its
scope from her original request for ``visiting dignitaries'' to
encompass Arizonans as well.
   A 1978 protocol-fund statute allows the governor, House speaker
and Senate president to make gifts that promote state interests and
encourage public service. It does not include the secretary of
state, but Cunningham and other aides say the Legislature's
approval of the $2,400 was the equivalent of including her.
   Earlier this month, Mrs. Mofford said that when faced with the
need to present gifts to important visitors as secretary of state,
she ``took care of it myself.''
   The gifts resulted in a public benefit because they promoted
good will for the state, Cunningham said.
   He said the joke-service helped spice up Mrs. Mofford's speeches
and likened it to a reference book. He said the diet food appeared
to be bee pollen capsules manufactured in Arizona that Mrs. Mofford
was using to promote state agriculture.

   A business student may be living proof of
the adage that some people will do anything for a buck.
   The former John W. ``Jack'' Kriss, 23, was awarded $10,000 this
week by KOAQ-FM in Denver after he legally changed his name to
``The New Q103 FM'' and collected as many documents as possible
identifying him with the new name.
   ``I worked on it for three straight days,'' Kriss said. ``It was
a lot of fun and a lot of stress, but the best thing about it is
that I'm going to get out of school debt-free.''
   Kriss, a senior at the University of Northern Colorado, at first
was skeptical of the contest because he did not think he could win.
His roommate, Denton Cochell, persuaded him to try.
   The first stop for the Colorado Springs native was the Weld
County Courthouse, where Kriss had his name legally changed for
$30. It was the first of 53 documents he would secure.
   Along the way, he purchased a fishing license, won a lottery
check for $2, signed an apartment lease and obtained receipts for a
keg of beer and a will.
   Kriss estimates he spent about $50 and 60 hours on his entry. He
also sold his television set to raise $35 for the trip to Denver,
where about 50 other contestants were on hand with documents.
   Kriss _ who said he intends to change his name back in a few
days _ deposited the winnings in a bank account Friday, but not
before giving half to his roommate.

   The dress code at Tri-County North High
School allows miniskirts, but requires shorts to extend below the
kneecaps for both boys and girls.
   Unfair, say some of the school's males. So they've taken the
only reasonable step as hot weather approaches.
   They're wearing miniskirts, too.
   More than two dozen young men wore borrowed miniskirts to school
Friday to show their disdain for the code.
   ``We feel that it is unfair that girls can wear miniskirts, but
we are not allowed to wear shorts that come past our knees. If
they're going to have a school dress code, they should make it
equal,'' said the leader of the protest, senior Jason Gourlas,
whose hot pink miniskirt went past mid-thigh.
   Betty Hawkins, a junior, agreed.
   ``If the girls can wear short skirts and show off everything
they have, why can't the guys wear shorts?'' she asked.
   Principal Carl Walter said his hands are tied.
   ``The school cannot be run as a democracy. ... They're here to
get an education, and those guidelines were set by the board of
education, elected by the people. Since I'm hired by the board, I
follow the rule,'' he said.
   But Walter added he had no problem with male skirt-wearers as
long as they did not create disruptions. He acknowledged that the
skirts were shorter than the required length for shorts, but said
rules are rules.

   At least five people were killed and 50
injured when a freight train plowed into a passenger bus at a rail
crossing on a main highway, police and hospital officials said
today.
   The bus had apparently stalled on the crossing about 40 miles
southeast of Harare on Friday when the locomotive smashed into it.
   Four men and a woman were killed. All the injured were bus
passengers on their way to Harare for the weekend from villages in
southeastern Zimbabwe, officials said.
   Welders from a nearby factory helped police, firefighters and
other rescue workers free passengers trapped in the bus' mangled
wreckage.
   The locomotive, dented in the front, remained on the tracks.

   Two Conrail freight trains collided
head-on early today, killing a brakeman, authorities said. There
were no other injuries reported.
   The brakeman, who was not identified, apparently had gotten off
a local freight train, which moves freight for industries in
northern New Jersey, ``to perform work on the ground'' such as
throwing a switch or coupling hoses, when the accident happened,
said Steve Lubetkin, a Conrail spokesman in Philadephia.
   The local train was hit by another Conrail freight train from
Elkhart, Ind. bound for northern New Jersey, Lubetkin said. He was
unsure how fast the trains were traveling at the time of the 1 a.m.
accident.
   ``The accident itself does not appear to have been serious in
terms of damage to the equipment,'' he said.
   The train crews were being interviewed early today to determine
the cause of the accident and how the brakeman was killed. Lubetkin
said he did not know how many cars the trains were pulling.

   Drinking glasses were the first items
snapped up as author John Steinbeck's personal effects went on sale
at auction here.
   Most of the glasses sold separately to Steinbeck admirers happy
to have any item owned by the late author, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1940 for ``Grapes of Wrath'' and the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1962.
   The highest-priced item, at $6,000, was a painting of Gwyn
Steinbeck, second of the author's three wives and mother of his
sons. The lowest-priced, at $1, was a plastic measuring cup owned
by his son, John Steinbeck IV.
   Many of the buyers Friday were writers.
   ``He was a great American author, and so am I,'' said Jim
Hermanson of Denver, who bought a plain water glass for $16. He
described himself as ``an unemployed writer of short stories and
autobiographical pieces.''
   KCNC-TV editor Jim Syring of Denver found the sale a good
opportunity, ``especially in this area of the country, to get
something that was Steinbeck's without having to go to either coast
_ and just to have something that was his.'' He bought a wineglass
for $24.
   ``This will sit on my desk,'' he said, ``and I'll sit back
occasionally and have a glass of sherry in it ... and remind myself
that that was partly his downfall.''
   Evergreen building contractor Dean Snyder bought a hand-blown
blue martini glass with a twisty stem for $40.
   ``I've read Steinbeck all my life,'' he said. ``And my
father-in-law has read Steinbeck all his life. My father-in-law
also drinks martinis, so he's going to have a Steinbeck martini
glass.''
   Snyder also bought a slightly tattered photograph of Steinbeck,
signed by the author. ``I think it's a real bargain'' at $40,
Snyder said.
   The sale was to continue today.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Police Endangerment Charges Against East St. Louis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed charges that East
St. Louis is endangering its police officers, saying the court does
not have the authority to tell the poverty-stricken city how to run
its police department.
   The ruling Friday by St. Clair County Associate Judge Robert
LeChien was a setback for county State's Attorney John Baricevic,
who had charged the city with eight counts of reckless conduct for
not providing police with properly working cars.
   Baricevic had said it was the first time an Illinois city was
charged with criminal violations.
   LeChien rejected the charges.
   ``The authority over budgetary priority clearly lies with the
Aldermanic Council of the city of East St. Louis,'' LeChien wrote
in his order. ``For this court to engage in realignment of the
city's priorities would constitute judicial encroachment of
legislative power.''
   Baricevic was out of town Friday and could not be reached for
comment.
   East St. Louis Alderman Clarence Ellis said he wasn't surprised
by the ruling.
   ``Being a lawyer, I think he should have known he didn't have
any jurisdiction in this case,'' Ellis said. ``But he may have
helped us. He made us more conscious of the importance of having an
effective police force. He was concerned, and I want him to
continue to be concerned.''
   If convicted on all eight counts, the city could have faced
fines of up to $8,000.
   During a two-day trial last week, East St. Louis corporate
counsel Sam Ross contended no state law requires the city to supply
its police officers with working radios and cars.
   Twenty-six officers testified they were not assigned police
radios or cars, or received broken equipment.
   Witnesses also testified that city officials knew about the
deterioration of police radios and patrol cars, and that about
$10,000 in city funds was spent on such things as newspaper
advertisements, including a re-election ad for Mayor Carl E.
Officer.
   Neither Officer nor Ross could be reached for comment, the
Belleville News-Democrat reported today.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias today
pounded each other with howitzers and mortars in Beirut's southern
slums in a 16th day of fighting, ignoring Iranian efforts to halt
the bloodshed.
   Police said five people were killed and 41 wounded in the
fighting between the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and Syria's main Lebanese ally, the Amal militia.
   By police count, that raised the casualty toll to 258 killed and
855 wounded since the battle for control of the labyrinthine slums
erupted May 6.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages captured in Lebanon by Moslem
extremists _ half of them Americans _ are believed held in the
slums.
   In nearby Palestinian refugee camps, Yasser Arafat's Fatah PLO
faction dislodged Syrian-backed rivals of Fatah-Uprising after
night-long fighting, police said. The rival factions have clashed
several times in recent days for control of the camps.
   The Fatah-Uprising fighters, led by dissident Col. Saeed Mousa,
sought refuge today in Syrian-controlled territory on the edges of
the camps, said a police spokesman who by regulation cannot be
named.
   The Syrians have made no move to aid faction, which opposes
reconciliation moves between the Palestine Liberation Organization
led by Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad to end a 5-year-old
feud.
   The thud of exploding shells resounded across Beirut today as
Hezbollah and Amal, Arabic for hope, battled in the 16-square-mile
southern slums.
   Efforts to contain the fighting have shifted to Damascus, where
acting Foreign Minister Ali Mohammed Besharati of Iran met with
Assad and delivered a message on the crisis from President Ali
Khamenei of Iran.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency reported on the meeting
Friday night but did not disclose the contents of Khamenei's
message.
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, chief of Syria's military intelligence
in Lebanon, was also in the Syrian capital to consult with his
superiors, a source at the Syrian command in Beirut said.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kenaan was
expected to return to Beirut today or Sunday ``to pursue his
efforts with the warring factions.'' He did not elaborate.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide,
was quoted by Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily today as saying
discussions in Damascus ``may be decisive in determining the next
step'' in south Beirut.
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was
also in Damascus today, waiting to meet with Assad.
   Walters said Friday that the visit was ``not specifically for
the hostages.'' Still, he was expected to discuss Syrian efforts to
free the hostages, the longest-held being Terry Anderson,
Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent. He was seized
March 16, 1985.
   Amal claimed Friday that it had foiled a plan by Hezbollah to
trade an unidentified hostage for arms and ammunition from the
Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia.
   Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces denied there had been any such
deal.
   Syria has had 7,500 troops and 500 tanks massed on the southern,
western and northern edges of the embattled southern slums since
Sunday.
   But its officers say a decision to move in to quell the fighting
has been delayed to give political efforts a chance to arrange a
settlement.
   Besharati's efforts to arrange a cease-fire have apparently
failed, but it was not known when the Syrians might send in their
troops.
   France's Le Monde newspaper on Friday quoted Kenaan as saying:
``the entry of the Syrian army into south Beirut is inevitable.
   ``For the moment, we are simply allowing time for the
negotiators to reach a political agreement, which would be the best
solution for our entry.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's principal
ally in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war against Iraq, a long-time
Syrian rival.
   The Syrians have been alarmed by Iran's efforts through
Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the largest
single sect in this country ravaged by nearly 13 years of civil war.
   But diplomatic sources believe neither Damascus nor Tehran want
a major confrontation in Lebanon right now.
   The Iranians have suffered a string of military and economic
setbacks in the gulf and the Syrians, in trouble economically
themselves, need the free oil that Iran gives them.

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrests of three teen-gers foiled an
alleged plot to blow up Illinois River bridges using 2,400 stolen
blasting caps, police say.
   Lt. Jerry Sample, of the Peoria County Sheriff's Department,
said Friday he took the threat ``very seriously'' and kept the
information quiet until after the arrests were made to avoid panic.
   ``The kids who stole the dynamite caps were telling other kids
about it and they made comments about their plans to blow up
bridges,'' Sample said. ``I didn't take it as a joke at the time.
And they certainly didn't tell us it was a joke during
interrogation.''
   Late last week, police arrested the three 17-year-olds _ Kenneth
Johnson, Tyrone Gayton and Christopher Caho, all of Peoria _ in
connection with the May 9 theft of 2,400 blasting caps from a rural
Pottstown site.
   The caps are owned by a mining equipment and supply company.
Some are fused caps, which are extremely sensitive to shock, and
others are electric caps that can be detonated by radio
transmissions, police said.
   The teens were in Peoria County jail, charged with burglary and
theft, police said. Bond ranged from $5,000 to $10,000.
   In an interview from jail, Johnson said he was joking when he
told friends he might blow up a bridge. He said he planned to sell
the caps.
   Sample said it's unclear whether the caps would have been
powerful enough to blow up a bridge.
   ``The experts ... said that if you take 1,000 caps and put them
together, you can make a 10-foot crater in the ground,'' Sample
said. ``Whether they would hurt a steel bridge, we don't know.''
   All but about 60 of the stolen caps were recovered, Sample said.

   The man credited with inventing the sport of
wind surfing was rescued from the waters off Santa Catalina Island
when he tried to surf 20 miles from the mainland to the island,
authorities said.
   ``I was a little chagrined to be pulled out of the water,'' said
Jim Drake, 59. ``The great wind surfer himself!''
   ``That guy ought to get down on his knees and pray to God that
he was saved,'' Coast Guard Lt. Robert Randall said after the
rescue late Wednesday night. ``It was close.''
   Drake, who lives in the seaside city of Santa Monica, said he
set out at noon Wednesday from Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro to test
an experimental new craft called the ``Water Spyder.''
   The craft is an elongated sailboard with a small outrigger on
each side, designed for stability on long-distance excursions.
   An escort boat was following as Drake, who had twice before wind
surfed to the island and back to the mainland, left with another
surfer.
   About halfway to the island's Isthmus Cove, Drake said he became
confident in the performance of the new equipment and traded the
board for the conventional rig his companion, Kaz Yamada, was using.
   The escort boat then set off after Yamada, expecting to meet
Drake on shore later, but he failed to arrive.
   He was spotted four miles from the island at about 8:30 p.m. by
a county lifeguard patrol boat working with a Coast Guard
helicopter.
   Drake, an engineer, and his former partner, Hoyle Schweitzer,
obtained the first patent for a sailboard in 1970.

   Heavy rains drenched portions of Texas today after closing roads
and raising river waters 8 feet, while a flood watch remained in
effect over several Eastern states.
   Meanwhile, northern California residents basked in a heat wave
after the mercury soared Friday, breaking records in a hot spell
that sent people flocking to beaches and parks.
   In Texas, thunderstorms brought more than 3 inches of rain to
Kerrville and over 2 inches to portions of Austin. Some roads were
closed in northern Val Verde and other southwestern counties. At
Stonewall, west of Austin, the Pedernales River reportedly rose 8
feet late Friday night.
   Flood watches were in effect for portions of southeastern New
York, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, northern Delaware,
Maryland, northern Virginia and northeastern West Virginia.
   Strong winds from a possible tornado late Friday did
considerable damage to roofs and cars at New Braunfels, Texas,
between Austin and San Antonio.
   The weather was quiet over the Southeast, with clear skies from
Florida to the Tennessee Valley. Clear skies also covered the
nation west of the Rockies.
   Northern California sizzled Friday. The mercury reached 97
degrees in San Jose, highest in the area and surpassing the record
of 94 degrees set in 1942. Downtown San Francisco registered 92,
four degrees higher than the mark reached the same year.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from New England across the mid-Atlantic states to eastern Ohio and
eastern North Carolina; widely scattered showers and thunderstorms
in central and southern Florida and the lower Mississippi Valley;
and showers and thunderstorms from the upper Mississippi Valley
across the central and southern Plains to eastern Colorado and New
Mexico.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s in New
England, from western Minnesota across South Dakota, and western
portions of the central and southern Plains to the central Rockies;
90 degrees in the south Atlantic and Gulf Coast states; in the 90s
over western Oregon and California; 90s to near 105 degrees in the
desert Southwest; and in the 70s or 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Laramie, Wyo., to 83 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Former President Carlos Andres Perez
says the United States would look silly if it were to drop drug
charges against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in exchange for his
stepping down as Panama's leader.
   ``It would be a scandal,'' Perez said in an interview. ``It
would make the U.S. look ridiculous.''
   Earlier this year, Perez claimed he had negotiated a deal by
which Noriega would leave power, but that deposed President Eric
Delvalle of Panama upset the agreement by trying to fire Noriega on
Feb. 26.
   Perez said the apparent U.S. effort to negotiate Noriega's exit
after economic pressures to remove him failed, ``leaves us amazed.''
   But he agreed that Noriega, leader of Panama's 15,000-strong
Defense Forces, would have to give up power if democracy is to
prevail in Panama.
   ``To create continuity in Panama's democracy, it is convenient
to lower the influence of the military,'' Perez said. ``That
includes Noriega.''
   The former president, currently the frontrunner for Venezuela's
presidential election in December, says he feels he ``could still
help'' in mediating a solution to Panama's political crisis.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of protesters disrupted rail
traffic, smashed vehicles and hurled rocks at club-swinging police
during 18 hours of bloody riots on the streets of Taipei, police
and witnesses said today.
   An estimated 200 people were injured during the anti-government
demonstrations that were quelled early today. Police said 130
protesters were arrested.
   Local media described the roving riots as among the worst public
disturbances in Taiwan since the Nationalist Chinese government
fled the Communist mainland for this island in 1949.
   The fighting began Friday during a demonstration demanding that
the government provide farmers with insurance and quadruple its
rice purchases.
   About 3,000 rock-throwing protesters clashed with police at the
Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's highest legislative body, before moving
to the headquarters of the governing Nationalist Party.
   At a police station, rioters smashed five police vans and set
fire a car and a motorcycle, police said.
   Riot police used batons and water cannons to disperse most of
the protesters from the front of the police station. Demonstration
leader Lin Kuo-hwa and 11 other activists were arrested, witnesses
said.
   Police chased about 200 remaining protesters throughout the
city, fighting pitched battles in front of government buildings and
businesses.
   The rioters tore out rails at a railroad crossing, disrupting
train traffic for three hours and smashed phone booths before they
were dispersed, police said.
   Police beat demonstrators with clubs and stomped on some who
fell to the ground, the liberal Independence Evening Post reported
today.
   Two policemen, two photographers and four protesters were
hospitalized with head injuries, police reported.
   Another 60 officers were treated at hospitals and released, said
police, who put the total casualties at approximately 200 people.
   Taipei Police Deputy Chief Wang Hwa-cheng said among those
arrested were people who ``posed as farmers and incited the crowd
in an attempt to disrupt the 40 years of development on this
island.''
   Wang did not elaborate, but authorities said opposition
Democratic Progressive Party members and students were among the
demonstrators.
   Presiding Judge Liu Ching-yi of the Taipei District Court said
most of the detained protesters were ``non-farmers,'' claiming some
may have been incited by ``communist elements'' who infiltrated
from the rival Chinese government in Beijing. He also did not
elaborate.
   Demonstrating farmers had accused the government of ignoring
their concerns while focusing on industrial development.
   They demanded that President Lee Teng-hui, an agricultural
economics expert who succeeded the late Chiang Ching-kuo in
January, help improve the livelihood of farmers who have been hurt
by low prices for farm goods.
   Lee urged agricultural officials Friday to help solve farmers'
problems.

   Most Soviet citizens surveyed in a public opinion
poll believe relations with the United States are satisfactory but
unstable, Pravda reported today.
   The Communist Party daily said 67 percent of those surveyed
described relations as satisfactory, 8 percent said they were good
and 6 percent characterized relations as bad.
   Pravda said in an article headlined ``The Barometer of Hopes''
that it wanted to report Soviets' views of U.S.-Soviet relations
because it had published a similar poll of Americans on May 12.
   President Reagan arrives in Moscow on May 29 for his fourth
summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Pravda said two-thirds of those questioned characterized changes
in Soviet-American relations after the three previous summits as
``significant but unstable.''
   Pravda said the poll was conducted by a group in the Institute
for Sociological Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences along
with the Center for Study of Public Opinion of the Communist Party
in the Georgian republic.
   Pravda said 1,200 people were interviewed in 12 regions of the
Russian republic and several regions of Georgia. It did not say
when or how the poll was conducted or give a margin of error.
   The poll of Americans published by Pravda on May 12 said 61
percent of those surveyed believed relations between the two
countries are improving.

   Security forces crossed into Mozambique
and killed 73 guerrillas who killed peasants and stole cattle in a
raid on a Zambian border village, a government official was quoted
as saying today.
   Lusaka newspapers quoted a government spokesman as saying the
guerrillas were members of the Mozambique National Resistance,
which is fighting to topple Mozambique's leftist government.
   The rebels were blamed for crossing into Zambia on Wednesday and
raiding the village of Tafelela Nsoni in Chadiza District, killing
eight peasants.
   The guerrillas fled back to Mozambique with 28 stolen steers,
the spokesman was quoted as saying.
   Zambian security forces followed the guerrillas more than 12
miles into Mozambique, attacked two rebel camps, killed 73
guerrillas and recovered 22 steers, the spokesman was quoted as
saying.
   Mozambican rebels often cross borders to rob villages in Malawi,
Zambia and Zimbabwe. As a result, Malawi and Zimbabwe have about
12,000 troops stationed in Mozambique, mainly to protect supply
lines vital to their landlocked economies.
   Last month, President Kenneth Kaunda said Zambian forces killed
several rebels inside his country after they attacked border
villages and stole 150 steers.

<HEAD>James Brown's Wife Arrested On Drug Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of soul singer James Brown was
arrested on drug charges one day after her husband was released
from jail on similar charges.
   Adrienne Brown, 38, of Beech Island, S.C., was arrested Friday
upon her arrival at Bush Field airport in Augusta by police acting
on a tip, said Ron Maher of the Augusta police vice and narcotics
unit.
   On Thursday, Brown was released from jail in nearby Aiken
County, S.C., after posting $24,218 bond. He was arrested Wednesday
on charges including possession of drugs; he claimed his wife had
planted the drugs on him.
   Narcotics investigators with a search warrant confiscated a wet,
leafy substance they suspected was the drug PCP, also called
``angel dust,'' from Mrs. Brown as she walked through the airport
parking lot.
   Police said they later found two vials of a substance believed
to be PCP hidden in Mrs. Brown's blouse. She was charged with
possession of the drug.
   Mrs. Brown was released late Friday after posting $10,000 bond.
   Mrs. Brown was arrested April 9 on drug charges in Augusta. She
claimed a friend of her husband had set her up. She also faces a
charge of possession of PCP in Bedford, N.H.
   Brown's arrest Wednesday was his third in six months. Last
November, he was charged with resisting arrest and leaving the
scene of an accident.In April, he was charged with assault with
intent to kill his wife and with assault and battery of a high and
aggravated nature.
   ``It's getting to the point where we're spending a lot of time
investigating Mr. Brown's domestic problems,'' said Capt. James
Whitehurst of the Aiken County Sheriff's Department.
   Brown was charged Wednesday with with possession of PCP,
resisting arrest, illegal possession of a pistol, failure to stop
for a police car and simple assault and battery.
   Brown said he was working ``to keep the city and the world
clean'' from drugs. ``I don't have a drug problem,'' he said.
   Brown said he had not resisted arrest, only tried to ``keep from
being thrown to the ground.''
   He said he was carrying a pistol because he had a large amount
of money and ``important papers.''
   Brown is scheduled to appear June 6 in Aiken County General
Sessions Court. Mrs. Brown has filed for divorce, and Brown said he
plans to do the same.
   Brown, known to his fans as ``The Godfather of Soul,'' may have
to cancel his upcoming European tour because of his most recent
arrest.
   The bond Brown posted Thursday bars him from leaving the state,
Aiken County Magistrate Max Meeks said. Meeks said Brown, who has a
ranch at Beech Island, would need Meek's approval or that of a
circuit judge before leaving.
   Brown was allowed to tour in Brazil while out on bond in April.

   Militant Sikh separatists massacred nine
sleeping Hindu laborers in Punjab state today as the guerrillas
kept up their bloody campaign to avenge a police siege on their
sacred Golden Temple.
   The attack raised to 200 the number of deaths blamed on Sikh
extremists since May 9, when government forces besieged the temple,
Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   On Friday, police fanned out across the northern state and
raided Sikh hideouts in an effort to blunt the wave of violence
prompted by the 10-day siege on the Amritsar temple that ended
Wednesday.
   Today, the committee of Sikh elders that oversees the temple
agreed to cooperate with government efforts to prevent militants
from again turning the temple into an armed stronghold. On Friday,
it had refused to cooperate.
   Committee member Shiv Singh Khushipuri said the group decided
today to restrict visitors from bringing weapons into the temple
complex and prevent people from living in the offices that surround
the temple.
   Sikh extremists in the past have used the offices to hide from
police.
   But Khushipuri repeated the committee's demand that police free
four militant Sikh priests arrested May 12 when they defied a
curfew and tried to march on the shrine.
   He said that only the priests could resume religious rites at
the temple, which have been suspended for nearly two weeks.
   At least 42 people, mostly Sikh guerrillas, were killed during
the siege on the 400-year-old temple. Four Sikhs committed suicide
rather than surrender.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
more political autonomy or an independent homeland in Punjab for
their minority sect. They claim Sikhs are discriminated against by
India's majority Hindus.
   Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of India's 800 million people
but are a majority in Punjab. Their religion was founded about 500
years ago as an alternative to Hinduism and Islam.
   Killings of civilians by Sikh separatists escalated sharply in
1987 and 1988 despite efforts by police and paramilitary troops to
blunt the crusade.
   Early today, about six Sikhs armed with automatic rifles opened
fire on sleeping workers in the village of Gujarpura, about 18
miles northwest of Amritsar, said Chaman Lal, inspector general of
the Border Security Force.
   Nine workers were killed and three wounded, he said.
   It was the third such raid on a Hindu migrant workers' camp
since Tuesday, when 30 workers were slain as they slept at a camp
near the state capital of Chandigarh.
   On Thursday night, Sikh extremists ordered Hindu migrants at a
camp in Amritsar District to line up against a wall and shot five
of them to death.
   The attacks have prompted an exodus of hundreds of the Hindu
laborers who traditionally migrate from the northern states of
Bihar and Orissa to work on farms in Punjab, India's richest
agricultural state.
   Indian newspapers have speculated that the Sikh extremists are
trying to destroy the state's economy by driving away farm labor.
   The latest killings raised to at least 1,136 the number of
people slain by Sikh extremists in Punjab this year. Last year,
1,030 people were killed.
   Punjab has been placed under a police alert. On Friday, 9,000
police and paramilitary troops were sent out across the state to
protect citizens and raid the hideouts of Sikh extremists in three
border districts.
   The order came after at least 38 people were killed during raids
late Thursday and early Friday.
   Attacks Friday included numerous bombings in the town of
Pathankot in the northernmost part of Punjab. Several bombs went
off in buses, and five people were killed. The town was put under
curfew after the bombings.

   The victims were discovered Friday afternoon in the basement of

   One of the three, Edward Steele, 46, of New York was taken to
St. Vincent's Hospital, then transferred to Bellevue Hospital

   One of the two found dead at the scene was identified as Peter

   Police said they had no motive for the killings.
   Two shell casings were found at the scene.

<TEXT>
   The government has empowered its film
censors to make surprise inspections of private homes to search for
undesirable videocassetes, a Nairobi newspaper reported today.
   The Daily Nation quoted Japhet Kiti, permanent secretary in the
Ministry of National Guidance and Political Affairs, as saying the
Film Censorship Board's authority has been extended to Kenya's
booming videocassette industry.
   ``The public is warned that they will be equally guilty if they
rent videos that have not been cleared and would be liable to face
the rigors of the legal process if found in possession of the
uncleared cassettes,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The ministry said it intended to halt the importation of
``morally decadent, violent and possibly subversive videos.''
   Kiti set a May 31 deadline for all video rental libraries in
Kenya to submit a list of their cassettes. ``Any cassettes found to
be unsuitable will be removed from circulation,'' he was quoted as
saying.
   Videocassettes added after the deadline will have to be viewed
by the censor before they can be rented.
   President Daniel arap Moi established the Ministry of National
Guidance and Political Affairs in March and one of its jobs is
censorship.
   While moviehouse films have been screened by the government's
Film Censorship Board before public showings, videos have not been
scrutinized until now.

<HEAD>Thai Temple Opens With Chicago Artifact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand reopened an ancient temple
today even though it was missing a stone sculpture that officials
have tried in vain to have returned from the Art Institute of
Chicago.
   Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, a daughter of the
constitutional monarch, opened the Khao Phanomrung Temple in the
northeast province of Buriram after restoration work was completed.
   The lintel, or crosspiece over a door or window, disappeared
from the temple in the 1960s and some Thais have charged it was
stolen with the help of the U.S. officials.
   Thai officials pressed to have it returned in time for today's
ceremony.
   The art institute said in February that the sculpture, called
``The Birth Of Brahma With Reclining Vishnu On A Makara,'' has been
on display for 21 years and originally was obtained by a New York
antique dealer.
   It said in a statement that the institute may return the piece,
but that Thailand never proved that it had been stolen.
   Negotiations with the Chicago institute are continuing.

   Salvage workers recovered the wreckage of
a downed U.S. helicopter gunship from the Persian Gulf today and
put it aboard a salvage tugboat, where investigators will examine
it for crash clues.
   The Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra, which vanished April 18 after
day-long clashes between U.S. and Iranian naval forces, was in
three large pieces when lifted out of 130 feet of water off the
coast of the United Arab Emirates.
   Investigators are interested in finding out whether the
helicopter was shot down, as Iran has claimed. Its two pilots have
been officially declared killed in action, and their bodies,
recovered earlier, were flown back to the United States.
   U.S. officials said the Cobra's crew reported in their last
radio message that they were being tracked by a hostile radar.
   One official said it was possible that the aircraft was either
hit or crashed trying to evade fire.
   The U.S. Navy, after origionally planning to blow up the sunken
wreck, decided to raise it ``to better enable investigators to
determine the cause of the crash,'' a military official said.
   A seagoing crane put the wreckage aboard a Navy-chartered
salvage tug and divers covered it with a tarpaulin. The tug headed
for shore, but its destination was not immediately known.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English, who observed the
wreckage from a news helicopter, said there was no evident missile
or gunfire damage.
   He said the helicopter was in three main pieces _ the nose and
cockpit section, the main fuselage with engine and rotor assembly,
and the tail boom.

   Police hunted today for radical
leaders suspected of key roles in a bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy
in Seoul. Anti-government protests continued.
   Police officials said a search was under way for radicals
believed to be behind the attack Friday on the embassy, where
students scaled the walls and hurled homemade bombs.
   Radical students resumed demonstrations today against the
government of President Roh Tae-woo and the United States after
four days of fierce clashes between protesters and riot police.
Most of the demonstrations were peaceful.
   Police remained on nationwide alert and riot police squads
guarded key locations in Seoul and other cities.
   Students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of Roh have
battled riot police with firebombs and rocks in the streets of
Seoul and other cities. The violence is the worst political unrest
since major riots last summer.
   Investigators said the embassy attack apparently was organized
by radicals responsible for other attacks on U.S. diplomatic
offices and offices of the governing Democratic Justice Party.
   Seven students arrested in the embassy attack were being
questioned by police, they said.
   The police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
at least 20 other students were suspected of plotting the attack
and they believed a student leader named Kim Chul was involved.
   Kim is wanted for a Feb. 24 attack on the U.S. Information
Service building in Seoul by radicals who exploded bombs and
briefly seized the building.
   Protesters broke windows and hurled several firebombs at the
same building during clashes on Thursday.
   In the embassy attack, students wielding iron bars and hurling
homemade bombs scaled the walls and clashed with police in the
compound. One police officer and two students were hurt.
   The bombs did not cause any damage to the embassy building, but
the policeman sustained blast wounds.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment has been running high in the recent wave of
anti-government protests. Radicals claim the Roh government is kept
in power by the United States.
   Protesters have burned American flags, attacked U.S. diplomatic
buildings and demanded the removal of about 42,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, police remained on full alert
today following four days of violent anti-government and anti-U.S.
protests marking the anniversary of a 1980 civilian uprising. At
least 191 people died in the uprising.
   Tens of thousands of citizens and students have been staging
rallies in Kwangju, shouting anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans.

   A bomb exploded in a field near
the Irish border today, killing a British soldier and a search dog
checking for explosives in the area, police said.
   The outlawed Irish Repubican Army claimed responsibility for the
killing.
   The soldier, a dog handler, was leading a search patrol in the
county of South Armagh, where a 1,400-pound IRA bomb was discovered
on Thursday.
   Police said it appeared the soldier or his dog stepped on a bomb
hidden in a field about 10 yards from the road.
   The soldier was not immediately identified.
   Five people in two passing cars sustained minor injuries from
the explosion, but police said it was not immediately clear how
they were hurt.
   Security forces are the main targets of the IRA in its guerrilla
campaign to oust the British from Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the mostly Roman Catholic Irish
Republic to the south.

<HEAD>Paper Says Two Hijackers Killed in Beirut Fighting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the Shiite Moslem militants who hijacked a
Kuwaiti jumbo jet last month were killed in fighting between Shiite
militias in the slums of south Beirut, a newspaper reported today.
   The Al-Qabas daily, quoting a report by an unidentified European
foreign ministry, identified the men as Qassem Zaineddin and Nihad
Khashman, or his brother Fuad.
   It said they were killed with 10 other Shiites in fighting near
the Bourj el-Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in south Beirut
Monday night.
   Khashman's mother was also killed in the Beirut fighting, the
paper said.
   Al-Qabas said the Khashman brothers and Zaineddin were among the
nine hijackers who seized a Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 on April 5.
   They killed two Kuwaiti passengers before surrendering to
authorities in Algiers, the jumbo jet's third stop in the 17-day
drama, in return for what diplomats said was safe conduct to an
undisclosed country.
   There have been reports that the hijackers, believed to be
linked to Lebanon's Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, or Party of
God, had gone to Lebanon. But their whereabouts have not been
officially confirmed.
   The paper did not say on which side the alleged hijackers had
been fighting in Beirut.
   But the Kuwaiti jumbo hijackers' demand that Kuwait free 17
comrades jailed for a string of 1983 bombings was identical to that
of Hezbollah-linked Shiites in Lebanon for the release of American
hostages.
   Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian Amal militia have been fighting in
south Beirut for control of the area since May 6. Lebanese police
have reported more than 250 people killed in the fierce street
battles.
   Shiite factions have been responsible for kidnapping most of the
79 foreigners grabbed in Lebanon since 1984. Eighteen, including
nine Americans, are still captives, most of them believed to be
held in south Beirut.
   Al-Qabas said some of the hostages were being held in the Shiyah
district of south Beirut, while others have been moved to the
Iranian embassy in Beirut or to the southern port of Sidon.
   Iranian embassy officials have denied earlier reports that
hostages were imprisoned in the building's basement.
   The daily said that Amal shelling has forced the kidnappers to
keep moving some captives between the home of Sheik Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide, and a Hezbollah
meeting house, both in south Beirut.
   There was no independent confirmation of the al-Qabas report.

   Former aides and staff members have said Rep.
Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., expected them to run personal errands and
to campaign for the congressman, sometimes at taxpayer expense,
said published reports today.
   The Washington Post and The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch said
in today's editions that former staff members complained about
personal services they performed for Sikorski and his family like
washing dishes, shoveling snow and transporting his daughter to and
from school.
   Staffers told the Post some of these tasks were done during
times they were being paid their government salaries.
   Sikorski, contacted early today by The Associated Press, said,
``No personal requests were made, authorized or approved'' for any
of his former or current staff members.
   He said some aides were personal friends who had ``volunteered''
on occasion to take care of personal tasks.
   Sikorski characterized the reported allegations as
``inaccurate'' and ``a first-class hatchet job.''
   The three-term congressman said the charges had been initiated
by a disgruntled employee who had been terminated from his
congressional staff.
   Dennis M. McGrann, Sikorkski's administrative assistant, said,
``I do know that the Post was informed that the allegations,
innuendos and many outright lies contained in the story came from
an individual who was terminated from the staff who vowed revenge.''
   McGrann identified the former staffer as Rick Shapiro, who he
said worked in Sikorski's Washington office for 7 months before he
was terminated for non-performance.
   Shapiro could not be reached for comment.
   An unidentified former staffer told the Star Tribune that
Sikorski's office has had high turnover since the congressman first
took office in 1983. ``I only know of one or two people who left on
good terms,'' the former staffer told the Minneapolis paper.
   He said Sikorski has a reputation as being a perfectionist and
difficult to work for, adding he sometimes criticizes staff members
in front of others.
   Sikorski admitted, ``I have lost my temper,'' and said he
expects much from his employees.
   ``We work hard,'' he said. ``We accomplish a lot. We work long
hours. That's the way I was raised. ... (But) the relationship is
much more positive and friendly than many people are led to
believe.''
   The Post reported that several staff members and others familiar
with Sikorski's office, most of whom it did not identify, said he
had a member of his staff shovel snow off the sidewalk near his
Capitol Hill home last year.
   Ione Yates, who worked as an executive assistant in the
Minnesota Democrat's office in 1983 and 1984, told the Post, ``Once
I remember staff was sent over to the house to do the dishes.''
   ``I just got tired of feeling like a piece of property,'' Yates
added.
   Sikorski also sent some employees from his legislative office in
Washington to Minnesota to help his 1986 re-election campaign while
they were paid their regular government salaries, the Post said,
citing House records and former staffers.
   ``Legislative staff people do not give up their right to
participate in politics ... as long as they put in their hours in
their official duties,'' said Sikorski. He said if his staff
members did any politicking they ``did it on their own time.''
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch also reported that several
former staff members complained about being asked to complete
personal tasks for Sikorski, such as escorting his daughter home
from school, taking her lunch and tending his wife's dogs.
   ``On one rare occasion, my daughter was injured at school and a
staff person, without asking and without being asked, brought her
back to the office,'' Sikorski told The Associated Press.
   He said one staff member, who was a family friend before joining
the office, asked to help care for the dogs and has been
compensated by Susan Sikorski.

<HEAD>Leading Reformer Says Hungarians Must Have Greater Voice In
Government</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Pozsgay calling for reform.

<TEXT>
   A leading Communist Party reformer
today urged a greater voice for Hungarians in national affairs in a
party conference that has become a showdown between reformers and
longtime party leader Janos Kadar.
   ``Where we have democracy, we can really have renewal,'' Central
Committee member Imre Pozsgay told delegates during the second day
of debate at the first national party conference in 31 years.
   Pozsgay's remarks came a day after Kadar delivered a spirited
defense of single-party rule and blistering criticism for political
change that he said would undermine party control.
   Kadar's assault on reformers within the party clearly was aimed
at Pozsgay and other advocates of political change, who have
expressed support for independent political and trade union groups
that are demanding more of a voice in Hungary's affairs.
   Diplomats have speculated that Kadar would be asked to step down
when the conference concludes Sunday.
   ``The consensus is hardening that Kadar will go,'' said a
Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But he said that Kadar, who turns 76 next week, is a ``wily and
experienced politician'' who still could have firm support among
party conservatives.
   Earlier today, Premier Karoly Grosz, a leading contender to
succeed Kadar, urged party unity but said it must ``rid itself of
ideological prejudices.''
   While Pozsgay did not refer to the proliferation of independent
political groups directly, much of the speech focused on the need
to allow more grass-roots participation in party decisions.
   ``People don't just want to implement party resolutions, they
want to participate in the preparations and policy making,'' said
Pozsgay.
   ``We need greater freedoms to build a democratic socialism ...
we must do away with barriers or barriers will destroy us.''
   Pozsgay has said in earlier speeches that he supports
constitutional changes to guarantee the independence of interest
groups outside the party.
   Kadar's address indicated he has no intention of yielding to
such demands, and was considered an attack on the recent formation
of Hungary's first independent trade union and efforts by students
to set up an unofficial democratic youth group.
   Grosz, 57, seemed to defend the one-party rule, saying those who
demand more parties in Hungary ``do not reckon with the fact that
this is not a matter of decision, but conditional on the real
social possibilities.''
   ``If the party is paralyzed, then the country will be paralyzed
and everyone will be the losers,'' Grosz said.
   But Grosz said the party should break with ``the practice of
secretiveness, self-isolation and inflexible working style.''
   Kadar and Grosz both acknowledged the country's economic
problems, which include 18.5 percent inflation in the first quarter
of this year and an $18 billion foreign debt.
   Kadar, who took power in 1956 after the Kremlin crushed a
popular uprising, increasingly has been blamed for the nations's
economic problems and for resisting political changes.
   Austerity measures imposed earlier this year have angered many
Hungarians, and reformers say economic innovations cannot be
achieved without sweeping political changes.
   The conference meanwhile elected a 34-member nominating
committee to select candidates for the new Central Committee, which
now has 106 members.
   The Central Committee in turn nominates candidates for the
Politburo, where changes are also expected.
   Politburo member Janos Berecz said personnel changes will be
announced in a live radio and television broadcast Sunday.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Shultz interview, scattered
demonstrations today and curfew.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept an international peace conference
and give up occupied territory for Middle East peace.
   ``The agenda, as we see it, has to be territory for peace,''
Shultz said in an interview broadcast today by Israel radio. ``If
you say no ... then there is no Arab partner that wants to come and
negotiate, because they say, what is there to negotiate.''
   Shultz was interviewed Friday in Washington.
   The army imposed a curfew on parts of Gaza City this morning
after Palestinians demonstrated, a military spokesman said. He did
not elaborate.
   An Arab reporter said there was a full general strike throughout
the Gaza Strip and scattered stonethrowing clashes between soldiers
and protesters. He said at least three Palestinians were beaten by
Israeli troops.
   Both the military spokesman and reporter spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Since anti-occupation unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers have killed 191
Palestinians. Two Israelis also have been killed.
   Shultz stopped short of directly criticizing Shamir, but he said
the United States and the Israeli leader disagree on the need to
give up territory captured during the 1967 Middle East war in
exchange for peace.
   Disputes remain on the international peace conference and the
timetable of negotiations.
   ``Everybody has views that they hold and ... which we discuss,''
said Shultz. ``Some of the things that the prime minister feels
about the proposals we've put on the table of course we don't agree
with.''
   Shultz urged the Israeli government to accept his peace
proposal, which includes a call for an international peace
conference and negotiations on Palestinian demands for self-rule.
   ``The status quo is not stable, is not satisfactory,'' Shultz
said.
   Shultz has visited the Middle East twice since drawing up his
peace proposal and is due back again in June.
   Israel's coalition government is split on the proposals.
Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc opposes the plan, while the leftist
Labor Party, led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, supports it.
   Shultz has failed to budge Shamir. So far, Egypt is the only
country to officially endorse the plan. But Shultz said he would
keep trying.
   ``It's not my initiative or the U.S. initiative that's in
trouble,'' Shultz said. ``It's the region that's in trouble. And
that's why I keep coming back.''
   Peres returned Friday from Washington, where he met with Shultz
and President Reagan.
   In an airport interview, he said the Soviet Union has agreed to
join an international peace conference on the Middle East but
continues to insist on Palestinian self-determination.
   Peres said Soviet officials told him they now agreed the
international conference would not have the power to impose its
views on Israel and its Arab negotiating partners.
   Both Shamir and Peres reject establishment of an independent
Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Peres met with Soviet officials in Madrid and Washington,
including Moscow's U.S. ambassador, Yuri Dubinin.

   A spokesman for the federal Sea Safety and Surveillance Center

prevented a helicopter from airlifting the crew from the stranded
vessel.
   The 30,000-ton Korean Star ran aground early Saturday at Cape

   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the

both sides.
   The Korean Star was en route from Hong Kong to Australia to
collect a consignment of salt.

   Two bombs exploded in the Athens suburb of

port of Piraeus. There were no injuries, police said.
   All three attacks were claimed by a local left-wing terrorist
group, Revolutionary Popular Struggle.
   The first blast occurred at 12:45 a.m. on the ground floor of a
building housing the Nikaia police precinct, said a police
spokesman who declined to be identified in accordance with Greek
practice.
   At 4 a.m., another bomb exploded in an unoccupied building a few
streets away, the spokesman said.
   Just before 5 a.m., an explosive device was hurled from a
speeding car and hit the Evelyn Bar in Piraeus, which had closed
for the night, the spokesman said.
   An anonymous caller to the left-wing Athens daily Eleftherotypia
claimed the attacks on behalf of Revolutionary Popular Struggle.
   The group has taken responsibility for several hundred bomb
blasts around Greece over the past decade. Last month, the group
claimed two attacks against tax offices in the northern city of
Salonica.

<TEXT>
   A series of political smoke signals from
Dublin and Belfast has aroused hopes for a fresh and radically
different initiative on Northern Ireland.
   If successful, it could lead to contacts between Irish Prime
Minister Charles Haughey and James Molyneaux, the leader of
Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party.
   A year ago, the notion of talks between Haughey, the proud Irish
nationalist, and Molyneaux, the equally fervent British loyalist,
would have seemed inconceivable.
   The mere fact that they sound willing to talk demonstrates how
much the political atmosphere in both the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland has changed.
   The new departure is rooted in the November 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement, which gave Dublin a say in the running of Northern
Ireland and a guardianship role over the province's 40-percent
Roman Catholic minority.
   Protestants, viewing Ireland as a hostile, Catholic-dominated
state, bitterly objected to the agreement, fearing the strategy was
to bring them under Dublin's rule.
   But 2{ years later, they are conceding failure to topple the
agreement and are beginning to accept that Dublin, having gained a
foothold through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, cannot be excluded from
any future deal.
   ``I don't think unionists (Protestants) should get themselves
hung up on this shibboleth that they have created for themselves in
the past about the relationship with Dublin,'' Raymond Ferguson,
the Protestant mayor of the Northern Ireland town of Enniskillen,
said in a television interview.
   People like Ferguson talk of an Irish Republic-Northern Ireland
confederation, in which Catholics and Protestants would share power
in Ulster. They prefer not to go into detailed proposals at this
stage, dwelling instead on the need for Protestants to rethink
their attitudes toward the Irish Republic.
   Ireland's and Britain's membership in the 12-nation European
Economic Community will take on major significance in 1992, when
the abolition of most frontier controls will inevitably knit this
island closer together, socially and economically.
   The quest for a united Ireland is being supplanted by a
consensus that unity is impossible without Protestant consent and
that this consent does not yet exist.
   ``There is an atmosphere of dialogue,'' John Hume, leader of
Northern Ireland's largest Catholic faction, the Social Democratic
and Labor Party, told American correspondents recently.
   Archbishop Robin Eames, head of the (Protestant) Church of
Ireland, told a synod Tuesday: ``One can sense a new recognition of
political reality in the air. Is it just possible that we are
seeing the first signs of a new and more hopeful chapter in our
troubled history?''
   Molyneaux, 67, gave the cue this spring when he spoke of the
need for London, Dublin and Northern Ireland to start discussing
Ireland's future.
   Haughey responded by saying: ``Direct dialogue of this kind
would be of great significance and would open the way for political
progress, even if only on a limited scale initially.''
   On May 8, on London Weekend Television, Molyneaux suggested an
``exchange of ideas on paper,'' followed by talks between civil
servants. Would he meet Haughey? ``I don't rule out that at some
stage ... it may be desirable,'' Molyneaux replied.
   The old animosities that used to permeate the language of
cross-border debate were nowhere in sight.
   Haughey, 62, was at pains to sound conciliatory toward the
Protestants, while Molyneaux praised Haughey as an effective
politician and castigated those who still harbored ``a blind,
unreasoning hatred'' of him.
   The overtures have tended to be overshadowed by this year's
upsurge in violence in Northern Ireland, and at this stage, few
will speculate where talks might lead. Haughey and Molyneaux have
been cautious not to raise any premature hopes.
   The Irish Republican Army, fighting to drive Britain out of
Northern Ireland, continues to see violent resistance as the only
answer, and hard-line Protestants may seek to torpedo any
compromise with Dublin.
   Molyneaux and Haughey ``face a perilous course in undertaking
any dialogue,'' commented the Irish Times of Dublin. ``But the
process has to start, and soon. The alternative is an indefinite
future of violence.''

   Airport employees had to moonlight as
wranglers when about 50 cows wandered onto a runway and temporarily
disrupted operations.
   Police Sgt. Frank Rute said the cattle strayed onto Santa Fe
Municipal Airport on Friday from grazing land to the west that the
U.S. Bureau of Land Management leases to ranchers.
   Airport workers, sheriff deputies and city and county animal
control officers herded the cattle to an area near the city's
sewage treatment plant. Rute said airport security officers stood
guard until the owners were contacted.
   Airport operations were temporarily disrupted while the animals
were corralled.
   Airport manager Neil Beard said there have been isolated
incidents of cattle wandering onto airport property, but this was
the largest.
   Rute said two cattle owners each would be issued a single
citation for having an animal running at large.
   ``I don't think they'll be issued a citation for every animal,''
he said.

<HEAD>Historic Turkish Wreck Located Off Greek Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath
the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden
Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822.
   The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the
island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical
accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter
Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
   The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set
afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for
Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
   Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked
other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek
struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greece won
independence in 1830.
   The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture,
``The Massacre of Chios,'' based on the raids.
   ``It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book
we used to read in school about the War of Independence,''
Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.
   Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an
underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started
querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed
obstacles.
   He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said.
   ``When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy
seabed and dozens of objects _ Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls,
a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church,'' he
said.
   ``The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios. I think
there may be gold and silver items as well,'' he said. ``I also saw
what I recognized as human bones,'' he added.
   He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet
in length.
   According to historians, more than 1,000 people _ including 400
Greek captives _ were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his
attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822.
   The Greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of Psara, towing
a boat stuffed with explosives. Its pointed bow was rammed into the
mouth of a cannon on the Bourloti Seimaz and a fuse lit.
   The Ottoman commander, Admiral Kara Ali, was killed in the blast
that split the ship. Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped.
   ``This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from
this particular period of history,'' said George
Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine
archaeology.
   Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site
will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology
rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, ``This is
a ship that must be explored.''
   Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American
and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international
project.
   American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at
Texas A & M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers,
have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast.
   Greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying
historic wrecks scattered around the Aegean and rarely carry out
excavations.

<HEAD>Two Hijackers of Kuwait Jumbo Killed In Beirut, Paper Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two of the Shiite Moslem militants who hijacked a
Kuwaiti jetliner last month have been killed in fighting between
Shiite militias in the slums of south Beirut, the Al-Qabas daily
reported Saturday.
   The newspaper, quoting a report by a European foreign ministry
that it did not identify, said one of the men killed was Qassem
Zaineddin. The paper said the other man was either Nihad Khashman
or his brother, Fuad.
   The two were killled with 10 other Shiites in fighting near the
Bourj el-Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in south Beirut on
Monday night, the paper said. Khashman's mother was also killed in
the Beirut fighting, according to the report.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report from the
newspaper, a major independent Kuwaiti publication.
   Al-Qabas said the Khashman brothers and Zaineddin were among
nine hijackers who seized a Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 with 112
people aboard on April 5. The hijackers demanded the release of 17
pro-Iranian bombers jailed in Kuwait.
   The air pirates killed two Kuwaiti passengers before
surrendering to authorities in Algiers in return for what diplomats
said was safe conduct to an undisclosed country.
   There have been reports that the hijackers, believed linked to
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, went to Lebanon. But their
whereabouts were not officially confirmed.
   Since May 6, Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting the
Syrian-backed Amal militia for control of the slums of south
Beirut, where Western hostages, including nine Americans, are
believed held. Both groups are comprised of Shiite Moslems. More
than 250 people have been killed.
   The paper did not say on which side the alleged hijackers had
been fighting.
   But like the hijackers, Hezbollah-linked Shiites holding
American hostages in Lebanon have demanded the release of the 17
terrorists jailed in Kuwait.
   Shiite factions have been responsible for kidnapping most of the
79 foreigners grabbed in Lebanon since 1984. Eighteen are still
captives.
   Another Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Seyassah, reported Saturday that
authorities in Kuwait have launched a security dragnet for two
friends of a 23-year-old man who was killed by a bomb in Kuwait
City on Wednesday.
   Walid Abdel-Nabi al-Mousa died with another man when a bomb in a
car they were driving apparently exploded prematurely near the head
office of the Kuwait Airways Corp.
   Al-Seyassah said the two wanted men, identified only as
Kuwaitis, flew to Cyprus several times to meet al-Mousa when he was
visiting the Mediterranean island earlier this year.
   The paper said the two wanted men disappeared following
Wednesday's explosion.
   The blast was the third in less than a month in downtown Kuwait.
The offices of Saudi Arabia's national airline, Saudia, and the
U.S. Avis car rental agency have also been bombed.
   The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying that
investigators believed the bombings were related.

   A Soviet newspaper painted an unusually
sympathetic picture Saturday of Crimean Tatars and their attempts
to return to their ancestral homeland on the Black Sea.
   ``For tens of thousands of Crimean Tatars, settled today all
around the country, everything connected with their native homes,
the history of the people, takes on a special acuteness,'' said
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the daily of the youth organization Komsomol.
   While not advocating mass resettlement of the Tatars, the
article took a more balanced look than other Soviet media at the
peoples' history and problems.
   It said authorities in the capital of the Crimea, Simferopol,
were addressing the problems of the Crimean Tatars and that ``the
question of the organized resettlement of part of the Tatars in the
Crimea is being settled.''
   The rights of the Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups
is one of the most sensitive issues facing the administration of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He has called on the Communist Party's
Central Committee to devote a plenary meeting to the issue, which
includes the recent unrest between the neighboring republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Under Soviet dictator Josef V. Stalin, the Crimean Tatars were
deported from their homes on the Crimea, a peninsula in the
Ukrainian republic that juts into the Black Sea. They were charged
with betraying their country while the Crimea was occupied by Nazi
Germany.
   According to the article, nearly 200,000 Crimean Tatars were
loaded onto railroad cars and taken to Central Asia and Siberia.
Thousands died during the deportation, but Komsomolskaya Pravda did
not mention this.
   The government dropped the collective war crimes charges in
1967, but the Tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the
Crimea.
   Soviet newspapers usually ignore demonstrations by Crimean
Tatars, but Komsomolskaya Pravda recently reported on a meeting in
mid-May of about 100 people outside government offices in
Simferopol.
   The group heatedly debated whether the Crimean Tatars, who now
number about 350,000, should be allowed to resettle in their
homeland.
   Some of the Tatars who met outside the government offices told
the newspaper they had bought houses in the Crimea but that
authorities refused to recognize their right to reside there.
Authorities claim no work is available for the Tatars, although
``on the wall of the administrative offices are job announcements
for milkmaids and mechanics,'' the daily said.
   According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, nearly 4,200 Crimean Tatars
have been given permission to resettle in their homeland since
January, shortly before a government commission headed by President
Andrei A. Gromyko announced new procedures on resettlement.
   A government official said March 5 that Crimean Tatars who are
``the most virtuous and well-proven in work and social life'' would
be allowed to return to the Crimea. Crimean Tatar activists
predicted then that only a small number of their countrymen and
only those who toe the party line would be allowed back.
   Saturday's article was not the first time Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported sympathetically on ethnic issues.
   In March, the newspaper accused the Communist Party leadership
of trying to suppress the sensitive ethnic dispute that continues
in Aremenia and Azerbaijan.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late last week, radical students
stormed the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, tossing homemade bombs at
embassy buildings as they sullied American flags. The incident was
not an isolated one.
   Anti-American protests are increasing dramatically in South
Korea as radicals blame the United States for everything from
military rule to dividing the Korean peninsula.
   Radical students and dissidents are singling out the United
States for harsh criticism as they continue a drive to oust
President Roh Tae-woo. Radical leaders demand the expulsion of U.S.
troops from South Korea and an end to all American influence.
   ``Drive out the Yankees!' and ``Down with the Yankee masters of
military dictatorship!'' protesters shouted during recent riots in
Seoul and other cities.
   They burned U.S. flags and effigies of American leaders,
scattered tens of thousands of leaflets denouncing U.S. policy and
hurled bombs and firebombs at U.S. diplomatic buildings.
   Dissidents and radical students, who represent a small but
powerful minority on college campuses, portray Roh as a front for
American rule, and their anti-Americanism has increased as they
step up their drive to oust the Roh government.
   ``It is a fact we cannot ignore, that the United States and its
proxy ruling force (Roh) are primarily responsible for all our
country's problems and divisions,'' one radical leader said in a
speech at a demonstration.
   ``We will never end our struggle until we destroy the Roh
regime,'' a student said during one of the protests.
   Demonstrators are demanding the removal of about 42,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against
communist North Korea.
   The radicals blame the United States for the partition of the
Korean peninsula and claim that Washington is keeping the two
Koreas apart so it can control the South.
   Protesters have demanded immediate reunification of North and
South Korea. They want the two Koreas to field a joint team at the
Olympics in Seoul as a first step toward unification.
   ``The Olympics, which should serve as a foundation for opening
the way for peaceful, independent unification, has been used by the
United States to stabilize the military regime and secure its own
national interests through the permanent partition of the Korean
peninsula,'' said a statement by the Hangyore (One Nation) Party.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because South Korea and
the International Olympic Committee will not agree to its demand to
be a co-host of the Games.
   Radical leaders deny they are pro-North Korean. They say
unification is more important then any political consideration and
insist any problems can be solved after the Koreas are reunited.
   Most Koreans are thought to support the U.S. military presence,
and many are appalled at the radicals' views.
   ``It torments us to see that many of these self-appointed
unification promoters seem to ignore the true character of the
North Korean communist clique,'' The Korea Times said in a May 18
editorial.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet forces at
the end of World War II. U.S. forces intervened to help the South
after the North Korean invasion that started the Korean War in 1950.
   North Korea, one of the most repressive nations in the world,
has made little secret of its desire to eventually take control of
the South. It has repeatedly launched terrorist attacks against the
South.
   The United States has been the main ally of all South Korean
governments since the Korean War. Washington has tended to push for
democratic reform while insisting its main concern is defending the
South against any threat from North Korea.
   U.S. government leaders have said repeatedly that U.S. forces
will remain in the South only as long as they are wanted. South
Korean leaders say the U.S. troops must stay until the South can
defend itself alone.
   The main South Korean opposition parties, while rejecting the
radicals' anti-Americanism, are calling for a smaller U.S. role in
the country. Opposition leaders want an end to U.S. command over
most of the South Korean military.
   ``It is nonsense for an American commander to stand above the
president of Korea as far as the operational control over the
Korean armed forces is concerned,'' top opposition leader Kim
Young-sam said.

   Seven out of 10 teachers give school reform a
grade of ``C'' or less, and half feel that teacher morale has
declined even though student achievement is up, according to a
nationwide survey released Saturday.
   Overall, a majority of the 13,500 public school teachers
surveyed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
said that five years of reform had improved the lot of students
much more than that of teachers.
   ``Teaching is a grueling, thankless job. Most people who
criticize teachers could not long survive in many of the nation's
schools,'' concluded the 85-page survey, ``Report Card on School
Reform: The Teachers Speak.''
   On the bright side, the survey found that 66 percent of teachers
reported higher math achievement among their students, and 64
percent said reading and writing have improved.
   Seventy-six percent said educational goals at their schools are
more clearly defined than they were five years ago, and 74 percent
reported that more is expected of students. Fifty-six percent said
the leadership role of their principals had improved.
   But when teachers were asked, ``If you were to give a grade to
the education reform movement, what would it be?'' 50 percent gave
it a ``C,'' 13 percent a ``D,'' and 6 percent a failing grade.
Twenty-nine percent gave it a ``B,'' and only 2 percent an ``A.''
   Forty-nine percent said teacher morale had worsened since 1983,
the year a national commission heralded the school reform movement
with its report, ``A Nation at Risk.'' Twenty-eight percent
reported no change, and 23 percent said morale had improved.
   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation and author
of the latest report, said that teachers believe school reform has
boosted student performance in the basics like reading.
   ``But what the data show is that teachers feel largely bypassed
in the process. Regulations have added more paperwork and the
bureacracy has increased. Teaching conditions have gotten worse.
And in the process, morale has gone down,'' he said in an interview.
   A majority of those surveyed reported no improvement or a
worsening in key issues affecting working conditions such as study
space for teachers, daily teaching load, class preparation time,
class size, freedom from non-teaching duties, teacher awards and
money to support innovative ideas.
   Fifty-nine percent said the salary picture was better than in
1983. But only one in four felt that community respect for teachers
had increased.
   In his paid weekly column due to appear in Sunday's New York
Times, American Federation of Teachers president Albert Shanker
said the Carnegie survey indicates teachers ``feel they've been had
on the promises of professionalism.''
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teacher union with 1.8 million
members, called the Carnegie report ``right on target.''
   ``Teachers tell me that, in essence, they do not have the
authority, or the resources, to do what is expected of them,''
Futrell said in a statement.
   While teachers nationwide gave mixed marks to school reform, the
survey found more upbeat attitudes in a few states where school
reform has gotten the most political attention.
   The standout in the survey was South Carolina, which has pumped
hundreds of millions of dollars into improving its schools, and
where 46 percent of teachers surveyed graded school reform ``B,''
and 6 percent gave reform an ``A.''
   The Carnegie poll, one of the largest ever of teacher attitudes,
was conducted by mail in November by the Wirthlin Group, a national
polling firm based in McLean, Va. Surveys were sent to 40,000
teachers in all 50 states, and 13,576 teachers completed them. The
survey had a sampling error of plus or minus 0.84 percent.
   Reports assessing school reform issued in the last few weeks
have sharply differed on the role teachers have played.
   A report in April by the RAND Corporation concluded that reform
has improved salaries but has yet to elevate teaching to
full-fledged professional status.
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett followed on May 2 with a
report chiding teacher unions for obstructing school reforms. But
last week, a second RAND report financed in part by Bennett's own
department absolved teachers of such blame.
   Bennett was out of the country until Monday and unavailable to
comment on the latest report.

   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., was released from a
hospital today following successful surgery earlier this month to
correct an aneurysm near his brain.
   ``I am happier than you can possibly believe to be out of the
hospital,'' Biden told reporters at an impromptu news conference
outside Walter Reed Medical Center.
   Biden was admitted to the hospital May 1 and underwent surgery
May 3. It was his second brain aneurysm since February. An aneurysm
consists of a ballooning of the weakened wall of an artery and is
caused by disease or injury.
   Pete Esker, a Walter Reed spokesman, said the neurological team
was pleased with Biden's recovery and had determined there was no
reason that he could not resume his Senate duties.
   In the operation, doctors inserted a clip on the artery wall to
eliminate the ballooning, Esker said. Doctors earlier said Biden's
second aneurysm was smaller than the first and there was no sign of
any others.
   Biden, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, appeared thin
but relaxed, with his wife, Jill, and his 6-year-old daughter,
Ashley, by his side. He wore a baseball cap.
   After a recuperation at his home in Delaware, Biden said, he
plans to resume his full schedule in the Senate. That could come as
early as September, he said.
   Biden, 45, who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
dropped out of the Democratic race before his first aneurysm was
discovered in February.

   About 2,000 students shouting ``Yankee
go home!'' forced their way to the front of a parade honoring
Buddha on Saturday and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops and
the fall of President Roh Tae-woo.
   In Kwangju, 165 miles south of the capital, hundreds of students
battled riot police with firebombs and rocks.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests, and the country
was relatively calm after four days of clashes between
anti-government protesters and riot police in Seoul and other
cities.
   In the capital, the students interrupted a parade of about
30,000 people honoring the anniversary of the birth of Buddha and
marched to the front with banners denouncing Roh and the United
States.
   ``Drive out the Yankees!'' and ``Down with the military
dictatorship!'' the students yelled, raising clenched fists.
   There were thousands of riot police along the parade route, but
they did not try to stop the students until they got near the U.S.
Embassy. The students did not try to approach the embassy.
   Riot police removed students who blocked a main city street
after the march. Students dispersed and there were no incidents.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment has been high in the recent wave of
anti-government protests, the worst political unrest since major
riots last summer. Radicals claim the Roh government is kept in
power by the United States.
   Protesters have burned American flags, attacked U.S. diplomatic
buildings and demanded the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Police officials hunted Saturday for radical student leaders
believed behind an attack Friday on the U.S. Embassy in which
students stormed the walls and hurled bombs.
   Investigators said the attack apparently was organized by
radicals responsible for other attacks on U.S. diplomatic offices
and offices of the governing Democratic Justice Party. Police
questioned seven students arrested in the embassy attack.
   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least 20 other students were suspected of plotting the attack.
   In the embassy attack, students wielding iron bars and hurling
homemade chemical bombs scaled the walls and clashed with police in
the compound. One police officer and two students were hurt. The
embassy was not damaged.

   The government today freed the
daughter and six other relatives of the late Emperor Haile Selassie
imprisoned since he was overthrown in a 1974 Marxist revolution,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
   The government-owned agency gave few details of the release.
There was no mention of three grandsons of Haile Selassie who also
were detained after the revolution.
   An East bloc journalist based in Addis Ababa who witnessed the
release of the elderly princesses said the women looked good and
were greeted by relatives in a tearful reunion in the courtyard of
the police headquarters.
   ``They walked out without anyone's help,'' said the journalist,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Those released were Haile Selassie's 79-year-old daughter,
Tenagne-Work Haile Selassie, her four daughters, her
daughter-in-law and another relative. They spent their nearly 14
years of detention in the women's section of the Central Prison in
Addis Ababa.
   Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia for 44 years as head of one of the
world's last feudal states before he was deposed on Sept. 12, 1974
by a military clique that established a Marxist government.
   The emperor, who had made Ethiopia the United States' strongest
ally in Africa, was last seen alive climbing into the back seat of
a Volkswagen Beetle parked outside his main palace in the center of
Addis Ababa.
   He died under obscure circumstances 11 months later while in
detention and the government buried his body in a secret location.
   The 10 relatives were never brought to trial. Amnesy
International, the London-based human rights group, listed them
among its prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia.
   There had been frequent humanitarian appeals for their release,
all of which the government ignored.
   Haile Selassie also had three sons, two of whom died more than
20 years ago. The crown prince, Merid Azmatch Asfa-Wossen Haile
Selassie, is in his 70s and lives in London.

   Two school buses carrying 87 people
collided at a highway toll station, leaving 18 people with minor
injuries, authorities said Saturday.
   Most of the people were treated for neck pains after a bus
carrying students from the Woonsocket Junior High School struck
another bus as they returned from a New York City field trip.
   The first vehicle had stopped for a toll booth on Interstate 95
northbound in New Rochelle when the second rear-ended it Friday
night.
   The injured were taken to New Rochelle Hospital for treatment.
One girl was kept overnight for observation, while the others were
treated and released, said Tim Connors, principal of the school in
Woonsocket, Rhode Island.
   ``All of the other youngsters are fine,'' he said.
   The driver of the bus that was hit was given a ticket for not
having a log and the second driver was ticketed for having
inadequate brakes and not having a log, police said.

<TEXT>
   Anti-foreign, and particularly
anti-American sentiment, is growing here as the nation rides the
crest of national pride brought about by the ouster of Ferdinand
Marcos and the rise of President Corazon Aquino.
   Some Filipino and foreign observers see the phenomenon as a
healthy corrective to centuries-long subservience among a people
dominated by Spanish and American colonial power for about four
centuries.
   ``The Filipinos should look to America purely as a market
instead of engaging in sentimental nonsense such as partners in
democracy, historical ties and special relations,'' wrote columnist
Hector Villaneuva in the Philippine Daily Globe.
   But the mood may complicate the government's relations with the
United States and other foreign countries as the Philippines seeks
economic and political support to rebuild after 20 years of ruinous
administration under Marcos.
   Anti-foreign sentiment by no means approaches the level of
xenophobia in such turbulent societies as Iran or Lebanon.
   Tens of thousands of Filipinos live, work and study abroad.
Mixed marriages are widespread in Manila and other urban areas, and
foreign goods, many of them pilfered from U.S. military exchanges,
are favored by those who can afford them.
   But renewed Filipino pride, which emerged after the ouster of
the Marcos administration in February 1986, has been coupled with a
deep resentment of foreign influence.
   Politicians and newspaper columnists routinely blame foreigners
for the country's economic problems, prostitution in Manila, and
for bankrolling the Communist New People's Army.
   Legislation is pending in Senate to ban advertising that uses
foreign models or depicts ``an alien and unrealistic lifestyle.''
Many lawmakers have called for repudiating part of the country's
$29 billion foreign debt.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
believes the ongoing talks between the United States and the
Philippines on the future of U.S. military bases here has
galvanized latent anti-foreign sentiment.
   A growing number of Filipinos believe the six bases should be
closed because they see them not as protection from Soviet
expansionism but as an odious remnant of American colonial rule.
   Last month, the two governments began a review of the bases
agreement, which expires in 1991. Filipino negotiators claim
privately that the Americans have been ``stonewalling'' in the
talks.
   American diplomats complain privately that their Philippine
counterparts are violating an agreement to keep the substance of
the talks confidential.
   Several leading politicians and newspaper commentators have
reacted negatively to reports that Washington is putting together a
multinational aid package for the Philippines.
   Although terms and conditions of the package have not been
announced, critics have accused the United States of using the
promised aid as leverage to allow its bases to remain here.
   Resentment of foreign _ particularly American _ influence has
run deep in Philippine society for generations. In 1898, the United
States helped Filipino insurgents defeat Spanish rulers, then
turned against them and took over the country after a two-year
guerrilla war.
   In 1946, the United States granted independence to the
Philippines but forced the new government to accept a trade measure
under which American firms had equal rights with Filipino companies
to exploit the nation's resources.
   U.S. support for Marcos, including acquiesence of his 1972
declaration of martial law, revived anti-American sentiment in the
generation that now wields considerable influence over the nation's
government and mass media.
   A new musical, written by Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
depicts a Filipino view of historical relations with the United
States.
   Columnist Hilarion Henares, writing in the Philippine Daily
Inquirer, suggested American diplomats attend the musical, titled
``Yanky-Panky,'' to see ``the hypocrisy, the deceit, the betrayal,
the vicious greed, the love-hate that characterize
Philippine-American relations today.''
   Some Western diplomats believe the current, free-wheeling mood
may complicate Philippine dealings with important foreign
countries, from whom the government is seeking economic aid and
political support.
   Last week, Manila newspapers bannered reports from unidentified
military sources claiming a television crew from the British
Broadcasting Corp., paid Communist rebels to stage an ambush in
which 11 soldiers were killed.
   Some European diplomats said the charge, which the BBC denied,
was embarassing because it surfaced two weeks before the planned
visit of British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe.
   Before Thursday's arrival of Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, several Manila newspapers featured reports of an alleged
``smear campaign'' against Filipinos in Spain's media.
   The reports were based on a letter to Mrs. Aquino's children by
a 67-year-old British resident of Spain, who claimed newspapers
there portray Filipinos as ``simpletons and morons.''
   Newspapers featured the claim, despite offering no evidence of
such reportage beyond the letter.

   The government of Sierra Leone has
more than 9,000 non-existent employees on its payroll, according to
a census ordered by President Joseph Momoh.
   Momoh, who received the report Friday, described the findings as
``sad news.'' But he said they would help his government end the
abuse of government funds through phony schemes to hire
non-existent civil servants known as ``die men.''
   The report said that of the 74,699 government workers on the
payroll, only 65,514 could be located, a difference of 9,185.
   Momoh ordered the census last November after declaring a state
of economic emergency to prevent the collapse of the national
currency, the leone.
   He said then that Sierra Leone, with a population of 3.7
million, was spending $3 million a month on the salaries of
government employees.
   In West African countries, the term ``die men'' refers to
``ghost'' workers, whose paychecks are pocketed by corrupt
employers.

<HEAD>Jury Trials and Tribulations Don't Often Slow Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the long, complicated trial of
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche collapsed in the wake of
complaints from disgruntled jurors, legal experts have little fear
that the episode portends similar problems in future jury cases.
   LaRouche's conspiracy trial in Boston ended in a mistrial
earlier this month when the presiding judge excused four jurors who
complained, after six months, about its slow pace. Federal
prosecutors hope to bring LaRouche to trial a second time in
October.
   Juror-caused mistrials get lots of attention but they are rare,
say experts who point to lawyer strategy _ not juror
irresponsibility _ as the culprit in most such cases.
   A jury's tribulations do not slow the wheels of justice in the
vast majority of the 300,000 jury trials held in state and federal
courts each year, the experts say.
   Statistics on mistrials caused by hung juries or other problems
in the jury box are elusive, said Tom Munsterman of the jury
studies center of the National Center for State Courts. But he said
the numbers are sure to be ``negligible.''
   ``When a mistrial occurs, it's usually in a big trial that's
going to last more than a few days,'' Munsterman said. ``It often
is a publicized case, so the public gets the impression that
mistrials occur more frequently than they do.''
   He added, ``It's when you get a case like the LaRouche case or a
big narcotics-conspiracy case where problems can arise.''
   LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche organizations are charged
with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into
allegations that his 1984 presidential campaign reaped more than $2
million through credit card and loan fraud.
   The trial, which had begun in December, was proceeding very
slowly. Testimony was all but halted in March for hearings on
whether prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence from the defense.
   When U.S. District Judge Robert S. Keeton resumed testimony,
several jurors complained they had been told the trial would last
only six months. They said continuing through the summer would pose
hardships. Keeton said he had no choice but to declare a mistrial.
   He has set a second trial date for Oct. 3. But he first will
hear arguments by defense lawyers that the mistrial was the
government's fault and a new trial would represent impermissible
double jeopardy.
   Joe S. Cecil of the Federal Judicial Center said the mistrial in
LaRouche's case cannot be pinned to the jury. ``Litigation strategy
disrupted the flow of the trial,'' he said.
   Cecil was one of the authors of a survey report last year
indicating that jurors are willing to tackle complex cases even if
they result in lengthy trials.
   Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger warned in a 1979 speech
that juries may not be able to cope with the increasingly complex
legal issues and the mass of complicated information introduced at
trials.
   Burger also voiced concern about the fairness of requiring
citizens to serve on juries for extended periods of time.
   But the Federal Judicial Center's report said, ``A majority of
jurors from both long and short trials reported that their service
interfered `very little' or `not at all' with their normal life,
and no significant difference emerged on this item between the
responses of long-trial jurors and the responses of short-trial
jurors.''
   It added that more than four-fifths of jurors who had served in
both long and short trials said they were willing to serve on the
case if they had to do it over again.
   ``Even among those jurors who said their service had interfered
a great deal with their normal life, more than 60 percent said they
would be willing to serve if they were called again for jury
duty,'' the report said.
   ``While (the perceptions of) jurors in long and short trials may
differ, the differences are not great in magnitude and are offset
somewhat by the seriousness with which all jurors approach their
task,'' the report concluded.

<HEAD>First Titan 4 Space Rocket Moved To Launch Pad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of the Air Force's
powerful new $150 million Titan 4 space rockets was transported to
a launch pad Saturday under curious censorship.
   The 20-story-tall rocket, the largest unmanned booster in the
U.S. space stable, is scheduled to make its maiden flight next
October, boosting a classified military reconnaissance satellite.
   Development of the Titan 4 was accelerated following the
explosion that destroyed space shuttle Challenger in 1986. The
grounding of the shuttle fleet left several critical national
security payloads without a way to get into space, and many of
those will be hoisted by the new rocket.
   The Air Force, which held a media extravaganza here in January
when the first rocket was delivered and its launch pad was
dedicated, originally said the news media would be escorted to the
pad to cover Saturday's rollout.
   But Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldrich, who presided at the
January festivity, ruled the media out earlier this week, with the
Pentagon explaining only that, ``the launch sequence of military
launch vehicles is not typically an item of public discussion.''
   But when the decision was made Saturday to move the Titan 4, Air
Force public affairs officials alerted the news media at their
homes by phone. They also made arrangements to release photographs,
film and videotape of the move.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the
Eastern Space and Missile Center, replied, ``absolutely none,''
when asked if there were any security or safety reasons for barring
the press Saturday.
   A Titan 34D, predecessor of the Titan 4, is being readied on an
adjacent pad for a secret military launching, but Rand said that
had no bearing on the ruling.
   The rocket was visible for miles during its 45-minute move to
the launch pad from an assembly building. The closest point for the
public to see it was about six miles away.
   The launch pad debuts of previous space rockets have been open
to news coverage here.
   Martin Marietta is building 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force at its
plant near Denver. The Pentagon is seeking millions in public funds
to build an additional 27 boosters.
   Col. Lawrence Gooch, commander of the Eastern Space and Missile
Center, issued a statement saying, ``The rollout of the Titan 4 is
another major step toward recovering our space launch capability.''
   From Washington, Aldrich said, ``The Titan 4 program is one of
the cornerstones of our national security stategy to rebuild
assured access to space. This booster represents the new workhorse
of space for our nation.''
   For the next several months, a team of specialists from the Air
Force and Martin Marietta Astronautics Group will check the
compatibility of the rocket with the new launch pad and prepare the
vehicle for launch.
   The Air Force plans to launch two Titan 4 rockets a year from
Cape Canaveral to boost military satellites for such assignments as
reconnaissance, communications and communications intercept. Other
launches are scheduled from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
   The Titan 4 can boost 32,000-pound payloads into low Earth orbit
and 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high, where most
military satellites are based.

<HEAD>Final Span of New Thruway Bridge Opens to Traffic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The final span of a new highway bridge over
Schoharie Creek opened Saturday, allowing traffic to flow normally
on Interstate 90 for the first time since the old bridge collapsed
nearly 14 months ago, killing 10 people.
   The northern span of the bridge was opened to westbound traffic
for the first time, but alternate lanes of the two-lane span will
have to be closed later on in order to finish painting it, said New
York State Thruway Authority spokesman Arthur D'Isabel.
   Traffic in both directions had been carried by the southern span
of the $13 million bridge since December.
   The April 5, 1987, bridge collapse has been blamed on erosion
around the footing of the bridge piers, which shifted and caused
the steel and concrete structure to tumble into the flood-swollen
creek.
   The new bridge has pier foundations supported on steel piles
driven into bedrock, solid concrete piers and continuous steel
girders. The creek was widened under the bridge to reduce the water
pressure on the bridge supports.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Head Accepts Syrian Troops in Beirut Slums, Report Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lebanon-Violence, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
group was quoted Saturday as saying he would accept Syrian troops
in south Beirut to end fighting between his fighters and the rival
Amal militia.
   ``For the safety of residents, we have accepted that the Syrians
deploy in the suburbs,'' the Barcelona daily La Vanguardia quoted
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual leader, as
saying.
   ``But ... there is still no decision on the form, how and with
what guarantees the Syrian troops are to move into the area,''
Fadlallah told the newspaper's correspondent in Beirut.
   More than 250 people have been killed and 850 wounded since May
6 in south Beirut fighting between Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the Syrian-supported Amal. Both are Shiite Moslem militias.
   Most of 18 foreign hostages kidnapped by Moslem extremists in
Lebanon are believed held in the slums. Nine of the hostages are
U.S. citizens.
   Asked whether he thought the presence of the foreign hostages
created obstacles to ending violence, Fadlallah said: ``I have no
information to give an opinion on this matter.''
   Fadlallah said his party and Syrian troops have gotten along
together before in the Bekaa Valley and that the Syrian army aids
Hezbollah in its ``struggle against Israel.''
   ``But I can't deny that in these moments there is a certain
feeling of apprehension among our people'' over entry by Syrian
troops, he said.
   Syria massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks on the edges of the
embattled southern slums.
   Asked whether he thought Syrian troops would move into the slums
peacefully or by force, Fadlallah said ``there has been no decision
by any party (to the conflict) to oppose their entry.
   ``Lebanon is a testing ground for all political powers in the
world. Foreign influences are so great that no local force has any
autonomy. The peeple of this country are the guinea pigs, the
scapegoats of international politics.''

<DATELINE>SARAGOSA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two miles north of Saragosa, the flat
cotton fields flanking Highway 17 begin to resemble a vast, dusty
junkyard. Crumpled tin roofs and sides of mobile homes, along with
the occasional battered stove, litter the countryside.
   They are leftovers from the tornado that ripped through Saragosa
a year ago Sunday, killing 30 people, injuring 170 and leveling
most of this unincorporated cotton-farming town of about 250
residents.
   Amid those fields lies Saragosa's cemetery, where 13 victims are
buried. Like the memories of the tornado's survivors, the silk and
plastic flowers that were put on the graves a year ago have barely
faded.
   ``It's a completely different place all the way. The tornado not
only moved things, it scratched things,'' said Maria Paz Candelas,
pronouncing ``scratched'' with a growl. ``It scratched the dirt. It
come out like this,'' she said, making a vigorous scooping motion
with her hand.
   ``You know how a strong wind will pick up papers and trash?
Well, this one picked up rocks. It pulled out mesquites. We used to
have a lot of trees,'' Mrs. Candelas said, pointing out the kitchen
window of her new house at the barren back yard, once covered by
stubborn-rooted mesquite trees.
   At about 8:30 p.m. on May 22, 1987, the twister dipped from the
clouds near the Davis Mountains six miles to the south and skipped
across the fields before slamming into the community center during
a preschool graduation ceremony. The community center was destroyed
along with 61 houses, the Catholic church, the Candelas family's
convenience store and pieces of farm machinery.
   ``For a lot of months, when you came out here it looked like
someone else's place, another world,'' said Tomas Martinez, living
in a trailer while he rebuilds his house. ``When I came out here
(after the tornado), there were no houses, but there were all sorts
of TV satellite trucks parked up and down the highway.''
   Now new, small, boxlike houses, built by Red Cross volunteers,
line Saragosa's streets. The new community center boasts a basement
shelter that can hold up to 300 people. A warning siren on a
30-foot pole stands in the center's back yard. A new church is
halfway finished. The diocese helped rebuild the Candelas Grocery.
   The tornado drove away a few Saragosa families. But most elected
to stay in the tightly knit, Mexican-American farming town despite
the painful memories.
   ``For starters, the people that died _ we miss them,'' said
Rosario Lopez, 26, a resident of nearby Balmorhea who works as a
clerk in the trailer that now serves as the town's post office.
``Every day, when we'd drive by, we'd seen them. Now they're dead.
It's unbelievable.''
   The Rev. Daniel Rojas, Saragosa's parish priest, was so taxed by
the job of counseling survivors that he took a leave of absence and
only a few people know where to reach him, said Corina Brijalba,
48, who lost seven family members and depended heavily on Rojas in
her grief.
   Mrs. Brijalba's son Lucas, a 28-year-old father of three, died.
So did her mother, Amelia Carrillo. Five other relatives _ two
aunts and three cousins _ were killed when the concrete walls of
the community center caved in. Mrs. Brijalba, who suffered a
punctured lung and a fractured skull, lost sight in her right eye.
The vision of her husband, Pat, was so impaired that he is legally
blind.
   After being in critical condition for three days, Mrs. Brijalba
was notified of the deaths.
   ``I asked, `How long did it last?''' she recalled. ``And they
said, `Five minutes.' I said, `Five minutes? My family was wiped
out in five minutes?'''
   Mrs. Brijalba, who recently was appointed the area's justice of
the peace, said she is impatient with the minority in town who have
complained of alleged irregularities in the distribution of
donations. There also have been complaints that the replacement
houses are too small and poorly built.
   ``That irks me,'' she said. ``The people who didn't lose anyone
seem to be the ones complaining about material things. I would have
taken a small bedroom if my son had been able to sleep in it.''
   There have been sleepless nights for many of Saragosa's
children, especially this spring, with its brown dust devils
snaking 200 feet skyward and its rainclouds marching over the Davis
Mountains toward the town.
   One recent windy, rainy night, Sylvia Mendoza's 8-year-old son
and 9-year-old daughter ran out of their room and jumped into bed
between their parents.
   ``Whenever they see a lot of clouds and whenever they see a lot
of wind, they get scared,'' Mrs. Mendoza said, adding that her
seven children don't range about town as far as they used to and
are more quick to go inside when it becomes windy and rainy.
   Mrs. Candelas said she misses the nightly soccer games children
used to play near her house.
   ``I used to get mad because they made so much noise,'' she said.
``They used to come out at night. Now they're afraid. They're
afraid if they come, the tornado will get them here.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Critics Decry Dukakis' Absence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few weeks ago, nine college students occupied
the lobby of Michael Dukakis' Statehouse office and demanded an
audience with the governor.
   But Dukakis was off in Pennsylvania, campaigning for president,
and the only reception the students got was from the Capitol
police, who arrested them. ``Why isn't he here in the state when
there are all these issues to address?'' one of the protesters said.
   It's a question many on Beacon Hill have asked. Some have even
suggested Dukakis take an unpaid leave of absence and turn over the
reins of Massachusetts government to Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy while
he concentrates on his Democratic presidential race.
   The three-term governor, who has said he will not resign unless
and until he is sworn in as president, has been on the campaign
trail for more than a year, balancing his Statehouse duties with
those of a White House aspirant.
   ``Fortunately, I have been able to combine the two fairly well,
all things considered,'' he said recently. ``I think I can probably
continue to do that. Certainly I am going to work hard at doing
that.''
   But critics question how effectively he's handled the dual role.
They point to delays in enacting a $3 billion transportation bond
in January and in dealing with recently discovered multi-million
dollar revenue shortfalls in the fiscal 1988 and 1989 budgets.
   There also have been charges of presidential politics entering
into two other major initiatives his administration pushed in the
legislature _ a first-in-the-nation universal health care bill,
which he signed in April, and a pending bill to address
skyrocketing auto insurance rates, a hot topic in California and
New Jersey, the two large states whose primaries close the season
on June 7.
   House Republican Leader Steven Pierce has criticized Dukakis for
``management by neglect,'' and other members of the minority GOP
have used similar language to characterize Dukakis' lack of
on-the-spot leadership.
   ``He's spread too thin,'' the minority leader said. ``I've said
consistently that I have great respect for his energy and his
stamina.
   ``But even a person with a tremendous amount of those things
cannot be a chief executive of a state with 70,000 employees and a
$12 billion budget and a whole host of problems, and also be a
candidate for president of the United States. They are both
full-time occupations.''
   Robert Behn, director of Duke University's Governors Center,
said the question is more difficult than whether it is harder to do
two jobs at once. ``The hard question is _ can you do two things at
the same time and do them both well?'' he said.
   A sitting governor hasn't won the presidency since Franklin
Roosevelt, as New York's chief executive, did it in 1932. But Behn
said that was a different era when less was popularly expected of a
governor and less was required of a candidate to win the
presidential nomination.
   The Middlesex News in Framingham, Mass., has been keeping a
daily attendance record on the governor. Friday's tally showed that
since Jan. 1, Dukakis had been out of state for 121 partial or
entire days, including 31 weekend days.
   When the governor is away, his acting authority passes down a
constitutional chain of command. Lt. Gov. Murphy has officially
filled the bill most of the time, although Dukakis' chief
secretary, Hale Champion, carries out day-to-day government duties.
   However, Dukakis aides and Democratic legislative leaders say
that even if the governor isn't actually in the state, he is still
in charge.
   ``The governor is running the government,'' said Senate Ways and
Means Chairman Patricia McGovern.
   Similarly, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Voke said:
``Oh, Michael Dukakis very definitely is the governor and in
charge, and I think certainly knows what's going on here on a
day-to-day basis.''
   Dukakis sets the policy and makes the ultimate decisions for the
administration, Champion said. He can do that without being in
Boston eight hours a day, through daily written briefings and phone
conversations and group sessions with his Cabinet and key
legislators, Champion said.
   ``I think this would be difficult to do if you had a governor
who was relatively new at his job, who didn't know the state,
hadn't been around a long time, didn't know all the players,''
Champion said. ``The governor can do it.''
   But Pierce said, ``The governor is obviously here some of the
time and tries to create the appearance of being in charge no
matter where he is. But the sense is that different people
(Dukakis' aides and Cabinet secretaries) are in charge at different
times and on different issues.''
   Stephen Hess, senior fellow at Brookings Institution in
Washington, said Dukakis has shattered some long-held theories by
coming as far as he has in the presidential race.
   ``It was said, until he showed otherwise, that you really had to
be an unemployed politician'' to run for president, Hess said.
``That was the history of Richard Nixon in 1968, it was the history
of Jimmy Carter in 1976, it was the history of Ronald Reagan in
1980 and it was the history of Fritz Mondale in 1984.
   ``So he has shown us that it is do-able. That's the important
thing. The conventional wisdom was otherwise,'' Hess said.
   How well Dukakis is able to fulfill his governor's duties during
this time will be more of a state issue than a national one, Hess
said, adding that Massachusetts residents may be less harsh on the
governor under the circumstances.
   The ``upside'' of this for the commonwealth, Hess added, is the
``prospect of possibly having your favorite son in the White
House.''

<HEAD>Report Cites ``Kickback Arrangements'' for Eye Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in the way Medicare reimburses for
cataract surgery has spawned ``kickback arrangements'' between eye
care professionals and led to shoddy patient treatment, a
Republican congressional report said Saturday.
   The Inspector General's Office of the Department of Health and
Human Services also has been investigating the referral
arrangements, and says legislation may be necessary to change the
system.
   The problem stems largely from a 7-year-old law permitting
optometrists to be paid by Medicare for post-surgical cataract work
for which Medicare had previously only reimbursed ophthalmologists,
according to a report of the Republican staff of the Special Senate
Committee on Aging.
   Ophthalmologists are eye surgeons trained in medical school and
residency programs. Optometrists, who do not need medical-school
training but attend their own training programs, examine eyes,
diagnose cataracts and other ailments and prescribe corrective
lenses.
   The new reimbursement policy, which was clarified in Medicare
guidelines issued last year, has made optometrists and
ophthalmologists increasingly reliant on each other for business,
and has ``created the opportunity for highly questionable referral
arrangements and kickbacks,'' the report said.
   ``Some ophthalmologists, who depend on optometrists for patient
referrals, are being held hostage by optometrists who refuse to
refer patients unless they are guaranteed that the patient will be
returned to them for postoperative care,'' the report said.
   It said the ``kickback arrangements'' have placed profits ahead
of medical judgment, sometimes encouraging inappropriate surgery or
poor postoperative care by optometrists performing work for which
they are not properly trained.
   The report was based largely on some three-dozen case studies in
Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, California, Utah and other states.
The case examples are to be presented along with the report at a
hearing in Philadelphia on Monday with Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., as
chairman.
   Also at the hearing, Bryan Mitchell, deputy inspector general of
HHS, is to present preliminary findings of an investigation into
the questionable referral arrangements.
   So far, the probe has found that 28 percent of ophthalmologists
interviewed permit optometrists to do cataract follow-up care,
according to an advance copy of Mitchell's statement.
   Those physicians perform a ``significantly greater'' number of
cataract surgeries than their counterparts who do their own
postoperative work, Mitchell's prepared testimony said.
   This year, some 1.3 million Americans are expected to have
cataract surgery, in which an artificial lens is placed in the eye.
   The American Academy of Ophthalmology said in a statement to the
committee that while it was tempting to make deals to surrender
postoperative cataract care, ``the overwhelming majority of our
members insist on taking care of their patients from the
pre-operative work-up through the postoperative recovery period.''
   Harvey Hanlen of the American Optometric Association told the
panel there was ``a very legitimate and natural referral
relationship'' between optometrists and ophthalmologists in
cataract work.
   He said his organization believes that referrals ``motivated
solely on some `quid pro quo' economic agreement have no place in
the system.''
   A bill signed into law last year prohibits payments made in
return for steering Medicare patients to a specific health
professional for care. However, final regulation implementing the
law have not yet been issued.

   In blue jeans, tennis shoes and a tan
fishing vest, Jimmy Carter stepped carefully across the partly
submerged rocks of Turniptown Creek, then snapped several quick
casts to put a tiny artificial lure in the swift current upstream.
   The intensity of the dedicated fly fisherman creased his face,
even if the occasion was a photo opportunity to be repeated
numerous times at Carter's cabin among the fern and white pine in
this cool nook of the north Georgia mountains.
   At one-hour intervals last week, reporters and photographers
were ushered past a Secret Service guard post to the rough-hewn
cabin.
   There, above a constant roar from a nearby falls, the former
leader of the Western world talked about his fourth and latest
book, a narrative that avoids politics and history to offer a
picture of the one-time Georgia peanut farmer, governor and
president as an accomplished outdoorsman.
   ``An Outdoor Journal: Adventures and Reflections,'' from Bantam
Books at $18.95, is going to book stores this week. It depicts a
young Jimmy Carter learning to hunt and fish in the swamps of south
Georgia under the stern tutelage of his father, and absorbing the
woods lore and occasionally earthy humor of the menfolk in his
close-knit farming community.
   The book is part travelogue, part technical manual and part
philosophical treatise.
   In a quest for trophy rainbow trout along Alaska's Copper River,
Carter marvels at the untamed beauty of the wilderness his
administration helped protect.
   He writes in detail of the life cycles the dedicated fly
fisherman must study to present the proper lure to his quarry.
   A strong conservation ethic also comes through in Carter's
policy of releasing what he catches.
   The outdoors, he said in an interview, holds many meanings for
him.
   ``One thing is, it's a resurrection or recollection of
adventures or experiences I have known all my life as a farm boy.
So when I went in the Navy or when I was in the governor's mansion
or in the White House, I had a hunger for the forest, the
wilderness areas, streams and fields that were the same or similar
to the ones I knew as a child.''
   His love for the outdoors played a part in the Camp David accord.
   ``Perhaps the most famous achievement of my life was brought
about because (former First Lady) Rosalynn and I were walking
through the quiet of a Camp David trail. ... I was deeply concerned
about the Mideast situation deteriorating, and Rosalynn said, `Why
don't we bring (Israeli Prime Minister Menachem) Begin and
(Egyptian President Anwar) Sadat up here to Camp David? I think
that the Egyptians and the Israelis in this kind of environment
might forget about war and get to know each other better.'
   ``And, of course, it worked out that way. I don't think that we
ever could have healed the relationship between Israel and Egypt
had it not been for the quietness and the contemplative environment
of Camp David.''
   The Reagan administration's stewardship of the environment has
been ``abominable,'' Carter said. ``I think President Reagan's
statement that trees cause pollution has been a kind of a basic
philosophical characteristic of this administration.''
   Carter makes no mention in the book of the most famous outdoor
adventure of his presidential years _ the ``killer rabbit'' episode.
   ``I guess I should have just to explain there was nothing to
it,'' Carter said. ``But I don't want to get into another
altercation with the press about it. That was a contrivance of the
press.''
   The episode occurred in 1979 while fishing in a pond near his
home in Plains. A rabbit _ also dubbed the ``banzai bunny'' _ swam
toward Carter's canoe.
   He told reporters at the time that he used a paddle to hit water
to keep the rabbit away. But first reports said the rabbit was
making straight for Carter's canoe and that he beat it back with a
paddle.

   The attorney for a woman convicted in the
nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial has asked a judge
to throw out the verdict, contending a juror's actions tainted the
deliberations.
   The juror, who had been holding out for acquittal, told the
judge she got a telephone call telling her the defendant had
flunked an FBI lie detector test, information which had not been
allowed in evidence. She then changed her vote to guilty.
   The same juror later revealed that she had won a settlement in a
product-tampering case a few months before.
   Stella Nickell, 44, of Auburn, was convicted May 9 of five
product-tampering counts, including two stemming from the June 1986
deaths of her husband, Bruce Nickell, and a woman she didn't know,
Susan Snow. Both died after swallowing cyanide-laced Extra-Strength
Excedrin capsules.
   Nickell could receive life imprisonment when she is sentenced
June 17.
   In a motion filed Friday, public defender Thomas Hillier II
asked U.S. District Judge William Dwyer to declare a mistrial
because of juror Laurel Holliday's actions.
   Hillier noted Ms. Holliday was the only juror who reported
receiving an anonymous phone that said Mrs. Nickell had flunked the
lie detector test.
   Ms. Holliday also failed to reveal the fact that she won a $500
settlement in a product contamination suit about three months
before the Nickell trial began and had discussed the possibility of
writing an article about her jury experiences, Hillier said.
   Ms. Holliday has said neither the telephone call nor her own
lawsuit affected her fairness as a juror. She has said she did not
consider her case relevant to the cyanide trial and so did not
mention it during jury selection.
   She sued Pepperidge Farms Inc. in June 1987, alleging she bit
into a cracker in July 1986 that contained an aspirin substitute
pill. Pepperidge Farms disputed the allegations but agreed to
settle out of court.

   Joe Walsh, the self-proclaimed court
jester of rock 'n' roll, says he takes a light approach to music to
offset what he sees as a bleak future for mankind.
   ``I like to make people think,'' said Walsh, who is here for a
concert Saturday. ``The best way to make 'em think is to get their
attention. The way to do that now is to make 'em laugh, 'cause
everything's so ridiculous you have to laugh, you know? It's the
only way.''
   Walsh, formerly of the James Gang and the Eagles, cited Agent
Orange, environmental disasters at Love Canal in New York and in
Times Beach, Mo., and the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island
and Chernobyl.
   ``I think we're living in the peak of civilization, right now,''
Walsh said on a Kansas City radio station. ``It ain't gonna get any
better. I'd say in a hundred years there won't be anything left
alive on this planet except insects.''
   However, Walsh, 40, said young people can change the world by

   As the 1988 elections approach, career
women must push for day care, pregnancy leave and equal pay for
equal work, Diane Sawyer of CBS News says.
   ``It is backbreaking to do what women are still trying to do,''
Ms. Sawyer said of those who try to maintain a career and a family.
``It is a marathon, not a sprint. But we have to have help for the
next 23 miles.''
   The co-editor of ``60 Minutes'' spoke to about 1,000 people
Friday night at an awards banquet held by the Career Club of
Metropolitan Kansas City.
   Ms. Sawyer said career women need confidence, stamina and
resilience, qualities that she said can be hard for women to come
by.
   ``Women have so little cultural preparation for the game and how
it is played,'' she said.
   Ms. Sawyer recalled the words of Virginia Woolf, who said that
while men are given the opportunity to develop freedom and courage,
women have to learn it for themselves.
   Ms.Sawyer said women who have found such qualities today form
``a kind of throbbing heartbeat that is going to change the pulse
of this country in the next 10 years.''

   A songwriter has filed a libel suit seeking more
than $11 million from Daryl Hall of the pop music duo Hall and
Oates.
   Attorney Mark Guralnick said the suit, filed Friday in U.S.
District Court, stems from a Dec. 14, 1986, Music Connection
magazine interview in which Hall allegedly defamed songwriter John
Madara, best known for the 1950s hit ``At The Hop.''
   Guralnick said Hall, using an obscene phrase, claimed Madara had
taken advantage of him early in his career, causing him to become
disillusioned with the music business.
   Guralnick said the suit is directed only at Hall, not the
magazine. It was filed in Florida because the federal court here
adheres to the two-year statute of limitations of Florida libel
law, he said. Suits against nationally circulated magazines may be
filed in any state.
   A call to Hall's attorney, Stephen Hayes of New York, was not
answered Friday evening and Hayes had no answering service.
   Among the many hits by Hall and Oates are ``Rich Girl,''
``Maneater'' and ``Kiss On My List.''

   A federal appeals court overturned
insurance benefits totaling $2.27 million for nine Malibu
homeowners, including actor Pernell Roberts, whose houses were
damaged in a landslide in the winter of 1982-83.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Friday in a 3-0
ruling that losses caused by landslides were excluded from coverage
in the federal government's flood insurance program to which the
homeowners belonged.
   The homes, in the Big Rock Mesa area of Malibu, lie on an old
landslide that was activated when heavy rains and discharges from
septic systems raised the ground water level.
   The ruling reversed a district judge's order for payment to the
homeowners.

   A newspaper reporter was stabbed to
death during a struggle after he rescued his wife from a man who
was trying to rape her, authorities said.
   Steve Petix, 31, of The Californian, had gone home for lunch
Friday and found his wife, Vickie, 23, being assaulted by a man
with a knife, said police Lt. Bob Lein.
   ``(Petix) immediately injected himself into the situation by
pulling the subject off his wife. She was freed and able to get out
of the apartment, which she did,'' Lein said.
   Mrs. Petix, who suffered cuts and bruises, telephoned police.
When officers arrived and entered the couple's second-floor
apartment, they found Petix lying on the floor, fatally wounded.
   ``He was the most peaceful guy I ever met, but he was a
take-charge kind of guy,'' said Petix's brother, Mark, a reporter
for The Times-Advocate of Escondido. ``He would have laid his life
down. That would be his first thought, to protect her.''
   At The Californian, where Petix worked for six years, managing
editor Jim Slusher said: ``We deal with this sort of thing all the
time. Yet, we seem sort of unprepared to deal with it when it
happens to one of us.''
   ``He was a model reporter, he was a model for human beings,
actually,'' Slusher said.

<TEXT>
   The government has launched a
full-scale offensive against Eritrean rebels to capture their major
strongholds in northern Ethiopia, the state-owned Ethiopian News
Agency reported Saturday.
   The agency said the offensive started near Keren, the second
largest town in the province of Eritrea and about 59 miles west of
Asmara, Ethiopia's major port. It did not give the exact date the
push started.
   The agency said government soldiers launched an attack on all
fronts after repulsing what it described as ``two suicidal
attempts'' by guerrillas of the Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front
to capture Keren. It gave no details.
   The central government in Addis Ababa has been planning an
offensive against rebel movements in Eritrea and neighboring Tigre
since March, when both insurgencies scored a string of victories
and forced the army to retreat.
   The rebels, who are fighting for a separate homeland, claimed in
a radio broadcast that Ethiopian warplanes had bombed the town of
Afabet, a rebel stronghold, for two hours Thursday. They said six
civilians were killed and 30 houses destroyed in the attack.
   Keren is strategically important as a staging area from which
the Ethiopian military can strike at Afabet and Nakfa, another
Eritrean stronghold.

<TEXT>
   The prosecutor who nailed cocaine
baron Carlos Lehder Rivas livens up his speeches with country
songs, once had the governor and 48 sheriffs calling for his
ouster, and is nicknamed ``Mad Dog'' for his aggressive,
bowl-over-the-opposition courtroom methods.
   ``In the immortal words of James Brown, `I feel good!''' U.S.
Attorney Robert W. Merkle exulted to reporters after Lehder's
conviction Thursday climaxed a 7{-month trial.
   Merkle, who jeopardized his job and drew national attention even
before the landmark trial, stayed on the offensive throughout his
prosecution of the Colombian on drug trafficking charges. It was
the first U.S. prosecution of a such a major foreign drug figure.
   Merkle, 43, became U.S. attorney for Florida's Middle District,
covering 32 counties from Fernandina Beach to Fort Myers, in 1982.
   Since then, the former Notre Dame running back has obtained the
indictments of three sitting Florida representatives, two judges,
three prosecutors and dozens of bankers, attorneys and postal
workers. He once called Gov. Bob Martinez a liar during a trial.
   When some of the state's top powers called for his replacement
in 1987, citizens in conservative central Florida rallied to
Merkle, a father of nine known for strong, pro-family positions and
anti-drug activism. They spurred what Justice Department spokesman
John Russell called the first letter-writing campaign in memory in
favor of a U.S. attorney.
   At the time, the outspoken prosecutor had his own view of the
effort to oust him: ``I'm not sweating it. I'm doing a great job.
If anyone looks at the performance of this office the last 4{
years, it's not just great, it's remarkable.''
   Critics acknowledge his legal skills but question his methods.
   ``He obviously has a great deal of talent. However, there is
another side. ... He can be rude, abrasive and abusive,'' said Jose
Quinon, one of Lehder's attorneys. ``If he had been around during
the Constitutional Convention a couple of hundred years ago, he
would have said the Constitution is not needed.''
   Merkle showed little fear of Lehder, identified with the violent
Medellin cocaine cartel. During one hearing in February 1987,
shortly after Lehder was arrested and brought to the United States
from Colombia, Lehder asked for a court-appointed attorney.
   ``Mr. Lehder,'' responded Merkle, ``Is that a Rolex watch you
are wearing on your wrist?''
   ``Do you know that watch is worth approximately $6,000?''
   At the time, Merkle was in political hot water for his dealings
with Martinez.
   Two days after Martinez, the former mayor of Tampa, was
inaugurated as governor, he was called as a defense witness in the
mail fraud trial of a Tampa insurance agent, Nelson Italiano. The
trial ended in a conviction, but the verdict was overturned on a
technicality.
   In closing arguments, Merkle told the jury that Martinez lied on
the stand when he denied receiving a bribe years earlier in
connection with the awarding of a Tampa cable television franchise.
   The governor quickly contacted an aide to President Reagan and
asked that Merkle be removed. Also tired of Merkle was three-term
Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles, who denied Merkle's claim the
senator told him to ignore reports of Hillsborough County
corruption.
   The two major newspapers in Merkle's Tampa base, the Tampa
Tribune and The St. Petersburg Times, called for his dismissal. So
did 48 Florida sheriffs.
   But the clamor died down as Merkle went after Lehder. Jon Peck,
spokesman for Martinez, said recently that the governor had not
taken any further action seeking Merkle's removal.
   Now, Merkle said he is ready, if it becomes possible, to
prosecute the drug indictment he secured against Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   It is also reported, though Merkle won't comment, that he is
seeking indictment of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling,
whose nation was a stopping point for many of Lehder's cocaine
shipments.
   It wasn't so strange for Merkle to quote one of soul singer
James Brown's hits in reacting to the Lehder verdict. A popular
speaker at civic functions, he often brings his guitar and sings
country songs with lyrics he has written.
   ``Mothers, don't let your babies grow up to be lawyers,'' is one
of his adaptations.

   Here is the text of the Democrats' response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, given by Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd:
   This is Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. I want to talk
to you about our national security.
   America's great power is being sapped. We are in danger of
becoming a second-rate power. Why? The reason is simple. Little by
little we are handing over our economic future to foreign
competition. We are giving away the store. We are surrendering our
economic leadership.
   This is wrong. If we cannot afford a strong military how can we
protect America's interests around the world. If we do not have a
strong economy, how can we afford a strong military? A strong U.S.
trade posture is fundamental to a strong military and economic
future.
   For years, the administration has talked tough about trade but
done little. As a result, we have an eroding economic base. Our
foreign competition keeps chipping away.
   Congress has sent the president a good trade bill. It has
bipartisan support. The president should sign the bill.
   But the president does not like a small section of the trade
bill _ the plant-closing provision _ that gives workers advance
notice if they are about to lose their jobs. The issue really is
one of common decency and justice.
   Today, Congress and the American people are still waiting on the
president's answer. As we began this weekend, the trade bill still
sat on the president's desk unsigned. American workers do not know
whether they will get a fair shake. Mr. President, keep America
strong _ sign the bill. Keep America number one.
   All across America people are worried. They see dark clouds on
the economic horizon. They are worried about their children's
future. They know our current prosperity is fragile.
   The president says the economy is booming, the economic future
is bright, there is no need to worry. If that is true, why is the
stock market so jumpy? Why are economists worried about a future
recession or a sudden inflationary spiral? The reason is simple.
The big boys are not willing to bet the farm on the rosy
predictions of the administration.
   It is time to rethink how we look at our economy, and our
national security. If we surrender our economic leadership, we
surrender our economic future and our national security to foreign
hands.
   Our real strength is measured in competence and stability _ not
just in warheads and bombers. Smart students are just as important
as smart weapons. A well-trained work force is just as important as
well-trained army in this era of competition.
   Not long ago the United States was the world's largest creditor.
Today, we are the world's largest debtor. Our treasury is forced to
do the tin cup two step in one financial capital after another. We
have put the power of our own purse in foreign hands.
   Foreign investors are buying everything from our bonds to our
businesses to our real estate. How much longer will we be in
control of our own house? The question of debt has become a
question of national standing, national security and national pride.
   In one industry after another, we are losing our position of
leadership. Good jobs are at stake. So is our security. Ten years
ago we led the world in the memory chips that are the building
blocks of computers and the weapons of war. Today, we are
struggling just to keep up with the Japanese.
   The machine tool industry is a critical defense industry but
foreign machine tools are flooding the American market. This is
alarming, because without machine tools, we cannot build the ships,
submarines, tanks, guns and missiles needed to protect the United
States and our interest abroad. This is dangerous.
   But something can be done. We can remain strong. We can remain
number one. But seven and a half years of borrow and debt _ a
policy of national neglect _ have led to an increasing dependency
on foreign capital. It is time of change course. The trade bill on
the president's desk is one step in the right direction.
   The president has the trade bill on his desk. If he signs it, he
makes America stronger. If he vetoes it, he weakens America. At
stake is nothing less than our economic future and security. Mr.
President, the future is in your hands. Sign the trade bill.

   My fellow Americans, you may have heard me say before that one

talking with our young men and women in uniform.
   I've met them all over the world. At our Army outposts along the
Demilitarized Zone in South Korea, on board the USS Constellation,
in the hangars of Tempelhof Air Base in West Berlin, at Parris
Island in South Carolina and at the Coast Guard Academy a few days
ago.
   And everywhere, I've seen that their commanders are right;
they're the best we've ever had. I mention this because today is
Armed Forces Day. Yes, this is the day for all of us to salute the
soldiers, sailors, marines and aviators who stand sentry on the
frontiers of freedom all over the world.
   We say thanks to the patriots who, whether under the midnight
star or the noonday sun, are always alert so that America's peace
and liberty will always be safe. Seven years ago, when we came to
Washington we found that our armed forces had been badly neglected.
   We found airplanes that could not fly and ships that could not
sail for lack of trained people and spare parts. The military
couldn't recruit enough good people or hold on to those they had.
   Today that's changed. The men and women in the services are well
trained and well equipped. Almost all new recruits have a high
school diploma. Never before in peacetime have we had a military
that is as well prepared.
   Just last month the world saw that those who serve America on
freedom's front _ what they can do when the chips are down. I'm
speaking of the story of the USS Samuel D. Roberts, a guided
missile frigate and part of our task force to help protect passage
through international waters in the Persian Gulf.
   The Roberts was on patrol when it hit a submerged mine. The mine
blew a huge hole in the ship's hull, set a fireball shooting up the
exhaust stack and 150 feet in the air, and almost tore the Roberts
in half. Luckily, no one was killed. Some might have said that
``She was doomed, head for the life rafts.''
   Well, that's not what the men of the Roberts said. They were
determined to show what they could do. Acting fast, they held the
Roberts together with bolts and wire, took care of their injured,
escaped the mine field and with the help of other Navy ships, got
safely to harbor.
   The captain summed up the spirit and determination of the entire
crew when he closed his report saying of the Roberts, ``We saved
her. We'll fix her. And we'll fight again.'' And he signed off with
their motto, ``No higher honor.''
   That's the spirit, skill, and dedication that has been rebuilt
in all our Armed Services today. ``No higher honor'' could be the
motto of every American in uniform.
   Yesterday, to show the nation's gratitude again, I signed into
law three bills expanding veterans' benefits in education, job
training, health care, and other areas. The men and women on duty
today should know that we'll still be behind them when their
service is done.
   They also deserve to know that, like them, we're all doing our
part to keep the peace. This week I was pleased that the Senate
began floor debate on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or
INF, treaty. This treaty has had a thorough and useful examination
in committee.
   Now the Senate can join with me and show both our allies and
adversaries that it, too, wants to help build a brighter peace and
better world. I hope the Senate will provide its consent to
ratification of the INF treaty in time to bring it into force
during my meetings with the general secretary in Moscow.
   On this Armed Forces Day, let's also remember the important role
the armed services have been playing in supporting law enforcement
agencies in the fight against drugs. I asked the secretary of
defense this week to find even more ways to use military resources
against drug smugglers. I also called for a joint task force, the
executive branch and Congress, to draw up a unified plan to fight
drugs.
   I hope the leaders of Congress agree with me that the campaign
against illegal drugs must not be hostage to headline-seeking and
partisan politics.
   This week we had another sign of America's strength, its
economic strength which undergirds all of our national security
efforts. Trade figures came out for March. America exported in
March more than ever before.
   Against this background of good news on trade, I'm going to veto
the ill-advised trade bill Congress has sent me. Once my veto is
sustained, we'll work hard to get a responsible trade bill _ one
that will strengthen, not weaken, our economy.
   One last thought for Armed Forces Day, and every day. If you see
someone in uniform, would you go up, shake their hand, and thank
them.
   Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

<TEXT>
   The government Saturday freed seven
female members of the former royal family imprisoned since a 1974
Marxist revolution ended the 44-year rule of Emperor Haile Selassie.
   The women were greeted by relatives in a tearful reunion in the
courtyard of the police headquarters, said an East bloc journalist
who witnessed the release.
   The government-owned Ethiopia News Agency announced the release
in a short statement.
   ``The State Council of the People's Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia today granted amnesty to seven members of the former royal
family of the defunct feudal regime,'' the agency said.
   Freed Saturday were Selassie's 79-year-old daughter,
Tenagne-Work Haile-Selassie; her four daughters, Aida, Hirut, Seble
and Sofia; her daughter-in-law, Sara Gizaw; and Zuriash-Work
Gebere-Egziabher, identified only as a relative of the princess.
   No ages were available on the other royals.
   The release of the seven princesses leaves three grandsons of
Haile Selassie still behind bars. All are sons of Tenagne-Work
Haile-Selassie. They are believed to range in age from 27 to 40
years.
   In addition to his daughter, Haile Selassie claimed three other
children, all sons. Two of the sons have been dead for more than 20
years.
   The crown prince, Merid Azmatch Asfa-Wossen Haile Selassie, 71,
lives in London. He had been in London for nearly two years
undergoing treatment for diabetes when his father's reign ended.
   They princesses spent nearly 14 years of detention in the
women's section of the Central Prison in Addis Ababa.
   Over the years, a number of Ethiopians living in the West have
passed themselves off as the crown prince or a princess of the
Ethiopian royal family.
   The government kept the jailed royals under tight wraps, and it
was only in 1986 that they were permitted outside their cells to
receive regular medical and dental treatment in hospitals in Addis
Ababa. Before then, physicians were taken to the prison to treat
the royals.
   The 10 relatives were never brought to trial. Amnesty
International, the London-based human rights group, listed them
among its prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia, and the government
had ignored appeals for their release.
   In Britain, conservative members of Parliament had led an
international campaign to win the royals' freedom.
   ``This has come about because of the buildup of international
pressure in which we played our part,'' said David Harris, one of
the leaders in the campaign.
   ``It was an act of great inhumanity that they had been locked up
without trial and without charge,'' he said. ``This is wonderful
news and brings to an end one of the worst cases of imprisonment
without trial in modern history.''
   Harris said the princess were held under ``appalling
conditions.'' He said Princess Tenagne-Work suffers from stomach
ulcers and chronic rheumatism, one of her daughters is partially
paralyzed, another has skin cancer and a third has hepatitis.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, reported
``that if the princesses wanted to come to Britain, no bar will be
placed in their way.'' The agency did not attribute those comments
to any government official.
   Haile Selassie, who received worldwide attention in the 1930s
when Italy occupied his country, ruled Ethiopia for 44 years as
head of one of the world's last feudal states. He was deposed on
Sept. 12, 1974 by a military clique that established a Marxist
government.
   The emperor, who had made Ethiopia the United States' strongest
ally in Africa, was last seen alive climbing into the back seat of
a Volkswagen Beetle parked outside his main palace in the center of
Addis Ababa.
   He died under obscure circumstances 11 months later while in
detention, and the government buried his body in a secret location.
   The military leaders who dethroned Haile Selassie, led by Col.
Mengistu Haile Mariam, swung Ethiopia into the Soviet Union's camp
and made the East Africa country Moscow's closest ally in Africa.

<HEAD>Authorities Urge Tougher Village Defenses Against Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese government
has ended an unprecedented national conference in which top leaders
urged that militias be strengthened to prevent guerrilla
infiltration and living conditions improved.
   Officials of 500 model communes nationwide discussed local
defenses in the May 16-19 conference in Phnom Penh, also attended
by top party and state leaders including President Heng Samrin and
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the official SPK news agency said in a
report seen Saturday.
   An earlier official radio broadcast said Hun Sen exhorted the
commune leaders to increase cooperation between military and police
forces, strengthen the propaganda campaign, and grant clemency to
those who abandon the guerrilla movement.
   The local militia in particular must be strengthened, he said.
   Hun Sen and Heng Samrin also called for efforts to improve
villagers' livelihoods by increasing rice production in the coming
rainy season.
   The Phnom Penh government was installed by Vietnam after it
invaded the country in late 1978 and is backed by thousands of
Vietnamese troops in fighting three main guerrilla groups.
   The conference was convened in response to increased attacks and
undercover operations mounted by the largest guerrilla group, the
Khmer Rouge.
   Vietnamese forces wiped out all guerrilla bases along the
Thai-Cambodian border in 1984-85 but since then the rebels have
re-established their positions.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnamese
invasion and were responsible for the deaths of millions during
their radical communist regime.
   In a preview of the conference, Phnom Penh's official Communist
Party paper Pracheachon (The People) said the party's ruling
Politburo ``considers the localities as a matter of life and death
to the revolution ... as the core battlefield, and the work of
building and consolidating the localities, villages, communes,
units and army bases as the key task in 1988.''
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the paper said, were spreading
propaganda in the villages, planting `'secret agents,'' and
preparing for 1990, when Vietnam has said it will withdraw the last
of its troops from Cambodia.
   It said while Phnom Penh was able to counter pyschological
warfare in the interior of the country, the guerrillas were
infiltrating a number of remote villages and communes along the
Cambodian-Thai border and intimidating people there ``with
impunity.''
   In these areas, it said, living conditions are primitive,
security forces don't support the people in attacking the
guerrillas, and some villagers are even helping the guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis may
give the appearance of a cool technocrat, but the presidential
candidate's blood pressure is ``at the high end of normal,'' a
doctor said Saturday.
   During a visit to a Los Angelese community health center, Dr.
Pedro Lopez administered a blood pressure test to the Massachusetts
governor. The reading was 138 over 82, which Lopez described as
within the normal range although slightly elevated and ``at the
high end of normal.''
   ``There's steadiness,'' Dukakis said of the reading. ``It may
not be a passionate blood pressure but it's steady.''
   When Lopez gave the same blood pressure test to Kitty Dukakis,
the candidate's wife, the reading was much lower _ 118 over 78.
   ``Amazing,'' Dukakis said of the results for his far more
emotional wife.

<HEAD>Climbing Deaths Underscore Danger of Mount Rainier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHFORD, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of three mountain climbers in an
avalanche on Mount Rainier will probably attract even more
thrillseekers to a peak that looks lovely but sometimes acts like a
``devil that shows pity on noone,'' National Park officials say.
   ``News like this tends to bring more people to the mountain,''
said Bill Jensen, the park's chief ranger. ``It's a very dangerous,
hazardous route and that's what attracts people _ the thrill of
danger.''
   The bodies of Craig Loyal Adkison, 37, of Kirkland; David
Kellokoski, 30, of Tahoe-Paradise, Calif., and Greg Remmick, 32, of
Citrus Heights, Calif., were recovered by helicopter Friday from
the 14,410-foot mountain.
   They had been scheduled to finish their climb of the treacherous
Liberty Ridge route up the mountain's north face on May 14. The
search began for the three Tuesday, and their bodies were spotted
from the air Thursday.
   The deaths brought to 54 the number of climbers who have died on
the dormant volcano since 1898, and another 24 have perished on
lesser peaks and slopes nearby, said Cy Hentges, a spokesman for
Mount Rainier National Park.
   Officials at Mount Rainier National Park stressed the mountain's
perilous, unpredictable nature and worried that the latest deaths
would attract thrill-seeking climbers to it.
   ``Let's realize that the American Everest team trained on it,''
Hentges said. ``That should tell you something. It's on a miniature
scale, but it provides anything and everything that Everest does,
except it's not that high.
   ``You can walk up sometimes, roped, with proper equipment but in
shorts, but all it takes is one storm to come in _ and this has
happened many times _ to kill people within half an hour of a road
system. It has killed children on what seems like a gentle slope.
It's something that can become very angry.
   ``It looks so lovely and so beautiful, and yet it can be a devil
that shows pity on no one.''
   Hentges said bad weather and unstable fresh snow probably caused
the three to fall 2,000 feet to their deaths in an avalanche. Their
bodies were recovered from an avalanche chute at the 10,000-foot
level by a helicopter equipped with a grappling hook that snagged
the rope connecting them and carried them to a safer spot.
   About 8,000 people attempt Mount Rainier each year, most of them
up the less steep and glaciated south side, and about half make it.
   To brave the Liberty Ridge route, climbers must be very strong
and well-prepared for bad weather, Hentges said.
   Everest veteran Lou Whittaker, who has run the only guide
service on the peak for decades and that on the southerly route,
made six attempts on Liberty Ridge before making it to the summit,
Hentges said.
   ``If weather's coming in, you have to say it's not safe and turn
around,'' he said.
   ``There is a point of no return,'' Hentges added, ``when you
must continue to the top, and if you hit bad weather, you can get
in real trouble.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three out of five New England women had jobs or
were seeking work last year as the influx of females into the
region's labor force continues to outpace men by a three-to-one
margin, a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report says.
   Yet almost a third of working women in New England hold
``traditional female occupations,'' such as clerical jobs or
teaching, while women's median earnings were only 70 percent of
their male counterparts last year, according to the report being
released Sunday.
   ``However, the growing number of women and their increased
commitment to the labor force have consistently narrowed the
earnings gap between men and women,'' said Anthony J. Ferrara,
regional commission of the bureau's Boston office.
   Women's record-high 60 percent participation in the region's
labor force last year rose from 51.8 percent in 1977, compared with
56 percent nationwide last year and 48.4 percent in 1977.
   For the period between 1982 and 1987, 353,000 women and 102,000
men joined the labor force in the six-state New England region,
according to the report.
   Although increases were noted in all women's age categories, the
greatest gains since 1982 were registered among 25- to
44-year-olds. The highest percentage in the region's labor force
last year was women 20-24 years old at 78.6 percent.
   Only divorced, widowed or separated women and black or Hispanic
women experienced a slight decrease in the labor force since 1982.
   In general, New England women's employment figures were higher
than the nationwide statistics. New England men and women, however,
had slightly lower average work hours in 1987 than the national
average. And women's average work week in New England last year was
34.3 hours compared to 41.9 hours for men.
   Ferrara attributed the shorter work hours to women's prominence
in the retail and service industries, where part-time work is
common.
   ``New England woman have participated more fully in the labor
market and have benefited from an extended period of economic
growth,'' said the report.
   The data in the report indicates mothers across the country are
returning to work sooner after giving birth.
   Last year, 52 percent of U.S. mothers in the work force have
children less than one year old, compared with 43 percent in 1982
and 32 percent 10 years ago.

   The gender-gap problem that plagued President
Reagan could become an even greater liability for George Bush,
whose standing among women is deteriorating as the fall campaign
approaches.
   The vice president, who used his close identification with
Reagan to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, appears to
have inherited Reagan's relative weakness among women voters
without picking up the president's strength among Democratic
blue-collar and ethnic voters, polling data suggests.
   The prospect that Bush may have a problem winning support among
women in November has campaign aides worried and has sent political
analysts searching for explanations.
   ``Clearly, I think that if you're 16 or 18 points behind, it's
not an enviable situation to be in,'' said Bush spokesman Peter
Teeley. ``Obviously there's a (gender) gap there. And it's probably
related to certain issues that women, particularly single women,
are interested in.
   ``I think once Bush begins to talk about various issues, there
will be some benefit to him and that (gap) will close,'' Teeley
said.
   Republican consultants interviewed by The Associated Press were
nearly unanimous in saying that Bush needs to do something quickly,
and that the gender-gap problem not only affects him but all GOP
candidates this year.
   The current gender gap ``is not just George Bush's problem. It
is an institutional problem for all Republican candidates,'' said
Roger Stone, a Republican consultant.
   Bush ``has got to recognize that women are a target group for
him. And he's got to lay out his own views of parental leave, child
care, and stress his own theme that his experience in foreign
policy is best to lead us to peace,'' Stone said.
   ``If he does those things, I think he will close the gap by
election day, Just as Reagan closed the gap with Carter.''
   A CBS-New York Times poll last week put Bush 10 points behind
Michael Dukakis, with the Massachsetts governor at 49 percent and
the vice president at 39 percent in a fall matchup. It also showed
that while the two candidates ran about evenly among men, Dukakis
held a 54-35 percent lead among women.
   Recent internal polls for Bush and the Republican Party show a
similarly wide deficit _ in the vicinity of 20 points _ in support
among women voters, according to GOP sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   These polls also disclose that women are far less optimistic
about the economy than men, suggesting that the current 65-month
economic recovery _ usually viewed as a major campaign asset for
Bush _ may be of little help in persuading many women voters to
vote Republican.
   And while pollsters caution that polls 5{ months before an
election are not to be taken too seriously, the recent results
suggest that Bush's current gender gap problem is about twice as
deep as it was in the Reagan-Bush 1984 landslide re-election
victory. That ticket won a narrow majority of women's votes.
   An election day poll in 1984 by NBC showed that men backed
Reagan and Bush by 64-to-36 while women backed the ticket by 55-45.
In the 1980 election, an AP-NBC poll showed that men backed
Reagan-Bush by 56-36 percent, women by 47-45 percent.
   Why should Bush score more poorly than Reagan among women?
   ``Reagan has far more charm than Bush ever will have. I think
that helps in politics,'' said Molly Yard, president of the liberal
National Organization for Women.
   But she said the Reagan administration has had a negative image
among many women all along. Bush, like Reagan, ``is anti-ERA,
anti-reproductive rights. Those are kind of bottom line issues for
an awful lot of women.''
   Republican pollster Linda DiVall said Bush ``did not have a
gender gap when he ran for president in 1980. He has one now
because he's part of the Reagan team. It is a problem, in that we
need to recognize it exists. And we need to determine the kind of
issues that can be targeted to certain types of women to minimize
the gap.''
   ``It provides a good case for naming a woman as vice
president,'' she added. Some Bush advisers have suggested that a
moderate woman candidate, such as Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum,
might be a good choice.
   Irene Natividad, leader of the National Women's Political
Caucus, said that Bush's poor polling among women ``doesn't
surprise me. This vice president has flip-flopped on women's issues
as he changed from a fairly moderate Republican to a very
conservative one.''
   ``The other reason there is a serious gender gap is that he
hasn't shown a sensitivity to the concerns of the modern women.
Through statements and gestures, he's been showing an attitude
toward women that's frozen in the '50s,'' she said.
   Aides note that, despite the apparent gender gap, Bush has
stressed issues that are important to many women, such as day care.
   But Bush spokesman Teeley conceded ``one or two trips (to day
care centers) is not going to solve it. It has to be done on a more
consistent basis.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a moderate Republican who is a Bush
supporter, said the gender issue ``is also a problem for the
Democrats, but in the reverse. Why do they have a problem with
males? Shouldn't that issue be treated as seriously as the
Republican problem with females?''
   However, he said Bush ``has got to be far more in tune with
younger people's concerns and far more compassionate than Reagan on
issues like day care'' if he expects to narrow the gender gap.

<HEAD>Biden Leaves Hospital After Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., plagued with
health problems since February, was released from the hospital
Saturday about three weeks after he underwent surgery to repair an
artery near his brain.
   ``I am happier than you can possibly believe to be out of the
hospital,'' Biden said at a news conference outside Walter Reed
Army Medical Center. ``I am in good shape and anxious to go back to
work.''
   He also said that though his health problem didn't come to light
until after he dropped out of the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, ending his campaign may have saved his
life.
   ``I think getting out of the race was, quite frankly, a
godsend,'' he said. If he had stayed in the race, ``the percentages
are I might not have made it down here,'' he said.
   The 45-year-old senator withdrew from the race after
acknowledging he plagiarized a law school exam and exaggerated his
achievements.
   Biden, appearing thin but relaxed and in good humor, said he
planned to recuperate at his home in Wilmington, Del., before
resuming his duties in the Senate, where he is chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee. He left the hospital in a car driven by his wife, Jill,
and accompanied by his 6-year-old daughter, Ashley, and his mother,
Jean.
   ``There is no reason why I cannot resume all of my Senate duties
with the same vigor that I have before,'' Biden said, noting that
he routinely worked 15-to-18-hour days in the past.
   ``I feel like I could go back now, but they (doctors) won't let
me ... until I build up my strength,'' Biden said. He said he hoped
to resume his schedule in the Senate ``between now and September,
but it's kind of hard to tell.''
   Biden said he had generally followed developments in the
Judiciary Foreign Relations committees, although he had not kept up
with the day-to-day events.
   To gain strength, Biden said he follows a regimen that includes
lifting weights and riding a stationary bicycle. He plans to return
to the hospital in about a month for a checkup.
   Peter Esker, a spokesman at Walter Reed, said a team of
neurological surgeons, headed by Dr. Eugene George, is ``extremely
pleased'' with Biden's progress. ``His overall health is
excellent,'' he said.
   Doctors have found no additional aneurysm or ``other problems
that would interfere with his complete recovery.''
   Biden, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last
September, first underwent surgery on Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm
in an artery supplying blood to the left side of his brain.
   At that time, doctors discovered _ but were unable to fix _ a
second, smaller aneurysm in an artery on the right side of the
brain. Doctors repaired the second aneurysm during a 4 1@2 hour
operation on May 3.
   An aneurysm is a weakened area in an artery. The pressure of
blood causes the area to balloon, forming a blister-like flaw on
the side of the artery.
   To correct the problem, doctors perform microscopic surgery,
inserting a metal clip into the head that locks at the base of the
flaw. The clip remains in the head.
   Further complicating Biden's recovery was a blood clot that
doctors found in his lung on March 13. The clot was absorbed into
the body without any damage, but to prevent further problems
doctors inserted a tiny filter into a major vein to prevent other
clots from reaching the lungs.
   Biden said he never feared for his life, despite the severity of
the operations, particularly the first one in which he said doctors
told him his changes of surviving were a ``little better than
even.''
   The odds improved dramatically for operation on the second
aneurysm, with only about a 1 percent change of dying, he said.
   Biden said he planned to seek re-election to the Senate in 1990.
   Asked whether he thought Attorney General Edwin Meese III should
resign, Biden said he was one of the few people who argued
strenuously against Meese's appointment from the start. ``I stand
by my remarks,'' he said.
   Meese has been criticized for a number of actions, including his
association with E. Bob Wallach, a lawyer indicted in the Wedtech
case.

   Cuba's Civil Defense denied that a major
earthquake hit the eastern provinces of Santiago and Cienfuegos on
Saturday, the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said.
   There was, however, an earthquake in Santiago, Chile, that
caused no injury or damage.
   ``The only thing that is taking place in Santiago de Cuba are
the Meteoro 88 exercises, which include evacuation drills in the
event of natural disasters,'' Prensa Latina said.
   The dispatch from Havana, the Cuban capital, quoted an
unidentified spokesman from the Civil Defense general staff. The
report was monitored in Mexico City.
   Amateur radio reports monitored in Santo Domingo, the capital of
the Dominican Republic, had said that a strong earthquake hit
eastern Cuba and caused extensive damage and injury.
   Nadin Cury, director of the Civil Defense in Santo Domingo, said
radio reports indicated the eastern Cuban town of Santiago had been
severely damaged. The report was received from the Radio Club of
Santiago, the official said.
   A telephone operator at the Sierra Maestra newspaper in Santiago
said there had been no earthquake. The Cuban interest section in
Washington and the Foreign Relations office in Havana said they had
no knowledge of a quake.
   Geophysicist John Minsch at National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said there was ``no record of a quake in
Cuba in this morning's records.''
   In Santiago, Chile, a strong earthquake caused alarm but no
injuries or damage, authorities said. Minsch said it measured 5.3
on the Richter scale.
   The Seismological Institute of the University of Chile said the
quake hit at 10:28 EDT. The epicenter was off the country's central
coast, 125 miles northwest of Santiago.
   In addition, four small earthquakes rocked central Guatemala
over a period of seven hours Saturday, causing alarm among the
population but no damage or casualties, authorities reported.
Minsch had no record of that quake.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.

<HEAD>Officials Sponsor Rally to Honor Victims of Stalinist Repression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people gathered in the capital of the
Lithuanian republic Saturday for an official rally paying tribute
to those who suffered repression under dictator Josef V. Stalin,
Tass said.
   The official news agency said the rally in Vilnius honored the
``innocent victims of the violation of laws during the years of
Stalin's personality cult.'' It said the gathering drew old
Communist revolutionaries as well as people ``notorious for their
extremist actions,'' a reference to Lithuanian activists.
   The rally apparently was intended to head off unofficial
ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the deportation of
thousands of Lithuanians from their homeland to Siberia and the
northern Soviet Union.
   Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire until the 1917
Bolshevik revolution, when it gained its independence. The Soviet
military again took control of Lithuania in 1940 as a result of a
secret agreement between Stalin and German dictator Adolf Hitler.
   In February, a large police presence stifled efforts by
nationalists to mark the anniversary of the republic's declaration
of independence after World War I.
   The United States does not recognize Lithuania and the two other
republics on the northern Baltic Sea, Latvia and Estonia, as parts
of the Soviet Union.
   Lithuanian groups in the United States have announced that
activists intend to hold religious services, processions and a
rally in Vilnius on Sunday.
   They said the activities would mark the 40th anniversary of the
largest in a series of deportations from Lithuania under Stalin in
which 320,000 to 520,000 were forcibly moved to camps.

   Up to 14 people were reported killed
Saturday in gunfights between rival Moslem groups in northern
Pakistan, and a U.S. official said foreign tourists were being
evacuated from the region.
   Joanne Clifton of the U.S. Information Service said Pakistan had
promised to fly 94 tourists from the remote northern town of Gilgit
to Islamabad in a military transport plane Sunday if weather
prevented civilian flights.
   In a phone interview from Gilgit, Clifton said Pakistan
International Airlines canceled at least two flights Saturday
because of heavy cloud cover in the rugged Korakoram mountains.
   U.S. Embassy sources in Islamabad, speaking on conditon of
anonymity, said they had heard that 10 to 14 people were killed in
violence between Sunni and Shiite Moslems. Ms. Clifton said no
foreigners were reported among the victims. Pakistani officials
claimed no knowledge of the situation.
   Combined Western sources said fighting between the two groups
had been going on as long as a week, but first reports reached the
capital late Friday.
   Reports conflicted on the duration and details of the fighting.
   They indicated clashes had occurred in Gilgit's central bazaar
and several roads leading out of town.
   Pakistan's 90 million population is mainly Sunni, with an
estimated 15 percent Shiite.
   The rivals occasionally clash, but there was no word on the
cause of the latest fighting.
   Gilgit is a tourist resort 155 miles north of Islamabad.

   A 10-year-old boy, apparently despondent over a bad
report card, shot himself to death with a gun taken from his
parents' bedroom, police said.
   Omar Williams shot himself in the chest with a .357 Magnum on
Friday afternoon while his parents were shopping and his brother
and sister were outside playing, said Metro-Dade homicide Detective
Jim McDermott.
   ``It was a shock. I mean someone you have in your own class .. .
and he was so young,'' said Omar's reading teacher, Joan Ziperson.
``He was well-liked. Occasionally, he would do more than his share
of talking.''
   The boy's principal, Betty Meares, said his father came to
school that same day to pick up Omar's report card because he
apparently had failed to take it home. The May report card is only
a progress report for parents and does not determine whether a
student is passed or failed.
   McDermott said the boy's grades were ``were fairly low'' but
were not failing.
   Meares said the only previous fatality since she has been the
school's principal occurred two years ago, when a student was
killed in a traffic accident.
   ``That was terrible, but we've certainly never been through
anything like this,'' she said. The school would probably bring in
counselors to help the other children discuss the suicide, she said.

<HEAD>Sharansky Relates Episodes from His Imprisonment in New Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nathan Sharansky, the human rights activist
who was freed from the Soviet Union in February 1986 after nearly a
decade in captivity, says prison doctors once pried his mouth open
with a metal device to force-feed him during a hunger strike.
   ``The force-feeding was intended to feed my body, the torture to
save my soul,'' Sharansky writes in his new book, ``Fear No Evil.''
Excerpts were published in the May 21 edition of U.S. News & World
Report.
   Sharansky, 40, spent from 1977 until 1986 in Soviet prisons,
charged with spying and other offenses, which he denied. He was
allowed to emigrate to Israel in 1986 after his case attracted
international attention.
   In his book, Sharansky recalls how he embarked on a hunger
strike in 1982 because Soviet authorities refused to allow him to
see his family or correspond with them.
   Before they resorted to metal pincers, authorities tried a
number of methods to feed Sharansky whose weight dropped from 143
pounds to 77 pounds. Finally, they arrived with ``more reliable
methods,'' he said.
   ``The handcuffs were clicked on, and the guards held me by the
feet, head and shoulders,'' he said. ``Somebody pressed pincers on
my cheeks, and pushed down very painfully while rotating the
pincers.
   ``As soon as I opened my mouth, a metal object was inserted
between my teeth. The turning of the screw, to which two plates
were attached, began to separate the plates, which make my mouth
open wider and wider. The complicated task of introducing a tube
into my mouth had been completed.''
   The force-feeding continued for three days until prison
officials relented and allowed Sharansky to correspond with his
mother. His hunger strike lasted 110 days.
   Sharansky's book also relates other episodes from his
imprisonment, as well as his flight to freedom in Germany.

<HEAD>Clint Eastwood Says Charlie Parker Movie Sprang from Passion for
Jazz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FIONA GLEIZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clint Eastwood, director of the new film
``Bird'' about jazz visionary Charlie Parker, said Saturday the
movie sprang from his passion for jazz and for Parker's music.
   Eastwood, although better known as an actor, has directed 13
films.
   ``I first heard him when I was a teen-ager living in Oakland,''
Eastwood, 58, told a news conference. ``It was a mad image that
stayed in my mind for many years.''
   The film, shown Saturday as part of the 41st Cannes Film
Festival, describes Parker's dependence on drugs and alcohol.
   It is based largely on a book by Parker's widow Chan, ``Life in
E-Flat.'' Many of the film's sequences are shown from her point of
view.
   ``She helped me a great deal,'' said Diane Venora, who plays
Chan in the film. ``She explained how life with him degenerated.''
   Parker got the nickname ``Yardbird,'' later shortened to
``Bird,'' at the Reno Club in Kansas City.
   Too young to gain entry, he would hang around outside, trying to
hear the music of Count Basie. Basie's musicians compared him to a
chicken, always hanging around in the yard. The name stuck.
   ``We didn't cover much of his early life though,'' said
Eastwood, ``because that's another story.''
   Forest Whitaker, who appeared in Oliver Stone's ``Platoon'' and
``The Color of Money'' by Martin Scorsese plays the adult Parker.
   The composer and musical director of ``Bird,'' Lennie Niehaus,
taught Whitaker to play the saxophone.
   For the soundtrack, Niehaus used original Parker recordings with
new orchestrations.

<HEAD>Police Sweeps Having Subtle Effect, But Gang Czar Says It Takes
Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police sweeps of gang-infested neighborhoods
seem to have lowered dramatically the number of ``drive-by''
shootings this spring, even though most of those arrested have
quickly been released, officials say.
   Authorities concede that many of the 1,456 people nabbed during
last month's sweeps were back in their neighborhoods within days.
But they insist there are indications the streets are being retaken
by officers.
   While the news media focus on almost nightly gang violence,
often involving innocent victims, Deputy Chief Robert Rathburn
notes the drop in ``drive-by'' shootings since his task force
roundups began.
   ``We have been averaging 26 drive-bys a month in 77th Division
(a South Central gang hotbed) and we only had seven in April and
two so far this month,'' Rathburn said last week.
   His task force was applauded by Vice President George Bush, who
observed, ``You're up against the rotten little cowards who shoot
innocent people.''
   Rathburn, the city's gang czar, defended last month's highly
publicized sweeps, which involved 1,000 officers.
   ``I think there has been a reduction in gang violence since the
sweeps began,'' Rathburn said. ``The task force is having an
effect. I'm optimistic that things are going in the right
direction.''
   Civil libertarians have raised questions.
   Attorney R. Samuel Paz, chairman of the Hispanic Advisory
Council to the Police Commission and a local American Civil
Liberties Union chapter board member, said the sweeps remind him of
the ``zoot suit'' roundups of the 1940s, when Hispanics were
singled out for arrest primarily because of their clothing.
   ``People are willing to say, `Let them stop all the kids.'
That's my real concern,'' he said. ``That could be my kid.''
   Raymond Johnson, branch president of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, has urged police to keep
civil liberties in mind and not take in people based on hunches or
for minor offenses that would normally go unpunished.
   ``Make good arrests. Don't use excessive force,'' he said at a
news conference.
   Police couldn't determine how many were of the 1,456 arrested in
the huge gang sweeps of April 8 and 9 were still in jail because
``we don't have a system that could track that down,'' said Capt.
Dennis Conte. Spokesmen for the district attorney and city attorney
also said those arrests weren't ``flagged'' and there's no easy way
to trace the cases.
   But the Police Department did study a sampling of 276 of the
1,456 arrests and found that 79 were felony arrests and the rest
were for traffic-related misdemeanors and lesser crimes, Conte said.
   Of the 79 felony arrests, prosecutors ultimately brought felony
charges in 24 cases, including charges such as murder, assault,
rape and armed robbery, said Conte. Sixteen others in that group of
79 eventually were charged with misdemeanors, he said.
   Seventy-one percent of the 197 arrested for misdemeanors,
meanwhile, were eventually charged with misdemeanor crimes, Conte
said, adding that many of those were released on the Monday
following their weekend arrest.
   Conte explained how most of the arrested street thugs are
quickly back on the streets.
   ``It is the policy of the city attorney's office that if they
stay in jail for the weekend and it comes to arraignment on Monday
and the penalty is three days, they won't file and they are
released on time served,'' Conte said.
   Officers estimated initially that about half those arrested in
the sweep were affiliated with gangs.
   Rathburn said eradication of street thugs may take years. ``The
problem didn't develop overnight and it's not going to be solved
overnight,'' he said.
   ``The big sweeps serve a number a purposes: It shows the gangs
we are committed to the battle and, more importantly, it shows the
community we are there, too, that it's not just a public relations
show,'' Rathburn said.
   Taking aim at known gang leaders is another police tactic.
   ``Day in and day out, we are being more selective in removing
the hard core gang leadership from the streets. We are going to see
the gangs collapse from lack of leadership,'' Rathburn said.
   Asked if the streets have become safer since the police sweeps,
Rathburn said: ``It's hard to gauge. The important thing in the
long term is affecting the perception of residents.
   ``People live in fear in South Central Los Angeles. I want to
change that fear, transfer it from the resident to the criminal.''

<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old boy afflicted with a rare
disease that makes his arteries resemble those of a 70-year-old is
recovering well from quadruple heart bypass surgery, doctors said.
   Gilbert Bowers underwent the operation at Memorial Hospital here
May 13 after suffering a massive heart attack while playing
basketball. Doctors, who disclosed details of the case Friday, say
that they know of no patient younger to have had that type of
operation.
   ``It's OK, really,'' said Gilbert. ``I didn't know I was the
youngest. I never thought about it.'' Doctors say he should
eventually be able to resume playing basketball, he said.
   In bypass surgery, blood vessels from elsewhere in the body are
grafted around the blood vessels leading to the heart to get around
blockages. Doctors said the boy would have died without the
operation.
   ``To the best of our knowledge ... we have searched around and
not found anyone of this age to have this kind of surgery,'' said
Dr. Silvio Sperber, a cardiologist at Memorial. ``This is a very
rare case.''
   The 7{-hour operation, however, was only a stopgap measure to
cure a rare disease that Gilbert was born with, which robs his body
of its ability to rid itself of cholesterol. Within a couple of
years, Gilbert will need a liver transplant, doctors said.
   The genetic disease, called hypercholesterolemia familial, is
found in about one in a million people, doctors said.
   The cholesterol has clogged Gilbert's arteries to the point
where they could easily be mistaken for those of a 70-year-old man,
doctors said. He had been under treatment for the problem
previously but doctors didn't realize the extent of it.
   ``All he can do is accumulate cholesterol,'' Sperber said. ``The
heart itself is that of a 14-year-old. It's the fuel lines that run
into the heart that are clogged.''

   The English bull terrier popularized as
``Spuds The Party Animal'' in Budweiser beer commercials should not
be allowed in a Portland parade because he glamorizes alcohol, says
a leader of an anti-drug group.
   ``They have spent millions of dollars to come up with the magic
advertisement,'' said Lynn Coonrod, executive director of
development for the Oregon Federation for Drug Free Youth. ``It's
not the right message.''
   The dog is depicted in television commercials and advertisements
as a hit with attractive women at beer parties.
   Coonrod said Friday that a letter-writing and
signature-gathering campaign is under way in hopes of convincing
the Portland Rose Festival Association to ban the dog from its
Starlight Parade.
   ``What does Spuds represent?'' Coonrod asked. ``Drinking.''
   Gene Leo, executive manager of the festival association, said
Spuds will remain in the June 4 parade.
   ``A lot of people have told me that Spuds and underage drinking
is not an automatic correlation,'' Leo said. He added that no one
has objected to the Anheuser Busch-Budweiser Clydesdale horse team
appearing in the parade.
   Stephen Lambright, vice president and group executive of
Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. of St. Louis, issued a statement
saying, ``Spuds MacKenzie is designed to sell beer only to those
above the minimum legal age of consumption.''

<TEXT>
   A Puerto Rican separatist accused of
masterminding the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo depot has
been released on $1 million bail after being held for 32 months in
pretrial detention.
   Filiberto Ojeda Rios, alleged to have helped plan the September
1983 robbery in order to finance a violent separatist movement in
Puerto Rico, was allowed to leave prison Friday after a federal
judge certified that title to three pieces of real estate on the
island was being transferred to the government, securing his bail.
   ``I have read it. I understand it. I agree to it voluntarily,''
Ojeda said of the terms of his release. A packed gallery burst into
applause as he was pronounced free.
   ``It's good to breathe fresh air,'' he said moments later
outside the courthouse, holding a full-sized Puerto Rican flag in
front of him while family and friends waved smaller plastic
versions of the flag behind him. ``I think it's a victory of the
people.''
   While awaiting trial with 15 other defendants, Ojeda must wear
an electronic ankle bracelet that authorities will use to monitor
his movements. He will live in a Hartford apartment, and won't be
able to leave the city.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie set Ojeda's trial date for
Sept. 6. Pre-trial hearings began in January 1987. Asked outside
the courthouse if he planned to appear for the trial, Ojeda said,
``I do.''
   But, he said, ``I do not recognize the jurisdiction of the court
and principles will be my line of guidance for future conduct.
Principles, honor and particularly the honor of my people and my
country are the elements that will serve as guidance as to whatever
action I take in the future.''
   Authorities allege that the 55-year-old Ojeda is a Cuban agent
who helped mastermind the robbery of the Wells Fargo depot in West
Hartford to finance activities of Los Macheteros, a violent group
seeking Puerto Rican independence.
   Other Wells Fargo defendants are free on bonds ranging as high
as $1.5 million. Clarie had previously denied bond for Ojeda five
times. Prosecutors contend Ojeda is a risk to flee the country.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York last week
ordered that bond be set and that Ojeda be released, further
detention would violate his constitutional rights.

   Communist Party authorities on Saturday fired the
leaders of the southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan in an
apparent effort to prevent more of the ethnic turmoil that has
killed at least 32 people this year.
   The official Tass news agency said Karen Demirchyan, first
secretary of Armenia's Communist Party, was ousted during a meeting
of his republic's Central Committee in the capital city of Yerevan.
   Azerbaijani party First Secretary Kyamran Bagirov was fired
during a meeting in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, Tass said.
   Both meetings were attended by Politburo officials in charge of
party organization, ideology and propaganda, a sign of Moscow's
concern about events in the two southern republics and its direct
involvement in the changes.
   The Kremlin's No. 2 man, Yegor K. Ligachev, addressed the Baku
meeting. Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, party propaganda
chief and a key adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
spoke to the meeting in Yerevan. Tass gave no details about what
either man said.
   Tass said Demirchyan and Bagirov were retired for health
reasons. But their replacement likely reflected dissatisfaction in
Moscow with their failure to contain the dispute over control of
the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   Armenians are demanding that the Armenian-dominated region be
annexed to their republic.
   After a period of quiet following riots in the Azerbaijani city
of Sumgait in which at least 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were
killed, mass meetings were reported again last week by Armenian
activists and the official Baku radio.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said Thursday that there was a
``constant danger of an explosion'' in Nagorno-Karabakh and that
the region was surrounded by soldiers.
   Bagirov, 55, was replaced in the job he had held since 1982 by
58-year-old Abdul Rahman Vezirov, the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan.
   The 56-year-old Demirchyan, who had been Communist Party leader
since November 1974, was replaced by 49-year-old Suren Arutyunyan,
Armenia's first deputy prime minister.
   Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants, who is half Armenian
and has followed events there closely, said Armenians despised and
distrusted Demirchyan for corruption.
   ``The party must have someone who can command at least a minimum
of trust. That's the only way to quiet Armenia,'' Grigoryants said
in a telephone interview from his Moscow home.
   Telephone calls to the official media and activist sources in
Armenia and Azerbaijan either did not go through or went unanswered
Saturday.
   Grigoryants said the firing of Bagirov also indicated that
Communist authorities recognized they could not control the unrest
until he was removed.
   Armenians have accused Azerbaijani leaders of encouraging the
rioting in Sumgait. Selection of a diplomat to be party leader
indicated a deep distrust by Moscow of officials in Baku.
   The rioting in Sumgait began Feb. 28, about two weeks after
massive demonstrations in Yerevan and in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Nagorno-Karabakh was joined to Azerbaijan in 1923, in the early
days of Soviet power.
   Central authorities in February rejected Armenia's demands to
change jurisdiction over the region. Instead they announced a
longterm program of social and economic development for the region.
   The first of more than 80 people brought to trial in the Sumgait
riots, Azerbaijani metalworker Talekh Salekh Ogli Ismailov, was
found guilty Monday of murder and sentenced to the maximum 15 years
in prison.
   Armenian sources said 150,000 people gathered in Yerevan Tuesday
to stress that such convictions were not a solution to the area's
ethnic problems.
   About 30 Armenians gathered across the street from the Soviet
Supreme Court in Moscow on Friday to demand the trial of the other
suspects in the rioting be open to Armenian observers and broadcast
on television.
   Gorbachev had singled out Demirchyan for personal criticism for
the republic's poor economic performance.
   Tass said Vezirov, the new Azerbaijani party leader, graduated
from an industrial institute and worked in the republic's Young
Communist League from 1951 to 1970. He was involved in other party
work until 1976, when he entered the diplomatic service.
   He was consul-general in Calcutta, India, ambassador in Nepal
and then in Pakistan.
   Arutyunyan graduated from a veterinary school and joined the
Communist Party at the age of 22, Tass said.
   He graduated from the V.I. Lenin military-political academy in
Moscow and obtained a degree in philosophy, it said.
   Arutyunyan was a secretary of the Young Communist organization
and began working in the Communist Party Central Committee in 1978.

<HEAD>Conrail Engineer to Plead Guilty on Federal Obstruction Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Conrail engineer who was at the
controls of a train involved in the worst crash in Amtrak history
has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of conspiring to obstruct
investigation of the crash, his lawyer says.
   Fred Warren Bennett, a federal public defender, said Friday that
former engineer Ricky Gates would plead guilty in exchange for the
dropping of three other federal charges against him.
   Sixteen people were killed and 175 injured Jan. 4, 1987, when
Gates ran a string of Conrail locomotives past a signal and into
the path of a speeding Amtrak passenger train near Chase.
   As part of the plea bargain reached about 10 days earlier,
Bennett said, federal prosecutors would recommend that Gates
receive a five-year sentence to be served consecutively to his
five-year sentence on state charges for manslaughter by locomotive.
   He could have been fined $250,000 on the federal charge as well.
   Gates, 34, and brakeman Edward Cromwell were accused of lying to
National Transportation Safety Board investigators and denying that
they had smoked marijuana while operating the train. The indictment
says Gates also lied about having tested cab signals to make sure
they were in working order.
   He had been scheduled for trial beginning June 13 on the federal
charges. He was indicted March 31, two days after he received the
five-year state sentence and a $1,000 fine.
   Gates is scheduled to plead guilty at his rearraignment
Wednesday morning before U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsey in
Baltimore.
   Cromwell received state and federal immunity for his testimony.

   A nude woman walking along a road caused two
distracted drivers to crash Saturday, then took off in the
ambulance that came to their aid and drove the wrong way on a
freeway until she hit a bread truck, police said.
   No one was seriously hurt in the accidents that began about
dawn, said Lt. Dave Waterman.
   Paramedics who came to the scene of the first accident found a
nude woman lying in the street. They put her in the ambulance, and
when they went to check on the men, she drove off in the vehicle,
authorities said.
   Valerie Morales, 27, of Los Angeles was arrested by a passing
Los Angeles County sheriff's unit after the ambulance, heading
northbound in the southbound lanes of the Glendale Freeway, ran
into a bread truck, Waterman said.
   Ms. Morales was booked for investigation of felony drunken
driving and driving without the owner's consent.

   A teen-age couple doffed their clothes
to go for a swim were stranded for nearly six hours alongside a
flooded creek when rising water forced them from their car,
authorities said Saturday.
   Rescuers finally reached the teen-agers, who had taken shelter
in some trees atop a mound, and brought them to safety, said Steve
Allen, director of the Berkeley County Office of Emergency
Services. The couple was unhurt.
   The two were naked except for a water-soaked blanket the girl
had wrapped around herself, said Friendship Fire Chief Alvin
``Bud'' Manuel.
   ``He said they were going to swim,'' Manuel said. ``I didn't
even see their clothes.''
   The teen-agers, who were not identified, were trapped near
Opequon Creek early Friday when water from the swollen stream
started seeping into their car, which was parked on a dirt mound,
Allen said. They left the car and climbed to higher ground.
   A rescue helicopter was dispatched but was ordered to return
because of water and weather conditions, Allen said. Members of the
Friendship Fire Co. water rescue unit of Harpers Ferry finally
reached the couple, Allen said.
   Manuel said he guessed the girl to be in her early teens and the
boy to be ``17 or 18.''

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Journalist Denies Infiltrating CIA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A journalist who Nicaraguan
authorities said infiltrated the CIA denied being a paid spy for
the Sandinista government or infiltrating the U.S. agency, the
newspaper Barricada reported Saturday.
   The newspaper also quoted the Interior Ministry as saying that
it wanted to clarify that the journalist ``undertook relations of
cooperation with intelligence organisms of the Nicaraguan
government but was not an agent for them and was not infiltrated by
the Interior Ministry into any foreign intelligence agency.''
   The statements from the ministry and from journalist Maria
Lourdes Pallais Checa contradicted earlier statements by both.
   On Thursday, Barricada, which belongs to the ruling Sandinista
National Liberation Front, quoted Interior Minister Tomas Borge as
saying Ms. Pallais was ``a counterintelligence agent who worked in
enemy ranks.''
   ``She carried out missions in the heart of the CIA,'' Borge was
quoted as saying.
   At the time, Ms. Pallais' lawyer, Ron Kuby, said in New York:
``My client has instructed me to confirm the accuracy of Mr.
Borge's statement.''
   In an interview published Saturday, Ms. Pallais said she ``never
did become what you might call an agent within the CIA, but only a
collaborator of the Nicaraguan government during a period that
cultiminated towards the end of 1985.''
   Kuby said Saturday's article was meant to clarify that Ms.
Pallais was not ``a hired gun, working for profit for Nicaraguan
intelligence.''
   Kuby said initial reports in the American press implied that Ms.
Pallais was a full-fledged Sandinista agent.
   ``That was not the case,'' he said. ``She was never paid by the
Sandinistas or the CIA, but she worked with Sandinista intelligence
against the CIA.''
   Kuby said he spoke with Ms. Pallais on Saturday morning and said
she told him the purpose of the Barricada article was to show that
she had never been a paid agent.
   Ms. Pallais, a graduate from Columbia University in New York, is
a niece of the late Anastasio Somoza, the Nicaraguan dictator
overthrown by the Sandinistas in July 1979.
   She worked for The Associated Press in New York from August 1978
until November 1979, first on the editing desk of the Latin
American service and then in the New York City bureau.
   Her brother Marcel, a supporter of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, was killed by Somoza loyalists in October 1979.
Ms. Pallais resigned from the AP in 1979, saying she wanted to
investigate her brother's death and help care for her ailing mother.
   The Sandinista victory in July 1979 ended 42 years of rule in
Nicaragua by the rightist, pro-American Somoza family.
   Kuby said Ms. Pallais is currently writing a book but said he
did not know what it is about.

   A British soldier and his dog
were killed Saturday by a bomb that went off as they searched for
explosives near the Irish border, police said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibility, police said.
   The 28-year-old soldier was leading a search patrol for
explosives in the county of South Armagh, where a 1,400-pound IRA
bomb was discovered Thursday.
   Police said it appeared the soldier or his dog stepped on a bomb
hidden in a field about 10 yards from the road.
   The soldier was identified as Cpl. Derek Hayes.
   Five people in two passing cars sustained minor injuries in the
explosion, but police said it was not immediately clear how they
were hurt.
   Security forces are the main targets of the outlawed IRA in its
guerrilla campaign to oust the British from Northern Ireland and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mostly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
   There were no immediate details on how the IRA claimed
responsibility for the bomb.

   A millionaire's four beloved beagles got
more than scraps and bones in the woman's will: they inherited
$75,000 to keep them in style.
   Tony, Libby, Cissy and Christina belonged to Rebecca Knight, who
died May 12 at the age of 82.
   ``They were like her children,'' Barney West III, Mrs. Knight's
great-nephew, told the News and Observer of Raleigh last week.
``She would cook for them and take extraordinary care of them. I've
heard of fish dinners they would have together _ maybe not shrimp
and lobster _ but as I said, they were her children.''
   Mrs. Knight treated the dogs to Sunday drives in her
mint-condition Volkswagen Beetle. She shopped at farmers markets,
seeking out the best apples and strawberries for the pups.
   The will set aside $75,000 of Mrs. Knight's $2.1 million estate
for two of her friends, William and Elizabeth Davis of Creedmoor,
to care for the animals.
   The will says the couple should use the money for a permanent
addition to their home for the dogs to occupy. Besides the room,
the will calls for an outdoor exercise area and a screened porch
where the dogs can enjoy the sun.
   The Davises haven't started building the new digs yet, but plans
are under way.
   ``We turned a bedroom into a temporary place for them,'' Mrs.
Davis said, ``and we're going to cut a doggy door in the side of
the wall so they can get out and exercise. We're still talking to
contractors, though, about what needs to be built.''

   It may sound like udder bull, but a dairy
specialist says a computer dating service that matches compatible
bovines can yield a herd that's the cream of the crop.
   Michael Tomaszewski, a dairy expert with the Texas Agriculture
Extension Service in Dallas, developed the program called Herdmate.
   Any farmer who has a personal computer can use it to match cows
with bulls to improve a dairy herd, Tomaszewski told the Dallas
Times Herald last week.
   Tomaszewski says his purpose is not to bring romance to the
bovines, but to help dairy farmers produce the best offspring they
can.
   For instance a farmer owning a cow with a particular weak trait
can find a bull with a strong, offsetting characteristic by using
Herdmate to locate available mates, he said.
   The software program debuted in late 1986 after development by
Tomaszewski and other agricultural specialists. This year ``there's
been more interest than in the past,'' he said.
   Next in the evolution of Tomaszewski's service will be Version
2, he says. It will allow farmers to scrutinize bulls even more
than now.
   ``Just like a stockbroker will analyze a portfolio of stocks,
farmers will be able to do the same thing with bulls,'' he says.

   Ever since a bingo game opened two weeks ago in
downtown Dallas during the lunch hour, it has attracted a full
house of almost 200 people a day.
   Circus Bingo, with eight daily games between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30
p.m. and prizes ranging from $25 to $500, caters to a downtown
lunchtime crowd more willing to spend $5 trying their luck with
bingo than grabbing a burger.
   ``People are looking for a different activity to do during their
lunch break. A lot of people enjoy bingo because it gives them
something fun to do and at the same time it can win them money,''
manager Kurt Prather said.
   A second-floor room for non-smokers is scheduled to open up next
week, he said.
   Christopher Exline sat hunched over the bingo table Thursday,
tie askew, suit jacket slung over the back of his chair, briefcase
at his feet.
   ``When you're in commercial real estate in this market, any
chance you have to make $500 is great,'' he said, adjusting his
horn-rimmed glasses.

<TEXT>
   The Dallas Morning News and The Dallas Times
Herald have settled their lawsuits accusing each other of
fraudulent circulation practices.
   The suits, filed in 1986, were to have been heard in December of
this year in federal court in Chicago.
   The Times Herald sued first, charging its larger competitor with
padding its paid circulation figures and intimidating newspaper
distributors. The Morning News responded with a similar suit a
month later.
   Details of the settlement announced Friday were not released.
   The Times Herald's suit was sparked by the latest circulation
figures released through the Audit Bureau of Circulations, an
Illinois-based agency that audits newspaper circulation.
Advertising rates are based on circulation.
   According to those figures, for the six-month period ending
Sept. 30, 1986, the Times Herald's daily paid circulation was
246,370 and The Morning News' was 390,987. On Sunday, the Times
Herald's reported paid circulation was 338,963, and the Morning
News reported 531,417.
   The Times Herald's suit also alleged the ABC knowingly released
false circulation numbers for the Morning News, a charge the News
and audit bureau denied.
   ``We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this matter,''
said William Dean Singleton, chairman of MediaNews Group, owner of
the Times Herald. ``We think that the three parties have arrived at
an imaginative solution to our disagreement. We now look forward to
the final audit results.''
   ``We're obviously pleased, but that's really all I'm going to
say,'' said Burl Osborne, president and editor of the Morning News.

   Ana Aslan, the Romanian scientist who
developed a treatment that held out the vision of restored youth,
has died, Romania's official Agerpres news agency reported
Saturday. She was 91.
   The report monitored in Vienna said Ms. Aslan died Friday in the
Romanian capital of Bucharest. It did not give the cause of death.
   ``Romanian medical research experiences a great loss,'' the
report said.
   Ms. Aslan was the inventor of a treatment for biological and
psychic regeneration. She was dubbed ``Lady Gerovital'' after the
drug she patented. Ms. Aslan believed that old age must be fought
like a disease and that drugs can lengthen the life span and even
bring new vitality.
   A member of the Academy of Sciences of New York, she devised the
``Gerovital H-3'' treatment, which was reported to have favorable
results in a wide range of symptoms, from tightening skin to
reactivating brain functions and repigmentation of hair.
   Wealthy foreigners were among the callers at her Institute of
Geriatrics near Bucharest.
   Despite some skeptics in the medical world, Western
pharmaceutical companies are competing on a vast market with
``youth pills'' claimed to be based on her research.
   Hundreds of thousands of people have received the treatment in
Romania and abroad. Romanian doctors said among them were former
Chinese leaders Mao Tse-tung, former French president Charles de
Gaulle and comic genius Charlie Chaplin.
   The cures of Ms. Aslan have brought Communist Romania millions
of dollars.
   ``People do not live long enough,'' she once said. ``All of us
ought to be able to live at least 100 years.''
   The report did not mention survivors or funeral arrangements.

<TEXT>
   The Swiss Supreme Court on Saturday
announced it has ordered a Swiss bank to allow investigators to
examine the bank account records of former Philippine President
Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   The court, in a ruling made May 16, denied a request filed by
the Credit Suisse in March to bar Swiss investigators from
examining the records.
   The ruling was made to give Swiss judicial authorities the
possibility of locating any funds that might have been embezzled by
the ousted leader or his family, according to Justice Minstry
spokesman Joerg Kistler.
   The government of Philippine President Corazon Aquino has
accused the Marcos family of corruption, fraud, embezzlement and
other offenses and has asked Switzerland to help it recover funds
deposited in Swiss accounts.
   But the ruling does not mean that Credit Suisse must return the
Marcos fortune to Philippine authorities, Kistler said. He said a
request by the Aquino administration for a return of the money was
still blocked by appeals and that the accounts have been frozen.
   The Manila government has estimated that $1 billion of the
deposed leader's money was in Swiss banks, most of it in Credit
Suisse, but Swiss bankers have said the amount is exaggerated.

   An Austrian soldier of the U.N. force in
Cyprus killed a Turkish Cypriot in the village of Pyla on Saturday
in the first fatal shootout involving the peacekeepers since their
arrival on the island 24 years ago.
   Cyprus television said the Turkish Cypriot man, Hussein Kafa,
shot and wounded the Austrian soldier. The peacekeeper fired back
three pistol shots, killing Kafa, who was in his 60s.
   The Austrian soldier, who was not identified, was rushed to
Larnaca Hospital, three miles from Pyla.
   Pyla, 15 miles southeast of Nicosia, is the only village where
Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots still live together despite the
14-year-old partition of the island.
   The state-run television said Pyla was tense after the incident
and that Turkish Cypriots armed with handguns, including Kafa's
30-year-old son Saleh, were ``threatening'' the Austrian post.
   The elder Kafa, the state-run television reported, crossed into
the U.N. force's zone of operations in the village, claiming he
wanted to mend a wall surrounding his farm. When two Austrian
soldiers ordered him out of the buffer zone, he drew a pistol and
fired at one of them.
   U.N. spokesman Charles Gaulkin confirmed an Austrian soldier was
wounded in a shootout in Pyla, but said he had no information about
the circumstances and could not identify the wounded soldier.
   The eight-nation, 2,300-strong U.N. force in Cyprus known as
UNFICYP has been in Cyprus since 1964. The Austrian contingent has
300 men.
   The other countries that contribute to UNFICYP are Denmark,
Britain, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Finland and Ireland.
   The U.N. force runs 143 observation posts along a 112-mile
``Green Line'' that has divided the island since Turkish troops
invaded the northern third in 1974 in the wake of an abortive Greek
Cypriot coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   Pyla, with a population of 750 Greek Cypriots and 350 Turkish
Cypriots, has been an attraction for tourists who crowd its fish
tavern at weekends.
   Officials said that in March the elder Kafa kidnapped a Greek
Cypriot waiter and his Maltese girlfriend and rammed his minibus
into a number of Greek-owned cars because the Greek-Cypriot police
took his son, Saleh, into custody.
   The waiter and his girlfriend were rescued by a British patrol
while being driven through the nearby British base of Dhekelia on
the Turkish side of the Green Line.
   Saleh Kafa had been charged with contempt of court for refusing
to demolish a shop he had built in the village, police said. He was
later released.

   The crew of a Chinese jetliner hijacked to
Taiwan this month has urged the Nationalist government to send the
hijackers back to China for trial or punish them harshly, an
official report said Saturday.
   Yang Yongling, pilot of the Boeing 737, said the hijackers
placed a knife to his neck and pointed a gun at his forehead,
according to a report by the official China News Agency. The report
appeared in Hong Kong newspapers Saturday.
   The pilot was quoted as saying at a news conference in the
Chinese city of Xiamen that the two men threatened to kill anyone
who moved without permission during the hijacking.
   Chinese air force radar operators Chang Ching-kuo and Lung
Kuei-yun used a toy gun and fake explosives to commandeer the plane
to Taiwan on May 12. Taiwan authorities sent the plane back to
China about five hours after it landed.
   The two were granted political asylum by Taiwan's Nationalist
government but still could face prosecution in the hijacking.
   At a preliminary court hearing Thursday in the capital of
Taipei, the hijackers' lawyers quoted Chang and Lung as saying they
did not threaten or use force against the pilot, who they said
sympathized with them and agreed to divert the plane to Taiwan,
according to China News.
   It was the first hijacking of a Chinese plane to Taiwan, the
seat of the Nationalist government, which claims to have the sole
right to rule China.
   The two men are under custody pending a second hearing on an
unspecified date.

   A crowd of 1,000, some shouting profanities
or holding anti-racism signs, greeted about 40 people dressed in Ku
Klux Klan robes Saturday as they marched along a court-sanctioned
route flanked by rows of police.
   At least six people were arrested, some led away in handcuffs
after minor scuffles including one in which an officer was knocked
to the ground. Most in the largely white crowd limited their
protests to shouting, but some threw bottles and other objects.
   Police estimated the crowd at 750 to 1,000 people, but said it
may have been larger. The militant Jewish Defense League, which had
promised to show up with guns, did not make a show of force, but
authorities said the group was represented.
   A row of six officers on horseback led the marchers about five
blocks up and down state Route 352, the main street in this
112-acre borough of about 2,500 residents, while a police
helicopter hovered overhead.
   ``We Shall Overcome. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,'' read a sign
carried by a marcher.
   John Weiss of Philadelphia, who identified himself as a Klan
spokesman, said the Klan simply wanted to march on Armed Forces Day
``because we've got a lot of veterans in the organization.''
   One woman bolted from the sidewalk and ripped the hood off a
marcher. Police quickly wrestled her to the ground and led her away
in handcuffs. Another woman who became involved was also
handcuffed, and an officer was knocked to the ground in the scuffle.
   About a block away, two men were detained after mounted police
helped quell an incident.
   Unspecified charges were being filed against the six arrested,
Parkside Borough Council President Samuel Iannucci said. The only
one immediately identified was George Snider, who had made the
Klan's request to borough council for a parade permit. No
circumstances of his arrest were released.
   Police far outnumbered Klan marchers, with some 150 from
Delaware County communities and 95 officers from the state police.
   After the march, as Klan members prepared to leave the shopping
center parking lot where they had gathered, in the adjoining
borough of Brookhaven, some in the crowd behind police lines broke
into a chant of ``Send the cops home.'' One sign read, ``Just Say
No to Racism.''
   Brookhaven Police Chief John Eller said the only disturbance at
the shopping center was some rock-throwing right before Klan
members left. Some rocks hit store employees' cars but no Klan
targets, he said. No arrests were made.
   The march was staged according to the terms of an agreement
approved Thursday in federal court in Philadelphia after a borough
ordinance designed to stop the march had been overturned on
constitutional grounds.
   Gregory Watson of nearby Chester was one of relatively few
blacks in the crowd at the shopping center. ``I always heard about
hatred with the KKK,'' he said. ``I wanted to see hatred eye to
eye. ... I'm surprised more blacks aren't showing up.''

<HEAD>Three Injured In Shell Attack in South Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola said Saturday that a South
African artillery shell exploded near a vehicle carrying visiting
journalists and injured three people, including a reporter from the
Reuters news agency.
   But an account by Reuters correspondent Pascal Fletcher made no
mention of injuries to him and said he and visiting journalists
narrowly escaped flying shrapnel. Fletcher's report said three
Angolan soldiers and a civilian official were injured.
   The report by the official Angolan news agency ANGOP, monitored
in Lisbon, said the attack came Thursday near the besieged southern
Angolan town of Cuito Cuanavale. A separate ANGOP report said four
rebels were killed in fighting Saturday in the central city of
Huambo.
   ANGOP said Fletcher and an unidentified Angolan journalist were
hit by shrapnel from a 155mm shell that exploded 60 yards from an
armored personnel carrier transporting the visiting journalists.
   The agency quoted the Saturday edition of the government-run
Jornal de Angola as saying an Angolan soldier was seriously wounded
by the same shell.
   However, Fletcher filed a report from Angola on Friday saying he
and a group of foreign journalists narrowly escaped from two
exploding shells, Reuters said.
   Fletcher's report said four people were injured by shrapnel,
including a soldier beside him in the vehicle.
   The correspondent was in the Angolan capital, Luanda, continuing
his assignment Saturday, the Lisbon bureau of the British news
agency said.
   The ANGOP report gave no further details on the attack.
   Fletcher is based in Lusaka, Zambia and has visited Angola
several times to report on the country's 13-year civil war.
   Cuito Cuanavale, 190 miles north of Angola's border with South
African-administered Namibia, has been under siege since September
by South Africa and forces of the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   Cuito Cuanavale is a staging post for government offensives
against the Angolan guerrillas.
   ANGOP reported security forces killed four UNITA guerrillas and
wounded several others in a shootout Saturday in Huambo, foiling an
attempt to sabotage installations of the Benguela railroad.
   The report said four pounds of explosives, seven mortar shells,
detonators and other arms were captured from the rebels.
   Angola, South Africa and Cuba, are trying to reach an agreement
on ending the war in Angola and granting independence to
neighboring Namibia, also known as South-West Africa. The talks are
supported by the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The rebels are fighting to force the Marxist Angolan government
to share power. More than 40,000 Cuban soldiers back the government
forces.
   Angola says 9,000 South African troops are in Angola, but South
Africa says no more than 3,000 troops have been in the country at
one time since it entered the country last year.

   Prime Minister Olof Palme wrote that
``extremists are hounding me and other Social Democrats'' two days
before he was assassinated on a downtown street, a newspaper said
Saturday.
   The letter, dated Feb. 26, 1986, is believed to be the last that
Palme wrote. It was published in full in the Stockholm newspaper
Aftonbladet.
   Palme was replying to a socialist woman in southern Sweden who
felt persecuted by a small local extreme rightist group.
   He told her, ``Personally, I am not unused to being persecuted
by various extremist groups, and I do not care about it.''
   Palme was shot from behind and killed while walking home with
his wife from a movie in downtown Stockholm.
   Authorities have investigated many leads, including the
possibility of an extremist conspiracy, but no one has been charged
in the slaying.

   Dutch Crown Prince Willem Alexander
drove his car into a canal Saturday but escaped uninjured, Dutch
television reported.
   The 21-year-old heir to the Dutch throne, who is a history
student here, apparently lost control over his automobile as he was
approaching a road construction site, according to the television
report.
   The car ran over a grass embankment and into the 12-foot wide
canal, the report said. Willem Alexander climbed out, reached the
shore and reported immediately to a first aid post, the report said.
   It gave no further details of the accident.
   Police said the car was not completely covered by water.

   A second Soviet military unit withdrawing from
Afghanistan arrived back in the border town of Termez on Saturday,
the Tass news agency said.
   Local officials, youth delegations, friends and relatives
greeted the convoy of rifle troops as they arrived in the border
town of Termez in the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, the official
news agency said.
   The troops continued on to an unspecified base after resting
briefly. Tass did not say how many soldiers were in the unit nor
where they had been based in Aghanistan.
   The Soviets are pulling out under an agreement signed in Geneva
on April 14.
   They entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replacing one
pro-Soviet government with another. They remained to fight rebels
backed by the United States, China, Pakistan and other countries.
   A Soviet media official confirmed for the first time Thursday
that between 12,000 and 15,000 Soviet soldiers had been killed in
the fighting in Afghanistan.
   The first 1,300 soldiers to leave, another rifle convoy, crossed
the border Wednesday. They had been stationed in the eastern city
of Jalalabad.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers have been serving in
Afghanistan, but under the Geneva agreement they must all leave
within nine months.

   Sarasota County's teacher of the year has
been charged with having five 17-year-old girls dance topless for
him in a class.
   David John Schram, 34, also faces a count of battery for holding
one of the student's breasts Feb. 9 during class at Booker High
School in Sarasota, police said.
   Schram, who has taught at Booker for 10 years and directs the
school's Visual and Performing Arts Center, refused comment Friday
as he left the Sarasota County Jail after posting $250 bail.
   In an affidavit, police Detective Terry Winkel said that during
dance and drama classes on Feb. 8 and 9, Schram instructed the five
girls ``to take off their tops.'' Schram ``then instructed the
students to dance in place while he walked around viewing their
performance.''
   A boy student also was instructed to remove his clothes above
the waist during the rehearsals. The five girls and a boy were the
only students present, Winkel said.
   Because the girls danced ``with their breasts exposed while he
watched, (Schram) committed the act of sexual performance of a
child,'' according to the warrant issued by Circuit Judge James
Parker.
   The personnel director for the Sarasota County School Board,
Walter Pierce, said detectives contacted school officials after one
of the students and her parents filed a complaint with police in
March.
   Pierce said Schram has been suspended with pay at least until
the June 7 meeting of the Sarasota County School Board.
   Schram was selected from 34 candidates as Sarasota County
Teacher of the Year for the 1987-1988 school year.

<HEAD>Illinois Bell Uses U.S. Mail To Reach Suburban Customers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Bell is using the mail to reach
thousands of customers in six western suburbs to make sure service
is back after a two-week disruption by a fire at a switching
station.
   Illinois Bell spokesman Dick Hill said that as of Saturday
almost all of the 35,000 customers who lost dial tones after the
May 8 fire have had partial service restored, although there were
still some ``spotty problems'' with about 200 to 300 lines still
not working.
   Those people should have limited service restored by the end of
the weekend.
   To make sure they didn't miss anyone, Illinois Bell officials
took the unusual step of mailing postcards Thursday to all 35,000
customers in the Hinsdale area asking those still without phone
service or with phone-related problems to contact the company.
   ``We thought this was about the fastest and ... the most
effective way we could think of to get the message out,'' Hill
said. ``The Postal Service has been very helpful, giving it special
handling. We couldn't possibly have called all 35,000 of them.''
   The service disruptions have caused millions of dollars in
business losses throughout the western suburbs.
   Hill said there were still problems restoring normal access to
long-distance lines routed through the Hinsdale switching station.
   ``There is long-distance service available, but it's not up to
the normal levels.'' Hill said normal long-distance service should
be restored to the region during the upcoming week.
   ``Now it's settling down to be a job to finish the installation
of the new switching equipment,'' he said.
   About 250 Bell employees were working around the clock through
the weekend to install new state-of-the-art switching equipment at
the Hinsdale center, Hill said.
   ``We're down to the very last ones,'' Hill said, ``but we're not
sure how many of the 35,000 lines we restored are working
properly.''

<HEAD>Actress Ordered To Jail For Violating Paternity Case Gag Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who won a paternity suit against comedian
Jackie Mason last month was in jail Saturday for violating a gag
order, but friends contended that the comic broke the order first.
   Circuit Judge John Gale on Wednesday ordered Ginger Reiter to
serve a 30-day sentence for giving interviews to several Miami
newspapers and television stations in violation of his court order.
   Ms. Reiter, 37, an actress and playwright who also owns a
struggling striptease-telegram service, was booked into the Dade
Women's Detention Center on Thursday night.
   Her 2-year-old daughter, Sheba, was placed in the custody of the
child's maternal grandmother, Mirian Oliver, of Hallandale.
   Mason is appearing on Broadway in his hit one-man show, ``The
World According to Me!'' Ms. Reiter testified that she had had an
intermittent relationship with the star for more than a decade.
   Last month, Gale declared Mason to be the father of Sheba,
citing the resemblance between the two and a blood test that showed
a 99.94 percent probability that Mason was the father. Gale removed
a gag order and then reinstated it at the insistence of Mason's
lawyers.
   Ms. Reiter's friends and co-stars in her autobiographical
musical, ``Oh Jackie, Oh!'', which plays in community centers in
southern Florida, criticized the sentence.
   Tony Ross, an actor in the musical, said Mason violated the gag
order first when he gave a May 2 interview to the New York Post.
   Mason's attorney, Raoul Lionel Felder, said Mason gave the
interview to offer a response to the paternity suit.
   ``Jackie Mason doesn't put people in jail. The judge puts people
in jail,'' Felder said.

<HEAD>Former Governor, Convicted of Extortion, Announces Race for
Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Wrier</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Ray Blanton, who served time
in a federal prison and whose administration was riddled by
political scandal, announced Saturday he is running for Congress.
   ``I have been battered. I have been beaten and I have been
burned. But my grandfather taught me on the farm sharpening plow
points ... that the more you heat it and the more you beat it the
sharper and the tougher it gets,'' Blanton said.
   ``I've been that route and I hope it works the same way on me as
it did on that hot steel.''
   Blanton was convicted of extortion and mail fraud in 1981 and
spent two years in federal prison. But the mail fraud conviction
has since been overturned and he is appealing the extortion and
conspiracy charges.
   In announcing his candidacy for the Democratic nomination from
the 8th Congressional District, Blanton painted himself as a victim
of a Republican Justice Department lusting to bring down a
Democratic governor.
   ``I want to show that because I have been mistreated, falsely
accused, been made a political prisoner in the country I love, that
I don't give up on my love for this country,'' he said.
   Blanton, 58, is running for the congressional seat being vacated
by Rep. Ed Jones, a popular Democrat who has represented the
largely rural west Tennessee district since 1968.
   Tennessee's governor from 1975 to 1979, Blanton was convicted of
taking part in a scheme to sell state liquor licenses, and his
administration was rocked by allegations that prison inmates bought
their way to freedom.
   Two former Blanton aides also went to prison in the liquor
license conspiracy, and two other aides and a third man went to
prison in the so-called ``clemency for cash'' scandal.
   The former governor's mail fraud conviction was recently
overturned because of a Supreme Court decision restricting the
definition of that offense. Blanton is appealing his conviction on
extortion and conspiracy charges, and his citizenship rights were
restored by a federal court last fall.
   ``I believe that the people of this district, this state and
this nation realize that what happened to me was purely
political,'' he said.
   Will Jerry Pillow, a Gibson County farmer who joined about 50
Blanton supporters for the campaign announcement at a Jackson
motel, described the former governor as ``honest and humble.''
   ``This state owes him an apology, and a vote for him for
Congress would be a step in the right direction,'' Pillow said.
   Blanton, who represented Tennessee's 7th Congressional District
from 1967 to 1972, lives in Nashville, where he sells prefabricated
industrial buildings. He said he plans to move soon to Madison
County in west Tennessee.

<HEAD>Jerusalem, West Bank Set to Open Palestinian Public Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials on Saturday prepared to reopen public
schools for Palestinians in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank
that were shut down when attendance fell sharply during widespread
protests in February.
   About 16,000 elementary and high school students in Jerusalem
were due back to 31 Palestinian public schools scheduled to reopen
Sunday, said municipal spokesman Menachem Raboy.
   ``All in all, it's an experiment. If they don't come, we can't
teach them,'' Raboy said in a telephone interview.
   Jerusalem's private schools, where the majority of Palestinian
children learn, remain shut down.
   Public schools in the West Bank are due to reopen Monday.
   In other developments, Israel television reported troops opened
fire on Palestinian protesters in Nablus on Saturday, wounding two.
The army did not confirm the report.
   Arab storekeepers shuttered their shops, and cars and buses
disappeared from the streets as Palestinians observed a general
strike Saturday throughout the occupied territories.
   The army imposed a curfew on districts of Gaza City after
soldiers clashed with protesters Saturday morning. According to
Arab reports, demonstrators stoned Israeli soldiers in three
refugee camps and the town of Rafah in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Raboy said education officials decided to reopen the schools
after receiving requests from Palestinian parents and teachers who
did not want to see their children lose a year of schooling.
   ``We have said all along that as soon as we feel there are
enough appeals and a reasonable degree of certainty the schools
will work, we will open them,'' Raboy said.
   Students will study into the summer and have one hour a day and
one day a week added to their timetable, Raboy said.
   Raboy said the municipality shut down the schools in February
after attendance dropped below 25 percent as students protested the
Israeli occupation. At the time, police deployment in the city was
doubled to 1,500 to quell rioting in Arab neighborhoods.
   Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle
East war and annexed Arab east Jerusalem a few days later.
   The West Bank schools became a focal point of protests during
the first stage of the Palestinian uprising which began on Dec. 8.
   According to U.N. figures, 191 Palestinians have died in the
unrest. Two Israelis have also been killed.
   Seventeen left-wing protest groups banded together Saturday to
demonstrate in front of jails where Palestinians are being held by
the army.
   Iris Singer, a spokeswoman for the groups, said the
demonstrators were protesting against the mass arrests and
administrative detentions since the uprising began. She said they
were also protesting poor prison conditions.
   According to estimates by left-wing legislator Deddi Zucker,
10,000 Palestinians have been arrested since the uprising began,
1,900 of them without charges.
   Singer said the army turned away 56 protesters on their way to
Farah prison, near Nablus in the occupied West Bank. The protesters
planned to meet with Palestinian villagers and demonstrate outside
the prison.
   An Arab reporter said the office of a chartered accountant in
Hebron was firebombed in a bid to prevent Palestinian merchants
from paying taxes to Israeli authorities. Arab merchants pay their
taxes to the military government through accountants.
   The reporter said it was the third time in the past 10 days an
accountant's office has been burned down. An army spokeswoman said
she had no information about the attack.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz called on the Israeli
government to accept an international peace conference and be ready
to yield war-won territory.
   In an Israel Television interview broadcast Saturday, Shultz
said Israel must negotiate ``territory for peace. ... If you say no
... then there is no Arab partner that wants to come and negotiate,
because they say, what is there to negotiate.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected the proposal for an
international peace conference on the grounds that Israel would be
isolated in a hostile forum and forced to make dangerous
concessions. He opposes giving up any of the occupied territories.

   Risen Star, a son of Secretariat who was third
in the Kentucky Derby, spoiled Winning Colors' bid to become the
first filly to win the Triple Crown by capturing the $536,200
Preakness Stakes Saturday.
   Risen Star, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, took the lead on the
final turn. Winning Colors, the Kentucky Derby winner, was in the
hunt but faded in the stretch to finish third, behind Brian's Time.
   Louie Roussell III, co-owner and trainer of Risen Star, had
hedged all week on whether he would even start the strapping colt,
especially because rain had made the Pimlico track muddy. However,
the track condition was upgraded to good before the race.
   ``This is the best racehorse I've had in 20 years and I don't
want him to run on an off-track if I don't have to,'' Roussel said.
   Risen Star finished 1\ lengths ahead of Brian's Time, carrying
scale weight of 126 pounds over 1 3-16 miles in 1:56 1-5 in the
nine-horse field.
   Risen Star, who earned $403,700 for Roussel and co-owner Ronnie
Lamarque, paid $15.60, $7.80 and $4. The colt boosted his record
for the year to five victories in seven starts, with a second and a
third.
   The Preakness is the second jewel of racing's Triple Crown,
which includes the Kentucky Derby and the June 11 Belmont Stakes.
No filly has ever won two Triple Crown races.

<TEXT>
   Haiti has joined Panama as a growing drug-smuggling
center, and members of its dreaded secret police are muscling into
crack cocaine distribution in Florida, witnesses told a special
U.S. Senate hearing Saturday.
   The drug connection reaches high into the Haitian government,
including Interior and Defense Minister Gen. Williams Regala and
his liaison officer to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration,
two Haitians testified.
   ``Our intelligence indicates that major Colombian trafficking
organizations are using Haiti as a base of operations,'' Tom Cash,
head of DEA in Miami, told Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Bob
Graham, D-Fla.
   Haiti sits astride a natural drug-smuggling route from Colombia,
providing planes and boats with a staging area for the last leg of
the run into the Bahamas and Florida, he said.
   D'Amato compared Haiti to Panama as a drug menace, and noted
that the military of the two nations had close communications.
   ``Birds of a feather flock together,'' the senator said.
   Cash said the investigation that led to the Miami indictment of
Haitian Col. Jean-Claude Paul in March for allegedly flying cocaine
into Florida is continuing, but refused to say if higher Haitian
officials were implicated.
   Other witnesses said the army took in the secret police, called
Tonton Macoute, after the overthrow of President-for-Life
Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986, and that soldiers and secret police
now trafficked drugs in both Haiti and the United States.
   Roger Biamby, director of the Haitian American Community
Association of Dade, testified that the Haitian liaison to the new
DEA office in Port-au-Prince was a drug dealer who personally
supervised cocaine loading operations on one U.S. bound freighter.
   Regala, Paul and other officers ``have created an effective
drug-smuggling network in Haiti and the United States,'' Biamby
said.
   ``We must find out whether the people we are working with are
the devils themselves,'' D'Amato demanded after the testimony.
   Fritz Pierre-Louis, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who
later defected, said he personally turned over cocaine confiscated
in raids to Paul only to have it disappear. He estimated that 70
percent of Paul's powerful Dessalines Barracks forces are involved
in the trafficking.
   Earlier this year, Paul even raided an army jail to free some of
his soldiers arrested for receiving cocaine at an airstrip, said
Pierre-Louis.
   ``This incident indicates that Col. Paul has, if not the
support, at least the acquiescence of army headquarters in his drug
operation,'' he testified.
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesman Michael
Lanfersiek said the Haitian connection continued into street
distribution in Florida.
   An informant ``stated that much of Haitian crack cocaine
distribution in this country was being directed by corrupt military
officers (and) the former secret police of the Duvalier regime, the
Tonton Macoute,'' Lanfersiek said.
   Haitian immigrants now control distribution of the potent
cocaine derivative crack throughout South and Central Florida, he
said.
   Eduoard Piou, charge d'affaires of the Haitian Embassy in
Washington, disputed the testimony, saying his country supported
any effort to end drug trafficking.
   Piou acknowledged that Haitian law does not allow Paul to be
extradited to the United States, and said charges against him by a
Miami federal grand jury ``are under review'' by his government.
   After Paul was indicted in March, the government of Haitian
President Leslie Manigat vowed to redouble its efforts to fight
drug traffic.

<HEAD>Severe Thunderstorms Bring Tornadoes, Heavy Rain and Hail to
Louisiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms over the central Gulf Coast spawned several
tornadoes in Louisiana and dropped heavy rain and hail on the
state, while rain also hit parts of the Plains and the Northeast
Saturday.
   In southeastern Louisiana, a tornado destroyed several mobile
homes west of Hammond, another tornado destroyed a trailer north of
Folsom and a third damaged a house and barn at Creole.
   Tornadoes also were sighted near Maurice and Nunez in
south-central Louisiana.
   Thunderstorms also generated winds up to 69 mph at Houma, 50
miles south of New Orleans, and up to 75 mph at Cameron on the
state's southwestern Gulf Coast. Winds blew down trees and power
lines north of Baton Rouge and in Tangipahoa and Vermillion
parishes.
   Indian Bayou and Lafayette were hammered with two-inch hail and
storms dropped golfball-sized hail south of Baton Rouge.
   Rainfall was very heavy across the southern part of the state,
with Lafayette recording 1{ inches in the six hours ending at 2
p.m. EDT and Alexandria getting 1\ inches. Streets in Lake Charles
were blocked by flash floods during part of the morning.
   Despite the severity of the storms, there were no serious
injuries or deaths reported.
   Thunderstorms also hit south-central Texas and southern
Mississippi, producing gusts to 62 mph in Biloxi, Miss. Storms also
stretched into northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also were scattered over much of
the Plains to the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota.
Huron, S.D., received almost 1\ inches of rain in the six hours
ending at 2 p.m. EDT and Norfolk, Neb., had two-thirds of an inch.
   Rain kept temperatures in the upper 40s and 50s in the central
Plains.
   New York State and northern Pennsylvania received more showers
and thunderstorms, and a flood watch remained in effect for the
Catskill Mountains, the Susquehanna region and lower Hudson Valley
of New York.
   Widely scattered showers also were reported in the Ohio Valley
and New England.
   Sunny skies prevailed west of the Rockies, and skies were clear
or partly sunny over much of the Southeast.
   Temperatures climbed into the 80s across the Southeast and much
of the Mississippi Valley and into the 90s and above 100 degrees in
the desert Southwest.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 48 degrees at Laramie,
Wyom. to 103 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to
stretch from the central Gulf Coast states to the southern Plains,
and north to the upper Mississippi Valley, with showers most
numerous in the lower and middle Mississippi Vally and eastern
Texas and Oklahoma. Showers also were forecast for the northern
Atlantic Coast states, particularly southern New England. Sunny
skies are expected to prevail over the rest of the nation.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s and 60s in New England; in
the 60s in the central Plains, upper Mississippi Valley and upper
Michigan; in the 80s from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley, and
most of the area west of the Rockies; and in the 90s or above 100
degrees in the valleys and deserts of southern California, southern
Nevada and southern Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted for most other areas.

   President Reagan met with his top advisers
Saturday to discuss policy on Panama, but an administration
official said the 2{-hour session produced no deal to get Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega out of power.
   ``There is no definitive deal or agreement or understanding''
with Noriega, said the official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified. In response to a question, he said also that ``it is
safe to assume'' there is no tentative deal, either, ``at this
stage.''
   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House press secretary for foreign
affairs, said there were ``no immediate plans'' for Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Michael G. Kozak, who returned from
Panama on Friday after talks with Noriega, to return to Panama.
   ``He will remain in Washington for consultation,'' Popadiuk
said. Kozak attended the meeting with the president and reported on
his negotiations, the spokesman said. He added that no further
meeting between Kozak and the president had been set.
   Popadiuk said the president and his advisers met in the
residential quarters of the White House. The president left the
meeting for a few minutes toward its end to deliver his weekly
radio address.
   Popadiuk said the president convened the meeting ``to review the
Panama situation and hear Deputy Assistant Secretary Kozak's report
on his discussions in Panama.''
   Also attending were Vice President George Bush, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci,
Secretary of the Treasury James Baker III, White House Chief of
Staff Howard H. Baker Jr., Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Deputy
White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein, National Security
Adviser Colin Powell, Deputy National Security Adviser John
Negroponte, CIA Director William Webster, Under Secretary of State
Michael H. Armacost and Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary of
state for inter-American affairs.
   Howard Baker, in an interview with Cable News Network that was
taped Friday for broadcast Saturday, said, ``I believe in the final
analysis that Gen. Noriega will leave _ will leave power and leave
the country _ but that is not a done deal.''
   Baker said the indictment of Noriega was ``a useful part of the
technique to try to get Noriega so that he can no longer use the
government of Panama, the armed forces of Panama, to advance the
cause of his own drug trafficking and trading.''
   Bush and James Baker were asked as they left the meeting whether
a deal had been made. Neither man responded to the questions called
out by reporters.
   Under an arrangement described by a U.S. official on Friday,
Noriega would transfer power to an interim government that he would
have a hand in selecting. Then Noriega would leave the country for
nine months, returning after presidential elections are held in May
1989, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States would drop federal drug trafficking charges
pending against Noriega.
   Dismissing the drug indictment and giving Noriega a role in
setting up the transition government were said to be the elements
that some administration figures were having the most difficulty
swallowing.
   That difficulty was reflected earlier in the week by an 86-10
Senate vote against any concession that would lead to dismissal of
the drug smuggling indictments.
   The State Department view is that dropping the indictments
against Noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been urging Noriega to step down
since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5, and has since
refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government headed by a
Noriega-approved president.
   The United States imposed massive economic sanctions against
Panama hoping to break Noriega's grip on power, but the strategy,
so far, has failed.

   Defrocked TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
plans to return to the pulpit Sunday, three months after he made a
tearful confession of sin and was accused of hiring a prostitute to
pose for him in a motel room.
   The ensuing fight in the Assemblies of God over the length of
Swaggart's punishment led to his dismissal from the Pentecostal
denomination April 8.
   ``It has been nearly three months since I stepped down from the
ministry, and now we feel that it is in God's timing for us to come
back,'' Swaggart said in the May issue of The Evangelist, the
magazine of Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   He said his return to his ministry's Family Worship Center
sanctuary, which is not scheduled to be televised live, ``will be a
glorious time as the choir starts to sing the beginning song and
the 7,000-strong congregation joins in.''
   His return comes amid financial problems for his ministry, the
resignations of several key administrators and a report that
several top-level officials will leave Jimmy Swaggart Bible
College, part of the ministry's complex outside Baton Rouge.
   Although Swaggart did not specify his sin when he stepped down
Feb. 21, Assemblies of God officials have said he was photographed
with a woman outside a New Orleans motel.
   Marvin Gorman, a defrocked minister who contends in a lawsuit
that Swaggart ruined his New Orleans ministry with false rumors of
adulterous affairs, reportedly hired private detectives to take the
pictures.
   A prostitute has said that Swaggart paid her to pose nude for
him. The woman, Debra Murphree, is scheduled to be the subject of a
photo spread and interview in Penthouse magazine next month.
   Swaggart's hiatus is in accordance with a three-month suspension
ordered by the Louisiana council of the Assemblies shortly after
his confession.
   National leaders of the denomination, however, overruled the
state council and ordered Swaggart out of the pulpit and off
television for at least a year. Swaggart refused and the
denomination dismissed him after he submitted his resignation.
   Swaggart, who has avoided preaching on television during his
exile, recently appeared on a telethon in which he said the
ministry needs $6 million, much of it to pay stations that carry
his programs.
   ``We are scraping the bottom,'' Swaggart said on the telecast.
   Ministry officials refuse to say how much was raised. However,
Swaggart's appearance led three cable television outlets _ the PTL
network, the Christian Broadcasting Network and Black Entertainment
Television _ to cancel his programs. The three networks reach a
total of about 70 million homes.
   On Friday, the Baton Rouge State-Times reported that a number of
top-level administrators plan to leave the Bible college.
   Several weeks ago, at least six high-ranking officials of
Swaggart's ministry left their posts, including two who started
their own churches in the Baton Rouge area.
   Ministry officials have been silent about the reports, but the
ministry's magazine makes it clear there are financial problems. An
advertisement boosting seven crusades scheduled by Swaggart for the
rest of the year notes that one in June in Toronto has been
postponed.
   In the back of the magazine, a four-page spread notes that such
items as a videotape of ``The Best of Jimmy Swaggart'' and record
albums of Swaggart's songs are available at cut-rate prices.
``We've slashed prices on overstocked ministry items _ save up to
50 percent!'' the advertisement proclaims.
   Despite the problems, Swaggart said he is confident his ministry
will survive and prosper.
   Speaking to about 300 people at a prayer meeting Wednesday
night, Swaggart described himself as ``an unworthy vessel'' and a
``crippled preacher,'' but said he still carries God's word.
   ``He (God) does not abrogate calls. ... He does not call and
change his mind,'' Swaggart said. God ``will allow many things to
happen that will bring things to pass that he wants to come to
pass.''

   Marcy Peterson Carsey, executive producer of
``The Cosby Show,'' told 1,900 University of New Hampshire
graduates Saturday they can have it all if they ``learn how to
delegate _ and get a microwave.''
   Carsey, who received an English degree from UNH in 1966, also
told graduates they don't have to choose between a family and a
career.
   ``You can share your life with someone, raise children if you
want to, do tons of good work, and take karate lessons on the
side,'' Carsey said. ``You just have to learn to delegate well _
and get a microwave.''
   In Goffstown, ``NBC Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw told about
380 Saint Anselm College graduates that ``there's more to life than
looking good and living well.''
   Brokaw urged the audience to try to make a difference in matters
such as as public education, black teen-age unemployment, the drug
epidemic, disparities between rich and poor countries and the arms
race.
   ``Nothing great in this world would have been accomplished
without passion. I call upon you to have the passion to shape the
events of your generation,'' he said.

   Comedian Rich Little hailed President Reagan
as a great ventriloquist in a speech to graduates at the University
of Nevada-Reno Friday.
   ``Have you ever noticed when (Vice President George) Bush talks,
you never see Reagan's mouth move?'' he said at the school's annual
Graduation Celebration.
   Making light of his academic achievements, Little said a teacher
once told him, ``With your grades you'll never be president, but
with your absentee record, you could make it to the Senate.''
   The comedian interspersed his imitations with some sober advice.
   ``When you leave this school, I want you to forget every single
thing you've learned because there's no future in drinking,'' he
said.
   More than 1,000 students received diplomas Saturday at the
school's graduation exercises.

   Nobel Prize-winning economist James M.
Buchanan urged graduates at Ball State University Saturday to
maintain a healthy level of Midwestern skepticism.
   ``To get along in the world, we need to accept the rules of the
social structures that exist, but we also need to learn to question
them,'' he told 2,862 graduates.
   ``Literally everything should be subject to inquiry.''
   Buchanan, who won the Nobel in 1986 and received an honorary
doctor of humanities Saturday, said he was proud to be an
``academic outsider.''
   ``I have never been an Ivy League academician,'' he said. ``I
have never considered myself an adviser to politicians. In fact, I
have considered politicians something to be protected from. I have
never been attracted by the romantic nonsense that government or
politicians know what is best, and I hope you share these views

they would face bigger challenges than his generation because of

   ``The world today is significantly more challenging than it was

   Speaking to a crowd of about 6,000 people, including 1,000

   Shiite guerrillas from rival militias
rocketed each other's positions Saturday in the slums of south
Beirut after Iranian efforts to end 16 days of bloodletting
collapsed. Police said seven people were killed.
   In a separate conflict, two warring factions of the Palestine
Liberation Organization called a cease-fire after battles that
killed five people.
   A Lebanese leader said Syrian troops would soon enter the slums
to quell the struggle between the Shiite militias _ the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and pro-Syrian Amal. He also pledged in a
statement to work toward releasing foreign hostages.
   ``The doors of the suburbs are open for the Syrian army,''
Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said in an interview with the
conservative Beirut daily Al-Anwar that will appear Sunday. An
advance copy was made available to The Associated Press.
   ``No party in the suburbs intends to confront the Syrians,''
Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual guide, was quoted as saying.
   In a later statement, Fadlallah said he will ``invest all my
energies'' to resolve the hostage problem.
   ``I am still working on exerting pressure to reach a
humanitarian solution to this problem,'' he said, without
specifying who he was exerting pressure on.
   The statement was released through the Rev. Ray Barnett, head of
the Seattle-based Friends in the West, a Christian human rights
group. Barnett said Saturday he established contact with Fadlallah
in Beirut but declined to say how.
   Police said seven people died and 45 were wounded in howitzer
and mortar clashes Saturday between Hezbollah and Amal. At least
260 people have been killed and 859 wounded since May 6 when
fighting broke out in the slums where most of the 18 Western
hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held.
   The warren of narrow alleys and cement-block shanties is a
longtime Shiite stronghold.
   In the Palestinian conflict, police said rival guerrilla bands
observed a cease-fire in the nearby refugee camps of Chatilla and
Bourj el-Barajneh after a night of clashes in which five people
were killed and 45 wounded.
   The truce was reached after Yasser Arafat's Fatah, the main PLO
faction, dislodged Syrian-backed dissidents of Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising from most of their positions in the camps.
   Mousa's defeated followers sought refuge in Syrian-controlled
territory on the edges of the shantytowns, a police spokesman said.
   Assem Kanso, leader of the Baath party, the Lebanese chapter of
Syria's ruling party, said the Syrians will move into south Beirut
soon, ``and, God willing, sooner than expected.''
   He announced that orders to move into south Beirut might be
issued in the next 24 hours. He said the Syrian deployment will be
``peaceful so that there will be no more blood and destruction.''
   Syria massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armored vehicles
around the slums after Hezbollah overran Amal positions to seize
control of 90 percent of the urban battleground.
   Syria began threatening to move into the shantytown almost
immediately after the violence began.
   The fighting persisted despite eight cease-fire accords brokered
by an Iranian mediator, acting Foreign Minister Ali Mohammed
Besharati.
   Efforts to contain the fighting then shifted to the Syrian
capital of Damascus, where Besharati delivered a message to Syrian
President Hafez Assad from Iran's president, Ali Khamenei.
   Syria's official media, reporting the Friday night meeting, did
not disclose the contents of the message.
   In a related development, Kuwait's Al-Qabas newspaper, quoting
an unnamed European foreign ministry report, said two of the
Shiites who hijacked a Kuwaiti jetliner last month died in the
south Beirut fighting.
   It said Qassem Zaineddin and Nihad Khashman, or his brother
Fuad, were killed in a clash Monday night.
   It said all three were involved in the April 5 hijacking, which
ended when the Shiites surrendered in return for safe passage to an
unidentified country. Two passengers were killed in the hijacking.
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, chief of Syria's military intelligence
in Lebanon, returned to Beirut on Saturday after consulting with
military commanders in Damascus on the crisis, a source at the
Syrian command in Beirut said.
   The Syrian Arab News Agency said that Vernon Walters, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations, met with Assad in Damascus on
Saturday and discussed ``the situation in the region.''
   It gave no other details. But Walters, who arrived in Damascus
Friday, had been expected to discuss Syrian efforts to free the
hostages held in Beirut.
   Syrian officers said the decision to move into south Beirut to
quell the fighting had been delayed to give political efforts a
chance to arrange a settlement.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's main Arab
ally in its war against Iraq, a longtime rival of the Syrians.
   But Damascus has been alarmed by Iran's efforts through
Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's
largest single sect.

   Cuban authorities
reported in a mock drill Saturday that an earthquake killed
hundreds, but the broadcasts put Dominican officials on alert and
caused a wave of phone calls, officials and radio operators said.
   Also Saturday, real earthquakes rattled Chile and Guatemala, but
there were no reports of injuries.
   Cuba's Civil Defense Department made the bogus reports on an
amateur radio frequency, asking for international help for a
damaging earthquake in eastern Cuba, said emergency officials and
amateur radio operators in the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   ``Later, they (the Cubans) gave their excuses,'' said Nadim
Cury, director of the Dominican Red Cross and two amateur radio
operators.
   ``We have tapes of the broadcasts,'' said Baldomero Quezada, a
former president of the national Radio Amateur Association.
   According to the broadcasts monitored in the Dominican Republic,
the earthquake hit three eastern provinces in Cuba: Santiago,
Cienfuegos and Palma Soriano. The reports said it killed hundreds,
buckled roads and virtually destroyed the coastal town of Santiago.
   ``At no time in those first broadcasts did they (Cubans) say
they were carrying out a simulated disaster drill,'' Cury said.
   The Dominican Radio Amateur Association will consider protesting
the broadcasts to the international organization, Quezada said.
   As a result of the reports, broadcast from Havana over the Radio
Club amateur frequency in Santiago, Red Cross and Civil Defense
authorities in the Dominican Republic were placed on a
``first-alert basis until we could determine what we could do to
help,'' said Cury.
   The earthquake reports also prompted international telephone
calls from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Colombia to the
Cuban Interest section in Washington, Cuba's Foreign Relations
office in Havana, and the Sierra Maestra newspaper in Santiago.
   Reporters and photographers prepared to make the trip to report
on the earthquake.
   Cuban officials and citizens ended the uproar by explaining to
callers that there was no earthquake.
   ``There has been no earthquake in Santiago,'' said Ms. Magali de
Daigne, a telephone operator at the Santiago newspaper.
   Cuban officials in Washington and Havana, who did not identify
themselves, said they knew nothing of an earthquake.
   A report by Prensa Latina, the Cuban government news agency
monitored in Mexico City, denied a major earthquake hit the eastern
provinces.
   ``The only thing that is taking place in Santiago de Cuba are
the Meteoro 88 exercises, which include evacuation drills in the
event of natural disasters,'' Prensa Latina said.
   Geophysicist John Minsch at National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said there was ``no record of a quake in
Cuba in this morning's records.''
   Nelson Montalvo, a second amateur radio operator in Santo
Domingo, said, ``I took the report seriously when I attempted to
contact them (in Santiago), and they told me I could not use the
frequency because of the emergency.''
   Later Saturday, Santiago radio amateur operators admitted it was
``a simulated drill,'' according to Cury.
   After giving excuses, the Cubans said, ``We now know what kind
of reaction to expect from our radio colleagues and Dominican
authorities'' in the event of a disaster, according to Montalvo.
   Meanwhile, in Santiago, Chile, a strong earthquake caused alarm
but no injuries or damage, authorities said. It measured 5.3 on the
Richter scale.
   The Seismological Institute of the University of Chile said the
quake hit at 10:28 EDT. The epicenter was off the country's central
coast, 125 miles northwest of Santiago.
   In addition, four small earthquakes rocked central Guatemala
over a period of seven hours Saturday, causing no damage or
casualties, authorities reported. Minsch had no record of those
quakes.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number marks a 10-fold increase
in ground motion. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage in populated areas.

   Smiles, handshakes and summit meetings aside, good
feelings toward Americans engendered by the upcoming visit of
President Reagan have their limit. Soviets still don't care much
for Rambo.
   A correspondent for the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia got
a sneak preview of the movie ``Rambo III'' in New York recently.
   He didn't like it any better than his colleagues liked any of
the previous ``Rambo'' movies.
   A. Shalnev wrote in Saturday's edition of Izvestia that ``Rambo
III,'' scheduled to be released May 25, could be considered
entertainment only if the definition included ``a torrent of blood
and the crunch of broken bones.''
   Shalnev said a representative of the film company told him the
movie had no political intent. But he wrote ``the thought of the
film, its goal, is politics. The politics is of very evil, very
militaristic anti-Sovietism.''
   ``The dialogue is minimal. When the heroes want to speak, they
talk not in words but in slogans,'' he said.
   Shalnev said the film takes Sylvester Stallone in the title role
to Afghanistan to teach anti-government rebels how to use Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles.
   Soviet soldiers began withdrawing from Afghanistan on May 15.
Under an agreement reached in Geneva April 14 and guaranteed by the
United States and the Soviet Union, they must be totally out of the
country within nine months.
   The United States and Reagan, who once called the Soviet Union
an ``evil empire'' are receiving more positive treatment as
relations gradually improve and the U.S. president prepares to
travel to Moscow for his fourth meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   But Shalnev questioned why the film was being released the day
Reagan leaves Washington for Helsinki, Finland, on his way to
Moscow.
   Soviet media bitterly criticized previous ``Rambo'' movies and
other similar films that they said made enemies of ``Reds who
should be killed, killed, killed.''
   Writers attributed such films to a ``cult of violence'' in the
United States and an effort to erase the memory of the Vietnam War.

   The armed forces said Saturday that
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador plan to enter Honduras this week
to try to kidnap high-ranking government and military officials.
   According to the intelligence information, a special unit of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front will try to carry out the
terrorist actions in an effort to destabilize neighboring Honduras,
the military said.
   The front, which is made up of five guerrilla armies, has been
fighting the U.S.-supported government in El Salvador for more than
eight years.
   The armed forces statement said the rebel unit, which will
include both men and women, will try to take advantage of anti-U.S.
sentiment in Honduras that broke out in early April when
demonstrators burned the U.S. Consulate in Tegucigalpa.
   The demonstration was unusual in Honduras, a staunch U.S. ally
in Central America.
   It occurred after the April 5 arrest of Juan Ramon Matta, a
Honduran suspected of drug trafficking, who was arrested in a
pre-dawn raid at his Tegucigalpa home and deported to the United
States via the Dominican Republic.
   The Honduran Constitution forbids the extradition of Honduran
citizens.
   Matta was taken to a maximum security federal prison in Marion,
Ill., and held on drug-trafficking charges.
   He was also wanted for questioning by U.S. authorities in
connection with the 1985 torture-slaying in Mexico of Enrique
Camarena Salazar, an agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.

<TEXT>
   A leading Communist Party member on
Saturday defended his plan to allow independent trade unions and
political groups in a spirited attack on the ideals of aging party
boss Janos Kadar.
   Imre Pozsgay, a Central Committee member and leading reformist
in the party, called for a ``broadening of civil law'' to give
Hungarians more of a voice in national affairs.
   Pozsgay made his speech to a national Communist Party conference
amid speculation that Kadar would be replaced by Premier Karoly
Grosz.
   There was also speculation that Kadar, who has run the party for
31 years, would be appointed party president, a ceremonial post
created to ease him into retirement. The 75-year-old Hungarian
leader has been under pressure from many reformists to resign.
   ``He no longer has the support of the party,'' said one
prominent official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Janos Berecz, the party's chief ideologist, told reporters late
Saturday he heard talk of creating a new post of party president
and that ``if it is proposed, it will meet with the support of the
conference.''
   On Friday, Kadar lauded the benefits of single-party rule and
condemned demands for political change that he said would undermine
party control.
   Kadar's conservative assault was clearly aimed at Pozsgay and
other advocates of political change who have expressed support for
independent political and trade union groups in Hungary.
   Pozgay launched his defense.
   ``We need a new socialist pluralism so that we can work to make
socialism more attractive, a socialism based on individual
responsibility,'' Pozsgay said.
   ``We must do away with barriers, or barriers will destroy us.''
   Hungary's first independent trade union was formed last week,
and a growing number of other groups are seeking official
recognition outside the umbrella of the Communist Party.
   Pozsgay on Saturday reaffirmed his support for changes to the
constitution that would guarantee the independence of interest
groups outside the party.
   He also said Saturday that Hungary was considering merging the
posts of party general secretary and premier in a move that could
lead to Kadar's ouster.
   ``This could happen provisionally, although I am not certain
that it will,'' Pozsgay said. ``We have gone further than than we
expected.''
   Earlier Saturday, Grosz, 57, told the delegates that the party
``should break with the practice of secretiveness, self-isolation
and inflexible working style.''
   While he affirmed the role of the Communist Party leadership,
Grosz said the party must ``rid itself of ideological prejudices''
if economic and political reforms are to succeed.
   Kadar pioneered economic reforms that led Hungary to relative
prosperity in the late 1960s and 1970s but is increasingly blamed
for recent economic setbacks and for resistance to political change.
   A Western diplomatic source, who spoke to The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity, said there appeared to be ``a growing
consensus'' within the party that Kadar would be asked to step
dowen.
   But the diplomat said Kadar, who has led the party since the
Kremlin crushed an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956, may still have
considerable support among the party's old guard.
   Personnel changes are not expected to be announced until after
the conference concludes Sunday.
   Reformists say economic reforms will fail without sweeping
political changes.
   Inflation in Hungary reached 18.5 percent in the first quarter
of this year, and its gross foreign debt has mounted steadily to
$18 billion.
   Austerity measures implemented earlier this year to curb
inflation and economic stagnation have hurt many Hungarian
pocketbooks.

   The FBI knew about Laurie Dann. So did
prosecutors in three states. So did her neighbors and her former
husband and in-laws.
   Prosecutors were trying to track her down for making harassing
telephone calls and threats as she became increasingly disturbed,
but they were losing a race with time.
   ``After awhile you start to develop a sixth sense for these
things,'' said Lake County State's Attorney Fred Foreman said. ``I
had a feeling that this person was about to explode.''
   On Friday, the 30-year-old woman set fire to the house where she
worked as a babysitter, went to an elementary school and shot six
children, killing one, then wounded a 20-year-old man in a nearby
house and barricaded herself there.
   The nine-hour ordeal ended Friday night when police discovered
that Ms. Dann had shot herself to death.
   Authorities said Saturday they believe Ms. Dann also tried to
deliver poison to several families she once worked for gave
arsenic-laced snacks to two Northwestern University fraternities,
sickening several people.
   Laurie Dann left a long trail that led to Friday's rampage.
   Among other things, she had harassed an old boyfriend for two
years with telephone calls and she was known for her odd behavior
at an apartment complex in Madison, Wis., where she was found last
week lying on garbage bags.
   Her former husband woke up one night in May 1986 to find himself
bleeding from a stab wound made with an ice pick. He suspected his
wife.
   Ms. Dann was charged about a year ago with misdemeanor
harrassment by telephone, after authorities traced harassment calls
to a place where she had lived, said assistant Lake County state's
attorney Michael Waller. Charges were dropped after authorities
found out others had access to the same telephone.
   The evidence that she was violent was thin, and proper
procedures had to be followed. Her old boyfriend, a doctor in
Tucson, Ariz., refused to press charges. And some families Ms. Dann
worked for as a babysitter praised her work.
   ``If only we had known,'' said Dan Knauss, an assistant U.S.
attorney in Tucson, Ariz. ``But you can't anticipate things like
this.''
   Herbert Timm, police chief of this affluent Chicago suburb, said
that Ms. Dann had been seeing a psychiatrist.
   ``We know she had been undergoing some psychiatric care. The
full extent we are not privy to yet, and I don't know if we ever
will be because of the confidentiality factor.''
   At some point, Timm said, she obtained a firearms owner's
identification card, allowing her to possess the three guns she
used Friday.
   ``Anyone can get one by filling out a form and basically sending
in $5 to the state police. This allows you to buy weapons and
purchase ammunition,'' Timm said.
   ``It is supposed to be some kind of control mechanism but
obviously it isn't sufficient.''
   Authorities in Arizona said Saturday they had been ready to
indict Ms. Dann for making a threatening phone call to a man she
had dated at the University of Arizona in the late 1970s.
   But Janet Johnson, another federal prosecutor in Tucson, said
the man feared retaliation and asked officials to look for evidence
that she also had threatened others so he would not be the only one
to bring charges.
   Ms. Johnson refused to identify the man but said he had received
harassing phone calls on and off since 1985. And on May 9, Ms. Dann
threatened his life, Ms. Johnson said.
   ``We were not planning to dump the case, just trying to get some
telephone calls from other jurisdictions,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``You
need time to get those records, to prove an interstate connection.
   ``The FBI had looked for her in Madison, but she had
disappeared. We knew we were going to try to follow up leads, but
she was lost so there wasn't much we could do.''
   In Madison, where she sometimes lived, Ms. Dann also was known
for her strange behavior. Police went to her apartment one day last
week and found her lying on some trash bags, said FBI agent John
Wendet. She also had been arrested there in March in a shoplifting
incident.
   She was dubbed ``the elevator woman'' because she rode the
elevator for extended periods _ night and day _ in the high-rise
residence where she lived, according to former neighbor Keith
Wilson. She was a loner, never seen sharing a meal with a friend.
   Ms. Dann, the daughter of a Glencoe, Ill., accountant, came to
the attention of Illinois authorities after she filed for divorce
in 1986 from Russell Dann, a Highland Park insurance man stabbed
with an ice pick the same year.
   Russell Dann's family also reported he had received threatening
phone calls from the woman. Foreman became convinced she would
explode after he talked to her former in-laws in April. But he felt
he didn't have enough evidence to make an arrest.
   ``Russell Dann went to bed at night and woke up with a puncture
wound in his chest,'' Foreman said. ``But there was no one around.
His wife wasn't living there. What police came up with was a guy
waking up with a puncture wound in his chest. If you're a
prosecutor, you know a judge won't issue a warrant based on that.
   ``But we were very concerned and we continued to work on the
complaints about harassing phone calls. When the FBI came into the
case (in Arizona), we thought we had finally put something
together.''
   Complicating their case, authorities said, was that along with
all the reports of bizarre behavior, they also received praise
about Ms. Dann from families who continued to use her as a
babysitter.
   ``We had no real problems at all,'' said Craig Byless of
Winnetka, who recalled that Ms. Dann looked after his daughter last
summer. He called the woman ``a fine babysitter'' and a ``nice,
quiet girl.''
   Foreman and Knauss noted that in most such cases, people charged
with making harassment threats are released on bond after
misdemeanor charges.
   ``A prison term is rarely given,' Knauss said. ``A lot of these
things arise out of personal or business disputes.''
   ``If you think about it, how were we going to control her? I
don't know how she got licensed with a gun,'' said Foreman. ``We
don't create evidence, we just can't walk out and point at somebody
and say, `Hey, you don't look good, you've got to go to jail.'''

   The author of a novel written four years
ago about a fictional kidnapping at the Hubbard Woods Elementary
School was among the shocked parents trying to come to grips with
violence at the same school.
   James McManus, 37, said his son was a student at the school
Friday when a woman opened fire in a second-grade classroom,
killing one child and critically wounding five others before
barricading herself in a nearby home and shooting another person.
   The woman, identified as Laurie Wasserman Dann, 30, later was
found dead after having shot herself in the head, police said.
   ``My son was in the school,'' McManus said. ``He is OK. I don't
want to say anything right now. I don't want to comment about the
relationship with the book.''
   The novel, ``Out of the Blue,'' the first by McManus, was hailed
as a powerful psychological thriller when it was published in 1984.
   The plot involves a 5-year-old girl who is kidnapped from the
Hubbard Woods schoolyard by people who mistake her for the daughter
of wealthy parents in this affluent Chicago suburb.
   Some parents of Hubbard Woods schoolchildren Friday recalled the
novel, which was published by Crown Books.
   ``I read it about five years ago, and I thought about it
today,'' said Blanche Romey, whose 7-year-old daughter Katie is a
first-grader at the school.
   The jacket of the 246-page book calls it the story of how
``random violence can reach out to touch the lives of the
innocent.''

   President Francois Mitterrand began his second
seven-year term Saturday, promising to formulate policy aimed at
uniting fellow Socialists with non-Socialists.
   Speaking during a 20-minute inauguration ceremony, Mitterrand
said his May 8 re-election, in which he defeated conservative
Jacques Chirac, who then resigned as premier, ``was not the good
ones winning over the bad ones, nor the other way around.''
   He called on French people to work together ``so that the
principle of hope might triumph over the compulsions of fear and
confrontation.''
   Mitterrand, 71, has called legislative elections for June 5,
with runoffs June 12, in which Socialists backing new Premier
Michel Rocard are expected to win a large majority in the 577-set
National Assembly.
   Rocard and his Cabinet ministers and other top officials were
among about 150 people attending the ceremony in the glittering
Salle des Fetes (Festival Hall) of the presidential Elysee Palace.
Prominent guests included author Marguerite Duras and actor Gerard
Depardieu.
   The proceedings were televised nationwide. Schoolchildren, who
normally attend classes for a half-day on Saturdays, were given a
holiday for the occasion.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson told shipbuilders and homecare workers to fight for their
jobs as he attended two labor rallies Saturday and quickly denied
reports he had been hospitalized.
   ``You don't need `I-can't-remember' Bush or a palm-reading,
star-gazing president. You need someone who is alert,'' Jackson
told about 700 people at a shipyard labor rally.
   ``When I become president, you workers will have a friend in the
White House.''
   The rally in a parking lot across from Todd Pacific Shipyard
began an hour late, after a speaker announced from the podium that
the delay was due to Jackson being hospitalized in San Francisco
with a stomach ailment.
   Rick Roberts, his local campaign spokesman, also confirmed the
hospitalization report, but Jackson immediately denied it when he
took the platform at noon.
   ``Let me set the record straight. This morning in San Francisco,
we sat on the runway for nearly an hour and it threw our plane
late,'' Jackson said.
   ``There was some rumor about my health. My health is fantastic.
Ain't nothing wrong with me; feel so good, I want to jump off the
stage. Feel so fine,'' he said.
   ``He was not hospitalized. That's not true. He was late because
we couldn't get off the tarmac,'' said national Jackson campaign
spokeswoman Delmarie Cobb.
   Cobb said somehow there was miscommunication between San
Francisco and Los Angeles, and the report of hospitalization should
not have been announced.
   She said Jackson had received no medical attention in San
Francisco and did not know how the report originated or how why it
was announced.
   ``We don't know the genesis of it all,'' Cobb said.
``Apparently, from what I heard, someone stood up on the stage and
said that.''
   Cobb said she learned of the announcement when she was met by a
rush of reporters when she arrived with Jackson. After eating
dinner in Oakland Friday night, Jackson and the staff returned to
their hotel, she said.
   ``We were up bright and early this morning and nothing happened
in between,'' she said.
   At San Francisco General Hospital, a nursing supervisor who
refused to identify herself said Saturday that a man named Jesse
Jackson was admitted to the hospital Friday evening, but it was not
the candidate.
   ``It's not the presidential candidate. He is not here and has
never been here. Our poor gentleman just happens to have the same
name,'' the nursing supervisor said, refusing to release additional
details.
   Parents hoisted children on their shoulders to see Jackson, and
there was enthusiasm despite the smaller-than-expected turnout.
Organizers had predicted that thousands would attend the rally.
   ``I wish there would have been more people,'' said E.J. March,
36, a 10-year veteran of Todd. ``He's always supported labor, and
we've never had anyone who's supported labor.''
   According to speakers and flyers handed out at the rally, the
workforce at Todd has decreased from 5,000 to 900 in less than
three years, mainly due to business going to cheaper yards overseas.
   In the afternoon, Jackson appeared at a rally of 1,500 homecare
workers at the Los Angeles Trade Technical College.
   The mostly minority and female crowd of workers who care for
elderly and disabled people in their homes yelled ``Jesse, Jesse''
and clapped their hands as Jackson told them he identified with
them.
   ``I stand with working people,'' Jackson said. ``At the plant
gate, I stand with you. At the bus stop, I stand with you. In the
kitchen, I stand with you. At the hotel, I stand with you. Pushing
other people's babies down the street, trying to make a living, I
stand with you. Raising other people's children; can't raise your
own, I stand with you.''

   An underground nuclear weapons test
rocked the Nevada Test Site Saturday, the second blast at the
desert facility in the past eight days, a federal official said.
   The test, codenamed ``Laredo,'' was originally scheduled
Thursday, but it was postponed because of strong winds blowing
toward Las Vegas, about 75 miles to the southeast. The U.S.
Department of Energy, which oversees the testing program, prohibits
blasts under certain weather conditions.
   Jim Boyer, an Energy Department spokesman, said the test was not
as large as the 150 kiloton maximum limit adhered to by the United
States and the Soviet Union, but he declined to reveal the weapon's
power.
   He said the blast appeared normal, with no indications that
radioactivity had escaped.
   The nuclear warhead was detonated about 1,200 feet underground
as seven Soviet scientists spent the weekend in nearby Mercury,
Nevada, a small town about 32 miles from ground zero. The town
houses test site workers.
   The Soviets are in the area in preparation for an experiment
later this summer in which they will monitor a U.S. test. More than
two dozen American scientists are at the Soviet test site preparing
to monitor a Soviet blast.
   The test was the fourth announced explosion this year, and the
679th announced one since testing began in Nevada in January 1951.

   A dispatcher mistakenly allowed two
Conrail freight trains onto the same track, causing a head-on
collision early Saturday that killed a brakeman, railroad officials
said.
   The brakeman, F.W. Clinton, 50, apparently got off a local
freight train to ``perform normal duties'' like throwing a switch
or coupling hoses when the accident occurred, said Steve Lubetkin,
a Conrail spokesman in Philadelphia.
   The local train was hit by a Conrail freight train traveling
from Elkhart, Ind., to Newark about 12:50 a.m., Lubetkin said.
   He said Clinton, of Hawley, Pa., had been a railroad employee
for 25 years.
   A preliminary report concluded that the dispatcher, Dave Smith,
mistakenly allowed the two trains to travel in opposite directions
on the same track, said Rosemary Sheridan, spokeswoman for NJ
Transit Corp.
   Smith, 30, has worked for NJ Transit since July 1986 and has a
``very good'' record, she said.
   Smith, an NJ Transit tower operator and five Conrail crew
members underwent blood and urine tests for alcohol and drugs, a
routine procedure following a rail accident under National Railroad
Administration guidelines, she said. There was no indication
substance abuse was involved, she said.
   Smith and the tower operator, William Strubb, who has worked for
NJ Transit for nearly 23 years, were suspended until the test
results come in, which is expected in about two weeks, Ms. Sheridan
said.
   Lubetkin said the Conrail employees were not suspended.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson denied Saturday that he had been hospitalized, although a
campaign spokesman said he had been treated in San Francisco,
possibly for a stomach ailment.
   ``Let me set the record straight,'' Jackson said at a rally in
Los Angeles, where it was announced earlier that he had been
hospitalized. ``This morning in San Francisco we sat on the runway
for nearly an hour and threw our plane late.''
   ``There was some rumor about my health,'' Jackson said. ``My

   However, Rick Roberts, a spokesman in Jackson's Los Angeles
office, said earlier: ``He was hospitalized. We don't know for sure
what it was.''
   ``It was a possible stomach ailment. We don't want to speculate
until the national campaign people get here,'' Roberts said as
participants at a Los Angeles Harbor shipyard labor rally awaited
Jackson's arrival.
   Jackson went to the hospital after a campaign stop in San
Francisco on Friday, Roberts said.
   ``He was not hospitalized. That's not true,'' said Delmarie
Cobb, a spokeswoman for Jackson. ``He was late because we couldn't

   Jackson arrived in Los Angeles about 11 a.m. PDT Saturday to
address a crowd at the San Pedro yard, which has experienced
hundreds of layoffs in the past six years.
   Jackson was treated for back pain on New Year's Day at a
hospital in Greenfield, Mass. He was released after a couple of
hours of physical therapy.

   Sammy Davis Sr., a vaudeville song-and-dance
man and father of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. died Saturday, a
publicist said.
   He was 87.
   Davis died at his Beverly Hills home of natural causes, Arnold
Lipsman said.
   Sammy Davis Jr. was to deliver the eulogy at public services
Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, said Dick Fisher,
a park spokesman.
   The elder Davis was born in Wilmington, N.C., the grandson of
slaves. He began a 40-year career in New York City by winning a
series of dance contests, then joined the Will Maston Trio after
World War I and went on to appear in vaudeville, on stage, and in
posh nightclubs, Lipsman said.
   Davis played Fletcher Henderson in the 1955 film, ``The Benny
Goodman Story'' and appeared on television with such celebrities as
Steve Allen, Eddie Cantor, Milton Berle and Jack Benny, Lipsman
said.
   Davis's last television performance was in 1973 with his son on
a General Electric special, Lipsman said.
   Besides his son, Davis is survived by two daughters, Ramona
James of New York City and Suzette Davis of Portland, Ore., as well
as six grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Fisher said.

   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II on Saturday
formally announced his candidacy for re-election to the
congressional seat once held by his late uncle, John F. Kennedy,
and former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill.
   The 35-year-old freshman congressman, son of the late Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, made his announcement to more than 200 cheering
supporters at Arlington Town Hall.
   ``Use the elections of 1988 to send a message of peace and hope
to those who suffer around the world,'' he urged his constituents.
``We can make a difference, we can bring this country together.''
   With his mother Ethel, wife Sheila, and two sons joining him on
the platform, Kennedy thanked those who worked with him during his
first year in Congress to perform constituent services, preserve
veterans' benefits threatened by budget cuts and help find funds
for investment in affordable housing.
   Kennedy spent a state record $1.8 million fighting through an
11-candidate primary field to win the seat in 1986. This year he
has the backing of 16 Democratic state representatives from the
district and faces no opposition within his own party, Kennedy aide
James Mahoney said.
   The state Republican Party has not announced a candidate to
challenge Kennedy.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Talks With Assad About Hostages And Syrian Forces In
Beirut</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Lebanon-Violence, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. envoy Vernon Walters said Saturday
the Syrian government is aware it could endanger foreign hostages
if it sends it troops into Beirut's southern slums.
   Walters, the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, spoke to
reporters at Damascus airport before flying to Baghdad, the third
stop of a Middle East visit. He met earlier with Syrian President
Hafez Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
   The U.S. envoy said the talks included discussion of the nine
Americans and nine other foreign hostages being held in Lebanon,
and the imminent deployment of Syrian troops in south Beirut.
   Walters said that during the talks, ``there was a recognition of
the fact that this (the deployment) could work two ways.
   ``In one way it could work to endanger the hostages and in
another way, it could work such that it would not endanger them and
would make the hostages safe,'' he said.
   Most of the hostages are held in the slums by
Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers.
   ``I don't want to go into the detail. I'm sure that the
president (Assad) is very much aware of the possible dangers and
the possible advantages of such an action,'' Walters said.
   He added: ``I did not attempt to influence his decision one way
or the other.
   Iran'a proxy force, Hezbollah, or Party of God, has wrested
control of Beirut's southern slums from the Syrian-backed Amal in
recent fighting.
   Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, is Iran's main Arab
ally. But Damascus has been alarmed by Tehran's attempts to
dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Moslems through Hezbollah at
the time efforts are focused on eliminating Lebanon's sectarian
feuds to establish a secular system of government.
   Lebanese and Syrian officials have said that with or without
Iran's consent, some 7,500 Syrian soldiers, now poised on the edges
of the southern slums, would soon deploy in the 16-square-mile
enclave. Fighting has raged in that area since May 6.
   On arrival in the Iraqi capital later Saturday, Walters told the
Iraqi News Agency he would discuss the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war
with officials.
   He later met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, the agency
said.
   Before leaving Damascus at the end of a 24-hour visit, he said
his trip, which began in Israel, would also take him to ``most of
the Arab countries.'' Walters, however, did not elaborate on the
purpose of the tour, two weeks in advance of the arrival in the
Middle East of Secretary of State George P. Shultz.

   A Shiite Moslem leader pledged in a
statement Saturday to ``invest all my energies'' and exert pressure
to free foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``I feel with the families of the hostages and I am doing all I
can to reach a happy ending,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
spiritual leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, said in the
statement.
   The Rev. Ray Barnett, head of the Seattle-based Friends in the
West, said Fadlallah issued the statement Saturday after the two
made contact.
   ``Despite the limited means I have in this respect, I will
invest all my energies in this direction,'' Fadlallah said in the
statement.
   ``I have sought to close this file with all the means that I
have and I am still working on exerting pressure to reach a
humanitarian solution to this problem,'' he said, without
specifying who he was exerting pressure on.
   An aide to Barnett gave a copy of Fadlallah's statement in
Arabic to The Associated Press.
   Barnett, of Vancouver, Canada, arrived in Lebanon Friday,
seeking to deliver a petition to Fadlallah asking him to help free
the hostages. Speaking in a telephone interview from his hotel in
Christian east Beirut, he declined to comment on how he established
contact with Fadlallah.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the umbrella organization for
pro-Iranian groups believed holding most of the 18 foreign hostages
_ including nine Americans _ in Lebanon.
   The longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In another development, a freed French hostage was quoted Sunday
in a London newspaper as saying a British television newsman and a
Northern Irish teacher are held in Lebanon by the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad.
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann would not, however, say how he knew that
John McCarthy, 31, and Brian Keenan, 36, were held by the Shiite
Moslem extremist group, The Sunday Times reported. They both
disappeared in April 1986, but no group has claimed responsibility
for their kidnapping.
   Kauffmann was released in Beirut May 4 with two other French
hostages after nearly three years in captivity.
   The newspaper also said Kauffmann revealed that until October
1986, McCarthy was held in a cell next to an American hostage. But
he said he wanted to keep the American's name secret to avoid
putting him or McCarthy in danger.
   Fadlallah started his statement by expressing how deeply moved
he was by the hostage issue.
   ``I am stirred by this issue which is a humanitarian one
although it has been placed within a political framework,'' he said.
   In an earlier interview Saturday, Barnett had said he did not
know how the petition, with 40,000 signatures from various
countries, would be delivered.
   An aide to Barnett said the petition was not actually delivered
to Fadlallah but that the Shiite leader considers it as good as
done.
   He said Fadlallah showed deep concern and thanked all those who
``made this great effort.''
   Barnett, 50, has met Fadlallah twice on previous trips to west
Beirut over the last two years.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic priests and nuns led
about 1,000 demonstrators in a march to the Senate building
Saturday to press for comprehensive land reform.
   The demonstrators carried signs which read ``Land to the
Tillers'' and ``Our Land, Our Life.'' They snarled traffic as they
blocked off the road in front of the Senate office building for two
hours. The Senate was closed for the weekend.
   ``This is to show that the church is all the way behind a truly
comprehensive agrarian reform that is pro-poor and that will
promote social justice,'' said Manila auxiliary bishop Teodoro
Bacani.
   Negotiators are trying to reconcile differences between two
versions of a reform bill passed by both houses of the
American-style legislature.
   Many people view land reform as a solution to the 19-year-old
communist insurgency, since a majority of the Marxist rebels are
peasants.
   Also Saturday, a news report said a guerrilla commander denied
allegations communist rebels accepted money from foreign
journalists in exchange for staging ambushes against the military.
   The communist New People's Army commander, Ernesto Bergola, made
the statement Friday to Filipino journalists at his mountain
hideout about 30 miles north of Manila, the Manila Chronicle
newspaper said.
   The nationally circulated newspaper said Bergola admitted
guerrillas accept donations from anybody ``without strings
attached'' but denied collecting money from journalists to stage
ambushes.
   Two weeks ago, the military said it had evidence showing foreign
journalists were present during an ambush on Feb. 27 which killed
11 soldiers. A rebel who surrendered said the ambush was staged
after a group of foreign journalists paid guerrillas about $20,000
to film it.
   Manila newspapers, quoting military officials, earlier
identified the film crew as members of the British Broadcasting
Corp. But the military has since denied having identified the crew
and the BBC denied it had a crew in the area at the time.
   The armed forces announced Friday it had invited a Hong
Kong-based American reporter of Newsweek to shed light on the
incident after the magazine reported details of the ambush in its
April 4 issue.

   A 30-year-old woman delivered
arsenic-tainted juice to at least six homes and poisoned snacks to
two college fraternities before shooting seven people and killing
herself, police said Saturday.
   After students began getting sick from the snacks, police
investigators discovered the new acts committed by Laurie Dann on
Friday before she opened fire in an elementary school classroom,
killing one student and wounding five others.
   As details emerged about the bizarre final hours of Ms. Dann's
life, hundreds of parents and children touched by the tragedy
gathered at the school Saturday to discuss the shootings and pray
for the victims and Ms. Dann. Social workers talked privately with
some of them.
   While they prayed and talked, police continued their
investigation.
   ``The situation with Laurie has not ended,'' Winnetka Police
Chief Herbert Timm said.
   He said police believe Ms. Dann dropped off the contaminated
snacks before going on a shooting spree in the Hubbard Woods
Elementary School and then shooting and wounding a 20-year-old man
in a nearby home. Ms. Dann ended the rampage by shooting and
killing herself.
   Before the shooting began, she dropped off Capri Sun drinks
laced with arsenic at the doors of six homes where she once worked
as a babysitter in the Chicago suburbs of Glencoe, Highland Park
and unicorporated Winnetka, Timm said Saturday.
   One Glencoe girl felt ill after sipping the juice, but was never
taken to a hospital, Timm said. A Highland Park child was taken to
Highland Park Hospital as a precaution.
   Laboratory tests showed the juice contained arsenic, said
Winnetka police Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis. But he said he didn't know how
much arsenic was in the juice.
   At one of the homes, the juice carried a note that read, ``Love
your little sisters. Enjoy.''
   Timm said police don't know why Ms. Dann delivered
arsenic-tainted Rice Krispies snacks to the Alpha Tau Omega and Psi
Upsilon fraternities at Northwestern University in nearby Evanston,
though he added that ``she did have a friend at the Northwestern
campus.''
   A Northwestern spokesman, Ken Wilds, said a laboratory analysis
conducted by the university confirmed the presence of arsenic. A
subsequent analysis by a police laboratory showed the snacks
``contained a very heavy concentration of arsenic,'' Kalvaitis said.
   Timm said police found a syringe at an apartment where Ms. Dann
stayed and investigators believed she used that to inject arsenic
into the snacks.
   Evanston Hospital said it treated and released six people linked
to the snacks she delivered to the fraternities.
   A Northwestern University athlete also reported becoming queasy
after eating the snacks at his fraternity house. Greg McCullough
was treated and released Saturday at the University of Michigan
Medical Center in Ann Arbor while his team was playing in the Big
Ten Track and Field Championships, said Bruce Madej, sports
information director for the host University of Michigan.
   At Ms. Dann's Madison, Wis., apartment, authorities said they
found a list of people who received the drink deliveries, and also
recovered two vials of powdered substances, one black and one white.
   Timm said that on Friday, Ms. Dann walked into the Hubbard Woods
school, shot one boy in a bathroom and then entered a classroom,
where she shot and killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded four other
children. She later wounded the 20-year-old man as he wrestled a
gun away from her at a nearby home where she holed up before
killing herself.
   Four of the wounded children were listed in critical condition
Saturday.
   On Saturday, nine-year-old Tom Sawyer said he and many of his
friends were ``freaked'' when they heard the shots inside the
school.
   ``Scared? No. Now that I know (Ms. Dann) is dead, I'm fine. A
couple of my friends are still scared. A lot of them are sad,'' he
said.
   ``I just think it's sad for such a little kid,'' he added,
referring to the slain youngster, Nicholas Corwin, who was a soccer
pal of his.
   Police believe Ms. Dann became distraught when a family that
hired her to babysit said they were leaving Illinois. Before the
shootings, she tried to set fire to the family's home and another
school, police said. They also belive she tried to serve
contaminated milk to the family's children.
   Ms. Dann's unexplained spree of violence and the siege that
followed it were a nine-hour nightmare for residents of this
affluent suburb just north of Chicago.
   ``Winnetka is a very quiet, sedate bedroom community,'' said
Sgt. Jim Brewer, a 22-year police veteran. ``No one ever thinks
anything like this would occur here.''
   The last murder, he said, occurred 31 years ago when a police
officer was shot.
   ``It's disconceting, but it's an odd event,'' said Irene Kerr,
38, who lives across the street from the school. ``It will never
happen again.''
   The discussions at the school were closed to the news media, but
some of the people leaving said participants had prayed for the
victims and Ms. Dann.
   Dr. Ira Sloan, chairman of the psychiatry department at Evanston
Hospital, said there was a wide range of reactions among those at
the meeting.
   ``There were children who were crying,'' Sloan said. ``There
were children helping each other, hugging each other and handing
Kleenex to each other. There were children who were angry.''
   Liz Dickey, 37, said she was trying to allay the fears of her
6-year-old son by telling him that Ms. Dann was ``a sick person.''
   ``It's something that usually doesn't happen,'' Mrs. Dickey
said. ``The children lack a certain amount of safety at this point.
We have to help them realize that it's an isolated incident.''
   At Evanston Hospital on Saturday, Mark Tebourek, 8, Robert
Trossman, 6, and Kathryn Miller, 7, were in critical but stable
condition. Lindsay Fisher, 8, was critical but unstable as doctors
performed more surgery, a spokesman said.
   At Highland Park Hospital, Peter Munro, 8, and Philip Andrew,
20, were in serious but stable condition, spokeswoman Sue
Masaracchia said.

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday inaugurated an
80-bed shelter within the Vatican's walls for homeless men and
women.
   Moter Teresa, the Nobel Peace Prize winner whose Missionaries of
Charity serve sick and poor people around the world, assisted the
pope as he sprinkled holy water from a chalice inside the two-story
building that houses the shelter.
   Nuns from Mother Teresa's order will help run the facility,
where Rome's homeless can sleep during the night in dormitory
rooms, simply furnished, with bunk beds. The shelter will serve
three meals a day.
   The building was erected in a courtyard near Paul VI auditorium,
where the pope holds his general weekly audiences during the winter
or in bad weather.
   John Paul appealed to the public and politicians to recognize
``the urgency of the problem of so many millions of our brothers,
deprived of such precious well-being and yet who can and must _ if
so helped _ be at the service of the common good.''

   Singing, praying and waving banners, thousands of
evangelical Christians joined a ``March for Jesus'' through central
London on Saturday.
   Organizers said more than 50,000 people from across Britain took
part in the march and rally in Hyde Park. Police had no immediate
crowd estimate.
   ``This is not a protest march,'' said Gerald Coates, one of the
organizers. ``It's an expression of traditional grassroots
Christianity.''
   He said the event reflected a rebirth of evangelism in Britain,
partly borne from dissatisfaction with the orthodox churches.
   Some of the marchers recited prayers, using portable amplifiers,
while others played guitars and trumpets, shook tambourines, banged
drums and sang.
   One group calling itself the ``Jesus Army'' wore camouflage flak
jackets.
   As the marchers passed the grounds of Buckingham Palace, they
said a prayer for Queen Elizabeth II and her family.
   Organizers said a letter explaining the march would be delivered
to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's official residence at No. 10
Downing St.
   Meanwhile, celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the
founding of Methodism got under way in London Saturday.
   To mark the occasion, two British Rail high-speed trains were
named after Methodist founders John and Charles Wesley in a
ceremony at St. Pancras Station.
   A week of celebrations is planned to commemorate the conversion
of John Wesley on May 24, 1738, at a Christian meeting in London.
His brother was converted soon afterwards.
   About 450 Americans traveled to Britain to join local
congregations in services and visits to sites associated with the
fiery preacher John Wesley and his hymn-writing brother.

   An American Airlines DC-10 carrying 254
people aborted its takeoff Saturday, ran off the runway at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and slid to a stop on its
nose when its front landing gear collapsed.
   Six people, including the three-person cockpit crew, were
injured in the accident, which occured about 4 p.m., airline
spokesmen said. None of the injuries was serious, they added.
   Flight 70 was beginning a non-stop flight to Frankfurt, West
Germany, with 240 passengers, a cockpit crew of three, and 11
flight attendants, American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said.
The plane had a capacity for 244 passengers.
   Another spokesman, Steve McGregor, said a cockpit warning light
flashed during the takeoff, and Capt. Bob Cornelison radioed the
tower that he was aborting the flight.
   ``But he was rolling at such a speed,'' Hotard said, ``that by
the time the plane slowed, it had run off the runway and into a
grassy area, which had been softened by a rain. Sinking into this
soft grassy area caused the nose gear to collapse,'' Hotard said.
   As a precautionary measure, passengers were evacuated by
emergency chute, Hotard said.
   The captain, co-pilot, flight engineer and three passengers
suffered minor injuries and were taken to area hospitals, American
spokesman Al Becker said. The three passengers suffered back
injuries, Becker said.
   The crew, Hotard noted, ``would have been the ones to drop the
farthest. They were right over the nose gear.''
   A passenger on the flight, Juhani Jamia, of Helsinki, Finland,
said that before takeoff ``it seemed the plane was having some kind
of technical difficulty. The power was going on and off.''
   The flight was scheduled to depart at 2:50 p.m., but it left the
passenger gate at 3:28 p.m. and was in position for takeoff shortly
after 4 p.m., the spokesman said. They did not give a reason for
the delay.
   No smoke or fire was noted during the incident, Hotard said.
   The passengers were returned to the terminal by bus, Hotard said.
   Airline officials arranged a 9 p.m. flight to Frankfurt, with
baggage scheduled for a later flight, McGregor said.
   An American Airlines maintenance crew from Tulsa was scheduled
to defuel the plane and take off baggage before officials tried to
move the plane, McGregor said.
   It was American Airline's third major problem this month.
   A two-week-old American Airlines jet made an emergency landing
in Bermuda on May 10 after a fuel pump split on a flight from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport to San Juan, Puerto Rico, spewing
fuel into the Atlantic Ocean.
   Early this past week, a domestic flight was diverted to Detroit
because of a crack in the main landing gear well, an airline
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. has doubled its size
estimate for last month's crude oil spill that soiled hundreds of
boats and killed 200 birds and animals in a wildlife habitat.
   Under orders from state investigators, Shell re-examined its
figures and said Friday that about 365,000 gallons spilled during
the April 23 leak of San Joaquin crude into environmentally
sensitive Peyton Marsh.
   Since May 2, Shell has insisted that only 175,000 gallons leaked
from the 12.5-million-gallon storage tank at its Martinez refinery
after a drain hose broke.
   In the days following the accident, Shell insisted less than
4,000 gallons of the thick petroleum had escaped.
   Independent consultants working for the state Bay Regional Water
Quality Control agency will review the new estimate. State
regulators ordered the review of Shell's spill estimate because
cleanup crews appeared to be recovering far more oil than Shell had
admitted leaked.
   The revision came after Shell discovered that refinery employees
working on the spill estimate erroneously used a formula commonly
employed when extracting oil from a drilling mixture of oil, water
and sand, Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey said.
   Technicians subtracted from the percentage of the oil-water
mixture recovered by cleanup workers a set percentage used in
drilling for determining sediment and water.
   As for the cleanup, ``There's still an awful lot of oil in
sensitive wildlife areas,'' said Michael Rugg, a state Fish and
Game Department biologist.
   Under guidance from the wildlife agency, Shell is draining the
100-acre marsh. Grasses will be mowed to remove the stickiest oil
and the marsh will be flooded again in October.

<HEAD>Rebel Archbishop Confirms Agreement With Vatican</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre on
Saturday confirmed reports he and the Vatican have reached an
agreement allowing him to consecrate new bishops.
   Lefebvre confirmed the reports after ordaining 26 deacons at his
traditionalist seminary in Econe. He said he signed the agreement
May 5 with Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, head of the Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith, or the Vatican's guardian of theological
orthodoxy.
   Lefebvre did not give details of the agreement. He said it did
not specify the date and number of bishops he could consecrate, but
he said he wanted to go ahead with his plans to consecrate bishops
on June 30 in Econe.
   The archbishop said he was traveling to Rome Sunday to hold
further talks with Ratzinger.
   In 1976, Pope Paul VI suspended Lefebvre, 82, from his priestly
duties including saying Mass because he refused to recognize the
results of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.
   In defiance of the Vatican, Lefebvre has ordained priests and
celebrated the Tridentine Mass, a banned 16th century liturgy in
Latin. He claims millions of followers and sympathizers around the
world and much enthusiasm for the Latin Mass.
   Without Vatican permission, his consecration of bishops would
lead to excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church and set the
stage for a possible schism.

   Democratic rivals Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson were continuing their dialogue Saturday, while Vice
President George Bush was making his strongest move so far away
from President Reagan.
   Dukakis, aiming to lock up the Democratic presidential
nomination in the final primaries on June 7, completed a California
campaign swing with a visit to a community health clinic and then
planned to attend a fund-raiser in St. Louis before flying home to
Boston.
   Jackson, appearing at a rally at a shipyard in San Pedro, denied
reports circulated by a campaign staff member earlier in the day
that he had been hospitalized Friday night in San Francisco,
possibly for a stomach ailment.
   ``There was some rumor about my health,'' Jackson told the
crowd. ``My health is fantastic. Ain't nothing wrong with me; feel
so good, I want to jump off the stage. Feel so fine.''
   Dukakis, during a stop at a community clinic, told the mostly
Hispanic crowd that if elected president he would ``put basic
health insurance for all of our citizens at the top of the national
agenda.''
   Dukakis said he would build coalitions with representatives of
business, labor and politics to enact legislation that would
require businesses to provide health insurance for their employees.
He recently signed such an insurance plan into law in his home
state.
   Dukakis received a loud round of applause at the clinic when he
lapsed into Spanish, which he speaks fluently.
   Bush, who attended a 2{-hour meeting at the White House, had no
response when reporters called out questions to him as he left the
session on U.S. policy on Panama.
   Meanwhile, CBS News, citing unnamed Republican sources Saturday,
said Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III would take over running
the Bush campaign next month, but Baker told CBS that he was not
preparing to leave his Cabinet post to go to work for the campaign.
   In an interview on his campaign plane late Friday, the
Massachusetts governor said he had talked earlier in the day by
telephone with Jackson.
   He did not say what they talked about but described his contacts
with Jackson as routine.
   ``What we try to do is arrange things so that when our paths
cross, we spend some time together,'' said Dukakis.
   He rejected the notion that he was negotiating with Jackson.
   ``We respect each other; we like each other,'' he said. ``We
agree on some things, we disagree on others. It's a good
relationship and it will continue to be.''
   Jackson told the shipyard crowd, which heard earlier that the
candidate had been hospitalized, that flight delays not an illness
was the reason he was late.
   ``Let me set the record straight. This morning in San Francisco
we sat on the runway for nearly an hour and threw our plane late,''
he said.
   But Rick Roberts, a spokesman in Jackson's Los Angeles office,
said earlier: ``He was hospitalized. We don't know for sure what it
was.''
   ``It was a possible stomach ailment. We don't want to speculate
until the national campaign people get here,'' Roberts said.
   Jackson was appearing at the rally and then attending three
fund-raisers in the Los Angeles area.
   There are 466 Democratic delegates at stake in the party's final
four primaries on June 7. California is the biggest prize with 314,
while New Jersey has 109. The other two primaries were New Mexico
with 24 delegates and Montana with 19.
   In Colorado, backers of Dukakis on Friday withdrew their
challenge of a decision to add 198 Jackson representatives to the
Democratic state convention. The state's Democrats are meeting this
weekend to finalize delegates to the national convention in
Atlanta, July 18-21.
   Evelyn Davidson, representing 18 Denver Democrats who challenged
the expanded convention delegation on May 2, said that although
party rules were violated, the Jackson delegates would not change
the final outcome.
   ``Mike Dukakis will clearly win the nomination. One or two
delegates from Denver will make no significant difference,'' Ms.
Davidson said.
   In Vermont, Republicans and Democrats also held their respective
state conventions this weekend to determine the delegates to the
national convention.
   Dukakis was sounding increasingly certain of getting enough
delegates on June 7 to top the 2,081 needed for a convention
majority.
   During his latest campaign swing through California, he often
made only passing reference to the primary, while tailoring his
rhetoric to his anticipated confrontation with Bush in the fall.
   Dukakis is heavily favored to defeat Jackson in California and
New Jersey.
   The Massachusetss governor stopped in Missouri on his way back
East, and was introduced at a fund-raiser in Creve Coeur by former
Democratic rival Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   ``Because of Dukakis, thousands and millions of people who voted
for Ronald Reagan in 1984 are going to vote Democratic in 1988,''
the Missouri congressman said.
   Bush, with the Republican nomination already locked up, appeared
to have found the issue on which to separate himself from the
president _ the controversial negotiations with Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The administration, according to a State Department source, was
considering a deal in which Noriega would leave Panama for nine
months in exchange for the United States dropping drug charges
against him.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said Friday that
``administration sources who have suggested that the vice president
favors ending the negotiations (with Noriega) and bringing the
envoy back to Washington are essentially correct.''
   In an interview with Cable News Network, White House staff chief
Howard H. Baker Jr. said Bush had stated his differences with the
Noriega negotiations ``persistently ... and enthusiastically.''
   ``George Bush must stake out his position as a candidate for
president of the United States,'' said Baker.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who made an unsuccessful
bid for the GOP presidential nomination, said Republican candidates
could suffer if the Reagan administration drops charges against
Noriega.
   ``I don't want the administration to make a mistake,'' Dole said
at a news conference at Mississippi's Republican state convention
in Jackson. ``We're in quicksand if we start dismissing
indictments, political quicksand.''
   At a news conference in Sacramento on Friday, Dukakis demanded
that the administration explain its past dealings with Noriega.
   ``I and the American people want an explanation of what this
administration has been doing doing business with Noriega,'' said
Dukakis.
   The Massachusetts governor has made denunciations of U.S.
dealings with Noriega a standard part of his stump speeches.
   Jackson also denounced administration dealings with the
Panamanian.
   ``Noriega is not plea bargaining with Reagan and Bush,'' said
Jackson. ``Reagan and Bush are plea bargaining with Noriega. ... We
need to know what's going on.
   ``Send a special prosecutor to Panama. Send a congressional
delegation to Panama. Hear both sides of an ugly story.''

   A jury Saturday ordered the death penalty
for two men convicted of murdering a man because they thought he
was homosexual.
   Richard Laird, 24, and Frank Chester, 20, were convicted Friday
of first-degree murder in the Dec. 15 slaying of Anthony Milano, a
26-year-old commercial artist from Levittown.
   The jury returned the death sentence at 5:35 p.m. after nearly
11 hours of deliberations over two days.
   Chester showed no emotion when the verdict was read. Laird,
however, cursed Bucks County Common Pleas Judge Edward G. Biester
when the judge said jurors had not rushed to a decision.
   Family and friends of the defendants began crying and screaming
when the verdict was read.
   Attorneys for both men said they planned to appeal. Death
sentences are automatically reviewed by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court.
   ``I thought it was wholly appropriate for these two men,'' Bucks
County District Attorney Alan M. Rubenstein said of the sentence.
   Milano's body was found by the side of a road in Bristol
Township with his face slashed and his throat cut so viciously that
the spinal cord was severed, an autopsy showed.
   Milano left his home at 11 p.m. on Dec. 14 to get a beer and
sandwich at a bar called the Edgely Inn, where he crossed paths
with Laird, of Bristol Borough, and Chester, of Bristol Township.
   A bartender testified the two men forced Milano to buy them
drinks and harassed and humiliated him.
   Both Chester, who worked at a diner, and Laird, a carpenter,
said they drank with Milano and got in his car for a ride home that
ended in a scuffle along a Britsol Township street. Each man
testified that the other had killed Milano.
   Rubenstein had insisted the motive for the killing was a fierce
hatred of homosexuals.
   Besides first-degree murder, both men also had been convicted on
charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault, conspiracy, unlawful
restraint, false imprisonment and possession of an instrument of
crime.

   A trio of lively 101-year-olds, still
prepared to raise a glass of sherry to the Class of 1908,
celebrated their 80th class reunion Saturday at Mount Holyoke
College.
   Mount Holyoke officials said their calls to other schools and
alumni associations were unable to turn up any institution that has
had a larger group of returning students for an 80th reunion.
   Tucked into a 1955 Oldsmobile flying the class banner, the three
_ an artist, a civic leader and a psychologist _ led the annual
parade of 1,100 alumnae in white dresses across the campus of the
nation's oldest continuing women's college.
   They were followed by a pair of 97-year-olds _ Dellar Cook
Crumrine of Hamden, Conn., and Irene McIntyre Walbridge of
Peterboro, N.H., back for their 75th class reunion. Mrs. Walbridge
spent 285 days under enemy fire as a Salvation Army worker during
World War II.
   ``I wouldn't miss this for the world. It's fun and you've got to
have fun,'' said Helen Warren Smith of Cambridge, 101, who had been
vice president of the Class of 1908.
   ``The three of them were up at the crack of dawn and they
weren't being at all quiet,'' said Alumnae Association President
Kitty Rokinow of Houston.
   ``The big news when we were here was the assassination of
President William McKinley and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,''
Mrs. Smith said. ``I remember it took so long to get any news out
of San Francico because the telegraph was gone. It was a terrible
thing.''
   ``In a few years, it won't be all that unusual to have people
our age returning for their 80th college reunion,'' said Lucy Day
Boring, 101, of Cambridge.
   At her 75th reunion five years ago, Marion C. Plack, still a
cigarette smoker, said the secret to longevity is not inhaling.
   ``I haven't given up cigarettes,'' said Miss Plack, now 101.
``But they hid them on me.''

   Georgia's Republican convention adjourned in
chaos Saturday after supporters of Pat Robertson shouted down
speakers and promised to hold their own meeting to pick delegates
to the GOP National Convention.
   ``The business of this convention cannot proceed,'' said John
Stuckey, chairman of the state Republican Party. ``The 18 delegates
at large cannot be elected.''
   Several hundred of the state delegates left the Albany Civic
Center after Stuckey's announcement, which he based on the
recommendation of the credentials committee. About 750 state
delegates remained for the dissidents' convention.
   Party dissidents quickly took control of the convention hall and
selected
   18 delegates, and then considered a party platform and debated
changes to party rules.
   Supporters of the television evangelist, who suspended his bid
for the Republican nomination last week, marched through the
convention hall and shouted down speakers on Friday. They won a
court order Saturday ordering the admission of delegates previously
denied because of missed deadlines for filing paperwork.
   Party leaders had disqualified more than 900 delegates to the
state convention, claiming they were chosen in improperly conducted
district conventions. Many of them were Robertson backers.
   Stuckey said the several court orders issued in the delegate
battle made it impossible to conduct business in an orderly fashion.
   He did not say how the party would select the 18 delegates, but
said the 30 national delegates already named at district
conventions would meet at a local hotel to choose a national
committeeman and a national committeewoman _ steps that were to be
taken at the state convention.
   All 48 delegates must vote for George Bush because of the vice
president's victory in the state's presidential primary, but
Robertson backers have pushed to win spots in the delegation to
influence the party platform and the selection of a vice
presidential nominee.

   Government troops killed 18 guerrillas
in recent fighting north of the capital of Maputo, the national
news agency AIM reported Saturday.
   Also Saturday, rebels announced in Lisbon, Portugal, that they
had killed 52 Mozambican and 15 Zimbabwean soldiers in attacks on
two army barracks earlier this month.
   AIM also said a military statement reported that the government
soldiers freed 13 civilians who were being held by the rebels of
the Mozambique National Resistance, AIM said, citing a military
statement.
   AIM said the clashes took place Wednesday about 30 miles north
of the town of Maluana on Mozambique's main north-south road. The
report made no mention of government casualties.
   Maluana has been the site of repeated ambushes by the rebels,
who attack both civilian and military vehicles traveling in convoys.
   The rebels, also known by their Portuguese acronym RENAMO, have
been fighting for 11 years to overthrow Mozambique's Marxist
government. An estimated 100,000 people have died in the war in the
past three years, according to a recent U.S. State Department
report.
   No government acknowledges supporting the group, which has
seriously damaged Mozambique's economy with hit-and-run attacks on
civilian and military targets.
   Mozambique claims that South Africa assists the rebels, but
South Africa denies the allegation, saying it has abided by a 1984
mutual non-aggression pact with Mozambique.
   In Lisbon, the rebels said in a statement that their forces
killed 23 Mozambicans and the 15 Zimbabweans in an attack on a
joint barracks in the town of Macossa about 55 miles from the
border with Zimbabwe.
   The rebels said the Mozambican battalion had been trained in
Zimbabwe by British military instructors.
   Troops from Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Malawi fight in Mozambique
alongside the army, mainly to protect transport routes and an oil
pipeline.
   In the other attack, the rebels said they killed 29 Mozambican
soldiers stationed at a barracks in the town of Morrumbene in the
southeastern province of Inhambane.
   The rebels gave no specific dates for the attacks, which were
not independently confirmed.

   An 11-month investigation into reports of
sexual abuse at a day-care home has triggered fears that a satanic
cult may have preyed on children, a Denver newspaper reported.
   No criminal charges have been filed, and the day-care home
operator denies the charges.
   The Denver Post said in a story in its Sunday editions that
seven children who attended the home have recently received
therapy. Five continue with therapists, paid for through the
state's victim compensation fund.
   Authorities believe at least two other children could be
victims, the Post reported, but their parents have refused to
cooperate with investigators.
   ``These are by far the most severely disturbed children I have
ever seen,'' an unnamed child-care expert told the newspaper. ``The
emotional impacts are astounding. Entire families are thrown into
chaos over this.''
   One youngster described vivid details involving a ceremonial
decapitation of a young boy named Bobby. Washington County
Undersheriff Steve Vosburg says he regards that report ``very
seriously,'' although no body has been found and no local children
have been reported missing.
   Other children told of rape and sodomy inflicted by masked and
hooded adults during ceremonial torture sessions. One 4-year-old
identified a pentagram _ a common satanic symbol _ and associated
it with the day-care home, the Post said.
   During therapy or as told to parents, the Post said, the
children have described adults who frightened them with guns,
knives, swords, power saws and cattle prods.
   The day-care home was operated by Hazel Riggs, 67, who
surrendered her license Sept. 15 _ 10 weeks after she was
questioned by Vosburg and a social worker.
   ``I completely deny all these charges ... and hope you look into
this case thoroughly because this is not true,'' she wrote in a
Sept. 15 response to a letter from Elizabeth Kester, the state's
licensing administrator. ``I do not wish to do any more day-care.''
   Vosburg says the case remains open.
   A search of the day-care home on May 5 turned up no evidence,
Vosburg said. His investigation is further harmed, he said, by
parents who refuse to allow their children to be interviewed.
   District Attorney Doyle T. Johns, who is responsible for filing
charges, refused to comment, saying he does not discuss active
investigations.
   Although he is skeptical of any links to devil worship, Vosburg
adds, ``I'd like to know where (the children) are getting these
stories if there's nothing to them.''
   Therapists, parents and social workers are less willing than
Vosburg to dismiss a satanic link. ``We know it is going on,'' an
unnamed county official told the Post. ``We just can't prove it.''
   Disturbances among the children, who range from preschool age to
about 12, include depression and suicidal feelings, nightmares,
regressive development, outbursts against other children, spells of
fear and terror, and general distrust, the newspaper said.

   A federal judge was shot and killed at his
home in this wealthy New York City suburb Saturday by an assailant
who then committed suicide, police said.
   It was believed to be only the second slaying of a federal judge
this century.
   Richard J. Daronco, 56, was in a garden at the side of his home
when a man approached with a handgun about 2:15 p.m., Police Chief
Anthony M. Quatroni said.
   The judge fled to the back yard, where he was shot several
times, he said.
   Daronco then ran into the house, followed by the attacker.
Inside, another shot was fired _ apparently that of the gunman
committing suicide, Quatroni said.
   Daronco's wife, a daughter and her boyfriend were in the house
when the attack occured and alerted neighbors who called for
police, according to a police officer who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Quatroni said only that family members were home at some point
during the day and that police were investigating whether there
were any witnesses.
   Police arrived within a few minutes and found a man on the
ground floor with a gunshot wound to the head and a .38-caliber
revolver near his hand, Quatroni said.
   Daronco was found in a study a few feet away, his sweatshirt and
sweatpants soaked in blood, he said.
   Daronco died of multiple gunshot wounds to various parts of the
body, said Dr. Louis Roh, deputy medical examiner for Westchester
County, who pronounced both men dead at the scene about 4 p.m.
   Roh said the other man, who he described as white and in his
late 60s, died of a single gunshot wound to the head, apparently
from the same gun.
   Quatroni said police were checking the name on a pistol permit
found on the attacker's body but had been unable to identify the
assailant.
   The attacker arrived at the scene in a car, Quatroni said, but
he would not say where the car was. He also said he did not know of
any words having been exchanged by the judge and his assailant.
   He said police were investigating whether any threats had been
made against the judge.
   ``It was shocking because he (Daronco) was a man respected by
the entire community,'' said Quatroni.
   Westchester County District Attorney Carl A. Vergari said
investigators would try to determine whether the killing was
connected with a case Daronco handled.
   ``Obviously, when you have a judge who sat on courts with
criminal jurisdiction that would be the first place to look, would
it not, where he's killed in this manner,'' Vergari said at the
scene.
   The judge and his wife, Joan O'Rourke, were married in 1957 and
have five grown children.
   ``He was a family man. He was a churchgoer. He was always out
working on his house,'' said William Hynes, a neighbor.
   Another neighbor, Joseph Kish, who said he had known Daronco for
14 years, called the judge ``a wonderful person, a beautiful
neighbor, a great family man. He's gonna be missed. It's a terrible
tragedy.''
   Daronco was appointed in 1987 as a federal judge for the
Southern District of New York.
   His brother, Paul, is the supervisor in this affluent town of
about 5,000 people just north of New York City in Westchester
County.
   Daronco was born and reared in Pelham and attended Providence
College in Rhode Island and the Albany Law School of Union
University.
   Daronco began his judicial career in 1971 when Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller appointed him to Westchester County Family Court. In
1984, Daronco was elevated from a state judgeship in White Plains
to deputy chief administrative judge of the state's office of court
administration.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Wood Jr. was shot by a sniper in the
driveway of his San Antonio, Texas, townhouse on May 29, 1979.
Wood, 63, was nicknamed ``Maximum John'' because he frequently gave
the maximum sentence to convicted narcotics traffickers in the
Western District of Texas.
   Charles V. Harrelson, a convicted hitman, was found guilty in
1982 of shooting Wood and was sentenced to two consecutive life
sentences for murder and murder conspiracy.
   Jimmy Chagra, of El Paso, Texas, who had been scheduled to
appear in Wood's court on drug charges, was acquitted of paying
Harrelson $250,000 to kill Wood, but was sentenced to 20 years in
prison for other crimes, and his wife, Elizabeth, was convicted of
conspiracy to murder the judge.

<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christians must overcome ``the rubble
along the road'' to Christian unity, the general secretary of the
National Council of Churches told religious and lay leaders
Saturday.
   The Rev. Arie R. Brouwer gave the opening sermon in a five-day
meeting, sponsored by the National Council of Churches, that
includes seven worship services, 53 workshops and 26 forums.
   An estimated 1,500 religious and lay leaders from around the
world were attending what sponsors called a ``religious
smorgasboard,'' a broadly ecumenical meeting of Protestant,
Catholic, Evangelical and Orthodox Christians.
   The event, called ``A Gathering of Christians,'' runs through
Wednesday.
   Brouwer compared the ``rubble'' obstructing Christian unity to
stones.
   ``We need to pick our way around them, we need to climb over
them, we need to sprint ahead in those places where the road is
clear. That is the task of Christian unity.''
   The obstacles to Christian unity are mostly isms _
``traditionalism, racism, sexism, nationalism, classism,
triumphalism, sectarianism, ecumenism,'' he said.
   ``The problem is in the `ism,' when love of nation becomes an
`America first' movement, giving second place to love, justice,
peace and truth,'' Brouwer said.
   ``When concern for personal renewal becomes privatism. When zeal
for the public order leads to the sacrifice of personal well-being.
When unity is sought at any price. These are a few of the things
that divide the human community and the Christian community,''
Brouwer added.
   Later in the week, the council's 260-member governing board will
consider whether to endorse an international boycott of Shell Oil,
which operates in South Africa, to protest apartheid.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Optimistic About Treaty To Reduce Strategic Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told U.S.
journalists this week he is optimistic about prospects for a
U.S.-Soviet agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic
nuclear weapons before President Reagan leaves office.
   Gorbachev, in an interview in Moscow with The Washington Post
and Newsweek magazine, also said he will ask Reagan to approve a
joint Soviet-U.S. unmanned flight to Mars when the two men meet in
Moscow for the May 29-June 2 summit.
   Details of the interview and Gorbachev's answers to written
questions submitted in March were released Saturday by Newsweek and
published in Sunday editions of the Post. Editors from the two news
organizations interviewed Gorbachev for 90 minutes on Wednesday.
   Asked about his answer to a written question on the 50-percent
reduction in strategic offensive weapons, Gorbachev said, ``We want
to have that signed.''
   He said if the agreement ``comes to be drafted under the present
U.S. administration, I see no reason why President Reagan and I
should not sign it. I would certainly welcome that.''
   Asked to evaluate Reagan, Gorbachev responded: ``I'm not
particularly fond of giving personal character references. But
since you ask, I would like to say that realism is an important
quality in President Reagan as a politician.
   ``By this I mean the ability to adapt one's views to the
changing situation, while remaining faithful to one's convictions.''
   In maintaining a positive tone in advance of the upcoming
summit, Gorbachev referred to the already-signed U.S.-Soviet treaty
to reduce medium-range missiles and said: ``Who would have thought
in the early '80s ... that it would be President Reagan who would
sign with us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history?''
   Gorbachev cautioned that he has no plans to set aside unresolved
disputes in order hasten a treaty on strategic weapons.
   ``In our assessment we have covered together a long road in the
search for conclusions to all questions,'' Gorbachev said. ``But I
think you would agree with me that if I say that if we sign with
one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive forces in one area
and at the same time launch an arms race in space or at sea, what
would be the point? That would be senseless.''
   He said the Soviet position was not capricious but fully thought
out and responsible and he reiterated opposition to the Reagan
administration's planned Star Wars missile defense program, known
formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``If we just replace one kind of arms race with another,
particularly in space, where the arms race would take a
particularly dramatic turn, we would undermine the trust that has
begun to be built, we would make worthless all the experience that
we have accumulated at the Geneva negotiations,'' he said.
   ``This new kind of arms race, new sphere for an arms race, new
criteria _ it would take decades to reach some kind of agreement
and come to an agreement.''
   Gorbachev said the leader who promotes an escalation of the arms
race in space ``is committing a crime against the people _ his own
people, and others. That must be said with all responsibility, and
with clarity.
   ``Such an approach, such an idea, is a road to destabilization,
to unpredictability on matters of security,'' he said. ``This must
be condemned, the initiator of such an approach must be pilloried.''
   As for sea-launched cruise missiles, Gorbachev said, ``This
would also be a roundabout maneuver that could become a new avenue
for the arms race. And therefore, we are linking all those
questions together and we believe that this is a fair approach.
   ``What is more, I have to say that we see genuine possibilities
to resolve all those questions, to resolve all of them together and
to have a treaty on a 50-percent reduction of strategic offensive
arms and then to continue farther,'' he said.
   On his proposal to Reagan for a joint mission to Mars, Gorbachev
said, ``Why shouldn't we work together? We have great experience,
you have great experience _ let us cooperate to master the cosmos,
to fulfill big programs. And whatever is being done in outer space
and whatever is being done in SDI to achieve new technological
breakthroughs.
   ``As a result of a joint project to study Halley's comet, we
have been able to develop dozens of new materials, we have been
able to make major advances in electronics and mathematics. This
resulted really in major scientific breakthroughs. This is a field
of cooperation that would be worthy of the Soviet and American
peoples. And I will make that proposal to President Reagan...,''
said Gorbachev.

   President Reagan watched film clips of Fred
Astaire and other Hollywood stars of past years, including himself,
Saturday night and then put in a plug for ``preserving our
country's film heritage.''
   The president spoke at a dinner sponsored by the American Film
Institute to raise funds for the preservation of deteriorating
films from the early days of the movie industry.
   The evening was billed as ``A Fred Astaire Remembrance'' in
honor of the late song-and-dance man and featured clips from movies
in which Astaire appeared.
   Also featured were a few shots from ``This is the Army,'' an
Irving Berlin musical in which Reagan appeared while he was a
lieutenant in the Army Air Corps film unit during World War II.
   ``What a surprise,'' the president quipped. ``I usually know
when I'm going to be on the late, late show.''
   ``In Hollywood, if you don't sing or dance, you become an
after-dinner speaker, and look where I wound up,'' he added.
   The president paid tribute to ``the important work the American
Film Institute is doing in preserving our country's film heritage.''

<TEXT>
   The Democratic National Convention Committee
has fired its communications director after complaints from the
news media that preparations for the July 18-21 convention were
inadequate.
   Bob Ferrante was dismissed last week as communications director
for the Democratic National Committee by Don Fowler, the
convention's chief executive officer.
   The firing occurred after a national press tour of convention
facilities on Monday, when the media complained about the state of
arrangements for the 15,000 media representatives who will cover
the convention.
   ``We just agreed it would be better for everybody concerned,''
Fowler said Saturday. ``We needed someone with more technical
knowledge.''
   Ferrante was replaced by Wally Podrazik, who was media
coordinator for the last two Democratic conventions.
   Fowler would not comment further on the reasons for the
dismissal.

<TEXT>
   The 30-year prison sentence imposed on
former Marine Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree in a Moscow embassy
sex-for-secrets case was cut by five years Friday by the commander
of the Quantico Marine Base.
   Lt. Gen. Frank E. Petersen also lifted the $5,000 fine imposed
on Lonetree after his Aug. 24 espionage conviction in a
court-martial at the northern Virginia installation.
   Petersen acted after a review of Lonetree's case ``because of
his total cooperation and conduct during his voluntary post-trial
debriefings by counter-intelligence specialists.''
   Gunnery Sgt. Dean Chamberlain said Lonetree would be eligible
for parole after serving one-third of his sentence, which means he
would have to spend 8 1-3 years instead of 10 years behind bars
before being considered for release.
   Lonetree also was sentenced by the eight-officer court-marital
to a dishonorable discharge, reduction to private and forfeiture of
all pay and allowances. Those penalties were unaffected.
   Chamberlain said Lonetree has been held at Quantico since his
trial.
   Lonetree was convicted on 13 counts, including allegations that
he turned over CIA identities and floor plans of the U.S. embassies
in Moscow and Vienna to the Soviets.
   Prosecutors alleged that Lonetree became a spy after falling in
love with a Soviet translator, Violetta Sanni.
   His defense lawyers contended Lonetree gave nothing of value to
the Soviets, but was trying to string the KGB along by providing
them with non-vital secrets in an effort to be a double agent.
   Lonetree's case unleashed concern over security at American
embassies world wide and led to a secret presidential study that
criticized the State Department and the Marines for neglecting
security.
   Lontree, who served as a guard at the Moscow embassy in 1985 and
1986, also was charged along with Marine Cpl. Arnold Bracy with
allowing KGB agents to roam the embassy at will. Those charges were
dropped by the government for lack of evidence.
   Another member of the detachment, Sgt. Robert Stufflebeam, was
convicted at Quantico on minor counts of dereliction of duty.
   The State Department and the Marines later minimized the
security report that more than 500 instances of possible wrongdoing
by guards at embassies worldwide had occurred.
   In a statement, the Marines said many of the so-called
infractions were minor, such as curfew violations, insubordination,
and misuse of telephone that could have no tie to espionage
activities.

   Vice President George Bush was told as early
as 1983 of allegations that Panamanian officials were involved in
the drug trade, but did not follow up on them, says Bush's top
foreign policy aide.
   The aide, Donald Gregg, testified in a deposition Friday that
then-Panamanian President Ricardo de la Espriella mentioned the
allegations to the vice president at the close of a December 1983
meeting in Panama, but the Panamanian official also told Bush the
stories were untrue.
   Bush, then chairman of a task force to combat the flow of drugs
into south Florida, ``said he had not been aware (of the charges)
or he would have raised them'' with de la Espriella, Gregg
testified in a deposition for a private civil lawsuit.

   Senate leaders are expressing growing doubts
the chamber will ratify the U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons treaty
before President Reagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Moscow eight days from now.
   Unless the Senate speeds up its pace, ``the chance of having
that little package with the blue ribbon tied around it in the
president's pocket by the time he goes to Moscow are going to
diminish daily and hourly,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., said late Friday.
   The problem is that conservative Republicans opposed to the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty have used Senate
rules to delay action, according to Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of
Kansas.

   The latest government figures on federal
spending and tax receipts indicate chances of avoiding
election-year budget headaches are growing increasingly dim,
private analysts say.
   Sharply lower income tax receipts in April and continued
increases in federal spending left the year-to-date budget deficit
24.6 percent higher than in the same month of 1987, the Treasury
Department said Friday.
   Private analysts said the April report indicates the government
will have a tough time avoiding a large jump in the deficit, let
alone achieving the reduction envisioned by the two-year budget
deal sealed by lawmakers and the president in December.
   The government collected $13.9 billion more than it spent in
April, helping to hold the deficit for the first seven months of
the 1988 fiscal year to $105 billion. But that was more than $20
billion higher than the $84.3 billion gap for the same period a
year ago.
   Nevertheless, the administration still is officially projecting
that the tide of red ink will recede from $150.2 billion in 1987 to
$146.7 billion when the budget year ends Sept. 30.

   The Contra guerrillas are leaving Nicaragua
``at a high rate'' because they are hungry and searching for food
in neighboring Honduras, the head of the U.S. foreign aid program
says.
   The American-supported Contras are moving because they have been
blocked from receiving supplies at their jungle bases in Nicaragua,
said Alan Woods, administrator of the Agency for International
Development.
   Woods told a Senate subcommittee Friday that ``there are people
inside Nicaragua who are desperate ... we've had reports of people
eating tree roots.''
   Woods declined to estimate how many people were involved, but
other administration officials have said that up to 3,000 rebels
have fled into neighboring Honduras in recent weeks to look for
food.

   An aging Pioneer spacecraft that
gave scientists their first close-up look at Venus continues to
yield secrets of the cloud-shrouded planet 10 years after its
launch, NASA says.
   The Pioneer orbiter has revealed many previously unknown
features of Venus, whose thick veil of sulfuric acid clouds has
kept Earth's telescopes from seeing its 800-degree surface.
   ``It challenges our thinking to try to understand why did Venus
evolve in such a different fashion than Earth,'' project scientist
Larry Colin said Friday. ``And are there any lessons to be learned
there in terms of the direction our own climate is evolving?''
   The probe, with some adjustments, should continue to send data
until it burns up in the Venusian atmosphere when its fuel runs out
in the summer of 1992, said Colin and project manager Richard
Fimmel.

   Communist Party authorities on Saturday fired the
leaders of the southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan in an
apparent effort to prevent more of the ethnic turmoil that has
killed at least 32 people this year.
   The official Tass news agency said Karen Demirchyan, first
secretary of Armenia's Communist Party, was ousted during a meeting
of his republic's Central Committee in the capital city of Yerevan.
Azerbaijani party First Secretary Kyamran Bagirov was fired during
a meeting in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, Tass said.
   Tass said Demirchyan and Bagirov were retired for health
reasons. But their replacement likely reflected dissatisfaction in
Moscow with their failure to contain the dispute over control of
the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   Armenians are demanding that the Armenian-dominated region be
annexed to their republic. After a period of quiet following riots
in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait in which at least 26 Armenians
and six Azerbaijanis were killed, mass meetings were reported again
last week by Armenian activists and the official Baku radio.

   Police sweeps of gang-infested neighborhoods
seem to have lowered dramatically the number of ``drive-by''
shootings this spring, even though most of those arrested have
quickly been released, officials say.
   Authorities concede that many of the 1,456 people nabbed during
last month's sweeps were back in their neighborhoods within days.
But they insist there are indications the streets are being retaken
by officers.
   While the news media focus on almost nightly gang violence,
often involving innocent victims, Deputy Chief Robert Rathburn
notes the drop in ``drive-by'' shootings since his task force
roundups began.
   ``We have been averaging 26 drive-bys a month in 77th Division
(a South Central gang hotbed) and we only had seven in April and
two so far this month,'' Rathburn said last week.

<HEAD>`St. Elsewhere' Leaves at Top of Form With Surprise Ending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Wayne Fiscus, soon to depart for
humanitarian work in Nicaragua, reminisces about his three years at
St. Eligius: ``Grueling hours, bad food, egomania, death and moral
confusion. It'll be hard to leave.''
   For its loyal viewers, too, it'll be hard to leave ``St.
Elsewhere,'' the NBC series that after six seasons becomes
television history with Wednesday's final episode, ``The Last
One.'' In terms of unbridled creativity, it was arguably the best
series ever on network television.
   The conclusion is suitably daft and won't be revealed here.
Suffice it to say that the impact of the final seconds will take a
minute to sink in, but the ending is perfect. Think Kafka.
   When ``St. Elsewhere'' premiered, it was compared to the
still-new ``Hill Street Blues,'' also from MTM Productions, that
broke ground with a similar messy style: characters talking over
each other and shaky, hand-held camera shots. ``Hill Street'' bowed
out at the end of last season.
   Writing set ``St. Elsewhere'' apart. Hip, weird, heartfelt and
very funny, no subject was too taboo, no character safe from
bizarre plot twists.
   Dr. Caldwell (Mark Harmon) turned from playboy to victim of
AIDS. Dr. Peter White (Terence Knox) was a rapist. Dr. Morrison
(David Morse) got raped. Fiscus (Howie Mandel) had a near-death
experience and took a tour of the afterlife. Dr. Axelrod (Stephen
Furst) died of a heart attack. Nurse Helen Rosenthal (Christina
Pickles) got breast cancer and addicted to drugs. A patient was
killed by a folding hospital bed. Doctors performed surgery in the
nude. A coroner only got turned on in the morgue. And Dr. Westphall
(Ed Flanders), the saint of St. Eligius, told off his new corporate
boss (Ronny Cox) by baring his behind in prime time.
   The show figuratively mooned NBC after the network made the
producers change the name ``Ecumena,'' the corporation that bought
St. Eligius at the start of the season, because the real-life
hospital chain, Humana Inc., sued for copyright infringement. The
writers put a lawsuit plotline in the show, and characters
complained about corporate bosses folding under pressure.
   The writers poked fun at television, especially MTM. In one
episode, a male patient fervently believed he was Mary Richards
from ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and was ecstatic when guest star
Betty White showed up _ ``Sue Ann!'' There were jokes on MTM shows
``The White Shadow'' and ``Newhart,'' and on TV in general. When a
patient played by an actor from ``The Andy Griffith Show'' needed a
haircut, the barber's name was Floyd. In the final episode, Fiscus
treats a man suffering eyestrain from watching too much tube.
   ``St. Elsewhere'' writers perfected the unlikely art of the hip
pun and managed to tuck a rock lyric into the dialogue of virtually
every show. Samples from Bruce Paltrow and Mark Tinker's final
script _ ``Jumpin' Jack! What was that flash?'' And ``Move that
gurney, Hal!'' a reference to Hal Gurnee, director of ``Late Night
with David Letterman.''
   What can be revealed of the final plot without disservice to
fans is that snooty Dr. Craig (William Daniels) is banished to
Cleveland. Reminded that the city is home of the Rock 'n' Roll Hall
of Fame, he sniffs, ``Yeah, yeah, yeah.'' The move sheds his
sycophant, Dr. Victor Ehrlich (Ed Begley Jr.), who declares after
another fawning surgery session, ``I'd follow you to the ends of
the earth. But not to Cleveland!''
   Early in the episode, an airplane crashes through a wall, but it
is never mentioned by anyone except Westphall's autistic son, who
mutters with mild interest, ``Plane.''
   Despite unfounded rumors that the producers intended to kill off
every character in the final episode, the only one to succumb is
Dr. Auschlander (Norman Lloyd), the liver cancer specialist who got
liver cancer. But he does manage to arrange the return of the
hospital to the Catholic Diocese and the return of Westphall to run
it.
   Paltrow, Tinker and Tom Fontana have a promising new series,
``Tattinger's,'' on NBC's fall schedule. But the real reason ``St.
Elsewhere'' won't be back is financial. Hour shows are not selling
well in syndication, and MTM has been producing the show at a loss.
   There could have been many more years in ``St. Elsewhere,'' but
it might not be so bad for a fine show to leave at the top of its
form.

<HEAD>A One-Night Concert Revival of `Hair' in New York</HEAD>

   Twenty years ago last month, ``Hair'' brought
the Age of Aquarius to Broadway and the American musical theater
was never quite the same.
   The show, with its contemporary sound and free-wheeling, almost
non-existent book, ran for more than 1,700 performances, spawning
countless touring and foreign companies as well as a successful
movie. Now it is back in New York for one night only, this time in
a unique concert version at the United Nations that will be a
benefit for children with AIDS.
   The concert, to be held May 26 at the U.N. General Assembly
Hall, will reunite the musical's creators _ James Rado, Jerome
Ragni and Galt MacDermot _ as well as many performers who appeared
in various companies of ``Hair'' or the film version.
   The ``Hair'' alumni include Melba Moore, Paul Jabara, Heather
MacRae, Treat Williams, Nell Carter, Andre De Shields and Donna
Summer. Among the other performers scheduled to appear are Bea
Arthur, Frank Stallone, Jay Leno, Rex Smith and Chuck Mangione as
well as a large cast of young, unknown singers.
   ``After 20 years, the anniversary came up and we said, `What are
we doing to do with it?''' Ragni said the other day. ``People told
us to do a big reunion of `Hair' kids and make it just a `Hair'
celebration. We didn't want to do that. In a way, `Hair' was always
used as a rallying point.''
   They found a new rallying point in the plight of children with
AIDS and the money raised from the concert _ ticket prices are
scaled from $250 to $5,000 _ will go to the United States Committee
for UNICEF and the Creo Society's Fund for Children with AIDS.
   ``Hair'' was the most influential of the rock musicals that hit
Broadway and off-Broadway during the late 1960s and early '70s.
More than any other rock show, it integrated the pop music sound of
the day into the Broadway musical.
   Tim Rice, lyricist for such ``Hair''-inspired musicals as
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``Evita,'' calls it ``one of the
best Broadway scores ever written.''
   ``Hair'' was also one of the most popular. It spawned four top
four singles on the American pop record charts. Each was sung by a
different artist. Incredibly, one song got to the No. 1 spot,
``Aquarius,'' by the Fifth Dimension; another to No. 2, ``Hair,''
sung by the Cowsills; a third to No. 3, ``Good Morning,
Starshine,'' by Oliver; and a fourth to No. 4, ``Easy to Be Hard,''
by Three Dog Night.
   The musical first opened in New York off-Broadway in October
1967 at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. The
following April it was remounted, recast and redirected and moved
to Broadway's Biltmore Theater.
   Rado and Ragni were in the cast. Rado played a young man named
Claude who was about to be drafted and spends his remaining free
hours with a tribe of first-spirited individuals on the outskirts
of conventional society.
   When the show is done today _ and it still has revivals around
the country _ it's done as a period piece, Rado says.
   ``There's nothing from that era that really showed what went on
with the hippie movement, what that time was about,'' Ragni said.
``It touched on the anti-war movement, racism, the ecology movement
and a lot of other things. All this was going on at the same time.''
   The title of the concert is ``Hair . . . For The Next
Generation,'' and for the show, the trio has composed 18 new songs
including several with such titles as ``Plant Love,'' ``Ozone'' and
``Sweet American'' that sound like they will fit right into the
show. Twelve of the new numbers will be used in the concert as well
as most of the original songs.
   ``We thought, `What would ``Hair'' be like now?' So we wrote
those kinds of songs,'' said Ragni. ``What's the difference between
now and then?''
   The children of today are ready to embrace this show again, its
creators say, and the concert may be the first step toward a new
edition of the show that may play the West Coast and work its way
east.
   ``There is such a revival of the '60s going on right now,''
Ragni said. ```What was that era about?, a lot of them are asking.''
   ``These kids are wondering what their parents were like or what
the kids in those days were like,'' said Rado. ``This show still
gives them a good idea.''

<HEAD>Diplomatic Reciprocity Means Amazingly Similar Summits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 23rd graf to CORRECT that Reagan speech will be May 31,
sted June 31</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan leaves this week for a summit
in Moscow that, under a diplomatic code of reciprocity, will be
amazingly similar to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit in
Washington late last year.
   Begin with their cars. Gorbachev shipped his Zil limousine to
Washington instead of relying on his host for transportation, so
Reagan will follow suit, sending his armored Cadillac to Moscow.
   Gorbachev met in Washington with American writers, actors, news
executives and businessmen. Reagan will meet in Moscow with monks,
dissidents, students, writers, artists and filmmakers.
   Gorbachev gave an interview in Moscow to NBC anchorman Tom
Brokaw. Reagan sat down at the White House with Moscow television
correspondents Valentin Zorin and Boris Kalyagin for an interview
that will be broadcast May 27 in the Soviet Union.
   The two leaders gave dinners for each other in Washington;
they'll do the same in Moscow.
   White House planners even counted the number of meetings the two
leaders had in Washington and checked the time they spent together.
That provided the basis for planning the Moscow summit.
   ``I would expect that the actual formal meeting times will
closely reflect the meeting times here _ maybe a little bit more
but not an awful lot,'' said Tom Griscom, the White House
communications chief and a key architect of Reagan's trip.
   ``You can blink your eye and see a difference here or there, but
it is set up so that there is a commonality to what we're doing,''
Griscom said.
   Reagan will arrive in Moscow on May 29, a Sunday, after a
four-night stop in Helsinki, Finland. He will be the first American
president in 14 years to visit the Soviet capital.
   Officials in both countries say there is no chance the summit
will produce a new arms treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons.
However, they are expected to sign a variety of other agreements,
dealing with issues such as ocean pollution, search and rescue
missions at sea, fishing, and cultural programs.
   Moreover, minor agreements on providing notice of missile tests
and on nuclear testing also are expected to be ready for signature.
   Reagan will see Gorbachev on Sunday in St. George's Hall in the
Kremlin Palace, the first of five official summit meetings.
   Two rounds of talks are planned at the Kremlin on Monday,
another meeting is planned on Tuesday and the fifth and final
official session is set for Wednesday, after which time has been
set aside for a signing ceremony.
   In Washington, Gorbachev held a news conference after the
summit. Reagan is slated to meet with reporters June 1, the day
before he leaves Moscow for an overnight stop in London on his way
back to Washington.
   There will be some small twists in the schedule in Moscow.
   For example, Gorbachev has invited the Reagans to the Bolshoi
Theater for a special ballet presentation Wednesday evening,
followed by an intimate dinner at a country cottage outside Moscow.
Nothing like that occurred in Washington.
   Moreover, Reagan will arrive on a Sunday and depart on a
Thursday, visiting with Gorbachev formally or informally on each of
the five days.
   On his trip to Washington last December, Gorbachev arrived on a
Monday but did not see Reagan until Tuesday. They held three days
of talks, with the Soviet leader departing on a Thursday.
   The planning for Reagan's trip actually started when the Soviets
were here last fall arranging Gorbachev's visit in December.
   ``What we tried to do was to recognize last year that whatever
we did in Washington would probably have an impact on what we were
going to do in Moscow, and that reciprocity is very important,''
Griscom said.
   ``And so, in looking at this schedule coming up, we used the
Washington summit schedule as the model to build from, particularly
for the official part of the schedule: the number of meetings,
dinners and things like that,''
   Unlike Gorbachev, who received his visitors at the Soviet
Embassy, Reagan will go out to his audiences instead of bringing
them to him.
   The major speech of his trip will be delivered on May 31 before
students at Moscow University. A question and answer session also
is planned.
   Reagan also plans to visit a monastery on the outskirts of
Moscow to watch monks restore icons, and to have lunch with
writers, artists and filmmakers at the House of Writers.
   Reagan is known as ``the great communicator,'' and Griscom said,
``Part of his communication is not just the spoken word but where
it's delivered, how it's delivered. ... I think the fact that this
president will go to Moscow University to speak to the students
will have an impact on them.
   ``I tend to think that they will appreciate that fact, that he
came to them, that he was willing to take his time out to come to
where they were, rather than to lift them up and move them where he
might be,'' Griscom said.

<HEAD>Weathering The Soybean Rally Is A Risky Proposition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD containing weekly
price trends.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The charging soybean futures market has attracted many new
investors who are betting on a continuation of this spring's dry
weather to drive prices even higher.
   But weather markets are risky, and experts warn that a sudden
shower could wash profits away.
   ``Where we try to be careful with our investors is to let them
know just that, that a weather scare can just as easily turn around
with tomorrow's forecast,'' said Penny Wydominic, a marketing vice
president at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. in New York.
   The combination of diminishing soybean stockpiles and unusually
dry conditions during the spring planting period has pushed soybean
futures prices to four-year highs on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid mounting fears of tight supplies.
   Even though planting is only about half finished, and despite
the fact that growers in the South can safely delay planting of
fast-growing soybeans until early July, trading of soybean futures
has reached frenzied proportions at times during the past two weeks.
   The wheat, corn and oat markets have also been strong but the
gains in soybeans have been dramatic.
   Prices have soared more than 25 percent since mid-March; the
contract for May delivery of soybeans expired Thursday at $7.77 a
bushel compared to $6.11{ on April 16. Soybean trading volume has
nearly tripled.
   The open-interest figures tell another part of the story.
Soybean open interest _ the tally of outstanding orders and a rough
indicator of the number of new players in the market _ has jumped
about 30 percent since mid-March.
   ``We're getting phone calls from people who've never been
involved with this stuff before looking to get in,'' said Walter
Spilka, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York.
   ``I would say that what you're seeing first is people who
speculate in other commodities moving easily into the grains,''
Spilka said. ``Then you're probably also seeing people who have
been, for instance, in the stock market or the bond market, who
again are speculative by nature, making more inquiries about the
prospects for commodities and grains.''
   Ms. Wydominic agreed: ``What you're seeing is people looking for
alternative places to earn a good rate of return.
   ``People who have been involved in the stock market are looking
for another good story,'' she said. ``The grains and soybeans have
certainly presented a good story and it's a relatively easy thing
for (investors) to understand: The weather's not good, soybean
supplies are short and it provides a good weather market
opportunity.''
   The soaring prices and increasing talk of drought have long-time
traders recalling previous soybean rallies, including the one 15
years ago in which soybean futures hit an all-time high of $12.90 a
bushel on June 5, 1973.
   But experienced observers also recalled that in a weather
market, the change can come as suddenly as a summer storm.
   ``It has at times dropped faster than it went up,'' said Robert
Wisner, Iowa State University extension economist in Ames, Iowa.
``In times past, we have seen bull markets like this end with as
much as three days of limit-down moves.''
   For soybean futures, in which prices are permitted to fluctuate
no more than 30 cents a day, that would translate into a loss of 90
cents a bushel, or $4,500 per 5,000-bushel contract.
   ``The person who's trading these markets needs to be well versed
in charting techniques and indicators like the relative price
index, which shows the soybean market is overbought and due for a
correction,'' Wisner said. ``It could come down sharply in the
event of rain.''
   Wisner said investors attracted by the strong soybean market but
looking to limit their exposure should consider options, which
allow players to set their maximum risk exposure in advance.

<TEXT>
   The golden leaf of tobacco is offering little
shade from the heat generated by U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop's declaration that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.
   His report lumping nicotine with heroin and cocaine as
physiologically addictive drugs underscored the seeming
contradiction between the government's support of tobacco prices
and its warnings about using the product.
   But at the Agriculture Department, where cafeteria patrons have
no-smoking or smoking areas, ban-the-butt crusades are viewed with
a certain cynicism. The attitude is that Congress makes the laws,
and if Congress wants the farm price of tobacco supported at
minimum levels, it's USDA's job to do it.
   ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes
and other forms of tobacco are addicting,'' Koop said last week in
the surgeon general's annual report on smoking and health. ``An
extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in
tobacco that causes addiction.''
   The USDA has run federal price supports for tobacco since the
early 1930s. Basically, in return for going along with controls on
plantings and marketings, growers are assured a floor price on what
they produce.
   The anti-smoking campaigns have affected cigarette use, although
it's hard to be precise about their impact, says Verner Grise of
the department's Economic Research Service. Price increases by
cigarette manufacturers and rising taxes have boosted retail costs
sharply, prompting some smokers to quit or cut down.
   Since 1981, total U.S. cigarette consumption has dropped more
than 10 percent, and last year Americans consumed 575 billion
cigarettes, or ``pieces,'' the fewest since 1972.
   Grise said the decline in domestic cigarette use isn't over and
the surgeon general's report last week will add to the downturn.
   ``I don't know that we'll see any accelerated drop in
consumption, but certainly it (the report) will be a factor in the
continued drop in consumption of one-half to 2 percent a year,''
Grise said in an interview.
   Grise said he thinks that ``there will be a push for an
additional warning label'' on cigarette packages to indicate
nicotine is addictive. ``And I suppose that a push for prohibition
or restrictions on where minors can buy cigarettes ... is going to
be stepped up,'' he said.
   More than 40 states and the District of Columbia have laws that
either ban smoking in certain places or segregate smokers from
non-smokers. At least 10 states regulate smoking in workplaces.
   The rate of smoking cigarettes by adults 18 years and older
peaked at 4,345 cigarettes a year _ more than 217 packs of 20 each
_ in 1963 and has generally declined since then. Last year's
average was 3,201 cigarattes, or 160 packs, the lowest since World
War II.
   The figures are used statistically to compare year-to-year
changes and include both smokers and non-smokers.
   Meanwhile, U.S. cigarette exports are up sharply _ a record
100.2 billion pieces last year, a 56 percent jump from 1986.
   With domestic use declining, the export market grows in
importance to the cigarette industry. An additional boost could
have been provided if a proposal by tobacco-state lawmakers had
succeeded.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee, at the urging of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., last year inserted in the trade bill a move to make
tobacco exports eligible for Export Enhancement Program subsidies,
with any resultant losses to be borne by the USDA's Commodity
Credit Corp.
   The panel acted without much fanfare and major debate did not
come until the measure moved to the Senate floor.
   The Senate last July 10 killed, 51-43, an attempt by Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., to delete the plan from the bill.
   Chafee claimed the $39 million cost estimated by the
Congressional Budget Office represented a violation of the 1982
no-net-cost agreement governing the tobacco program.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and other tobacco-state lawmakers
retorted that the agreement was never supposed to have affected
export programs and that in any case it was not a smoking issue but
an economic one.
   No similar measure, however, was contained in the House version
of the legislation and when the trade bill went to a House-Senate
conference committee the tobacco provision was quietly dropped.
   The 1982 No-Net-Cost Tobacco Program Act required that growers
had to pay, through assessments, the costs of operating the federal
support program. To be eligible, producers of most kinds of tobacco
are required to go along with federal production controls.
   In 1986, additional legislation changed the quota-setting
procedure, price support levels and the no-net-cost assessments for
flue-cured and burley tobacco, the main types produced by U.S.
growers. The changes were aimed at making U.S. tobacco more
competitive in world markets and to bring supplies into balance
with demands.
   Grise said the no-net-cost law has worked and, combined with the
1986 changes, has put the government's tobacco program on a much
sounder basis.
   ``Except for $10 million to $15 million of administrative costs,
the tobacco program in recent years hasn't cost the taxpayer any
money,'' Grise said.
   Even before the 1982 law, tobacco support operations were
relatively small compared with those for some other farm
commodities that piled up huge crop surpluses and then cost a lot
to dispose of, he said.
   According to USDA, in the 1986 fiscal year, for example, net
outlays by the Commodity Credit Corp. were a record $25.8 billion.
Of that, tobacco support operations cost $253 million, compared
with $12.1 billion for feed grains, $3.44 billion for wheat, $2.34
billion for dairy, and $2.14 billion for cotton.
   Since then, there have been no net outlays by CCC for tobacco,
according to department figures.
   The tobacco industry says more than 700,000 Americans earn at
least part of their incomes from tobacco, and that retail sales of
more than $30 billion a year generate $9 billion in federal and
state tax revenues.
   At the producer level, Grise says the 1982 census of agriculture
showed about 179,000 tobacco farms in the country but he says those
probably have declined to fewer than 170,000. In 1954, there were
about 512,000.
   Last year's tobacco harvest came from 601,700 acres in 16
states. Total output was around 1.23 billion pounds, with 65
percent produced in North Carolina and Kentucky. In all, according
to USDA, the 1987 crop had a farm value of $1.93 billion, making
tobacco the sixth-ranked U.S. commodity in terms of value. Corn led
at $12.1 billion.

<BYLINE>Has the Fed `Wimped Out' on Interest Rates?
^By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The continued buildup of inflation anxiety this
past week has left many bond traders wondering if the Federal
Reserve has ``wimped out'' on its interest rate policy.
   Fears have been mounting in recent weeks in financial markets
that robust economic growth could ignite high inflation. The
tension has driven down bond prices and pushed up interest rates to
their highest levels since last December.
   Many traders have been expecting the Fed to nudge interest rates
still higher, in an effort to cool inflationary pressure. But the
central bank _ which did respond earlier this month _ is apparently
reluctant to tighten credit any further for now.
   The Fed governors are ``resting on their monetary oars,'' said
William Sullivan, director of money-market research for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Some market observers, much less flatteringly, referred to the
Fed's inaction as ``wimping out.''
   ``The Fed is suffering from an extreme bout of
election-year-itis,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist and
senior vice president of the fixed-income division of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. He reflected the feeling in some
quarters that the Fed is buckling under pressure from the Reagan
administration not to raise interest rates, since that could hurt
the chances of Republican presidential contender George Bush.
   The perception that the central bank is staying the course and
not pushing rates higher helped bond prices recover Thursday from a
three-day selloff. Most observers believe that the Fed's
policy-making arm, its Federal Open Market Committee, decided at a
meeting last Tuesday not to tighten rates.
   Traders said bond prices also were cushioned during the week by
a ``flight to safety'' by investors fleeing the eroding stock
market into the relative security of bonds or more liquid
investments like money-market accounts. Among bonds, the trend
mainly helped short-term issues such as three-month Treasury bills,
since they offer greater liquidity to jittery investors.
   ``People are definitely leaning toward more marketable''
investments, said Jack Baker, the head of block stock trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The markets' inflation anxiety was aggravated last Tuesday, when
the Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
was sliced by more than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion _ the
lowest monthly shortfall since March 1985.
   The seemingly positive trade report was taken as bad news by the
stock and bond markets. Traders saw the big boom in exports in
March as another sign the economy could be overheating dangerously.
   Friday's report that consumer prices rose a modest 0.4 percent
in April, a level that had been widely anticipated, failed to
dispel the markets' inflation worries. Investors remained fearful
that the economy is growing so quickly that inflation may
eventually accelerate.
   The yield on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped
to 9.22 percent Tuesday, the day of the trade report, from 9.11
percent late Monday. The long bond traded Friday at around 9.33
percent, its highest level since it hit 9.40 percent last Dec. 14.
   The rate on three-month Treasury bills, which apparently
benefited strongly from the ``flight to safety'' out of Wall
Street, fell to 6.14 percent late Thursday from 6.30 percent on
Tuesday. But it moved up on Friday to 6.42 percent.

<HEAD>Computer Standard-Setting: No Way To Run A Railroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computers would be easier to use if the
companies that make them would stop their bickering, something that
became clear this past week in a bitter battle over a
simplification plan.
   The fight over Unix, a base layer of computer software, is
reminiscent of the days when railroads laid tracks of different
gauges and couldn't agree who should rip theirs up.
   Railroad museums have pictures showing that stevedores once had
to lug freight between trains that couldn't run on the same tracks.
   Most railroads overcame their differences decades ago, but
computer makers are still at each other's throats.
   There are few pure hearts in the fight over computer standards,
which pits American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the upstart Sun
Microsystems Inc. against International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and four others.
   Customers are clamoring for Unix, the prize in this battle,
because it allows them to run the same programs on different kinds
of computers.
   As things are now, it's as if someone had to buy one kind of
television to watch ``Dallas'' and another kind to watch ``Monday
Night Football.''
   AT&T made the telephone easy to use and says it can do the same
for computers. AT&T invented Unix and wants to continue controlling
its development, with Sun's help.
   But by the end of the week, some people were saying that AT&T
had miscalculated, alienating not only its rivals but some
customers as well.
   William H. Anderson, the computer chief for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said AT&T had performed a ``disservice'' to
customers by altering Unix to make it more dependent on a computer
chip designed by its partner, Sun Microsystems.
   AT&T denies it has doctored Unix for its own purposes. The
company says Unix is in good hands and questions the motives of
some of its rivals, which want to turn over development of Unix to
an Open Software Foundation.
   The foundation, announced Tuesday, is backed by $90 million over
its first three years. Its mission is to create a computing
``environment'' that would include a unified version of Unix.
   AT&T is refusing to join the foundation, and there is a
possibility that Unix will split in half just as it reaches the big
leagues.
   ``I think that AT&T has not learned that it is no longer
possible for a single company to control standards,'' said Marvin
Sirbu, a computer standards expert at Carnegie-Mellon University
who takes the side of the Open Software Foundation.
   The stakes are high. Computer systems that primarily use Unix
are likely to make up 22 percent of a $120 billion world market by
1991, up from 6 percent of an $87 billion world market in 1986,
International Data Corp. estimates.
   Some AT&T executives are hinting that IBM and Digital might
impede progress toward a unified Unix for selfish reasons.
   It is indisputable that computer makers such as IBM and Digital
benefit when they can lock customers into their own, private
operating systems. That way they can charge more for products
because there is less competition. Customers can't afford to switch
to another supplier because they would have to junk all their
existing equipment.
   But like it or not, IBM and Digital are being pushed to support
open operating systems such as Unix because customers are demanding
them.
   Prudential-Bache is insisting on Unix for many uses because it
allows the company to choose computers with the best combination of
price and performance without worrying that they won't be able to
run the company's software, Anderson said.
   Anderson dismisses the theory that IBM and Digital would try to
fragment Unix to keep customers using their own, private operating
systems. ``I've listened to talk like that for the last 30 years,''
he said.
   Other observers are more willing to attribute ulterior motives
to IBM and Digital. But they say any impulses by those companies to
undermine Unix would be checked by Hewlett-Packard, Apollo Computer
Inc. and other members of the new foundation.
   By Thursday, realizing it was losing ground in the
public-relations battle, AT&T said it was willing to cooperate with
the foundation and might some day put Unix development into a
separate AT&T group at arm's length from the Data Systems Division.
   Forty years after the first computers, visionaries are still
waiting for the day when word processing will be as easy as food
processing and searching a data base will be as simple as thumbing
through an encyclopedia.
   Standardizing on Unix is a step in that direction, as are
setting standards for the ways computers hook up in networks and
achieving some uniformity in the ``look and feel'' of computer
software.
   Unfortunately, each move toward standards seems to involve a
fight. Apple Computer Inc., for example, is suing Hewlett-Packard
for copyright infringement over the similar appearance of their
software.

   A history of conflict between computer makers has left customers
wondering whether their interests are being slighted.
   Peter Marx, a Boston lawyer, said he would try to build a united
front of computer users to give customers more clout with groups
such as the Open Software Foundation.
   Some people in the industry preferred to declare a plague on
both of the warring groups.
   ``The polarized posturing of these companies cannot help the
real headway that was being made towards openness in operating
systems standards. As such, this is a great pity and a disregard of
customers' real interests,'' Fred Wang, president of Wang
Laboratories Inc., said in a statement.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _A record level of export sales reduced the U.S. trade deficit
in March to $9.7 billion, lowest in three years. The news, although
good, depressed the stock market by reviving fears of increased
inflation. In reports for the month of April, the government said
consumer prices climbed 0.4 percent, industrial production surged
0.7 percent, factory utilization edged up 0.3 percent and
single-family home building declined 6.9 percent.
   _The Reagan administration working group on the stock market
crash issued a report recommending a variety of modest financial
market changes. Some criticized the report as weak, but others,
including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, said the market
may have to learn to live with post-crash volatility.
   _Fifty of the wealthiest American universities lost an average
of 13.1 percent of their endowments last fall in the stock market
crash, a college business group reported. By comparison, common
stock values overall dropped 22.6 percent during the final three
months of 1987.
   _The biggest commercial airplane order in history was split
between Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie of Europe, with Boeing
grabbing most of the $5.04 billion, 130-plane purchase by
International Lease Finance Corp.
   _Eastman Kodak Co. agreed to reimburse at least 4.2 million
owners of its obsolete instant cameras as part of a settlement of a
class action lawsuit. U.S. owners of the cameras would receive
between $50 and $70 in cash and coupons.
   _E.F. Hutton & Co. paid $1.01 million in fines for a
money-laundering scheme in which $1.5 million in cash was hidden
from the government for clients, some of them members of organized
crime.
   _The Wall Street Journal reported that flamboyant financier Paul
Bilzerian, now chairman of Singer Co., was the target of major
Securities and Exchange Commission and federal grand jury
investigations for possibly violating a litany of securities laws.
   _Takeover strategist Asher B. Edelman and a Midwestern building
materials company said they had purchased a 7.6 percent stake in
Payless Cashways Inc. and may try to acquire the company.
   _Texaco Inc. and Carl Icahn, its biggest shareholder, discussed
how to resolve their differences without continuing a proxy fight
over five seats on the oil giant's board.
   _A group led by Texas financier Robert M. Bass offered to pay
about $1.5 billion for the 91 percent interest in the publishing
concern Macmillan Inc. that it doesn't already own. The management
of the company said it was not for sale.
   _Merv Griffin and Donald Trump resumed their on-again, off-again
negotiations for control of Resorts International Inc., a week
after talks about the casino company collapsed.
   _Irving Bank Corp. said its board rejected Bank of New York's
sweetened takeover bid. Irving said talks continued on a friendly
merger with a big Italian bank.
   _Investor Burt Sugarman, apparently conceding that his $1.8
billion bid for Media General Inc. had stalled, suggested splitting
the communications firm into two or more parts.
   _American Stores Co. and Lucky Stores Inc. reached agreement on
American's $2.5 billion acquisition of Lucky, which would create
one of the largest supermarket chains in the country.
   _The Interstate Commerce Commission gave final approval to the
$80 million merger of Greyhound and Trailways, the nation's two
largest bus companies. The two bus lines have been operating as a
single carrier since last July.
   _The House Banking Committee approved legislation requiring
lenders to make full disclosure on home equity loans.
   _The General Accounting Office said the liabilities of the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. exceeded its assets by
$13.7 billion at the end of 1987, worse than the $6.3 billion
deficit a year earlier.
   _A General Services Administration appeals panel found
discrimination against AT&T by the agency's employees in awarding
contracts. It canceled four contracts that had been awarded to the
company's rivals and ordered them given to AT&T.
   _Steel executives and industry analysts, meeting in Washington,
D.C., said downward pressure on wages has eased, but savings from
other production costs remained top priorities. The group also
urged extension of import quotas on steel products.

<HEAD>Program Traders Get Important Boost From Fed Chief, Market's
Behavior</HEAD>

   Program trading, a prime target of Wall Street's
post-crash scapegoat searchers, received two key defenses this past
week, one from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and the
other from the market's own behavior.
   Greenspan's endorsement of the computerized trading strategy
convinced one major brokerage to reconsider the voluntary ban it
had placed on the most controversial form of program trading, index
arbitrage.
   Bear Stearns & Co. suspended index arbitrage earlier this month,
partly in response to a growing public outcry that the practice had
injected volatility into the market, devastating investor
confidence and scaring away business.
   Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Inc.
and Kidder Peabody & Co. also suspended index arbitrage for their
own accounts, although they have said they would continue to use it
for clients if asked.
   In index arbitrage, brokerages use computers to instantly sell
big baskets of stocks in New York while simultaneously buying the
equivalent stock-index futures in Chicago, or vice versa, to profit
from price discrepancies.
   This strategy, devised about five years ago, has been credited
with helping sustain the 1982-87 bull market that preceded the
October collapse. But some studies have suggested that index
arbitrage also played a role in the wild price swings that
accompanied the crash and the market's spasms since then.
   Testifying before Congress, Greenspan argued that index
arbitrage isn't the destructive influence critics claim, but
instead helps stabilize the market by keeping the prices of index
futures and stocks from varying too widely.
   ``It is a mistake to single out one segment of the broad
marketplace as the culprit for large and rapid price movements,''
said Greenspan, who is a member of a special presidential panel
that has studied the causes of the crash. The panel has recommended
no major changes in any professional trading techniques.
   Some prominent critics of index arbitrage program trading were
stunned by Greenspan's statement.
   ``As much as I admire and respect Mr. Greenspan, I almost fell
off my chair when I read that,'' said Robert Kirby, head of Capital
Guardian Trust Co. in Los Angeles, which had threatened to boycott
brokerages that use index arbitrage for their own accounts.
   ``I just think computer-driven program trading is a disruptive
influence,'' Kirby said. ``He could be right and I could be wrong,
but I sure don't agree with him.''
   Perhaps a more significant defense of index arbitrage than
Greenspan's remarks was the market's action itself this past week.
Although the biggest users of the technique were absent, it did
little to calm investor anxiety or bring back the disenchanted.
   On the contrary, many traders said another excuse was found to
dump stocks: fear of inflation and higher interest rates, despite
the best monthly trade news in three years. The Dow Jones
industrial average hit its lowest point in more than three months
last Wednesday, closing at 1,951.09.
   The key index of 30 industrial stocks finished the week barely
above that level at 1,952.59, bringing its loss for the week to
37.95.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2 to 143.30;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
6.45 to 366.03; and the American Stock Exchange market value index
fell 6.10 to 291.84.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 156.80 million shares a day vs.
153.07 million the week before.
   Despite the thin volume and falling prices, some trading
strategists said they believed the absence of index arbitrage as a
force in the market had caused a noticeable and welcome change.
   For one thing, they said fewer speculators were taking positions
in advance of computerized buy or sell programs, and investors were
basing their decisions more on the long-term merits of stocks
rather than quick-profit opportunities.
   ``The market isn't as jerky,'' said James Cramer, an outspoken
critic of index arbitrage and president of a small investment firm
that bears his name. ``Buyers come in because stocks are
attractive. We're not seeing the short-term hot money and fast
traders.''

   Irving Bank Corp. has amended it ``poison pill''
takeover defense to prevent hostile suitor Bank of New York Co.
from carrying out its threat to buy up Irving stock and operate the
bank as a subsidiary.
   Irving announced Friday that in a special meeting its board of
directors rejected Bank of New York's sweetened takeover bid. The
board refused to rescind its poison pill, a condition under which
Bank of New York had proposed to slightly raise the stock portion
of its $1.1 billion hostile offer.
   Instead, Irving said, the directors amended the defensive
provision so that it would be activated should someone acquire at
least 20 percent of Irving shares on the open market. The poison
pill previously would have gone into effect in the event of a
takeover not supported by management.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said: ``The action taken
by Irving's board ... is clearly invalid.''
   The company said it asked the New York State Supreme Court on
Friday to act quickly to invalidate Irving's poison pill. A hearing
was set for May 24.
   Bank of New York had threatened to proceed with its orignal
tender offer by Tuesday and run Irving separately, provided at
least two-thirds of Irving's 18.5 million outstanding shares were
tendered.
   Irving's management, meanwhile, supports a friendly merger with
Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, a major state-run Italian
institution.
   ``A lot depends now on what the court rules,'' said Michael
Alpert, a banking analyst with Bear Stearns. ``If it (the poison
pill) is ruled valid it will make it more difficult for the Bank of
New York to acquire Irving unless there's a negotiated settlement.''
   Poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by
greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition. In Irving's case,
existing shareholders would be permitted to buy stock in an
acquiring company at about half price.
   Brady said that as of Monday, Bank of New York held about 50
percent of Irving's stock, including shares it owned or had been
tendered to it.
   Also Friday, Irving filed suit in U.S. District Court against
the Bank of New York alleging its unwanted suitor was in violation
of federal securities laws by failing to notify shareholders of the
financial ramfications of its amended offer. It said Bank of New
York also failed to disclose the effects of its proposal to operate
Irving as a subsidiary.
   Bank of New York, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in Irving and
had received conditional regulatory approval for an Irving merger,
had offered to raise the stock portion of its bid to 1.675 Bank of
New York shares from 1.575 shares, adding $3.20 per share to the
deal and pushing its value to around $1.2 billion. The $15 cash
portion would remain the same.
   The proposal came after Irving announced a preliminary proxy
count showed its shareholders re-elected its board of directors,
rejecting a rival slate put forward by Bank of New York. The
hostile suitor has since questioned the results and says it may
file a formal challenge.
   Banca Commerciale, Italy's second largest bank, is offering $75
a share for 9.5 million Irving shares, or about 51 percent of the
stock outstanding, for a total of about $707 million. The bid is
part of a complex restructuring plan that would include asset
sales, cost-cutting measures and a $10-a-share special cash
dividend.
   Irving said in a statement Friday that it was in ``active
discussions with BCI concerning improvement in its offer.''
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving
closed down 37.5 cents Friday to $60.12{ while Bank of New York
rose 25 cents to $30.12{.

   Abundant crude oil supplies have helped drag
futures prices lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Contracts for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, closed at $17.17 per barrel, down 28 cents
from Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among June contracts for refined products traded on the
exchange, wholesale prices for heating oil rose 0.08 cent to 47.71
cents a gallon, while wholesale unleaded gasoline gained 0.10 cent
to 52.36 cents a gallon.
   ``What happened today is telling the story that short-term
supplies of crude are more than ample. There's plenty, everywhere
you look,'' said Donald Morton, vice president for energy futures
in the Boston office of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Another factor putting selling pressure on the June contract was
the fact that it expired Friday.
   On Monday, the July contract will become the new ``near month''
contract on the exchange.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up Again as Higher Inflation Looms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   News that big increases in food, energy and clothing costs sent
consumer prices up 0.4 percent in April has gotten a gloomy
reception from Wall Street and the bond market.
   Friday's government report of the April rise in inflation works
out to an annual rate of increase of 5.3 percent.
   Inflation, which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six
years, is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight
labor markets, high factory operating rates and a weak dollar,
analysts said.
   Stock and bond prices, which had been weighed down through the
week by fear of inflationary pressures and concern over higher
interest rates, finished the week with uninspiring performances.
   The 0.4 percent inflation rise, a level that had been widely
anticipated, nonetheless deepened the markets' anxiety.
   Stocks ended mixed. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
closed with a 6.13 point decline at 1,952.59, bringing its net loss
for the week to 37.95. Broader market indices were little changed.
   Bond prices fell after an equally traumatic week, driving
interest rates higher. The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond
declined | point, or $6.25 for every $1,000 in face value. The
yield on the bond jumped from 9.27 percent late Thursday to 9.34
percent _ its highest level since it hit 9.40 percent last Dec. 14.
   In another report Friday, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose 0.9
percent in April as the 0.4 percent rise in inflation was offset by
increases in hourly pay and number of hours worked.
   The April consumer price increase followed a 0.5 percent May
advance, which had been the sharpest monthly gain since January
1987. Analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two
months is worrisome because it reflected price increases in a
variety of areas.
   In April, grocery store prices shot up 0.8 percent, the biggest
increase in 20 months, while gasoline costs, which had fallen from
September though February, jumped 1.1 percent.
   Clothing costs, which had surged a record 2 percent in March,
posted another 2 percent rise in April, reflecting higher costs of
imports.
   ``We have an unacceptably high rate of inflation that is
widespread,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of Boston Co.
``This is the consequence of both the strength in the economy and
the effect of the weaker dollar on imported goods prices.''
   Seven months after the October stock market crash raised fears
of a recession, analysts have now switched to worrying that the
economy is growing so strongly that inflationary pressures are
building. They cite the fact that factories are now operating at
the highest level in eight years while unemployment has fallen to a
14-year-low of 5.4 percent.
   The Federal Reserve already has boosted interest rates twice in
the past two months in an effort to dampen demand and head off
further inflationary pressures.
   But the tightening has done little to reassure financial
markets, which have been in a tailspin in recent days, driven down
not only by inflation concerns but fears that interest rates will
go higher.
   Top Reagan administration officials, including Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, have contended that the market's
inflationary fears are overblown.
   In a statement Friday, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said ``inflation remains under control'' with no significant
acceleration from recent years.
   But private economists disagreed. David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer, predicted
consumer prices would rise by 5.5 percent this year.
