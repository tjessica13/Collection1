   Riot police firing water cannons and tear
gas broke up street protests in this capital city on Wednesday
during a Communist-led general strike that paralyzed transportation.
   Small pockets of strikers blocked streets with flaming tires and
rubble before being driven off.
   The government said 13 protesters were arrested in Quito. News
reports said six people were detained in Guayquil, the nation's
financial center and largest city with 2 million people, 180 miles
southwest of the capital.
   Interior Minister Heinz Moeller called the strike a failure. He
said nearly all of the nation's labor force of 3 million workers
ignored the strike call.
   Moeller told a news conference a capital policeman was injured
by a firebomb tossed by a protester. There were no other reports of
injury.
   Strike leader Fausto Dutan said 80 percent of Ecuador's business
activity was halted by the strike, called to back demands for
higher pay.
   Radio reports said the strike had little impact in provincial
cities across this Andean nation, which is the size of Colorado and
has 10 million people.
   Strike protests waned as night fell. The downtown of this
highland capital of 1.4 million residents was filled with tear gas,
making breathing difficult for the few pedestrians left on the
streets.
   President Leon Febres Cordero said the strike, the seventh
during his tenure, was illegal and declared a nationwide state of
emergency.
   Combat troops were sent to guard electric generating plants,
gasoline stations and other installations. Riot police patrolled
streets and industrial sectors of Ecuador's major cities.
   The nationwide strike was organized by the Communist-led United
Front of Laborers, the nation's most powerful labor federation, to
seek wage increases.
   Dutan said the 200,000-member confederation wants the minimum
monthly wage raised from $31 to $76.
   Moeller admitted that bus and taxi service in Quito and
Guayaquil was nearly halted as drivers stayed off the job either in
strike sympathy or in fear of violence.
   Many of Quito's factories did not open because workers could not
reach their jobs, news reports said.
   Banks, stores and shops in downtown Quito opened normally or
slightly late but closed in early afternoon to avoid trouble. The
government suspended school classes nationwide.
   Febres Cordero, a conservative whose four-year term ends Aug.
10, has faced increasing labor unrest over the past two years amid
mounting economic woes, caused mainly by depressed world prices for
oil, Ecuador's main export.
   Rodrigo Borja, a lawyer who heads the Democratic Left party, won
a presidential runoff election in May to replace Febres Cordero.
   Moeller said the state of emergency, which permits the
government to deploy the military, ban public meetings and censor
the media, would stay in force only until the strike officially
ended at midnight Wednesday.

<HEAD>`ET' Host Gives Showgirl Role a Try</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Mary Hart was growing up in Sioux
Falls, S.D., her mother often worried about the future
``Entertainment Tonight'' host running away to become a showgirl.
   Well, Mom, don't look now, but ...
   The perky blonde, who taught high school English and piano while
doing community theater and dreaming of a show business career,
recently made her stage debut in Las Vegas.
   With more bookings here and in Atlantic City, plus summer stock
and music festivals this summer, Hart's ready to continue her dual
professional role, although she'd just as soon skip those 18-hour
days, juggling two careers in two cities.
   Her grueling daily grind _ shuttling between this city's Glitter
Gulch for her long-awaited fling at singing and dancing, then back
to a Hollywood ``ET'' set for more TV patter _ gave new meaning to
the concept of commuting to work.
   Hart realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeks
appearing with comedian David Brenner at the Golden Nugget Hotel
and Casino earlier this month.
   But she admits she wouldn't care for a steady diet of the double
duty.
   ``I performed at 8 and again at 11,'' she said. ``Then I caught
a 1 a.m. flight to Los Angeles, and hit the house about 2:45. I got
up at 7:30 and was at Paramount (where `ET' is filmed) by 8 a.m. We
did our promos and other spots, then began taping the show at 11:30
a.m. At 2:45 in the afternoon I was on a flight back to Vegas.
   ``Both worlds is not an ideal situation,'' she laughed as she
relaxed between shows during her two-week engagement. ``It's
conceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short period
of time.''
   In her show, Hart does several dance numbers and displays a
surprisingly good singing voice. Her appearance and style are
reminiscent of Ann-Margret when she was a Las Vegas headliner for
years.
   Hart's sexy legs _ insured by Lloyd's of London for $2 million _
are amply displayed in the Las Vegas show. The legs are a product
of a lot of hard work, including a treadmill, rowing machine and
Exercycle at home, 25 miles of speed-walking a week, and aerobics
and dance classes.
   She admits that coming into this town with a nationally known
name didn't hurt her chances for success. But she thinks she had to
have more than just a pretty, recognizable face _ and $2 million
legs.
   ``You know, you're putting it all on the line when you come in
here as a co-headliner,'' she said. ``There's no way of hiding it.
But I wanted to do it. I was both exhilarated and intimidated by
the experience.''
   Her song-and-dance debut has given her a new appreciation of the
people she covers on `ET.'
   ``There's a lot of rejection and hard knocks. I'm far more
appreciative for having experienced it firsthand.''
   Hart admits to something of a Walter Mitty lifestyle since her
days in South Dakota. She's been a finalist in the Miss America
Pageant (1971), been a host of ``ET'' for five years, sparred with
David Letterman, sung the National Anthem at Los Angeles Dodgers
games, ridden with the Blue Angels flight team, danced on the Emmy
awards show, injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a
``Circus of the Stars'' performance and been co-host of the
Tournament of Roses Parade coverage and the ``Regis Philbin Show.''
   Despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at the
Golden Nugget was one of her toughest gigs.
   ``I prepared for the opening for months,'' she recalled. ``Then
the day of the opening, after working all afternoon in dress
rehearsals, I almost felt like I couldn't do it. I proceeded to cry
for three hours.
   ``Part of it was sheer fear; part of it was excitement. There
were moments of being panic-stricken. But the overriding emotion
was one of exhilaration.
   ``I have really always seen myself as an entertainer,'' she
said. ``You dream those things, but you don't know for sure if
they'll ever happen. I think that was part of my emotionalism,
realizing those things had come true.''
   A few dreams _ a Broadway play and her own TV sitcom _ remain
unfulfilled. But, at age 35, she thinks time is on her side.
   She's learned to roll with the punches, to be patient.
   After doing radio and TV talk shows in Sioux Falls, Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, and Oklahoma City, she moved West to headline ``PM
Magazine.'' She left that show to co-host ``Regis Philbin'' _ which
folded four months later.
   ``I was out of work and out of money,'' she recalled. ``That was
a time I was terribly disappointed. Then ET came along. Thank
heaven for my Midwestern upbringing, and positive thinking.
   ``My parents always told me that the bad times accentuate the
good. I've always translated the negative experiences into good in
the long run. I'm a big believer that life goes on. You get back
from life what you put into it.''

<HEAD>Handwork Of Rural Women Reaches Out To The World</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in report for Wednesday AMs.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It began with rural women passing on
the traditional crafts of knitting and weaving, grandmother to
mother to daughter.
   Today it is a $4-million-a-year business cooperative, shipping
colorful sweaters around the world, including the United States.
   Manos del Uruguay (Hands of Uruguay) is made up of 18 rural
cooperatives whose workers spin, knit, weave and dye virgin wool,
one of Uruguay's top commodities, entirely by hand.
   It was founded in 1968 by Sara Beisso and four other members of
Uruguay's high society who had second homes on ranch estates
outside Montevideo.
   Unemployment was high in South America's smallest republic at
the time, so the five devised a way for rural women to do what they
knew best _ weave colorful sweaters using natural vegetable dyes
and Uruguay's virgin wool.
   The result is a richly colored wool woven in bright, distinctive
sweaters, as well as in rugs, tapestries and placemats. Each
article bears the name of the artisan and where it was made on a
card accompanying the product.
   Finding many of the artisans' work sites on a map is often
difficult: they include Tacuarembo, said to be the birthplace of
famed tango singer Carlos Gardel, and villages such as Los Mellizos
and Quebracho.
   One thousand workers in more than 40 sites, some using just a
loom or a table under a tree, labor over the sweaters, tapestries
and rugs. Each sweater takes 12 to 28 hours to finish, Mrs. Beisso
said.
   Most of the sweaters end up in shops in neighboring Argentina,
but many are shipped to the United States, Italy, Japan and
Belgium. Seventy percent of Manos' sweaters are exported, said
Maria Orfila Algalarronda.
   Ms. Algalarronda, 36, was with Manos from its start, weaving
from the village of Paso de la Cruz. Two decades later, she is
secretary counsel of the seven-member directorate (five women, two
men) that oversees Manos' operations from Montevideo.
   Now one of Uruguay's largest exporters of wool, Manos is
well-regarded in business circles for the quality of its work and
fashion acumen.
   ``Manos is an experience that's practically unique in the
world,'' Ms. Algalarronda said in an interview. ``The world is a
very competitive place and Uruguay is a very small place. But at a
minimum Manos has turned into a source of work for 1,000 women.''
   Each sweater, which costs the equivalent of about $30 in
Uruguay, sells for up to $300 in the United States or Japan, said
Maria Cecilia Fernandez, an aide in the promotion department of
Manos' main office in the oldtown section of this capital city.
   In the United States, Manos sweaters can be found in some Saks
Fifth Avenue and Ann Taylor stores, Mrs. Beisso said. Manos
recently opened a small showroom in New York City.
   Ms. Algalarronda said 50 designs are ready for the 1989 summer
collection, including sweaters specially made for Japan (``smaller
sizes because the Japanese are smaller''), the United States
(``simpler designs'') and Spain (``reds and blacks are popular'').
   A specially designed sofa that Pope John Paul II used at a Mass
in Salto, Uruguay, on his visit in May was produced by Manos, Mrs.
Beisso said.
   Manos is set up so that regional leaders from each cooperative
elect representatives who then report to the directorate in
Montevideo. All business decisions, from designs to marketing and
exports, are made only after receiving input from the interior, Ms.
Algalarronda said.
   Any profits _ 1987 sales were $4 million _ are plowed back into
the business, helping keep those workers employed, which was the
founding purpose of Manos.
   ``It's a fine source of employment but not a good business,''
Mrs. Beisso said. ``The people in the country are the ones who
really profit from this.''

<HEAD>Four Republicans Seek GOP Nomination For U.S. Senate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Republicans refer to first-term Sen.
Jeff Bingaman as the ``invisible senator,'' and their conviction
that he can be beaten has lured four candidates to seek the GOP
nomination in the June 7 primary.
   Bingaman is vulnerable because of his liberal voting record and
his position on national defense issues, said state GOP Chairman
John Lattauzio.
   ``New Mexico's congressmen philosophically have always supported
defense spending until Jeff Bingaman came along,'' he said. ``And
economically defense spending is very important to New Mexico.
   ``If we can articulate these issues effectively, the Republican
candidate will do very well,'' Lattauzio said.
   ``Another thing we will be able to talk about a lot is that
Bingaman is the `invisible senator.' New Mexicans are accustomed to
their congressmen staying in touch with them,'' Lattauzio said.
``Jeff just hasn't been around up until recently.''
   Bingaman said in January when he announced for re-election that
as one of only two first-term Democrats running this year _ the
other is New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg _ he expected his race to
be targeted by the national Republican Party.
   But Democrats question whether the Republican field of state
Sens. Bill Valentine, 44, and Joe Carraro, 43, both of Albuquerque,
long-time party activist Corky Morris, 52, of Albuquerque, and
former U.S. Interior Department official Rick Montoya, 41, of Las
Cruces can produce a strong challenger to Bingaman.
   Polls showing a high percentage of undecided Republicans, far
greater than the percentage favoring any candidate, indicate none
of the four has caught fire with the voters. Valentine and Morris,
however, appear to be the front-runners.
   Lawrence Ingram, a former state Democratic chairman, said
Bingaman may be vulnerable but not with any of this year's
Republican candidates.
   ``Those guys are all wallflowers who follow the old party
line,'' Ingram said. ``I think had the Republicans had a
charismatic candidate running against Bingaman, he would have a
tough time in the fall.''
   Valentine, who sold his dentistry practice to campaign fulltime,
and Carraro, who owns and operates two pizza restaurants, are
giving up their state Senate seats to try for the U.S. Senate.
   Morris, who owns trucking and warehousing companies in
Albuquerque, is a former state GOP chairman and was New Mexico
chairman of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984.
   Montoya left the Reagan administration as assistant secretary of
interior for terriorities and international affairs to return to
New Mexico and seek elective office for the first time.
   Bingaman, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary, is a
Harvard-educated lawyer who in 1982 defeated first-term Republican
Sen. Harrison ``Jack'' Schmitt, a former astronaut.
   Ingram said Bingaman has recognized his problems and corrected
most of them, including that he had not been communicating with his
constituency on a regular basis. He also has been spending more
time in New Mexico in the last year, meeting with residents.
   The Senate race and presidential voting top New Mexico's primary
ballot, but the retirement after 20 years of Republican Rep. Manuel
Lujan Jr. has thrown open the door in the 1st Congressional
District.
   Three Republicans, including Lujan's younger brother Edward, and
nine Democrats aspire to succeed Lujan, who has called it quits
after 20 years in Congress.
   Edward Lujan, 55, is an Albuquerque insurance executive and
former state GOP chairman. Challenging him are Bernalillo County
District Attorney Steven Schiff, 40, of Albuquerque and state Sen.
John Budagher, 41, of Albuquerque.
   The top Democratic contenders are former state Land Commissioner
Jim Baca, 42, former state District Judge Patricia Madrid, 41,
Bernalillo County Commissioner Lenton Malry, 57, city Councilor
Steve Gallegos, 35, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Udall,
39. All are from Albuquerque.

<HEAD>Annual Rite Of NYC Spring: Brawling Landlords And Tenants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wedneday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Ah, springtime in New York: The first robin in
Central Park. The first ballgame at Yankee Stadium. And the first
angry protester ejected from Police Headquarters in the annual
brawl over city rents.
   ``People get frustrated, people get thrown out, their blood
pressure goes way up,'' says John J. Gilbert III, head of a
landlord group, in summing up the yearly hike-or-hold-the-rent
fight before the city Rent Guidelines Board, beginning its hearings
today.
   The proceedings match angry tenants with irate landlords, with
roughly the same results as introducing Billy Martin to patrons in
a topless bar. Rhetoric is thick and animosity thicker, with
supporters on both sides cheering, jeering and (with the aid of
police) disappearing during the session.
   Slightly more than 50 percent of the city's apartments are
covered by the board's guidelines under a system that has its roots
in the city's World War II housing scarcity. Although the owners
routinely request double-digit increases on one- and two-year
leases, the board generally grants a much lower increase. This
year, Gilbert asked for increases of 15 percent on one-year leases
and 19 percent on two-year leases.
   The hearings _ once held privately, but opened to the public by
court order in 1979 _ are held inside Police Headquarters for
security reasons. Dozens of police officers are assigned to the
hearings, and others are available if verbal arguments get out of
hand.
   ``The headquarters is the only place where we have the ability
to keep things under restraint,'' explained veteran board member
Joseph Forstadt, who's seen several participants dragged out over
the past four years. ``Otherwise ...''
   Otherwise there'd be more stories like these:
   _ A woman was arrested two years ago for biting the finger of
the police officer who was dragging her from the auditorium. ``It
was unclear which point of view she was biting for,'' recalled
Forstadt.
   _ Gilbert, whose Rent Stabilization Board represents 25,000
building owners, stood up and dramatically tore a dollar bill in
half last year to demonstrate how landlord profits were down 50
percent from 1971. Tenants derisively greeted the display with boos.
   _ In 1984, after the usual spate of insults, obscenities and
outbursts in English, a group of Spanish-speaking tenants enlivened
the hearing with chants of ``Callate! Callate!'' _ ``Shut up! Shut
up!'' _ as a landlord spoke.
   After all the sign-waving and screaming is finished, the
nine-member Rent Guidelines Board determines whether rent increases
should be granted, and if so, how much.
   The oldest and most stringent guideline, rent control, covers
218,000 apartments; when they become vacant, they come under a rent
stabilization guideline, which covers 943,000 apartment.
   ``When you have landlords and tenants at the same meeting _
which I think is a mistake _ you're bound to have turmoil,'' said
77-year-old Jane Benedict, founder and chairman emeritus of the
Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenant group.
   Benedict, a fixture in rent fights since 1969, has attended
every board hearing since they went public. She sees no end to the
near-anarchy of the hearings; in fact, the problem of homelessness
could make this year's affair even wilder, she predicted.
   ``Everybody knows New York City rents are outrageous. The
feelings are intense,'' she said. ``It's not just an academic
debate. We're talking about people with no place to live.''
   At least one landlord group blames the media for stirring up
anti-landlord sentiment and making the hearings contentious.
   Jimmy Silber, vice-president of the Small Property Owners of New
York, cited recent tabloid stories on ``The Dracula Landlord'' and
``The Reptile Landlord'' as well as the annual Village Voice
listing of the city's 10 worst landlords.
   Nevertheless, Silber believes the animosity level has decreased
over the past two years; Benedict, almost predictably, disagrees.
But Forstadt said there is an interesting phenomenon which occurs
each year among the participants.
   ``After six or seven hours, it's hard to tell the landlords from
the tenants when they're talking,'' he said. ``They're both under
such distress, they begin to feel sympathetic toward one another.
... There's a sense of cohesion. They're all in the same boat.''

   School officials here learned a lesson the
hard way after a quarter of the students played hooky _ many with
their parents' approval.
   ``I don't think any member of the present school board will ever
vote to hold classes on Memorial Day again,'' said Karen Coleman, a
spokeswoman for the Seminole County School Board.
   Seminole was one of 24 of Florida's 67 counties to hold classes
Monday. Absentees totaled 5,000 of Seminole's enrollment of 20,033.
   Many parents called the school district's offices to make it
clear they regarded the day as a family holiday, Coleman said.
   ``Some were really angry about having school on Memorial Day,''
she said. ``They were all blunt in saying they were keeping their
kids home and were going to celebrate the holiday.''
   ``I know we're taking a beating on this,'' said School Board
Chairman Joe Williams. ``I guarantee it won't happen next year.''

   The warming trend in U.S.-Soviet
relations has prompted the Russians to order out for ice cream.
   Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream announced Tuesday it has signed a
licensing agreement to open its first store in a communist country,
with its 31 flavors becoming available in Moscow by July.
   However, a spokeswoman said it is too soon to say if Moscovites
will be ordering ice cream with such names as ``Catherine the
Grape,'' ``Lenin's Lemon,'' ``Tutti-Frutti Rasputti,'' or
``Ivanilla the Terrible.''
   Baskin-Robbins executives haven't yet thought of Russian names
for their 31 flavors, said spokeswoman Marilyn Novak.
   Still, ``the Soviets have expressed particular interest in
having Pralines 'n Cream and Jamoca Almond Fudge,'' Ms. Novak said.
``They have requested those two, along with other typical American
ice creams.''
   The Soviets, who already enjoy excellent domestic ice cream,
will operate the store, while the company will train Soviet
employees, provide the necessary equipment and decor, and supply
the ice cream itself, she said.
   A cone will sell for about a ruble, or roughly $1.60, Ms. Novak
said.
   ``We're going to be putting our first store at the Rossiya
Hotel,'' Ms. Novak said. The 8,000-room hotel is located near Red
Square.

   California's and Arizona's most colossal
cockroaches faced off feeler-to-feeler for the honor of
representing the two-state region in a national ``roach-off.''
   The largest Oriental cockroach entered in Tuesday's contest
measured 1.18 inch and was nurtured on a diet of paper, eggs and
breakfast cereal by two Elm Street Elementary School students in
Oxnard.
   Nick Preston and Paul Parrish said they will donate their $500
prize toward a science camp for their class of gifted 3rd- and
4th-graders, even though their teachers and classmates wouldn't let
them bring the bugs to school.
   ``They thought it was pretty disgusting,'' said Paul, 9, whose
father is an exterminator. ``I like bugs. I like to catch spiders.''
   But alas, the boys' roach won't represent California and Arizona
in the ``Great American Roach-Off,'' a national event sponsored by
a pest-control company that recognizes a different variety of the
household pest, the American cockroach, as the continent's
pre-eminent insect.
   The regional roach-off entrant will be a 1.71-inch American
cockroach submitted by a Mrs. Rauich of Palm Springs, said contest
organizer Michael Bohdan, who didn't know her first name.
   Both bugs were dead, in keeping with contest rules, and neither
measured up to Florida's entrant in the contest, 1.75 inch.
   The grand prize in the national contest, to be judged July 7 at
the Philadelphia Zoo, is $1,000.
   Paul and Nick produced their winner as part of a science project
to determine roaches' favorite food. The bugs turned up their
feelers at almost nothing, devouring paste, paper and electrical
wiring as well as scrambled eggs and cereal.

   A distance runner's plan to finance a
964-mile jog across Great Britain with a raffle has been tripped up
by the state Gambling Commission, which says the plan is illegal.
   ``We didn't know anything about it,'' Dick Goodman, a
68-year-old real-estate agent and long-distance runner, said
Tuesday. ``I've never don anything in my life that is wrong.''
   Goodman said he has located two corporate sponsors willing to
put up the $10,000 to $12,000 needed, and will return the
approximately $800 he had raised from the $10 raffle tickets, as
the commission has ordered.
   Only bona fide non-profit organizations are allowed to operate
raffles, and state law sets the maximum raffle ticket price at $5,
said Ron Layton, a commission spokesman.
   Goodman had enticed raffle purchasers with the chance to win
round trip tickets for two to London.
   He said the setback won't alter plans for his 20-day jaunt from
John O'Groats, Scotland, to Land's End, on the southern tip of
England, scheduled to begin June 21. The 5-foot-8 Goodman, who
weighs 140 pounds, plans to run 50 miles a day to complete the
route.
   ``No man 68 years old ever ran it,'' said Goodman, a World War
II veteran who took up running 26 years ago because he was getting
out of shape.
   Plans call for running nine to 10 hours a day, with breaks for
massages and meals. Goodman's coach is Bill Emmerton of Santa
Monica, Calif., a long-distance runner who ran the Great Britain
route in 1965.
   It is the longest run yet for Goodman, whose past efforts have
raised thousands of dollars for charities around the state. The
current run is not for charity, he said. The money is needed to pay
for air fare, a training van and pace car, food and hotels.
   In 1985, Goodman ran 130 miles from the Kingdome in Seattle to
the Peace Arch near Blaine, his boyhood home, on the Canadian
border. That raised $20,000 for a nursing home in Blaine.
   Next May, he plans to run 2,000 miles across the old Pony
Express route from St. Joseph, Mo., to San Francisco.

<HEAD>Number Of Children In China Declines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's family planning policy, which calls for
no more than one child per couple, has in six years reduced by 30.1
million the number of children under the age of 14, the State
Statistics Bureau said today.
   The bureau said China now has 307.15 million children under 14,
compared to 337.25 million in 1982.
   It found the proportion of children in China's total population
of 1.07 billion to be 28.68 percent, down from 33.45 percent six
years ago, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The bureau attributed the decline to the family planning policy,
which has been largely successful in China's crowded cities but has
met resistance in many rural areas, where two or more children is
still the norm.
   The bureau said children account for just 18.36 percent of the
population in Shanghai, China's largest city, while making up 36
percent in the remote western areas of Tibet and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Discount Store Practice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Distributors of discount merchandise say
consumers are the big winners in a Supreme Court ruling upholding a
lion's share of the multibillion-dollar ``gray market'' that allows
costly imports to be sold at reduced prices.
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., sponsor of a bill favoring gray
market imports, also praised the decision. ``This is very good news
for everyone in the United States who likes to save a dollar or
many dollars on imported goods like televisions, cameras, and
perfume,'' he said.
   Nathan Lewin, a lawyer for discount dealer 47th Street Photo
Inc. in New York City, said the decision will mean savings for
buyers of brand-name imports.
   ``I think the Supreme Court's ruling today is a great victory
for American consumers and for the right of merchandisers in the
United States seeking to bring products manufactured abroad into
the United States at realistic and honest prices,'' he said.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld key U.S. Customs Service
regulations that permit the gray market _ brand-name, foreign-made
goods bearing valid U.S. trademarks sold in this country without
approval from trademark owners.
   The gray market is estimated to produce $5 billion to $10
billion a year in the United States, with consumers buying
everything from German sedans and French champagne to Japanese
cameras and watches.
   The business began to flourish when the value of the dollar on
the international currency exchange rose dramatically in the early
1980s. But the more recent decline in the dollar apparently has not
substantially depressed the American appetite for gray market
foreign goods.
   The gray market is created when foreign goods are purchased
abroad and sold through discount retailers in the United States in
competition with the owners of U.S. trademarks of those products.
   Trademark owners say they are being shortchanged because they
are forced to charge a markup to help cover advertising, warranty
and service costs.
   K mart Corp. and 47th Street Photo, two leading discount
distributors, joined with the Customs Service to defend the gray
market.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy _ the court's newest member _
provided the pivotal vote in the decision.
   By a separate 5-4 vote, the court struck down another Customs
Service rule that could have been used to expand the gray market.
Some lawyers for discounters said that rule probably is
inconsequential.
   But another attorney representing discounters said there may be
loopholes in the Supreme Court decision that would allow trademark
owners to block the gray market in the future.
   That lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous, said trademark
holders ``could get around the ruling in time'' by conveying their
trademark to an independent company that then would be able to
block competing imports.
   The Customs Service for more than 50 years permitted gray market
imports when foreign manufacturers of the goods are affiliated with
the owners of the U.S. trademarks. The rules apply when the U.S.
trademark holder is a subsidiary of, parent of or the same as the
foreign manufacturer.
   The regulations were challenged by some 60 major trademark
owners that banded together to form the Coalition to Preserve the
Integrity of American Trademarks.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Ruled by a 5-3 vote that states sometimes may execute convicted
murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was
violated.
   The justices said such violations may be deemed ``harmless'' but
they overturned a Texas killer's death sentence after ruling that
the violation in his case was not harmless.
   _Unanimously struck down the way Ohio promotes through tax
credits the use of ``gasohol,'' a motor vehicle fuel less
environmentally troublesome than gasoline.
   _Cleared the way for price deregulation of some natural gas _ an
8-0 decision the Reagan administration said could save consumers an
estimated $100 million a year.
   _Unanimously gave federal regulators, in a test case from Iowa,
broad power to oust bank executives from their jobs temporarily
when the executives are accused of serious crimes.

<HEAD>Report: Growing Number Of Students Commit Suicide Over Exams</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure from school work and exams
drove at least 50 secondary school students to commit suicide last
year and 10 students killed themselves in May alone, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Korea Herald reported a growing number of suicides among
high school and middle school students because of pressure from
school work and college entrance examinations.
   It warned that the number of student suicides would increase
unless education policy changes.
   The latest death was reported Monday, when a 17-year-old
student, upset over his poor academic performance, jumped from a
bridge to his death. He left a note that said, ``Sorry for my lack
of responsibility.''
   On May 18, the newspaper said, a 16-year-old high school girl
jumped to her death from an apartment one day after two high school
girls killed themselves over their poor school record.
   Most suicide notes left behind by students blamed pressure from
hard school work or poor exam results.
   ``I want to live in a country where there is no examination,''
said a suicide note from an 18-year-old student in the southern
city of Andong.
   To reduce the pressure, educators are proposing drastic reforms
of the system, which puts heavy emphasis on rote learning, the
paper said.

   The National Economic Commission created to
solve the government's budget troubles is finding it tough to agree
on just what that task entails.
   Commission co-chairman Robert Strauss, Washington lawyer and
political dealmaker, says the ``mandate is clear.'' The president
and next Congress need ``a political solution'' for reducing the
federal deficit, in the form of recommendations to close the gap
between spending and taxes.
   But commission member Caspar Weinberger, the former defense
secretary, expressed surprise at a meeting Tuesday when a witness
suggested that making policy choices would be difficult.
   ``Are you suggesting that this commission is supposed to make
specific recommendations for budget cuts and tax increases?''
Weinberger asked Alice Rivlin of the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank.
   Weinberger and fellow Republican Donald Rumsfeld, another former
defense secretary, had focused their remarks on changing the
cumbersome budget process. The two former administration officials
suggested changing the system to give the president more power over
what they described as a spendthrift Congress.
   But Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., another commission member,
noted that President Reagan has never submitted balanced budgets.
Trying to blame Congress for the deficits misses the point, said
Gray, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   ``I thought we had to come up with specific recommendations,''
said Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, another commission member.
   By the end of the session, Strauss admonished the members not to
get ``too tied up in possible philosophical differences.'' Strauss
is co-chairman of the 12-member commission along with Drew Lewis,
president of the Union Pacific railroad and President Reagan's
former transportation secretary.
   Ms. Rivlin, a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office, said the commission should seek ways to improve the process
to keep the deficit under control in the long run. But, she said,
the panel will be a failure unless it proposes short-term
improvements as well.
   Congress created the commission last year to develop proposals
for reducing the federal deficit. Its members were appointed by
Reagan and the bipartisan congressional leadership, and two
additional slots will be filled by the next president.
   The commission has announced it plans to issue a report on Dec.
21.

<HEAD>Former Attorney General In Court Over Check-Kiting Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell
ignored evidence that top E.F. Hutton executives orchestrated a
widespread check-kiting scheme when he blamed mid-level managers in
a defamatory report, the lawyer for one of those managers says.
   Bell, a defendant in a defamation suit brought by one of six
branch managers he criticized in the 1985 report about the
check-kiting scheme, was trying to shift the blame away from top
management, the lawyer argued Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   ``He cleared the company, he cleared the management and put the
blame out on regional managers and branch managers,'' Stephen G.
Milliken, a lawyer for former Hutton manager John M. Pearce, said
as the defamation trial got under way.
   Bell, a private attorney in Atlanta, was retained by Hutton to
conduct the internal investigation after the company pleaded guilty
May 2, 1985, to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud for
manipulating its checking accounts.
   The company admitted writing checks for amounts exceeding money
in the accounts, thereby giving itself interest-free loans. The
accounts were replenished before the overdrawn checks cleared,
enabling Hutton to make extra money by ``riding the float.''
   Hutton, which is now part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., agreed
to pay a $2 million fine and reimburse banks that were victims of
the check-kiting scheme. Federal investigators said the company had
interest-free use of $250 million a day.
   Milliken said the practice was conceived in the late 1970s by
Hutton management and promoted as a way to get interest-free loans
from banks.
   ``The entire operation was known to New York, understood by New
York, created by New York,'' Milliken said. But ``Mr. Bell, by his
investigation cleared everybody in New York.''
   Bell, a partner in the Atlanta law firm of King & Spalding, was
retained shortly after the guilty plea was entered by the company.
He produced a report three months later that recommended that
Pearce and eight other branch and regional executives be
disciplined.
   The report exonerated all but one top management official, whom
Bell recommended be stripped of any duties involving Hutton's
banking activities.
   Bell's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, said the former attorney
general's probe ``was a carefuly, thorough, meticulous and fair and
independent investigation.''
   Silbert charged that Pearce violated company policies limiting
overdrafts in order to make extra money. Pearce overdrew by as much
as 400 percent to take his 10 percent share of interest profits
that were given branch managers as an incentive for efficient cash
management, Silbert said.
   Bell carefully refrained from accusing top managers because
there was insufficient evidence they did anything wrong, he said.
   But Pearce and the others named in the report were criticized
because ``their conduct was so egregious and abusive and so
aggravated and the evidence of proof so overwhelming that he would
have been derelict in his responsibility if he had not so named
them,'' said Silbert, a former U.S. attorney.
   Milliken said the overdrafting policies were so important to
Hutton's business strategy that Pearce was admonished when he did
not write checks for more than the amounts in the accounts.
   ``They taught him to overdraft, they told him what branches to
use,'' he said.
   Milliken argued that Bell's independence was undermined by his
relationship to Hutton, which paid King & Spalding $2.5 million to
conduct the investigation.
   ``Hutton was supplying the information, Hutton was supplying the
fee, Hutton was controlling the timing of when the report would be
released,'' Milliken said.
   Bell, a former federal appeals judge who was President Carter's
first attorney general, was paid at a rate of $1,711 an hour for
518 hours of work.
   Pearce also sued Hutton, but a federal appeals court ruled that
his claim against the brokerage firm must first be submitted to
arbitration by the New York Stock Exchange.

   Fourteen school and church groups are giving
their imprimatur to a new pamphlet that lays out constitutional
ways for public schools to teach about religion in a way that does
not advocate a particular belief.
   The sponsors said Tuesday that endorsement of the document by
such diverse groups as the National School Boards Association, the
National Association of Evangelicals and the research arm of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State indicates that
the time is ripe for a resurgence of instruction about religion.
   ``The question is no longer should we teach about religion,''
Charles C. Haynes of Americans United told a news conference. ``The
question is how do we do this?''
   Other participants called the 1,000-word pamphlet historic and
expressed hope it will embolden teachers and principals to give
religion its due in history, literature and other classes.
   James Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs said
it shows ``there is a nobler and better way to deal with religion
in public schools than simply to yell at each other and threaten a
lawsuit.''
   All too often, debates about religion in public schools have
degenerated into ``a hog-calling or a shouting match,'' Dunn said.
   Secular and religious groups alike, as well as Secretary of
Education William J. Bennett, have complained in recent years that
religion gets short shrift in most American classrooms and
textbooks, even in courses that teach about historical events in
which religion played a prominent part.
   Some critics blamed publishers' fear of controversy, while
others attribute it to an overreaction by educators to Supreme
Court rulings in the 1960s that barred state-sponsored school
prayer and Bible reading.
   The pamphlet provides guidance in question-and-answer form for
school boards, teachers and others.
   The pamphlet, called ``Religion in the Public School Curriculum:
Questions and Answers,'' notes that the Supreme Court has ruled
unconstitutional a Louisiana law that required schools to teach the
Biblical account of creation in science classes. But it said the
high court also acknowledged a variety of scientific theories about
origins can appropriately be taught in a science class.
   The pamphlet added, ``Though science instruction may not endorse
or promote religious doctrine, the account of creation found in
various scriptures may be discussed in a religious studies class or
in any course that considers religious explanations for the origin
of life.''
   The pamphlet gives the following general advice on how to teach
about religion:
   _``The school's approach is academic, not devotional.''
   _``The school may sponsor study about religion, but may not
sponsor the practice of religion.''
   _``The school may educate about all religions, but may not
promote or denigrate any religion.''
   _``The school may inform the student about various beliefs, but
should not seek to conform him or her to any particular belief.''
   ``Because religion plays a significant role in history and
society,'' the pamphlet said, ``study about religion is essential
to understanding both the nation and the world. Omission of facts
about religion can give students the false impression that the
religious life of humankind is insignificant or unimportant.''
   ``Failure to understand even the basic symbols, practices and
concepts of the various religions makes much of history,
literature, art and contemporary life unintelligible.''
   The pamphlet recommends ``careful'' handling of religious
holidays in the classroom, with information focusing ``on the
origin, history and generally agreed-upon meaning of the
observances.''
   Other sponsors include the American Academy of Religion,
National School Boards Association, the American Association of
School Administrators, the Christian Legal Society, the National
Conference of Christians and Jews, the National Council of Churches
of Christ, the National Council for the Social Studies, the
Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, the
American Federation of Teachers and the National Education
Association.

<HEAD>Reagan Outrages Indians by Saying America `Humored' Their
Ancestors</HEAD>

   The only American Indian in Congress says
President Reagan _ in claiming the United States ``humored'' native
Americans by putting them on reservations _ appears to have learned
all he knows on the subject from his old Western movies.
   ``I only wish the president knew as much about American Indians
as he seems to know about the Russians,'' said Rep. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne who represents the western half of
Colorado. ``It's incredible he knows so little.''
   Campbell, a Democrat, joined a chorus of Indian groups and
others in denouncing Reagan's remarks to students at Moscow State
University on Tuesday.
   ``Maybe we made a mistake'' in trying to maintain Indian
cultures, Reagan said. ``Maybe we should not have humored them in
that, wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we
should have said, `No, come join us. Be citizens along with the
rest of us.'''
   Reagan misspoke. All American Indians were made full U.S.
citizens by an act of Congress in 1924.
   Suzan Harjo, executive director of the National Congress of
American Indians, said she found the remark about ``humoring'' the
Indians ``particularly insulting.''
   Gregory Frazier, president of the Denver-based National Urban
Indian Council, said, ``I'm a fan of the president, but the
president is a little bit removed from the reality of American
Indians.''
   Reagan volunteered his comments when he was asked by a student
if he would meet with three Indians visiting Moscow under the
auspices of the militant American Indian Movement. They went to the
summit city to call attention to the problems of American Indians.
   ``We have provided millions of acres of land for what are called
preservations _ or the reservations, I should say,'' Reagan said.
   ``They, from the beginning, announced that they wanted to
maintain their way of life, as they had always lived there in the
desert and the plains and so forth. And we set up these
reservations so they could, and have a Bureau of Indian Affairs to
help take care of them.''
   Though many Indians leave the reservations, many stay, the
president noted.
   The 1980 census found 1.37 million Indians, among whom 332,000
were living on 260 reservations.
   ``We've done everything we can to meet their demands as to what
they _ how they want to live,'' Reagan said.
   Campbell said, ``He appears not to know that Indians are
citizens.
   ``He must have been learning from these old celluloid Westerns
of the 1930s he used to act in,'' the congressman said.
   ``There's no question that American Indians don't want to lose
their traditions. But I don't know any Indians who want to be
primitive.''
   Harjo said, ``I thought his notion of having granted Indians
millions of acres of land was astonishing ... There was no grant
involved; his ancestors weren't dragging any land behind them when
they came to this country.
   ``He has headed the worst administration for Indians since the
days of outright warfare and extermination,'' she said, because of
``consistent efforts by this administration to undo legal,
long-standing rights and wipe out programs that meet our needs.''
   Indians leave reservations for better jobs and education ``and
politics,'' Frazier said. ``Life can be very hard on a reservation
if you're part of the `Out' party.''
   But, ``Many Indians don't have the choice to move off the
reservation'' because they have no job skills that mainstream
society will pay for, Frazier said.
   American Indians are among the poorest, worst-off of Americans.
A government study noted that the 1980 census found 12 percent of
all Americans living in poverty, but poverty among Indians affected
22 percent of those living off the reservation and 41 percent of
Indians living on reservations. Unemployment on reservations
frequently exceeds 60 percent and can reach 80 percent.
   Young Indian adults commit suicide at a rate six times their
counterparts in mainstream society.
   Campbell noted that government policy had tried to dissolve
tribes and force Indians to join mainstream culture as small
farmers in 1887-1934, then turned around and tried to maintain
tribes and tribal governments, but then flipped again to
``termination'' of tribes in the Eisenhower administration in the
1950s and flopped back to ``government-to-government'' policy in
subsequent administrations, a policy Reagan has affirmed.
   As for AIM and its three members in Moscow, Campbell said,
``People in AIM do not speak for all Indians. They speak for only a
small minority.''

   Noxious fumes from an acid leak at a factory
forced an evacuation of more than 130 residents and sent at least
38 people to a hospital for treatment, authorities said.
   Many of those treated at Pawating Hospital were players and
spectators at softball fields near the National-Standard wire and
cable plant where the leak occurred about 6:15 p.m. Tuesday,
nursing supervisor Mary Ann Weaver said.
   Hydrochloric acid and another acid were mixed in a storage tank,
causing the tank to rupture and the acids to form a puddle on the
plant floor, said Dennis Sexton, a dispatcher with the Berrien
County Sheriff's Department.
   The leak was contained with no fire or explosion, he said.
   Residents within three miles of the plant on Niles's northeast
side were ordered evacuated, but they returned when the area was
declared safe within three hours, Mayor Larry Clymer said.
   At least 130 people were sheltered temporarily at Ballard
Elementary School, about six miles from the plant on the west side
of the southwestern Michigan city of 15,000, school Superintendent
John Huffman said.

   Following is the text of President Reagan's speech
Tuesday before a student assembly at Moscow State University:
   Well, thank you, Rector Lagunov. And I want to thank all of you
very much for a very warm welcome. It's a great pleasure to be here
at Moscow State University, and I want to thank you all for turning
out. I know you must be very busy this week, studying and taking
your final examinations. So let me just say, (speaks in Russian).
(Applause.)
   Nancy couldn't make it today because she's visiting Leningrad,
which she tells me is a very beautiful city. But she, too, says
hello, and wishes you all good luck.
   Let me say it's also a great pleasure to once again have this
opportunity to speak directly to the people of the Soviet Union.
Before I left Washington, I received many heartfelt letters and
telegrams, asking me to carry here a simple message, perhaps, but
also one of the most important business of this summit. It is a
message of peace and good will and hope for a growing friendship
and closeness between our two peoples.
   As you know, I've come to Moscow to meet with one of your most
distinguished graduates. In this, our fourth summit, General
Secretary Gorbachev and I have spent many hours together, and I
feel that we're getting to know each other well. Our discussions,
of course, have been focused primarily on many of the important
issues of the day, issues I want to touch on with you in a few
moments.
   But first, I want to take a little time to talk to you, much as
I would to any group of university students in the United States. I
want to talk not just of the realities of today, but of the
possibilities of tomorrow.
   Standing here before a mural of your revolution, I want to talk
about a very different revolution that is taking place right now,
quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict. Its
effects are peaceful, but they will fundamentally alter our world,
shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives. It's easy to
underestimate, because it's not accompanied by banners or fanfare.
   It's been called the ``technological'' or ``information''
revolution. And, as its emblem, one might take the tiny silicon
chip, no bigger than a fingerprint. One of these chips has more
computing power than a roomful of old-style computers. As part of
an exchange program, we now have an exhibition touring your country
that shows how information technology is transforming our lives,
replacing manual labor with robots, forecasting weather for
farmers, or mapping the genetic code of DNA for medical
researchers. These microcomputers today aid the design of
everything from houses to cars to spacecraft. They even design
better and faster computers.
   They can translate English into Russian, or enable the blind to
read, or help Michael Jackson produce on one synthesizer the sounds
of a whole orchestra. Linked by a network of satellites and fiber
optic cables, one individual with a desktop computer and a
telephone commands resources unavailable to the largest governments
just a few years ago.
   Like a chrysalis, we are emerging from the economy of the
industrial revolution, an economy confined to and limited by the
earth's physical resources, into, as one economist titled his book,
``The Economy in Mind,'' in which there are no bounds on human
imagination and the freedom to create is the most precious natural
resource.
   Think of that little computer chip. Its value isn't in the sand
from which it is made, but in the microscopic architecture designed
into it by ingenious human minds. Or take the example of the
satellite relaying this broadcast around the world, which replaces
thousands of tons of copper mined from the earth and molded into
wire.
   In the new economy, human invention increasingly makes physical
resources obsolete. We are breaking through the material conditions
of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny. Even as
we explore the most advanced reaches of science, we are returning
to the age-old wisdom of our culture, a wisdom contained in the
book of the Genesis in the Bible. In the beginning was the spirit,
and it was from this spirit that the material abundance of creation
issued forth.
   But progress is not foreordained. The key is freedom _ freedom
of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication. The
renowned scientist, scholar and founding father of this university,
Mikhail Lomonosov, knew that. ``It is common knowledge,'' he said,
``that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid,
particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by
the freedom of philosophy.''
   You know, one of the first contacts between your country and
mine took place between Russian and American explorers. The
Americans were members of Cook's last voyage on an expedition
searching for an Arctic passage. On the island of Unalaska, they
came upon the Russians, who took them in, and together with the
native inhabitants, held a prayer service on the ice.
   The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with
vision, with a courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the
unknown. These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are
responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States.
   They are the prime movers of the technological revolution. In
fact, one of the largest personal computer firms in the United
States was started by two college students, no older than you, in
the garage behind their home. Some people, even in my own country,
look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only
waste. What of all the entrepreneurs that fail?
   Well, many do, particularly the successful ones, often several
times. And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll
tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the
way. Yes, it's what they learned from failing, like an athlete in
competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth.
   Experience is the greatest teacher. And that's why it's so hard
for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever
substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to
make their dreams come true.

   The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world.
There's an old story about a town _ it could be anywhere _ with a
bureaucrat who is known to be a good-for-nothing, but he somehow
had always hung onto power. So one day, in a town meeting, an old
woman got up and said to him, ``There is a folk legend here, where
I come from, that when a baby is born, an angel comes down from
heaven and kisses it on one part of its body. If the angel kisses
him on his hand, he becomes a handyman. If he kisses him on his
forehead, he becomes bright and clever. And I've been trying to
figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there
for so long and do nothing.'' (Applause.)
   We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the
world. Places such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan have
vaulted into the technological era, barely pausing in the
industrial age along the way. Low-tax agricultural policies in the
sub-continent mean that in some years, India is now a net exporter
of food. Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are
blowing over the People's Republic of China, where one-quarter of
the world's population is now getting its first taste of economic
freedom.
   At the same time, the growth of democracy has become one of the
most powerful political movements of our age. In Latin America in
the 1970s, only a third of the population lived under democratic
government. Today, over 90 percent does. In the Philippines, in the
Republic of Korea, free contested democratic elections are the
order of the day. Throughout the world, free markets are the model
for growth. Democracy is the standard by which governments are
measured.
   We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom. In fact,
it's something of a national pastime. Every four years, the
American people choose a new president, and 1988 is one of those
years. At one point, there were 13 major candidates running in the
two major parties, not to mention all the others, including the
Socialist and Libertarian candidates, all trying to get my job.
   About a 1,000 local television stations, 8,500 radio stations
and 1,700 daily newspapers, each one an independent private
enterprise, fiercely independent of the government, report on the
candidates, grill them in interviews and bring them together for
debates. In the end, the people vote. They decide who will be the
next president.
   But freedom doesn't begin or end with elections. Go to any
American town, to take just an example, and you'll see dozens of
churches, representing many different beliefs, in many places,
synagogues and mosques, and you will see families of every
conceivable nationality worshiping together. Go into any school
room, and there you will see children being taught the Declaration
of Independence; that they are endowed by their creator with
certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, that no government can justly deny; the
guarantees in their Constitution for freedom of speech, freedom of
assembly and freedom of religion.
   Go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent
judge beholden to no government power. There, every defendant has
the right to a trial by a jury of his peers, usually 12 men and
women, common citizens. They are the ones, the only ones, who weigh
the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence. In that court, the
accused is innocent until proven guilty, and the word of a
policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the
word of the accused.
   Go to any university campus and there you will find an open,
sometimes heated discussion of the problems in American society and
what can be done to correct them. Turn on the television, and you
will see the legislature conducting the business of government
right there before the camera, debating and voting on the
legislation that will become the law of the land.
   March in any demonstration _ and there are many of them. The
people's right of assembly is guaranteed in the Constitution and
protected by the police. Go into any union hall where the members
know their right to strike is protected by law. As a matter of
fact, one of the many jobs I had before this one was being
president of a union, the Screen Actors Guild. I led my union out
on strike, and I'm proud to say we won.
   But freedom is more even than this. Freedom is the right to
question and change the established way of doing things. It is the
continuing revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding
that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions. It is
the right to put forth and idea, scoffed at by the experts, and
watch it catch fire among the people. It is the right to stick _ to
dream, to follow your dream or stick to your conscience, even if
you are the only one in a sea of doubters.
   Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single
authority or government has a monopoly on the truth, but that every
individual life is infinitely precious, that every one of us put on
this world has been put there for a reason and has something to
offer.
   America is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities. Our
ties to you are more than ones of good feeling. They're ties of
kinship. In America, you'll find Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians,
peoples from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. They come from every
part of this vast continent, from every continent, to live in
harmony, seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected,
each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the
richness it brings to our lives.
   Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to
visit relatives in the West. We can only hope that it won't be long
before all are allowed to do so, and Ukrainian-Americans,
Baltic-Americans, Armenian-Americans can freely visit their
homelands, just as this Irish-American visits his.

   Freedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and
materialistic. But Americans are one of the most religious peoples
on earth, because they know that liberty, just as life itself, is
not earned but a gift from God. They seek to share that gift with
the world. ``Reason and experience,'' said George Washington in his
farewell address, ``both forbid us to expect that national morality
can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.'' And it is
substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of
popular government.
   Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to
keep government limited, unintrusive, a system of constraints on
power to keep politics and government secondary to the important
things in life, the true sources of value found only in family and
faith. But I hope you know, I go on about these things not simply
to extol the virtues of my own country, but to speak to the true
greatness of the heart and soul of your land.
   Who, after all, needs to tell the land of Dostoyevsky about the
quest for truth, the home of Kandinsky and Scriabin about
imagination, the rich and noble culture of the Uzbek man of
letters, Ali Sheer Nevoyai, about beauty and heart? The great
culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all
humanity.
   Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on
human freedom. It comes not from the literature of America, but
from this country, from one of the greatest writers of the 20th
century, Boris Pasternak, in the novel ``Dr. Zhivago.'' He writes:
   ``I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down
by threats, any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retribution
after death, then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion
tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed
himself.''
   ``But this is just the point: What has for centuries raised man
above the beast is not the cudgel, but an inward music, the
irresistible power of unarmed truth _ the irresistible power of
unarmed truth.''
   Today the world looks expectedly to signs of change, steps
toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union. We watch and we hope as
we see positive changes taking place. There are some I know in your
society who fear that change will bring only disruption and
discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future.
   Sometimes it takes faith. It's like that scene in the cowboy
movie, ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' which some here in
Moscow recently had a chance to see.
   The posse is closing in on the two outlaws, Butch and Sundance,
who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff with a sheer
drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below. Butch turns to
Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below.
   But Sundance refuses. He says he'd rather fight it out with the
posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered. Butch says
that's suicide, and urges him to jump. But Sundance still refuses,
and finally admits, ``I can't swim.'' Butch breaks up laughing and
says, ``You crazy fool. The fall will probably kill you.'' And by
the way, both Butch and Sundance made it, in case you didn't see
the movie.
   I think what I've just been talking about is perestroika and
what its goals are. But change would not mean rejection of the
past. Like a tree growing strong through the seasons, rooted in the
earth and drawing life from the sun, so too, positive change must
be rooted in traditional values _ in the land, in culture, in
family and community. And it must take its life from the eternal
things, from the source of all life, which is faith. Such change
will lead to new understandings, new opportunities, to a broader
future in which the tradition is not supplanted but finds its full
flowering.
   That is the future beckoning to your generation. At the same
time, we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized
will always be insecure. Such freedom will always be looking over
its shoulder. A bird on a tether, no matter how long the rope, can
always be pulled back.
   And that is why, in my conversation with General Secretary
Gorbachev, I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize
change, to put guarantees on reform. And we have been talking
together about one sad reminder of a divided world: the Berlin Wall.
   It's time to remove the barriers that keep people apart. I am
proposing an increased exchange program of high school students
between our countries. General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on
Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this, ``Better to
see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.''
   Mr. Gorbachev and I first began working on this in 1985. In our
discussion today, we agreed on working up to several thousand
exchanges a year from each country in the near future. But not
everyone can travel across the continents and oceans.
   Words travel lighter, and that's why we'd like to make available
to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals, and
our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite
in seconds. Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people
to get to know us better and to understand our way of life.
   Just a few years ago, few would have imagined the progress our
two nations have made together. The INF treaty, which General
Secretary Gorbachev and I signed last December in Washington, and
whose instruments of ratification we will exchange tomorrow, the
first true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history, calling for
the elimination of an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear
missiles.

   And just 16 days ago, we saw the beginning of your withdrawal
from Afghanistan, which gives us hope that soon the fighting may
end and the healing may begin, and that that suffering country may
find self-determination, unity and peace at long last.
   It's my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these
issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction of
conflicts in many regions of the globe, and that the serious
discussions that led to the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan will help
lead to solutions in southern Africa, Ethiopia, Cambodia, the
Persian Gulf and Central America.
   I have often said nations do not distrust each other because
they are armed; they are armed because they distrust each other. If
this globe is to live in peace and prosper, if it is to embrace all
the possibilities of technological revolution, then nations must
renounce, once and for all, the right to an expansionist foreign
policy. Peace between nations must be an enduring goal, not a
tactical stage in a continuing conflict.
   I've been told that there's a popular song in your country --
perhaps you know it -- whose evocative refrain asks the question,
``Do the Russians want a war?'' In answer, it says, ``Go ask that
silence lingering in the air above the birch and poplar there.
Beneath those trees the soldiers lie. Go ask my mother, ask my
wife. Then you will have to ask no more, do the Russians want a
war?''
   But what of your one-time allies? What of those who embraced you
on the Elbe? What if we were to ask the watery graves of the
Pacific or the European battlefields, where America's fallen were
buried far from home? What if we were to ask their mothers, sisters
and sons, do Americans want war? Ask us, too, and you'll find the
same answer, the same longing in every heart.
   People do not make wars _ governments do. And no mother would
ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain, for
economic advantage, for ideology. A people free to choose will
always choose peace. Americans seek always to make friends of old
antagonists.
   After a colonial revolution with Britain, we have cemented for
all ages the ties of kinship between our nations. After a terrible
civil war between North and South, we healed our wounds and found
true unity as a nation. We've fought two world wars in my lifetime,
against Germany and one with Japan. But now the Federal Republic of
Germany and Japan are two of our closest allies and friends.
   Some people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of
strength, but they're the frictions of all families, and the family
of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one.
   I can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in
my lifetime to see American and Soviet diplomats grappling with the
problem of trade disputes between American and a growing,
exuberant, exporting Soviet Union that it opened up to economic
freedom and growth.

   Chrysler Chairman and best-selling author Lee
Iacocca is back with another autobiography, this time revealing
that he once considered taking over General Motors but decided ``it
might be easier to buy Greece.''
   ``Talking Straight'' arrives in bookstores today. The initial
printing is 750,000; booksellers can only hope it measures up to
``Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' which has sold 2.6 million hardcover
copies and 3.5 million paperbacks worldwide.
   In the new book, Iacocca writes that last spring, automobile
dealer Victor Potamkin and Allied-Signal chairman Ed Hennessy
approached him separately to suggest an unsolicited takeover of the
industry behemoth, General Motors Corp.
   At first, Iacocca wrote, he dismissed the idea. But talks
continued, and Iacocca even met secretly with investment banker
Felix Rohatyn, consulted a takeover lawyer and investigated
financing before dropping the proposal.
   ``I concluded that it might be easier to buy Greece,'' he said.

   And as important as these official people-to-people exchanges
are, nothing would please me more than for them to become
unnecessary, to see travel between East and West become so routine
that university students in the Soviet Union could take a month off
in the summer, and, just like students in the West do now, put
packs on their backs and travel from country to country in Europe
and with barely a passport check in between. Nothing would please
me more than to see the day that a concert promoter in, say,
England, could call up a Soviet rock group without going through
any government agency, and have them playing in Liverpool the next
night.
   Is this just a dream? Perhaps, but it is a dream that is our
responsibility to have come true. Your generation is living in one
of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. It is a time
when the first breath of freedom stirs the air, and the heart beats
to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual
energies of a long silence yearn to break free.
   I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of Gogol's
``Dead Souls,'' comparing his nation to a speeding troika. Gogol
asks, ``What will be its destination?'' But he writes, ``There was
no answer, save the bell pouring forth a marvelous sound.''
   We do not know what the conclusion of this will be, of this
journey. But we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be
fulfilled. In this Moscow spring, this May 1988, we may be allowed
that hope, that freedom like the fresh green sapling planted over
Tolstoy's grave, will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile
soil of your people and culture. We may be allowed to hope that the
marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through, ringing
through, leading to a new world of reconciliation, friendship and
peace.
   Thank you all very much, and ``Da blagoslovit da Gospod.'' God
bless you. (Applause.)

   Sunny skies, a warm breeze, temperatures around 80
and the lilacs in full bloom: Moscow could hardly be lovelier. And
Ronald Reagan has made it nicer than usual for Muscovites.
   Reagan's legendary good luck and a crash cleanup by Soviet work
crews combined to put the prettiest possible face on this otherwise
seedy capital for the superpower summit.
   Even the city's notorious ``pookh,'' the cotton-wool summer
scourge that falls from the city's silver poplar trees, fills the
air and covers the ground like snow, has cooperated. It is having
either a late season or a light one.
   Yuri Somov, an architect and would-be artist, was displaying his
favorite painting on a downtown street when three Americans
approached. One asked how much he'd take for his painting, a
stylized Russian Orthodox church scene. When he discovered their
nationality, however, he insisted he couldn't sell his favorite
work but wanted to give it to the American president.
   ``To Mr. Ronald Reagan, with profound respect,'' he wrote on the
back, and signed his name. The painting found its way to Reagan's
White House staff.
   It was typical of the outpouring of goodwill that has greeted
the swarm of Americans and other foreigners, mostly journalists,
who have descended on Moscow for the meetings between Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Reagan.
   A 25-year-old woman standing at the edge of Red Square who
identified herself as Olga said Moscow streets ``look prettier
because they cleaned everything up for this summit.''
   ``If only it would stay this way,'' she said.
   It won't, although the constant hosing down and sweeping of the
streets is not extraordinary here. Street sweepers are undeterred
even by Moscow's frequent rainy days, but poor grading and
practically nonexistent drainage ensure that the streets have
almost perpetual puddles in summer. Dirt becomes mud only to be
redistributed by the next storm or water truck.
   Some Americans, particularly those who visited Moscow when
relations were more strained and its people more suspicious of
foreigners, have been surprised by Muscovites approaching them on
the street just to practice their English or exchange pleasantries.
   On the Arbat, the pedestrian mall in the restored historic
district that Reagan visited shortly after arriving Sunday, one
artist displayed a mural depicting familiar Moscow monuments, and
in the middle was a cherubic babe holding American and Soviet flags.
   The artist, who called himself Vladimir Britikov-Cambridge, told
a reporter: ``Ronald is one of us. He's an artist.''
   But if the summit has brought out a friendly comraderie in a
society where people often pass on the street without acknowledging
each other, it also has meant some inconvenience.
   Authorities announced before Reagan arrived that people without
residence permits would not be allowed to come into the city this
week, effectively banning an estimated 3 million visitors from
outside the capital who crowd in on any given day to stay with
relatives, shop, sell home-produced goods or search for
hard-to-find commodities.
   Permanent residents who live near summit sites have been pleased
to discover rarely found goods on store shelves that have been
barren most of the winter.
   One shopper refused to believe that an ordinary shop was selling
Danish canned ham, a rarity in the best of times, even in the
hard-currency berioska stores set up for foreigners.
   Cars without Moscow plates and those that police inspectors fear
might break down and clutter the streets have been stopped at
roadblocks set up at the city limits.
   But if the stringent controls have cut down on traffic volume,
the extraordinary enthusiasm of the foot police assigned to seal
off much of the city center has snarled the remaining traffic in a
city which hardly has enough cars to stage a respectable rush hour.
   More than one driver has exercised his newfound freedom of
expression to give policemen a candid opinion of a system that
leads innocent motorists into a trap where all vehicles, trucks and
buses included, must stop and turn around in the street to escape
horrendous tieups.
   A Moscow taxi driver who spent 20 minutes to drive less than
three miles grumbled to his American passenger, ``Your president
comes, and then when I want to go this way, I have to go the
opposite way instead.''

   Here is the exchange on American Indians during
President Reagan's question-and-answer session Tuesday at Moscow
University. The questioner refers to the presence in Moscow of
three representatives of the American Indian Movement to call
attention to the problems of Indians.
   MODERATOR: (A question from) a student from the biological
faculty: Mr. President, I heard that a group of American Indians
have come here because they couldn't meet you in the United States
of America. If you fail to meet them here, will you be able to
improve, to correct it, and to meet them back in the United States?
   PRESIDENT REAGAN: I didn't know that they had asked to see me.
If they've come here, or whether to see them there, I'd be very
happy to see them.
   Let me tell you just a little something about the American
Indian in our land. We have provided millions of acres of land for
what are called preservations _ or the reservations, I should say.
   They, from the beginning, announced that they wanted to maintain
their way of life, as they had always lived there in the desert and
the plains and so forth. And we set up these reservations so they
could, and have a Bureau of Indian Affairs to help take care of
them.
   At the same time, we provide education for them _ schools on the
reservations. And they're free also to leave the reservations and
be American citizens among the rest of us, and many do.
   Some still prefer, however, that way of _ that early way of
life. And we've done everything we can to meet their demands as to
what they _ how they want to live.
   Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them
in that, wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe
we should have said, ``No, come join us. Be citizens along with the
rest of us.''
   As I say, many have. Many have been very successful. And I'm
very pleased to meet with them, talk with them at any time, and see
what their grievances are or what they feel they might be.
   And you'd be surprised, some of them became very wealthy because
some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil. And
you can get very rich pumping oil.
   And so I don't know what their complaint might be.

   Wearing a wide smile, the local
Communist Party chief put his arm around an American visitor and
steered him into his paneled office to watch the latest TV report
on the Moscow summit.
   ``May these sunny May days at the Kremlin mean that a new page
has been turned in the history between our countries,'' Igor A.
Tolstoukhov said at one point Tuesday.
   In Volgograd, Olga V. Sovelyova picked her way through a thick
crowd when she heard there was an American nearby, removed her
sunglasses and extended her hand.
   ``I want to congratulate you on the ratification of the
medium-range missile treaty by your Senate,'' said the plump
41-year-old Russian woman. ``Things are looking up for relations
between us.''
   For a reporter on a 1,900-mile swing through the Russian
heartland, the hopes inspired by the meeting between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are immediately
apparent because Soviets readily express them.
   ``I just wanted to say that we want to be friends with you,''
said a shy teen-aged girl in Stavropol who then left a bookstore on
Karl Marx Prospekt that among other things sells posters condemning
U.S. militarism.
   If there is a Peoria in the Soviet Union, the Moscow summit
appears to be playing well there.
   That's the case even if the hopes it inspires are tempered by
memories of past swings in superpower relations and the political
fact that Reagan will be out of office in January.
   For most Soviets, the Ronald Reagan who once joked about bombing
their country has been replaced by a wiser, more sober statesman
who has joined with their country's leader in seeking tighter
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``He has changed,'' said Tolstoukhov, 49, party chief for a
region the size of Holland centered around the ancient city of
Yaroslavl, 150 miles north of Moscow. ``But after all, he was once
a Democrat who became a Republican.''
   In interviews, many people credited recent changes in the Soviet
Union itself for bringing Reagan to the capital of the socialist
nation he once called an ``evil empire.''
   ``As Mikhail Sergeyevich (Gorbachev) said, `It is better to once
see than to hear 100 times,''' Tolstoukhov said. ``We hope he will
sense the hospitality of our Russian people and their desire for
peace.''
   Gennady P. Starostin, mayor of Stavropol, said: ``We are all
people and we all live on the same tiny planet. All of us want to
live longer and better. The only place we should be competing is at
the stadium.''
   Among some Soviets, however, the hopes are twinned with
suspicions fueled in part by incomplete knowledge about how the
U.S. political system functions.
   A collective farmer in the village of Beshpagir, 25 miles from
Stavropol, thought the lengthy debate over medium-range nuclear
treaty meant the United States was backing out on its commitment.
   ``Your president signed it: why isn't that enough?'' said the
sunburned man standing outside his cottage. ``Don't you trust us?''
   But the man in his 40s who gave his name only as Vassily is an
exception. Most Soviets spoke wistfully of the high-water marks in
U.S.-Soviet relations _ the wartime alliance against Nazi Germany,
the Soyuz-Apollo flight, the detente of the 1970s.
   Mrs. Sovelyova was among them. A guide at the monument to the
World War II battle of Stalingrad, now called Volgograd, she
gestured to the stone pillars that commemorate the Red Army
soldiers who died in battle.
   ``We were once in a common cause,'' she said. ``Let us work
together to reinforce peace on our beautiful green planet.''

   Following are excerpts of President Reagan's
exchange Tuesday with students at Moscow State University:
   Moderator: Dear friends, Mr. President has kindly agreed to
answer questions, but since he doesn't have too much time, only 15
minutes, so those who have questions, please ask them.
   Q. This is a student from the history faculty, and he says that
he's happy to welcome you on behalf of the students of the
university. ... Do you think that it'll be possible for you and the
General Secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic
arms during the time that you are still president?
   A. This is a much more complicated treaty than the INF Treaty,
the intermediate-range treaty, which we have signed and which our
two governments have ratified and is now in effect. So there are
many things still to be settled. ... Once we had hoped that maybe,
like the INF Treaty, we would have been able to sign it here at
this summit meeting. It is not completed. There are still some
points that are being debated.
   We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave
office, which is in the coming January. But I assure you that if it
isn't ... I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry
on until it is signed. My dream has always been that once we've
started down this road, we can look forward to a day, you can look
forward to a day, when there will be no more nuclear weapons in the
world at all. (Applause.)
   Q. The student wonders how the youths have changed since the
days when you were a student, up till now.
   A. Well, I know there was a period in our country when there was
a very great change for the worst. When I was governor of
California, I could start a riot just by going to a campus. But
that has all changed, and I could be looking out at an American
student body as well as I'm looking out here, and would not be able
to tell the difference between you.
   I did happen to go to school and get my college education in a
unique time. It was the time of the Great Depression, when, in a
country like our own, there was 25 percent unemployment and the
bottom seemed to fall out of everything.
   I think what maybe I should be telling you, from my point here,
because I graduated in 1932, that ... you know an awful lot more
about being young than you do about being old. And I think there is
a seriousness, I think there's a sense of responsibility that young
people have, and I think that there's an awareness on the part of
most of you about what you want ... your adulthood to be and what
the country you live in, you want it to be.
   And I have a great deal of faith. I said the other day to ... 76
students _ they were half American and half Russian _ I believe if
all the young people of the world today could get to know each
other, there would never be another war.
   Q. Mr. President, you have just mentioned that you welcome the
efforts aimed at the settlement of the Afghani question, and it
might promote the settlement of other regional conflicts. What
conflicts do you mean _ Central American conflicts, Southeast
Asian, or South African?
   A. Well, for example, in South Africa, where Namibia has been
promised its independence as a nation, ... it is impossible because
of a civil war going on in another country there. And that civil
war is being fought on one side by some 30,000 to 40,000 Cuban
troops who have gone from the Americas over there and are fighting
on one side with one kind of authoritative government. ... But what
we believe is that those foreign soldiers should get out and let
them settle it, let them, the citizens of that nation, settle their
problems.
   And the same is true in ... Nicaragua. Nicaragua ... had a
dictator. There There was an organization that then was aided by
others in the revolution. And they appealed to the Organization of
American States for help in getting the dictator to step down, stop
the killing _ and he did. But the Organization of American States
had asked, ``What are the goals of the revolution?'' And they were
given in writing. And they were the goals of a pluralistic society,
of the right of unions, and freedom of speech and press, and so
forth, and free elections.
   And then the one group that was the best organized among the
revolutionaries seized power, exiled many of the other leaders, and
has its own government, which violated every one of the promises
that had been made. And, here again, ... we're trying to encourage
the ... making of those promises come true and letting the people
of that particular country decide their fate.
   Q. I am very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of 310
Soviet soldiers missing in Afghanistan. Can you, are you willing to
help in their search and their return to the motherland?
   A. Very much so. We would like nothing better than that.
   Q. The realization of the unalienable right of citizens
guaranteed by the Constitution faces certain problems. For example,
the right of people to have arms. Or, for example, ... whether a
spread of pornography or narcotics is compatible with these rights.
Do you believe that these problems just are unavoidable problems
connected with democracies or they could be avoided?
   A. If I understand you correctly, ... does that include the
right to do criminal acts and, for example, in the use of drugs and
so forth? No. (Laughter, applause.)
   No. We have a set of laws. ... Our Constitution is a document in
which ``we the people'' tell the government what its powers are.
... But very carefully, at the same time, the people give the
government the power with regard to those things which they think
would be destructive to society. ... The government can enforce the
laws, but that has all been dictated by the people.

   Q. Since your term of office is coming to an end, what sentiment
do you experience and whether you feel like if, hypothetically, you
can just stay for another term?
   A. There has kind of grown a tradition in our country about two
terms. ... It was just a tradition, and then Roosevelt ran the four
times, died very early in his fourth term. And suddenly, in the
atmosphere at that time, they added an amendment to the
Constitution that presidents could only serve two terms.
   When I get out of office I'm going to travel around ... and try
to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out
that amendment to the Constitution because it was an interference
with the democratic rights of the people. The people should be
allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for as many times as
they want to vote for them, and that it is they who are being
denied a right. (Applause.)
   In Hollywood, when I was there, if you didn't sing or dance, you
wound up as an after-dinner speaker. And I didn't sing or dance. So
I have a hunch that I will be out on the speaking circuit, telling
about a few things that I didn't get done in government but urging
the people to tell the Congress they wanted them done. (Applause.)
   Q. I heard that a group of American Indians have come here
because they couldn't meet you in the United States of America. If
you fail to meet them here, will you be able to ... correct it and
to meet them back in the United States?
   A. I didn't know that they had asked to see me. ... I'd be very
happy to see them.
   They from the beginning announced that they wanted to maintain
their way of life. ... And we set up these reservations so they
could, and have a Bureau of Indian Affairs to help take care of
them. At the same time, we provide ... schools on the reservations.
And they're free also to leave the reservations and be American
citizens among the rest of us, and many do. Some still prefer,
however, that ... early way of life.
   Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them
in that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe
we should have said, ``No, come join us. Be citizens along with the
rest of us.''
   I'm very pleased to meet with them, talk with them at any time,
and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be.
And you'd be surprised, some of them became very wealthy because
some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil. And
you can get very rich pumping oil. And so I don't know what their
complaint might be. Q. Why did you receive yesterday ... just
refuseniks or dissidents? Just what are your impressions from
Soviet people?
   A. You have to realize that we are a people that are made up of
every strain, nationality and race of the world. And the result is
that when people in our country think someone is being mistreated
or treated unjustly in another country, these are people who still
feel that kinship to that country because that is their heritage.
   What I have brought to the General Secretary, and I must say he
has been very cooperative about it, I have brought lists of names
that have been brought to me that are from people that are
relatives or friends that ... believe that this individual is being
mistreated here in this country, and they want them to be allowed
to emigrate to our country. Some are separated families.
   Now, I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming bureaucracy. We have the
same type of thing happen in our own country, and every once in
while somebody has to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it
loose and say, ``Stop doing what you're doing.''
   Moderator. (Makes comment in Russian followed by applause.)
   A. Thank you very much. (Applause) You are all very kind. ...
Nobody asked me what it was going to feel like to not be president
anymore. I have some understanding because after I'd been governor
for eight years and then stepped down, ... we'd only been home a
few days and someone invited us out to dinner. Nancy and I both
went out, got in the back seat of the car and waited for somebody
to get in the front and drive us.

   ``Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes,'' premiered
by American Ballet Theater on Tuesday night at the Metropolitan
Opera House, is a pleasing, light-hearted dance, the first
choreographed for the company by Mark Morris.
   Morris, who heads his own modern dance group, succeeds here by
being interesting but not pushing cleverness too far and being
inventive but not pushing that either.
   The mood of the dancing fit the mood of each of the 13 sections
of music, from Virgil Thomson's ``Etudes for Piano.'' Pianist
Michael Boriskin played a grand piano at the stage's rear center.
   Mikhail Baryshnikov danced but there is no ``star'' part. There
was much coming and going. There were touches of humor, as when a
dancer would enter at one side, dance straight across the stage and
exit, or when dancers would enter, make a U-turn and return
immediately to the wings.
   Morris sometimes repeated images, like having the women clasp
their hands over their heads and lean back against their partner's
arm. He would walk around in a circle, partly carrying the
ballerina's weight, with her pivoting on one toe.
   When Baryshnikov did solo figures, they were often turns,
alternating clockwise and counterclockwise. He also skipped
lightly, as well as doing regulation balletic jumps and turns in
air. Three women danced a section where the center ballerina's legs
were moving together while the other two ballerinas' legs were
moving apart, all looking like an optical illusion. They concluded
with a formal pose.
   Morris, a Seattle native, choreographed for the opera ``Nixon in
China,'' as well as for the Seattle Opera presentations of
``Orpheus and Eurydice'' and ``Die Fledermaus.''
   Next fall the Mark Morris Dance Group will become the resident
dance company of the Brussels theater, which formerly housed
Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the 20th Century.
   Also on Tuesday's program at the Met were Baryshnikov's staging
of ``Grand Pas Classique'' from ``Raymonda'' and the lavish
production of Leonide Massine's ``Gaite Parisienne,'' which is new
this season.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's remarks
Tuesday to members of the cultural and arts community at the House
of Artists.
   Well, as Henry VIII said to each of his six wives, ``I won't
keep you long.''
   (Laughter)
   Thank you Vladimir Vasilovich. It's with some humility that I
come here today. You here, writers, artists, dramatists, musicians
of this vast country, are heirs to the seminal figures in many of
the arts as they have developed in the 20th century Europe and
America. I'm thinking of such giants as Kandinsky, Stravinsky,
Stanislavsky, Dostoyevsky, to name a few men whose vision
transformed all of ours.
   I've been very impressed with what I've heard just now. For my
contribution to this dialogue I thought I would deal here briefly
with a question whose answer might open up some new insights for
all of us. You see, I've been told that many of you were puzzled
that a former actor could become the leader of a great nation,
particularly the United States. What does acting have to do with
politics and statecraft? Whatever possessed the American people to
entrust this high office to me? You might feel reassured to know
that you aren't the first to ask that question. Back in Washington
just about every member of the political opposition has been asking
it for the last eight years. And they're not the first; it's been
happening ever since.
   Almost a quarter of a century ago I announced that I was going
to run for what turned out to be the first public office I ever
held _ governor of California. Yes, I had served as president of my
union, the Screen Actors Guild; yes, in that role I'd led a
successful strike by the union against the studios; and yes, I had
campaigned actively for a number of candidates for office,
including candidates for president. But I was still known primarily
as an actor.
   In the movie business actors often get what we call ``type
cast.'' That is, the studios come to think of you as playing
certain kinds of roles, so those are the kinds of roles they give
you. And no matter how hard you try, you just can't get them to
think of you in any other way. Well politics is a little like that
too. So I've had a lot of time and reason to think about my role,
not just as a citizen turned politician, but as an actor turned
politician.
   In looking back, I believe acting did prepare me for the work I
do now. There are two things, two indispensable lessons that I've
taken from my craft into public life. And I hope you won't think it
excessive opportune if I use the words of a Soviet filmmaker to
explain one of them. He was, after all, one of the world's greatest
filmmakers. And so, like so many of your artists, indeed, like so
many of you, belongs, in a broader sense, to all of humanity.
   It was during the production of ``Ivan the Terrible,'' when
Eisenstein noted that in making a film, or in thinking through any
detail of it _ which, to my mind, the acting of a part _ in his
words, ``The most important thing is to have the vision. The next
is to grasp and hold it. You must see and feel what you are
thinking. You must see and grasp it. You must hold and fix it in
your memory and senses. And you must do it at once.''
   To grasp and hold a vision, to fix it in your senses, that is
the very essence, I believe, of successful leadership. Not only on
the movie set, where I learned about it, but everywhere. And, by
the way, in my many dealings with him since he became general
secretary, I've found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability to grasp
and hold a vision and I respect him for that.
   The second lesson I carried from acting into public life was
more subtle. And let me again refer to a Soviet artist, a poet,
again, one of the world's greatest. At the beginning of ``Requiem''
Anna Akhmatova writes of standing in a line outside a prison when
someone in the crowd recognizes her as a well-known poet. She
continues, ``Then a woman standing behind me, whose lips were blue
with cold, and who naturally enough, had never even heard of my
name, emerged from that state of torpor common to us all, and
putting her lips close to my ear _ there everyone spoke in whispers
_ asked me, `And could you describe this?' And I answered her, `I
can.' Then something vaguely like a smile flashed across what once
had been her face.'' That exchange, ``Can you describe this? I
can.'' is at the heart of acting, as it is of poetry and of so many
of the arts. You get inside a character, a place, and a moment. You
come to know the character in that instant, not as an abstraction,
one of the people, one of the masses, but as a particular person
yearning, hoping, fearing, loving, a face, even what had once been
a face apart from all others. And you convey that knowledge. You
describe it. You describe the face.

   Pretty soon, at least for me, it becomes harder and harder to
force any member of humanity into a straight-jacket, into some
rigid form in which you all expect to fit. In acting, even as you
develop an appreciation for what we call the dramatic, you become
in a more intimate way less taken with superficial pomp and
circumstance, more attentive to the core of the soul _ that part of
each of us that God holds in the hollow of His hand, and into which
He breaths the breath of life. And you come to appreciate what
another of your poets, Nikolai Gumilov meant when he wrote that
``the eternal entrance to God's paradise is not closed with seven
diamond seals. It is a doorway in a wall abandoned long ago _
stones, moss and nothing more.''
   As I see it, political leadership in a democracy requires seeing
past the adstractions and embracing the vast diversity of humanity,
and doing it with humility; listening as best you can, not just to
those with high positions, but to the cacophonous voices of
ordinary people, and trusting those millions of people, keeping out
of their way; not trying to act the all-wise and all-powerful; not
letting government act that way. And the word we have for this is
``freedom.''
   In the last few years freedom for the arts has been expanded in
the Soviet Union. Some poems, books, music, and works in other
fields that were once banned, have been made available to the
public and some of those artists who produced them have been
recognized. Two weeks ago, because of the work of the writers'
union, the first step was taken to make the Pasternak home at
Peredelkino into a museum. In the meantime, some artists in exile,
the stage director Yuri Lubimov, for example, have been permitted
to return and to work. And artists who are here have been allowed a
greater range.
   We in the United States applaud the new thaw in the arts. We
hope to see it go further. We hope to see Mikhail Baryshnikov and
Slava Rostropovich _ artists Mrs. and I have seen perform in
Washington _ perform again in Moscow. We hope to see the works of
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn published in the land he loves. And we hope
to see a permanent end to the restrictions on the creativity of all
artists and writers. We want this, not just for your sake, but for
our own. We believe that the greater the freedoms in other
countries, the more secure both our own freedoms and peace. And we
believe that when the arts in any country are free to blossom, the
lives of all people are richer.
   William Faulkner said of poets _ although he could have been
speaking of any of the arts _ ``It is the poet's privilege to help
man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage
and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice,
which have been the glory of our past. The poet's voice need not
merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the
pillars to help him endure and prevail.''
   Thank you for having me here today, and for sharing your
thoughts with me. And God bless you all..

   Here is a transcript of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's toast Tuesday at the dinner President Reagan hosted at
the home of the U.S. ambassador:
   Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mrs. Reagan, ladies and
gentlemen, comrades: I thank you, Mr. President for the words of
greeting you've just addressed to us. Two great nations have given
the two of us a mandate to determine what Soviet-American relations
should be like. Since our first meeting in Geneva, relations
between our two countries have overcome a long, drawn-out period of
confrontation to reach an acceptable level from it which it is now
easier to move forward. In Reykjavik, in Washington, and during
this present visit of yours, our dialogue has been intense. It's
most important result has been the now-ratified first treaty to
reduce nuclear weapons. A search is continuing to find a solution
for problems relating to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive
arms. The Geneva Accord on Afghanistan has come into force. We now
have as many as 47 bilateral agreements on cooperation.
   The visit by a president of the United States to the Soviet
Union is an occasion for a glance at the past, and a look into the
future. The history of relations between our two countries has
known all kinds of things, good and bad. Of the good things, we
remember particularly well the Soviet-American comradeship in arms
in World War II. Those grim years saw the emergence of the first
shoots of Soviet-American friendship. And there was not one single
Soviet citizen who did not feel bitter when that glorious page in
the history of our relations gave way to Cold War. That was a hard
test for our peoples. The world found itself in a dangerous
situation. We all felt the breath of impending catastrophe. Even
today, we're sometimes chilled by cold winds. But world
developments, in their main tendency, are turning toward a search
for political solutions, toward cooperation and peace. We are, all
of us, witnesses to momentous changes, though a lot still has to be
done to achieve irreversible change.
   Although everything urges cooperation and trust, prejudices and
stereotypes are still with us, as is rivalry, above all in the
military sphere. A great deal has been said at this meeting too
about how pointless and catastrophic it is. More importantly, we
can register some headway toward better mutual understanding in
this area as well.
   Today, I would like to address another major world problem _ the
situation in the developing world, which cannot but affect our
countries, too. The problems which the developing countries face
have turned out to be difficult to the point of tragedy. Glaring
backwardness, hunger, poverty and mass diseases continue to beset
entire nations, and incredibly high debt has become an excruciating
and universal problem. It would seem that everybody can see its
complexity, involving as it does extremely diverse and truly vital
interests, and understand that a way out must be sought.
   We believe that if the international community, and above all
the great powers, are to be of any help, the starting point and the
essential thing is to recognize unconditionally the freedom of
choice. We are insisting on fairness. We have seriously studied the
economic situation in developing nations, and I am convinced that a
way out is possible along the lines of a radical restructuring of
the entire system of world economic relations without any
discrimination for political reasons. This would promote a
political settlement of regional conflicts which not only impede
progress in that part of the world, but also cause turmoil in the
entire world situation. With such an approach, our differences as
to what kind of a future awaits the Third World would not take on
confrontational forms. So in this matter too, our relationship is
doomed to have an international dimension.
   Turning now to our bilateral relations, we envision their
opportunities and prospects primarily in the light of internal
evolution in both countries, but also in the context of world
developments. Many Americans who are studying us and who have
visited the USSR, and now, I hope, those present here as well, have
been able to see for themselves the sweeping scope of change in our
country. It is based on comprehensive democratization and radical
economic reform. I am gratified to note that today the president
and I have had an in-depth exchange of views on this subject. We
have also discussed our perestroika a number of times with other
Americans. This is all to the good. It, too, is a sign of change in
our relationship.
   We, for our part, are trying to closely follow the profound
trends in the United States. We see how little similarity there is
between what is happening in our country and in yours, in two very
different societies based on different values. But we do not regard
this as an obstacle to identifying promising areas for mutually
beneficial ties or for cooperation in the interests of the two
peoples. We're in favor of competition and comparison.
   And another thing, whatever the ups and downs of our dialogue
with America, Soviet representatives have been upholding the
interests of the Soviet state. In their contacts with us, American
officials have been acting in exactly the same way, vis-a-vis their
own interests. The truth is, that in building their relationship,
the Soviet Union and the United States can effectively serve their
own interests only if they have a realistic view and take account
of each other's interests and intentions.
   We must learn the difficult art of not just existing side by
side, but of building bridges of mutually beneficial cooperation.
Soviet and American people want to live in peace and communicate in
all areas in which they have a mutual interest. The interest is
theirs, and it is growing. We feel no fear. We are not prejudiced.
We believe in the value of communication.
   I ee a future in which the Soviet Union and the United States
base their relations on disarmament, a balance of interest and
comprehensive cooperation, rather than on deterring each other or
upgrading their military capabilities. I see a future in which
solutions to real problems are not impeded by problems historically
outdated or artificially kept alive, inherited from the times of
the Cold War, and in which the policies of confrontation give way
to a joint quest based on reason, mutual benefit, and readiness to
compromise.
   I see a future in which our two countries, without claiming any
special rights in the world, are always mindful of their special
responsibility in a community of equal nations. It will be a world
that is safer and more secure, which is so badly needed by all
people on earth, by their children and grandchildren, so that they
can gain and preserve the basic human rights _ the right to life,
work, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness.
   The path towards this future can be neither easy nor short. We
may be standing at the threshold of a uniquely interesting period
in the history of our two nations. This new meeting between the two
of us, Mr. President, confirms that three years ago in Geneva, we
took the right decision. May the years to come bring a healthier
international environment. May life be triumphant.
   To the very good health of the president, to the very good
health of Mrs. Nancy Reagan, to cooperation between our two peoples.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's toast
at a dinner Tuesday honoring Soviet leader and Mrs. Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The general secretary and I had already held three meetings
before this one began here in Moscow. Each of those earlier
encounters took place in the autumn. The days were growing short,
the weather ever grayer and colder. It makes for a bracing,
delightful change to have this meeting take place at the high point
of spring, a time of long, light-filled days.
   I know that Nancy found her springtime visit to Leningrad
earlier today both magnificent and moving. The play of light upon
the rivers and canals added the special splendor of the season to a
city splendid in any season. And everywhere, Nancy has told me,
there was a sense of history, especially of Leningrad's immense
courage and sacrifice during the Second World War, surely one of
the most stirring epics in the whole human story.
   Here in Moscow, I have been reminded a number of times during
this springtime visit of a passage in a book about your country by
Lawrence vanderPost. Especially struck by the city's churches,
vanderPost wrote that when he caught his first sight of the Moscow
skyline, he saw ``the light of an unusually pure evening upon it.
That light was alchemical, and it transformed Moscow into a city of
gold, the tops of the spires and pinnacles drawing the rigid forms
of the skyscrapers after them into arrows of gold aimed at the
arched and timeless blue.''
   So we, too, have found a city of beauties, a city especially
whose pinnacles and spires reminded one at virtually every turn of
man's ancient capacity for aspiration, for reaching out toward the
light.
   It's a particular pleasure to be able to welcome you to Spaso
House, a house of considerable beauty in its own right, the
residence of our ambassadors to the Soviet Union. During the 55
years of diplomatic relations between our two nations, Spaso House
has served as one of the principal settings for exchanges between
us, exchanges formal and informal alike.
   There've been some splendid moments within these walls.
   Prokofiev once conducted his marvelous, ``The Love for Three
Oranges,'' in this very room. As wartime allies, our
representatives met often under this roof, and Ambassador and Mrs.
Matlock have continued the tradition of making Spaso House a
centerpiece of American culture, a place to receive and talk with
Soviet officials, and with people from all walks of life and from
all parts of the Soviet Union.
   But, there have also been quiet times in this house _
unnaturally quiet times _ times when difficult relations between us
meant that this house, this huge magnificent house, stood virtually
empty of visitors. I'm told that it was even possible to hear the
Moscow metro rumbling past ever so faintly deep in the earth below.
   Mr. General Secretary, we know that on matters of great
importance, we will continue to differ profoundly, and yet, you and
I have met four times now, more often than any previous president
and general secretary. While our discussions have sometimes been
pointed or contentious, we possess an enlarged understanding of
each other and of each other's country.
   On specific matters of policy, we have made progress, often
historic progress. And perhaps most important, we have committed
our nations to continuing to work together, agreeing that silence
must never again be permitted to fall between us. We have agreed
always to continue the interchanges between our nations because, I
believe, we both hear the same voice, the same overwhelming
imperative. What that voice says can be expressed in many ways, but
I've found it in vivid form in Pasternak's poem, ``The Garden of
Gethsemane.'' Listen, if you will, to Pasternak's account of that
famous arrest.
   There appeared, no one knew from where, a crowd of slaves and a
rabble of knaves with lights and swords, and leading them, Judas
with a traitor's kiss upon his lips. Peter repulsed the ruffians
with his sword, and cut off the ear of one of them, but he heard,
you cannot decide a dispute with weapons. Put your sword in its
place, o man. That's the voice: Put your sword in its place, o man.
That is the imperative, the command. And so, we will work together,
that we might forever keep our swords at our sides.
   Mr. General Secretary, ladies and gentlemen, Spaso House has, as
I've said, seen quiet times, yet the animated conversation of this
evening has already done much to make up for them.
   And so, I would like to raise a glass _ a glass to the continued
interchange between our two nations, and if I may, to Spaso House
itself, as a symbol of our relations. May this lovely home never
lack for visitors and shared meals and the sounds of spirited
conversation, and even the peal of hearty laughter. Thank you, and
God bless you, to the general secretary, to Mrs. Gorbachev, to the
relationship that I believe must continue.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Challenges but No `Confrontation' at Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he does ``not foresee
confrontation'' at the Democratic National Convention although he
is considering challenges on a range of issues from platform planks
to the status of ``super delegates.''
   In an interview Tuesday, Jackson's convention manager said the
candidate expects to ``have a significant impact on the platform
itself, not just some minority reports.''
   Ron Brown, a Washington lawyer and party activist, said there
was ``great concern among Democrats over what Jesse's core
constituency does in the general election.''
   Black voters, who provided the base of Jackson's support in
primaries and caucuses, have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in
recent presidential elections. But there now is concern within the
party over whether those voters will turn out in large numbers if
they believe Jackson was shortchanged at the party convention in
July.
   After meeting Sunday with black supporters, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the likely party presidential nominee, said: ``I
don't see any deep divisions, philosophically, ideologically, on
the issues. I don't see any of that. We're going to have as united
a Democratic Party as we've ever had.''
   Campaigning in New Jersey on Monday, Jackson said, ``I do not
foresee confrontation. We can effectively negotiate on mutually
respectful terms.''
   But he also held out the possibility of floor fights over
platform issues.
   Brown said Jackson has ``become in effect the leader of the
progressive part of the Democratic Party'' and he added that the
enthusiasm his supporters would show for a Dukakis candidacy would
depend ``not only on what Jackson does and how he is treated but he
is perceived to have been treated.''
   Brown also said Jackson expects to play ``a strong role'' in the
selection of the party's vice presidential nominee, although he
does not anticipate having veto power over that choice.
   When asked whether he would accept second place on a Dukakis
ticket, Jackson said, ``I've earned consideration.''
   While saying he did not believe Jackson expected to have a veto
power over the vice presidential candidate, Brown said he thought
selection of Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia ``would not be a great
signal'' to Jackson supporters.
   On the other hand, Brown said, Jackson ``has not indicated he
expects to have a blackball of any candidate _ that's not a view
I've heard expressed by him at all.''
   By limiting their count to only elected committed delegates, the
Jackson campaign is arguing that Dukakis will not have a delegate
majority when the convention convenes in Atlanta in July.
   ``We count `super delegates' as uncommitted until they cast
their vote on the ballot for president,'' said Brown. Super
delegates are party and elected officials who became automatic,
uncommitted delegates outside the primary and caucus process.
   The role of super delegates in choosing Democratic presidential
nominees will be one of the major issues raised by the Jackson
forces at the convention, Brown said.
   ``We want to get the party to look at the general fairness or
lack thereof of the process,'' he said.
   ``There ought to be some nexus between the popular vote and
delegate strength,'' added Brown. ``Who said the purpose of super
delegates is to flock to the front-runner?''
   Many of the 1988 super delegates have been flocking to Dukakis.
   Even though Jackson finished first or second in 36 primaries and
caucuses this year, ``not a single governor, not a single senator,
not a single state party chair _ with the exception of the District
of Columbia _ has declared support for him,'' Brown said.
   He said a Jackson challenge to the role of super delegates would
be more likely to apply to future conventions than the 1988
gathering.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Capture Strategic Valley Used By Soviets To Withdraw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas have wrested control of
the valley through which Soviet troops are withdrawing from
Afghaninstan but are sparing the retreating Red Army, Western
diplomats and guerrilla officials say.
   The sources, who spoke Tuesday, gave credence to reports that a
deal had been struck between a guerrilla commander and the
Kremlin's army allowing Soviet soldiers to leave Afghanistan if
they do so peacefully.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also reported
rumors of an imminent military coup in Kabul and said the Soviets
have been giving the Afghan army more sophisticated gear than
before.
   The gear includes Soviet-built AN-12 transports, jets comparable
to the U.S. Turbo-prop C-130 Hercules, large bombs, infrared
nightsighting devices for small arms and new radar equipment.
   The anti-communist guerrillas are apparently also getting their
share of top-notch weaponry.
   Official Afghan television showed pictures of a new long-range
rocket captured south of the city. The rocket has a range of about
12 miles and is believed to come from the United States.
   Washington, while acknowledging it supplies the guerrillas,
rarely discloses details of arms shipments. China and Pakistan also
arm the guerrillas.
   Meanwhile, the insurgents were reported to have stepped up
rocket attacks on Kabul, a possible indication they are getting
stronger and drawing nearer to Afghanistan's center of power.
   Diplomats citing dispatches from the capital said 14 rockets
slammed into the city, mainly into its western and southern
districts, from May 23-30. That was the heaviest missile attack on
Kabul in any week this year.
   Several Western military analysts, all speaking on condition of
anonymity, say guerrillas are now operating within six to 12 miles
of Kabul, which is on a plain ringed by hills.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet withdrawal continued as Red Army troops
evacuated towns south of Kabul in their second major retreat from
Afghan outposts.
   Western and Soviet diplomatic sources in Kabul said Soviet
troops left Ghazni, 85 miles southwest of Kabul, and Gardez, 60
miles south of Kabul, and were heading north toward the Soviet
border.
   The evacuation of Soviet troops from the area leaves the Afghan
army largely unassisted, at least on the ground, against attacks by
anti-government guerrillas in the provinces separating Kabul from
the Pakistani border to the south and southeast.
   On Tuesday, the guerrillas said from their headquarters in
Pakistan that they captured the strategic Panjshir Valley northeast
of Kabul last Thursday. Diplomats in Islamabad supported the claim.
   The Salang highway, the major Soviet withdrawal route, runs
through the valley, but the insurgents say they are letting the Red
Army pass without attacking.
   Recent reports said the guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Masood
made a deal with the Soviet military to leave its troops alone if
they retreat peacefully.
   Masood has made such deals in the past, but only at a price.
   It is not known what concessions he may have extracted from the
Soviets.
   The Soviet withdrawal started May 15 with departure of troops
from Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul.
   Under an April agreement signed in Geneva, the Soviets are to
complete their withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989. When the pullout began,
the Soviets had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in Afghanistan. About
10,000 have left so far, according to reports from Moscow.
   The Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan began in
December 1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a Soviet-style
government in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks.
   Sources in Pakistan said speculation has been rife about a
possible military coup when President Najib leaves the country for
10 days beginning Saturday.
   Najib will be going to Moscow and is also scheduled to speak at
the United Nations in New York.
   Speculation focuses on the Khalq faction of the governing
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The faction dominates the
police and military. Najib's Parcham wing also is split in two: his
supporters and those of former leader Babrak Karmal.

   City Council couldn't agree whether members
should face each other or the public, but unanimously decided to
study the matter.
   The councilors on Tuesday considered doing away with their
decades-old semicircular seating arrangement, which allows them to
face each other rather than the public during meetings.
   The current ``horseshoe ... certainly gives the appearance that
council members are not listening,'' said Councilwoman Joan Milke
Flores.
   Councilman Nate Holden said he thought the change would be a
misuse of taxpayers' money and ``nothing more than a
headline-grabber.''
   Councilman Joel Wachs wasn't sure a rearrangement was a good
idea.
   ``I think it's worked well this way, and I don't think I would
like to see it changed,'' Wachs said.
   The Council voted 11-0 to order a study of whether changing the
seating would violate regulations that govern the council chamber,
which is designated a historical landmark.

   A man convicted of soliciting a murder
contract through Soldier of Fortune magazine has been sentenced to
a 40-year prison term.
   Richard Michael Savage received the maximum prison term for the
crime from U.S. District Judge James DeAnda on Monday.
   Savage is already serving a 40-year term in a Florida federal
prison for arranging the beating death of the former assistant city
manager of West Palm Beach, Fla. The latest sentence would follow
that term and a consecutive 25-year sentence in a federal prison in
Arkansas on a conviction for attempted murder-for-hire and
threatening a witness.
   Savage, 39, was convicted April 6 on charges he masterminded the
bungled bombing of Dana Free's home in October 1985. Savage of
Knoxville, Tenn., ran a ``gun for hire'' advertisement in Soldier
of Fortune magazine in June 1985.
   Alice V. Brado, a terminally ill Colorado widow, pleaded guilty
to paying Savage $20,000 to kill Free, her former business partner.
Ms. Brado, who later died in prison, said she wanted Free dead
because he bilked her out of her life savings of $300,000.
   Free was not at his Houston area home at the time of the
bombing. He also escaped two previous attempts to bomb his car in
Atlanta.
   Savage was tried in Brownsville after DeAnda ruled the defendant
could not get a fair trial in Houston because of publicity from an
unrelated civil suit against Soldier of Fortune. In that case, a
federal jury awarded $9.4 million to the family of a woman killed
after an ad ran in the magazine.

   President Reagan says he plans to become an
after-dinner and luncheon speaker afer he leaves office and that
he'll try to convince the American people to rescind the two-term
limits on presidents.
   The 22nd Amendment, which prescribes that limit, was ratified by
the states in 1951.
   ``It was an interference with the democratic rights of the
people,'' he told students at Moscow State University on Tuesday
during a question and answer session. ``The people should be
allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for as many times as
they want to vote for them.''
   The reply, which drew applause, was in answer to a question of
whether Reagan would like a third term.
   The president explained that a tradition of two-term presidents
had grown up since George Washington refused a third tirm because
he didn't want to foster a monarchy. He said the amendment passed
because of ``the atmosphere of the time.''
   ``I think it was kind of a revenge against Franklin Delano
Roosevelt who was elected four times,'' Reagan told the students.
   He said when he leaves office he'll travel around the mashed
potato circuit ``and try to convince the people of our country that
they should wipe out that amendment to the Constitution.'' The
president said, ``I can't do this while I'm in office because it'll
look as if I'm selfishly doing it for myself.''
   Reagan said that on the speaking circuit he'll tell ``about a
few things that I didn't get done in government, but urging the
people to tell the Congress they wanted them done.''

   Nancy Reagan's fondness for astrology became an
abstract point of ridicule during the president's meeting Tuesday
with intellectuals.
   Film director Elem Klimov made no direct reference to Mrs.
Reagan's reliance on stargazers during his remarks to Reagan, but
he noted that ``our'' astrologers had predicted this would be the
century of Russia.
   He suggested with a smile that perhaps U.S. and Soviet
astrologers ``should follow the new fashion for conferences'' and
get together to exchange predictions.
   The president had no visible response to Klimov's remarks.

   Baskin-Robbins is coming to Moscow.
   Barney Brown, vice president of the Glendale, Calif.-based ice
cream manufacturer, said Tuesday the company has signed a franchise
agreement to sell its 31 flavors at the Hote Rossiya, across from
the Kremlin.
   The Soviets will operate the concession with Baskin-Robbins
providing the equipment and the ingredients, Brown said. The store
is scheduled to open July 1, about a month after hordes of
Americans who were here for the summit leave.
   Most Soviet citizens, who are frequently seen licking ice cream
brought from street vendors, probably will not be able to buy the

   Michael Dukakis intends to campaign
extensively in the weeks following the June 7 end of the primary
season, traveling to the South, West and Midwest as well as tending
to the business of selecting a running mate and preparing for the
Democratic National Convention.
   The Massachusetts governor also plans to make a speech on
U.S.-Soviet relations a day or two after President Reagan wraps up
his Moscow summit, according to aides.
   Dukakis, who expects to clinch the party's presidential
nomination in the final round of primaries next week, said in an
interview that he anticipates making a quick campaign swing with
his vice presidential running mate shortly after the convention.
   Dukakis declined to comment further on his selection of a vice
presidential candidate, although he acknowledged he has been
advised by members of Congress and others to pick someone who is
regarded as a moderate or conservative to help reassure voters in
the South and West.
   ``I'm not looking for a clone of myself,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor shrugged off Jesse Jackson's recent
criticisms that he is too conservative, saying, ``I don't see any
deep division'' that would mar the unity of the party's convention.
   ``I don't see anything that can't be resolved,'' he said.
   In the meantime, Dukakis' aides are converting as many delegates
as they can. Campaign sources said as many as 25 Oklahoma delegates
pledged to dropout candidates Albert Gore and Richard Gephardt may
enlist, perhaps as early as today. Other such converts could come
from Kentucky, and the campaign is trying to win over some of Sen.
Paul Simon's Illinois delegates.
   Dukakis' comments came as fresh public opinion polls show him
running ahead of Vice President George Bush, the locked-in
Republican nominee. Dukakis said he believes his success thus far
is due in part to the ``steady, consistent'' campaign he has run,
but also because ``there really is a strong desire for change.''
   ``The cycle has come around here,'' he said.
   Dukakis and his aides have begun to direct their energies toward
the fall campaign, even as they go about wrapping up the delegates
needed to clinch the nomination. They have hired a new press
secretary, Dayton Duncan, and expect to add an additional
speechwriter to the staff shortly.
   Dukakis hopes to use the five weeks between the end of the
primaries and the convention to get off to an early start against
Bush _ and keep the focus on the issues they want to raise and not
on the ins and outs of the vice presidential selection process.
   ``They will be a couple of highly thematic trips in which we
will do our best to get you guys to do something other than
political horserace stories,'' said Chris Edley, the campaign's
issues director. ``Something to keep the campaign themes in the eye
of the voters.''
   Dukakis frequently says that he does not intend to concede any
states to Bush in the fall, and Leslie Dach, the campaign's
communications director, said one purpose of the pre-convention
traveling is to reinforce the impression that ``we can win
electoral votes in every region of the country.''
   Aides said the first extended trip is a Southern swing the week
following the end of the primary season in which Dukakis will speak
about drugs and crime issues. Dukakis tentatively plans stops in
North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas, including a visit to
the Texas Democratic Convention on June 18. That will mark his
second trip to Texas since the state's primary on March 8 _ he
attended a huge barbecue with the state's Democratic hierarchy last
week _ and apparently reflects a decision to campaign hard in the
state where Bush got his political start.
   A trip is tentatively being planned for the end of June to key
industrial states, perhaps Michigan and Illinois, in which Dukakis
will address economic issues.
   The governor is expected to travel to New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania sometime around July 4, and a trip to California and
perhaps one other West Coast state is being planned.
   In addition, Dukakis may travel to Salt Lake City to address the
U.S. Conference of Mayors the week after the primaries, and also
may make a quick trip to California on June 22 to speak to a
convention of the American Federation of State County and Municipal
Employees union.
   Dukakis will spend the balance of his time working in his
statehouse office. He envisions ``three days a week in Boston doing
my job during the day, and having the evenings free for briefings,
discussions on everything from the platform to general issues to a
running mate.''
   The governor also has set aside time for a vacation with his
wife Kitty during June, most likely on Cape Cod.

<HEAD>Seized Research Ship Allowed to Sail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The research ship Atlantis II, seized under the
federal zero-tolerance drug policy, was allowed to set sail for
Oregon but must keep authorities posted on its whereabouts.
   The ship, which took part in the exploration of the wreck of the
Titanic, left its moorage here Tuesday, said Mike Fleming,
spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Los Angeles.
   Atlantis II remains under ``constructive seizure,'' which means
that ship officials must report the craft's position to customs
officials at least once a week, said Capt. Gary Chiljean.
   Chiljean, who was not the captain when the seizure took place,
said Monday the release of the 210-foot vessel was based in part on
an agreement that ``this would never happen again.''
   The ship, worth an estimated $30 million, is now bound for
exploration off the Oregon coast. The stop in San Diego was a
planned one for overhaul of equipment, Chiljean said, and the ship
remains on schedule.
   Customs officials seized Atlantis II on May 18 after finding a
tiny bit of marijuana and some residue in a pipe owned by a crew
member.
   The ship was returning with a Scripps Institution of
Oceanography vessel from an exploration off the coast of South
America.
   The seizure was one of the most publicized of the zero-tolerance
program, a federal crackdown in which officials are confiscating
boats or vehicles for discovery of any amount of drugs.
   Protest of the policy, including a congressional attack on it
last week, led to a Coast Guard decision to use more discretion in
deciding whether to seize vessels. Ships outside the 12-mile
territorial limit will be taken only if intent to smuggle is
determined.

   A study has found that the U.S. death
toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously
predicted, the head of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday
to mark the opening of the 1988 Atlantic storm season.
   Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier
thought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said center
director Bob Sheets.
   Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties
from Maine to Texas, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier
islands is virtually impossible, Sheets said.
   There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and there
are serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fare
if lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations, he said.
   During a hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flying
everywhere,'' said Sheets.
   He refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season,
saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predict
the number and severity of storms.
   The first tropical depression of the year has formed, and
remained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip of
Cuba, or about 200 miles southwest of Havana. The system contained
winds of up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen.
   One of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes could
fail this year, forecasters said.
   ``It's quite possible this year that we could lose GOES-West at
anytime,'' hurricane specialist Bob Case said of the Geo-Stationary
Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which records atmospheric
conditions over the Pacific Ocean and part of the Western
Hemisphere.
   If that satellite does stop working, GOES-East would have to be
directed to move from its equatorial orbit over Brazil to a spot
south of the Texas Gulf Coast, where it would provide a view of the
Western Hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricane-spawning
eastern Atlantic, he said.
   A previous GOES-East expired in 1984 and temporarily deprived
meteorologists of Atlantic atmospheric photographs.
   A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, has
10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind
exceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenching
rain and wind over 74 mph, Case said.
   In 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropical
storms in the Atlantic.
   Hurricane Emily slammed into the Dominican Republic on Sept. 22,
causing three deaths with wind gusts up to 110 mph. It recovered
enough punch to belt Bermuda with 116 mph wind three days later.
   ``Emily was the fastest moving hurricane of any known in this
century,'' Case said.
   Hurricane Arlene meandered through the Atlantic in mid-August
with top wind of 75 mph. Hurricane Floyd hit Key West with 75 mph
wind but fizzled out over the Everglades and Miami in mid-October.
   Here are the names to be given to Atlantic tropical storms that
could grow into hurricanes this season:
   Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence, Gilbert,
Helene, Isaac, Joan, Keith, Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Oscar, Patty,
Rafael, Sandy, Tony, Valerie and William.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution in the Iran-Contra case
insists a joint trial can be held, despite the judge's reservation
that it could damage the defendants' rights to confront each other
at trial.
   Separate trials for Oliver L. North and three co-defendants
would be ``a massive waste of time and effort,'' Independent
Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said Tuesday in a legal brief.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said a single
trial on the crucial conspiracy charge may be a ``practical
impossibility,'' but he did not rule on the issue.
   The prosecutor said that the defense strategy would require five
separate trials on various counts for North, a former National
Security Council staffer; and one each for John M. Poindexter,
President Reagan's former national security adviser; businessman
Richard V. Secord; and his former partner, Albert Hakim.
   Walsh said the defendants participated in a ``common scheme'' to
``create, protect, and preserve an illegal financial and logistical
network ... to support the (Nicaraguan) Contras and other
activities'' designed by North and Poindexter.
   North's lawyers contended that multiple trials were needed for
their client on counts that charged him but not other defendants.
Walsh said the law did not require such a separation.
   Gesell said last week a single trial would have problems because
co-defendants might be unable to exercise their rights to fully
confront each other in cross-examination.
   In this case, such cross-examination might involve questions
that refer to testimony given to the congressional Iran-Contra
investigating committees under a grant of limited immunity from
prosecution. The immunized testimony _ given by all defendants
except Secord _ cannot be used by the prosecution, and there's a
chance that Gesell may bar the defense from using it also.
   That would create a conflict between the Fifth Amendment
privilege of a testifying defendant not to have his immunized
testimony used against him and the right of a defendant under the
Sixth Amendment to confront his co-defendants in a trial.
   In the Iran-Contra case, Secord has asked for the right to
question North about his immunized testimony on grounds that
North's statements to Congress would prove Secord's innocence.
   Walsh replied there would be no need for a reference to the
congressional testimony, because the defendants _ testifying under
oath in both cases _ would provide the same information.
   ``Moreover, even if a defendant initially were to make
statements at trial inconsistent with his prior testimony, his
memory could be refreshed without the need for the introduction of
that testimony,'' Walsh said.
   ``Material used to refresh a witness' recollection need not be
admissible itself,'' he said.
   If a conflict developed between the congressional and trial
testimony, the court ``has the ability ... to decide whether to
permit a line of questioning drawing on immunized testimony,''
Walsh said.
   The court also has the option of severing certain charges from
the case to keep immunized testimony out, Walsh said.
   Gesell said at a hearing May 26, ``As I see it, it is a
practical impossibility to try the conspiracy counts in the
context'' of rules on immunity. ``If you try them (the defendants)
together, you violate the immunities.''
   But the judge added that trying the defendants separately
``makes a conspiracy trial a farce. None gets the benefit of the
other's testimony.''
   He commented at one point, ``Four individual trials is
ridiculous.''

   A federal appeals court ruling allows members
of Congress to keep the $12,100 pay raise they received last year
and continue using the law that gave them the increase.
   In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia agreed with a lower court ruling last year
that the Federal Salary Act is constitutional.
   Members of Congress earn $89,500, although leaders in each house
earn slightly more.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and five House Republicans
challenged the act's multistep procedure: establishment of a pay
study commission; the commission's recommendation to the president;
a presidential decision setting the increase; and the chance for
lawmakers to change the presidential ruling.
   The lawmakers said the Constitution's intent was that Congress
set its pay scale by passing a law, a politically risky system used
from the founding of the nation through enactment of the current
law in 1967.
   The challenge also contended the act violated the constitutional
separation of powers among the branches by delegating
decision-making authority to the president in setting the pay.
   The salary act determines pay increases not only for Congress,
but also for judges and high-ranking executive branch officials.
   Since the court threw out the challenge, it di not address
whether a decision declaring the law unconstitutional would have
wiped out salary increases for judges and administration officials.
   The appellate court said the 1967 law is constitutional because
it gives Congress the ultimate role of disapproving salary
recommendations by the president.
   The pay commission is established every four years, its members
appointed by all three branches. After the commission reports to
the president and the chief executive submits his figures to
Congress, lawmakers have 30 days to disapprove the presidential
decision. Otherwise, the president's figures take effect.
   Referring to Congress' ability to change the president's
recommendations, the court said, ``Whatever the practical
difficulties and political realities, Senator Humphrey and his
co-plaintiffs have readily at hand ... an `in-house' remedy. ...
The availability of an internally available remedy to members of
Congress means that it would be an abuse of discretion for the
judiciary to entertain the action.''
   In 1987, the commission recommended giving Congress a raise to
$135,000. But President Reagan, citing the need to reduce the
deficit, recommended the $12,100 figure.
   The opinion was written by U.S. Circuit Judge Kenneth H. Starr.
Joining him were Circuit Judges Patricia Wald and Harry Edwards.
   Challenging the law along with Humphrey were Robert Dornan,
R-Calif.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Beau Boulter, R-Texas; Jack Davis,
R-Ill.; and Clyde Holloway, R-La.

   Millions of abortions performed worldwide each
year pose the largest threat to global peace, Mother Teresa said
Tuesday after receiving an honorary doctorate for her service to
the poor.
   ``Abortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace because it
destroys two lives, the life of that child and the conscience of
the mother,'' she said at a University of San Diego convocation.
   ``It is a terrible thing for that little unborn child, which was
created to love and be loved, to be destroyed by its own mother.''
   Mother Teresa, who in 1948 formed the Missionaries of Charity,
an order with nearly 3,000 members worldwide, also asked the
audience of 6,000 people to ``share the joy of loving with each
other'' by giving possessions to the needy.
   ``By just giving of your abundance you don't feel the joy of
sharing, so give until it hurts,'' the 78-year-old Roman Catholic
nun said. ``This is the joy of loving.''
   The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who has served the
impoverished people of 71 countries since resigning as principal of
a Calcutta, India, convent high school in 1931, received an
honorary doctorate of humane letters.

<HEAD>SEC To Conduct Investigation After Sex Harassment Finding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission will
investigate behavior in its own offices following a federal judge's
finding that a worker was sexually harassed at the agency's
regional office here.
   Chairman David Ruder ordered the agency to hire two outside
counsel: one to investigate possible disciplinary action against
SEC officials involved in the case and another to review the
agency's equal employment procedures, spokeswoman Mary McCue said
Tuesday.
   The agency, meanwhile, is trying to reach a settlement with
staff attorney Catherine Broderick, who won favorable judgment last
month from U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt on her sexual
harassment suit.
   Pratt found Ms. Broderick was forced to work in a ``sexually
hostile'' atmosphere where male supervisors had romantic
relationships with secretaries, who received promotions and bonuses.

<HEAD>Military Tests Put Off By Court Order; Were Set To Start Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has halted tests scheduled to
begin today of a high-powered electrical generator designed to
simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn, after hearing arguments
from attorneys representing the Navy and the Foundation on Economic
Trends, issued a temporary restraining order on Tuesday against the
tests.
   Navy officials had planned to begin the test Wednesday with
Empress II barge in international waters about 15 miles off the
Virginia-North Carolina coast.
   The restraining order, which expires at noon Friday, was issued
to give the government time to file a motion in response to a suit
that demands environmental impact studies be done before the test
goes forward.
   The Empress II is equipped with two diesel generators and a huge
antenna system, capable of sending ``pulses'' of electrical power
into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to test a
phenomenon known as electro-magnetic pulse, or EMP.
   The Navy maintains the testing will have no affect on human or
marine life.

<HEAD>English To Probe Agencies About Role In War On Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Glenn English says he's launching a
series of hearings this week into the federal offensive in the war
on drugs to glean information that will serve as the cornerstone of
a 1988 drug bill.
   ``Congress is going to pass an omnibus drug bill in the next few
months, and it is essential to develop a record of exactly what
happened to the 1986 act,'' the Oklahoma Democrat said Tuesday.
``We have to know where we are if we want to know where we're
going.''
   English plans to ask more than a dozen federal agencies _ from
the FBI to the Forest Service _ about their role in drug-fighting
effort. The chairman of a House justice panel, English said he
wants to know whether funding, equipment and authority parceled out
to the agencies in the 1986 omnibus drug bill have been properly
used.
   ``The hearings will provide a good indication of how confident
the agencies are (in fighting drugs) and how well they spent the
money,'' said English. ``It's good for the Congress to find out
what happened to the 1986 drug bill.''

<HEAD>Noriega Silent On Former Presidents' Offer To Mediate Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH NAVARRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former Latin American presidents
say they met with Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, and offered to mediate this nation's political crisis.
   Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela
said they made the offer as part of a Latin American initiative
during a two-hour meeting Tuesday with Noriega shortly after
arriving in the country.
   State-run Channel 2 television later broadcast their statements.
   There was no immediate response from Noriega on the initiative,
and his press office would not say whether Oduber and Andres Perez
were still in the country.
   ``We came to offer our good offices to try to find a solution to
the problem. We are doing this as Latin Americans because we are
worried,'' Andres Perez said.
   He said he and Oduber told Noriega they planned to divide their
mission into two parties _ to achieve a dialogue between the
government and the opposition, and to resolve the confrontation
between the United States and the Noriega-controlled government.
   Both the opposition and the United States want Noriega to
relinquish power. The general, who heads the country's
15,000-strong Defense Forces, was indicted in Florida on federal
drug trafficking charges in February.
   Panama's acting president, Manuel Palma Solis, was also present
at Tuesday's meeting at a louge in Tocumen air force base near the
capital, which occurred after Andres Perez and Oduber arrived in a
private plane.
   The two were picked for the mission by President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica, who announced the initiative on Monday.
   An earlier effort to have Panama's Roman Catholic archbishop,
Marcos G. McGrath, mediate the crisis failed because of what Arias
called interference by the United States.
   Most Latin American leaders have been cool to Noriega, who has
been accused of electoral fraud, graft and political assassination,
but also resent overt intervention by the United States to force
the general's ouster.
   Panama has been hurt by U.S. economic sanctions imposed after
the drug indictments to try and force Noriega to leave Panama.
   But Noriega has not budged, and negotiations with a U.S. State
Department envoy about the general's stepping down broke down last
week.

<HEAD>Lautenberg Vs. Dawkins: Resume Against Record</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans believe Peter Dawkins, a Heisman
Trophy winner, Rhodes scholar and war hero, is the star-quality
candidate who can unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg.
   Lautenberg, a rags-to-riches business pioneer seeking a second
six-year term, warns that he won't give up his seat without a big
fight.
   With that battle well under way, Lautenberg, 64, and Dawkins,
50, say they are confident of victory. They are prepared to spend
$7 million or more apiece to get it.
   The two are crisscrossing the state in anticipation of Tuesday's
primary election.
   Dawkins faces no GOP challenger. Lautenberg faces nominal
opposition from two little-known Democrats: Elnardo J. Webster, a
40-year-old state Corrections Department recreation official who
contends the senator is out of touch with constituents, and Harold
J. Young, who is running as a ``conservative-radical.''
   Nationally, the Republicans have targeted Lautenberg as one of
the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents. President Reagan spoke at
a Dawkins fund-raiser in March that took in $300,000. New Jersey's
popular GOP governor, Thomas H. Kean, is chairing Dawkins' campaign.
   Lautenberg's bid is led by the equally popular Sen. Bill
Bradley, the state's Democratic senior senator. Lautenberg has
raised nearly $4 million and has tried to get the best campaign
help money can buy.
   In a way, Bradley is part of Lautenberg's problem. Since taking
office in 1982, Lautenberg has worked to emerge from the shadow of
his nationally known colleague, a former National Basketball
Association star and like Dawkins a Rhodes scholar.
   Part of Dawkins' strategy has been to subtly stress his
similarities to Bradley.
   The message has been clear: by electing Dawkins, New Jersey _
the brunt of garbage-dump and gangster jokes _ could be the only
state to boast two Rhodes scholars as senators.
   Dawkins has begun to sell himself as a natural senator. He was
captain of his West Point football team, decorated as a paratrooper
in Vietnam and named the youngest general in Army history. Along
the way, he studied at Oxford and earned a Ph.D. from Princeton.
   Dawkins left the Army in 1983 to join the Shearson-Lehman
brokerage house in New York. He resigned last year to become a
full-time candidate, and moved from New York City to the exclusive
New Jersey suburb of Rumson.
   Dawkins has a larger-than-than life presence, augmented by
piercing eyes, a Steve Canyon jaw and a broadcaster's voice.
   ``When he walks in a room, heads turn. People know he's there,''
said Campaign Manager Doug Goodyear.
   Lautenberg's camp says its candidate also has a remarkable
background, and two things Dawkins doesn't have: a proven
legislative record and a long-term connection with New Jersey.
   ``The Lautenberg story is very compelling,'' asserted Paul
Begala, spokesman for the senator's campaign.
   As he did in his 1982 upset of Republican Sen. Millicent
Fenwick, Lautenberg _ affable, white-haired and with a noticable
gap in his front teeth _ is stressing his roots as the son of poor
immigrants, raised in the textile center of Paterson.
   He attended Columbia University on the GI Bill, and helped to
found the worldwide Automatic Data Processing Corp. En route, he
amassed a personal fortune topping $25 million, and became an
international philanthropist.
   Lautenberg is running on his record, greatly enhanced when
Democrats took control of the Senate last year. Then an obscure
freshman, Lautenberg was elevated to chair subcommittees on
transportation and the environment, two meat-and-potatoes issues in
New Jersey politics.
   For Dawkins, the goal is to convince voters that his remarkable
resume qualifies him to be a better senator.
   According to Goodyear, Dawkins will assert that Lautenberg has
``a record of no achievement, no accomplishment ... lackluster
performance.''
   Begala countered, ``Frank Lautenberg's motto is `New Jersey
first.' The other guy's is, `Me first.'''

   Former Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy will run a
third time for the presidency this year to help establish an
alternative voice in American politics, according to the party
backing his bid.
   The Consumer Party said Tuesday the former Minnesota congressman
and senator planned a 1 p.m. EDT announcement today outside
Independence Hall.
   ``We think there's a need for a permanent third force in
American politics, one that can speak for consumer interests,
rather than corporate interests,'' party spokesman Darcy Richardson
said.
   Neither the party nor McCarthy expect the 72-year-old elder
statesman of anti-establishment politics to win the Oval Office
this year, Richardson said.
   ``It would be nice to pull off a miracle, but we're building a
party that we hope can be an effective third party,'' he said.
   Sharon Varallo, a spokeswoman for McCarthy, said Tuesday she
could not confirm or deny that McCarthy would become a candidate
for the 21-year-old Philadelphia-based party. There was no answer
at McCarthy's home telephone number Tuesday night.
   McCarthy ran as a Democrat in 1968 and as an independent in 1976.

   Japan's average household income has topped $40,000
a year, but nearly half of all households report difficulties in
making ends meet, according to a survey released today.
   The nationwide survey conducted by the Health and Welfare
Ministry showed the average income of Japanese households was
$40,400 in 1986.
   The figure was 2.5 percent higher than the previous year, but
was the lowest increase since the first such survey was conducted
in 1962.
   The survey, conducted last summer, says there are 38.06 million
households in Japan, with an average 3.19 persons per household.
   Of the total households, 3.47 million were composed of people 65
years or older, up 4.5 percent from the year before.
   The survey saysd 43.1 percent of the households of people 65 or
older are totally dependent on annuities or pensions.
   In the survey, 45,000 households, chosen at random, were asked
about the ages of their family members, and 8,000 about income.
   Asked about living standards, 52.4 percent said they were living
an ``average'' life, up from 49.7 percent the previous year.
   Forty percent, unchanged from last year's survey, reported they
found it hard to make ends meet. Those who said they were living a
``comfortable'' life accounted for 7.1 percent, down from 9.4
percent.
   Results of the survey are used in planning the government's
future welfare policy.

<HEAD>Doctors Looking To Help Young Kidney Recipients Grow Normally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that the finer points of kidney
transplantation have been mastered, doctors are looking for ways to
make young recipients grow up to be big as well as strong,
virtually impossible under conventional therapy.
   ``You can give them a good kidney, but if we don't give them a
good life, it isn't worth it,'' said Dr. Amir Tejani, director of
renal services at the State University of New York Health Science
Center in New York City.
   Children with kidney failure, like those with other major
illnesses, tend to be shorter than normal, sometimes barely topping
4 feet as adults. Even with successful transplants, they don't come
close to reaching normal size because of a steroid commonly given
them along with anti-rejection drugs.
   ``They want to look normal. They want to feel normal,'' Tejani
said Tuesday at the annual conference of the American Society of
Transplant Physicians.
   ``You can't tell them the world is made up of small people when
Americans are getting taller,'' added Dr. Ira Greifer, medical
director of the National Kidney Foundation.
   To help the youngsters grow, Tejani is trying to withhold the
steroid, prednisone, from their post-transplant treatment. The drug
usually is combined with the potent anti-rejection drug
cyclosporine and inhibits the growth plate in the bone from
functioning normally. It also causes acne and puffiness, most
noticeably in the face.
   Some children, especially girls, cheat on their medication in a
desperate attempt to improve their looks, Tejani said.
   ``The main bugaboo of children is that they look ugly and don't
grow,'' he Perhaps the best known case is that of Gary Coleman,
star of the former television series ``Diff'rent Strokes.'' The
19-year-old actor, who has undergone two kidney transplants, is
less than 5 feet tall.
   ``It's the ones who are 5 feet that want to be 5 feet 2,''
Greifer said. ``They would give anything for another 2 inches.''
   About 1,200 youngsters age 16 and under experience kidney
failure every year in the United States, according to Greifer. Six
hundred to 800 end up receiving new kidneys, fewer than 9 percent
of the total number of kidney transplants performed annually.
   Overall, transplanted kidneys were still functioning at a rate
of up 80 to 85 percent a year after the operation, according to Dr.
John McDonald, president of the American Society of Transplant
Surgeons.
   Tejani said that he's tried since 1983 to remove prednisone from
the treatment of 30 children whose transplanted kidneys have
functioned well.
   Twenty-three of the youngsters were able to be treated solely
with cyclosporine for a time, Tejani said. But nine of these had to
return to prednisone after experiencing episodes of organ rejection.
   The remaining 14 patients have been off prednisone for up to 4{
years without any episodes of organ rejection or side effects,
according to Tejani. More importantly, all of them have grown,
including one 17-year-old boy who has reached 5 feet 8.
   ``Even for a third of them to grow normally, then by all means
we should be doing this for our kids or at least trying,'' said Dr.
Lawrence G. Hunsicker, president of the transplant society.
   Children who undergo liver and heart transplants also experience
severe growth problems, but it's too risky to toy with their
anti-rejection therapy, according to doctors.
   ``With kidneys, if you goof you lose the kidney'' and patients
can return to dialysis, Tejani said. ``With livers and hearts,
there's no other option.''
   In patients unable to be weaned off prednisone, Tejani has
administered growth hormone, enabling them to catch up on some lost
growth. He's also tried replacing prednisone with immuran, an
anti-metabolic drug, but it's too early to know the results.
   Doctors at the University of California, Los Angeles are trying
other methods to enhance kidney patients' growth.
   For about the past year, Dr. Vera H. Koch, a clinical fellow at
UCLA, and other researchers have administered growth hormone to
young patients on dialysis and those who have undergone kidney
transplants. Up to 100 percent increases in growth have been noted.
   ``The data seem good. There seems to be hope,'' Koch said. ``But
we need to have longer trials.''

Wednesday morning; Will stand for cycle.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President
Reagan commenced their final full-blown summit session Wednesday
morning as top-ranking officials awaited a ceremonial exchange of
the final instruments of ratification for the medium-range missile
treaty.
   Gorbachev won a fresh endorsement Tuesday from Reagan for his
Soviet reform program, but the leaders only inched forward during
ticklish arms negotiations and Gorbachev suggested it may be ``time
to bang our fists on the table'' to end the impasse.
   A U.S. official said the leaders were likely to sign a joint
statement, either on Wednesday or just before Reagan's departure
Thursday, spelling out progress on two of the main obstacles to a
strategic missile reduction treaty in an upbeat overview of the
U.S.-Soviet relationship.
   Both leaders touched on the arms issue in toasts at a dinner
Reagan hosted for Gorbachev at the home of the U.S. ambassador
Tuesday night.
   The president said the superpowers should work together ``that
we might forever keep our swords at our sides.''
   Gorbachev responded by acknowledging the superpowers' rivalry
``above all in the military sphere.''
   But, he said, ``I see a future in which the Soviet Union and the
United States base their relations on disarmament, a balance of
interest and comprehensive cooperation, rather than on deterring
each other or upgrading their military capabilities.''
   The movement on the strategic arms front came on a U.S. proposal
to verify limits on mobile missiles and on counting nuclear-tipped
cruise missiles aboard warplanes, said the official, who spoke on
condition he not be further identified.
   There was no progress on the thorniest obstacle of all, and
Reagan said his Star Wars program was not even discussed. ``We
would like the American delegation to originate fresh ideas,''
Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said later.
   Nor did Reagan and Gorbachev attempt to tackle any of the thorny
regional issues that bear on their relationship around the globe.
They sidetracked policy differences in Afghanistan, southern Africa
and the Middle East to focus on Gorbachev's perestroika campaign to
restructure the Soviet economy.
   ``We still have a day and a half to go so I will reserve final
judgment,'' said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity at a midnight briefing after Reagan hosted Gorbachev at
dinner.
   Following the day's only summit session, Gorbachev steered
Reagan through Red Square, a stroll which delighted and surprised
visitors, especially when Gorbachev picked up and cuddled a
toddler. Reagan said he found Red Square, site of this communist
state's annual military reviews, ``wonderful.''
   During an encounter with reporters, Reagan was asked if he still
believed the Soviet Union was an ``evil empire,'' as he described
it in March 1983.
   Standing next to his host, Reagan said, ``I was talking about
another time, another era,'' the president said.
   Several reporters permitted access to Reagan for a few minutes
described him as looking tired and possibly limping. Spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ``There is no problem with the president's
health,'' but that ``he did have a difficult night's sleep.
   ``We are all a little tired, and that's reflected in all our
delegation,'' he said. But Mrs. Reagan, during her trip to
Leningrad, was asked about the president and said, ``He sleeps
fine.''
   The 77-year-old president arrived here Sunday after a four-day
rest stop in Helsinki, Finland, en route from Washington.
   On their third day of talks, Reagan and Gorbachev met in the
Soviet leader's Kremlin office, sitting beneath a portrait of Karl
Marx and holding what presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
called a largely ``philosophiocal'' discussion on perestroika _
Gorbachev's economic reform effort _ that ran more than an hour.
   In giving his blessing to Gorbachev's economic reform efforts,
Reagan said taht in his talks with the Soviet leader, ``I have
spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change _ to put
guarantees on reform.''
   He told Moscow State University students they are living ``in
one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. It is a
time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart
beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope, when the accumulated
spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free.''
   ``We do not know what will be the conclusion of this journey,''
Reagan said, ``but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will
be fulfilled.
   The leaders also watched and joined in the applause as Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze signed several secondary agreements, including a pair
of arms accords.
   Under one pact, the superpowers will notify each other at least
24 hours in advance of the time, place and intended target of
intercontinental-range missiles tests. The other sets up joint
experiments this summer in Nevada and Semipalatinsk of devices to
measure underground nuclear test explosions.
   Reagan, continuing his campaign to promote freedom and human
rights in the Soviet Union, met over lunch at the House of Writers
with artists, filmmakers and writers.
   He told them ``I`ve found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability to
grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that.''
   But the fellowship did not lead to any breakthrough in the
effort to agree on terms for a 30 to 50 percent reduction in
long-range bombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines.
Squabbling over Star Wars and sorting out pesky verification
problems stand in the way.
   ``I'm sure that if the president makes good use of his time that
we have remaining, I'm sure that we will be able to prepare the
treaty,'' Gorbachev said. Both sides expressed a commitment to
seeking agreement before Reagan leaves office.
   At the opening of their first session on Sunday, Gorbachev said
``it`s quite possible'' there would be another summit if the treaty
were ready before January 20.
   Gorbachev recalled that in 1985, at their first summit in
Geneva, the two leaders had reached an impasse at one point. He
said the president told him `Well, let's stamp our fists on the
table,' and I said all right.''
   ``Maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the table
once again,'' the Soviet leader said.
   Asked by a reporter if he agreed, Reagan said, ``I'll do
anything that works.''
   During a question-and-answer session with students at Moscow
State University, Reagan said, ``We are hopeful that it can be
finished before I leave office. But I assure you, if it isn't ... I
will have impressed upon my successor that we must carry on until
it is signed.''
   In the speech, Reagan stressed the value of American freedoms,
including the free market economy, and said, ``it's so hard for
government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever
substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to
make their dreams come true. The fact is, bureaucracies are a
problem around the world.''
   Then, in response to a question, Reagan said Gorbachev ``has
been most helpful, he has been most agreeable,'' in dealing with
the cases raised by the United States.
   ``I am not blaming you, I blame bureaucracy,'' he said in regard
to the complaints of restrictions on emigration and other freedoms.
   Asked about the remarks, Fitzwater said ``I think the president
is fully aware of the constraints on emigration here, and the
source of that is within the Soviet system.''

<HEAD>Official Freed By Strikers, Hyundai Motor Announces Lockout</HEAD>

   Striking workers today freed a top
Hyundai Corp. official they had held hostage for five days, but
continued to hold 10 other executives. Management locked out 20,000
workers at another Hyundai plant.
   Chairman Chung Mong-ku of Hyundai Precision and Industry Co. was
released from a plant in the southern city of Changwon in a deal
under which talks on workers' demands for higher wages are to
resume Thursday.
   He was taken to a hospital by ambulance and was being treated
for high blood pressure and exhaustion, authorities said.
   But company President Yoo Ki-chul and nine other officials
seized Friday were still being held by strikers, officials said.
Workers guarded the gates of the plant that manufactures rolling
stock and unspecified defense equipment.
   Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor Co., another division of the giant
conglomerate, announced a lockout at its plant in the east coast
city of Ulsan as 20,000 workers refused to return to work.
   Strikers then left the plant and said they would spend the rest
of the week helping farmers with the spring rice planting.
   Hyundai Motor, South Korea's biggest auto maker, produces about
2,700 vehicles a day. Most of its cars are exported to the United
States, Canada and other countries.
   The autoworkers went on strike Monday following strikes Friday
at the Hyundai Precision plants.
   About 4,000 workers were striking two Hyundai Precision plants
in Changwon and Ulsan. A Hyundai Precision worker who stabbed
himself in a suicide attempt Tuesday at the Ulsan plant was in fair
condition today.
   Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest used to try and
shame or discredit superiors such as the government or a company by
showing that surbordinates are unhappy or badly treated.
   Chung, chairman of Hyundai Precision, was released when company
officials and strikers agreed to resume contract talks Thursday.
The company agreed to give President Yoo full power to negotiate
with the union.
   Hyundai also agreed that no criminal charges would be filed
against union members who seized parts of the plant and held Chung
hostage.
   The deal followed a government warning that force would be used
to rescue the executives. The company had requested police action,
charging that the chairman and other executives were being held
illegally.
   Workers at the Hyundai Precision plants are seeking increases of
up to $177 a month. The company offered an increase of $54.
   Strikers at Hyundai Motors want raises of $183, against a
company offer of $106.
   The Hyundai workers average salaries of about $800 a month after
six years.
   Union leaders at the Hyundai Motor plant said they would meet
next Tuesday to decide on a future course of action.

<HEAD>Researchers: AIDS Virus May Enter Dormant Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have discovered that the AIDS virus
apparently may become dormant in the human body and undetectable by
the standard test, but say the finding does not mean the nation's
blood supply is endangered.
   ``The blood supply is exceptionally safe and protected to a
great extent by existing screning tests and the self-deferral of
individuals at high risk,'' said B. Frank Polk, a professor of
epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and
co-author of the study published today in June's Annals of Internal
Medicine.
   Tests to pinpoint the disease and protect blood supplies are
based on detection of HIV-1 antibodies, produced naturally by the
body to fight the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
   The instances of AIDS victims who stop producing detectable
antibodies to the disease appear to be rare and so far have only
been observed in those who have shown small amounts of the virus in
their bodies, said Homayoon Farzadegan and Alfred J. Saah, also
professors of epidemiology at Hopkins and authors of the study.
   Farzadegan and Saah said at a news conference Tuesday that four
homosexual men infected with AIDS stopped producing detectable
antibodies, though a newer test showed they still are infected with
the virus. Farzadegan said the phenomenon may mean that the virus
has the potential of going into a latent phase, during which it
does not reproduce.
   The four were among 1,000 homosexual men infected with the virus
who participated in the continuing study. The four showed the loss
of antibodies up to 3{ years ago, though one has since shown signs
of the AIDS infection and has developed antibodies again.
   ``Usually when an infected person loses HIV-1 antibodies, he or
she is in the end stages of AIDS and has a deteriorated immune
system,'' said Polk. The four ``had no clinical symptoms of
illness, such as swollen lymph glands or abnormal counts of the
white blood cells targeted by the virus.''
   The researchers reported their findings last June, but could not
determine whether the men had been properly diagnosed as having
AIDS or whether mistakes had been made in laboratory tests.
   During the follow-up study, the researchers used a new method to
test for the virus instead of the antibody test and determined that
the men showed evidence of infection, but not HIV-1 antibodies.
   The new test, called PCR or polymerase chain reaction assay,
magnifies the presence of the virus' genetic material inside cells
up to 1 million times.
   ``We don't know if something in the virus itself is defective
and causing it not to reproduce, or whether it is something within
the host,'' Saah said, adding that researchers have not determined
whether the disease is transmittable during this phase.
   Farzadegan said the new test was not commonly used to screen
blood donors because of the complexity of conducting it and
interpreting its results.
   In an editorial accompanying the article, Dr. Thomas F. Zuck of
the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said that even though
the four would not have been picked out by the AIDS test used by
blood centers, the finding does not mean that the blood supply is
threatened.
   He wrote that there was no evidence that unexpectedly large
numbers of AIDS virus infections had been spread by transfusions
since 1985, when screening began, and that efforts to discourage
blood donations from those at high risk for AIDS were largely
successful.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted
by exposure to the body fluids of a person who carries the disease,
including sexual contact, blood transfusions or the sharing of
contaminated hypodermic needles.
   All of the men who participated in the initial report are
participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, which follows
nearly 5,000 homosexual and bisexual men in Baltimore, Los Angeles,
Chicago and Pittsburgh to document the natural progression of AIDS.

   A genetically engineered protein that kills
transplant-attacking cells in mice should be tested soon on humans,
and researchers hope it will reduce or eliminate the need for
anti-rejection drugs.
   ``It's the promise for the future that's very exciting,'' said
Dr. Jack Murphy, chief of biomolecular medicine at Boston
University Medical Center.
   Researchers expect the protein to be introduced for some
leukemia patients this fall and for transplant patients in about a
year. The leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease
marked by an excess of the transplant-attacking blood cells.
   ``There's no question that if everything works out the way we'd
like it to, it will be a whole new way'' of treating transplant
patients and victims of certain immune diseases, said Dr. Robert
Kirkman, a transplant surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston.
   Kirkman said Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Transplant Physicians that the new fusion protein has
succeeded in prolonging the lives of mice after heart
transplantation. Nine of the 10 mice in the experiment appeared to
retain their new hearts permanently without need for continual
therapy.
   Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker, the society's president, hailed the
fusion protein as ``terribly important.''
   ``The hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidney
transplant and put in whatever one you have available,'' Hunsicker
said. ``Maybe (tissue) matching at that point wouldn't make a
difference.''
   Researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the new
protein, a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin, one of the
deadliest known toxins, and the natural immune system protein
interleukin-2.
   When the body's immune system is confronted with unfamiliar
material such as bacteria or a transplanted organ, it fights back
with a group of cells called T-cells.
   The foreign substances activate a small number of T-cells, which
produce interleukin-2 receptors, points on the cell surface to
which only interleukin-2 molecules will stick.
   Activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascade
that stimulates more harmful cells that then attack the
transplanted organ, leading to rejection of the foreign tissue.
   To prevent this from happening, Murphy and Dr. Terry Strom,
director of clinical immunology at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital,
isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to other
cells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin-2
molecule.
   The result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches to
only those T-cells harmful to transplanted organs, and kills the
T-cells with the toxin.
   ``This therapy only zaps the cells that are active (against the
transplanted organ) at that time and doesn't depress the
(disease-fighting) immune system across the board,'' Strom said.
   Cyclosporine, a popular anti-rejection drug, suppresses the
body's entire immune system and, therefore, enhances the risk of
infection. Side effects include kidney failure, excessive hair
growth and tremors. Cyclosporine also costs transplant patients
$5,000 a year or more.
   And doctors at the University of Iowa are reporting an increase
in malignant tumors in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine
along with steroids and another drug, azathioprine. The so-called
triple drug therapy is suspected of being responsible for the
cancer, although there is no hard evidence so far.
   It is likely the fusion protein would be used with cyclosporine
in humans, pending Food and Drug Administration approval, Strom
said.
   ``So maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will go a long way with
this toxin,'' he said.
   Researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used to
treat autoimmune diseases, in which the body produces a disordered
immunological response against itself. Such diseases include forms
of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.
   Also at Tuesday's meeting, Robert H. Rubin, chief of infectious
disease for transplantation at Massachusetts General Hospital,
warned doctors they may be doing more harm than good by putting new
kidneys into dialysis patients infected with AIDS.
   About 250 people currently are on dialysis who test positive for
the AIDS virus but exhibit no symptoms of the disease, Rubin said.
   ``Nobody wants to turn their backs on these people,'' he said.
But preliminary data suggest ``these folks do not do as well as
other folks following transplantation.''

   Gun owners have filed petitions to block
Maryland's pioneering ban on sales of cheap handguns and to force a
public vote on the gun control law in November.
   Fred Griisser, chairman of the Maryland Committee Against the
Gun Ban, submitted petitions Tuesday to the secretary of state that
he said contained signatures of more than 22,000 voters.
   The committee will need 33,044 valid signatures by the end of
June to force the law to referendum.
   Griisser said his group believes the law has the potential to
ban all handguns.
   The law allows the state to ban guns that are cheaply made of
poor quality materials and are so inaccurate that they can't be
used for sporting purposes or defense. It also bans those that
can't be detected by metal detectors.

   A would-be burglar who tried to enter a
restaurant through an exhaust vent got stuck and was found dead
with his feet in a vat of hot fat, police said.
   ``He got wedged in there and his feet dropped down into that hot
grease. He couldn't get up and he couldn't get down,'' police Lt.
Carl Goolsby said Tuesday.
   Dr. O.C. Smith, a Shelby County medical examiner, said Dennis
Johnson, 34, was apparently asphyxiated.
   ``By being wedged in the vent it compressed his chest and he
couldn't breathe,'' Smith said.
   Johnson suffered third-degree burns over his feet and ankles,
but those were not sufficient to kill him, Smith said.
   Goolsby said Johnson apparently planned to burglarize the fried
chicken restaurant by crawling through the rooftop vent after the
business closed early Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The beach season's start brought an
onslaught of sunbathers to one of Maine's few sandy beaches but
none of the turmoil expected from a ruling that limited access to
the seashore in accordance with 17th century Puritan law.
   But an attorney for homeowners along the cherished beach in
southern Maine warned Tuesday that vacationers who relax on the
wrong patch of sand could wind up in court.
   At issue is mile-long Moody Beach, which a Superior Court judge
ruled in September is in effect private. The judge agreed with 30
homeowners that the beach between the high and low tide marks is
limited to fishing, bird hunting and boating based on a 1648
ordinance.
   The homeowners argued that sunbathers occupy the beach in front
of their homes _ property which they say is deeded to them _ and
make noise and leave behind trash.
   Justice William S. Brodrick's decision has been appealed to the
state Supreme Court, which is expected to rule in September. The
high court's decision also could affect some of the remaining 35
miles of sandy beaches along Maine's 3,500 miles of coastline.
   Meantime, Wells police Chief William Zackular says he will make
no trespassing arrests at the beach this summer. He said he was
instructed by the offices of the York County district attorney and
state attorney general to withhold enforcing the court decision
until the Supreme Court rules.
   But Sidney St. F. Thaxter, an attorney for the homeowners,
believes the town must enforce the decision pending the outcome of
the appeal.
   ``It's always been a private beach,'' Thaxter said. ``The judge
says it's a private beach and ... the public isn't allowed to be
there.''
   Thaxter said the chief's actions violate the order, and he
suggested that the town is ``encouraging the use of the property.''
He added that the police should at least come up with a solution
more equitable to the homeowners if the ruling is not going to be
enforced.
   If that fails, Thaxter said he would consider suing beachgoers
for civil trespass.
   ``The homeowners want to live in peace with the town and the
people that live there, but they're tired of being abused,'' he
said.
   Zackular countered that he has increased patrols at the beach
and is considering adding lifeguards to keep an eye on sunbathers.
   ``Near as I can tell the vast majority of the Moody Beach people
are happy with it,'' the chief said. ``They're happy with the
increased enforcement. ... There are just a few people who haven't
been pleased.''
   The police department received no complaints of trespassing
during the Memorial Day weekend, Zackular said.
   But some homeowners found weekend beachgoers annoying.
   ``I feel so sorry for my grandchildren because during the summer
there's absolutely no place to play,'' said Dorothy Jones, 68, a
plaintiff in the lawsuit. ``And it isn't even safe to run down
there and play _ with all those strangers _ in this day and age.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet emgire Natan Sharansky called the
summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
``a show,'' and said the Kremlin policy of glasnost is simply a
``new set of instructions.''
   However, this week's meeting in Moscow ``brings more attention
to the case of dissidents and what's really happening in the Soviet
Union,'' Sharansky said at a news conference Tuesday to promote his
book, ``Fear No Evil,'' at the American Booksellers Association
convention.
   Sharansky spent nine years in Soviet labor camps after being
charged in March 1977 with espionage and treason. He staged a
hunger strike in 1982, and led other protests to allow Jews to
leave the Soviet Union.
   Sharansky, who now lives in Israel, was granted an exit visa in
1986, 13 years after he first applied to leave the Soviet Union.
   He said Tuesday that the summit was ``a show'' intended to
display only the good side of life in the Soviet Union.
   He said the success of Reagan's visit will depend on whether the
summit is used to put additional pressure on Moscow to improve its
human rights posture. Reagan met with dissidents Monday, and spoke
on human rights.
   Sharansky said that glasnost, the Russian word for Gorbachev's
policy of increased openness, is merely a means of improving that
country's image.
   ``The fundamentals of this system _ nothing has changed,'' he
said. ``Glasnost is simply (a) new set of instructions. ... It's
not that people are allowed to exercise more freedoms and do what
they want to do.''
   Sharansky said that economic sanctions linked to liberalizing
the system are the best way to win human rights for the Soviet
people.

   The husband of comedian Lucille
Ball says the 76-year-old entertainer is doing ``super'' in her
recovery from a mild heart attack.
   ``She didn't have a stroke,'' Gary Morton said Tuesday,
dismissing tabloid reports that she had suffered a severe stroke
last month.
   Miss Ball was up and around at the couple's Beverly Hills home
and healthy, Morton said, adding upcoming projects for his wife
were on hold because of the prolonged Writers Guild of America
strike.
   Morton drove Miss Ball to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on May 11
after she became ill at home. She underwent a complete physical and
was released a few days later.
   ``Right now she's recovered from a very slight heart attack.
She's doing super, sensational,'' Morton said.
   Miss Ball, with her first husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in the
1951-1961 television show ``I Love Lucy,'' one of the most popular
television shows of all time. It is still seen around the world in
syndicated reruns.
   The Arnazes, who had two children, Lucie and Desi II, were
divorced in 1960 and Miss Ball married nightclub comic Morton a
year later. He later became her executive producer.

<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of South African clergymen
has pledged to organize anti-government protests and called for
increased non-violent resistance to apartheid in apparent violation
of government restrictions.
   The decision was made at an emergency conference _ the largest
and most broadly based of its type _ that ended Tuesday with a
church service at the Regina Mundi Cathedral in Soweto,
Johannesburg's largest black township.
   ``We are determined we are going to obey God whatever the
cost,'' Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told a mostly-black crowd
of 1,200 during the service.
   Tutu then ripped symbolic gags from the mouths of black and
white youths on the podium, took up a wooden cross and carried it
back and forth down the cathedral's center aisle.
   The audience sang an African hymn, then held hands and swayed
together, singing the American civil rights song, ``We Shall
Overcome.'' Security force vehicles, including a tear-gas truck,
lined the street outside.
   More than 200 religious leaders representing more than 30 church
groups assembled Monday in Johannesburg to consider new tactics to
oppose the white minority government's racial policies.
   They ended the two-day convocation with a decision to mobilize
support for a three-day national protest planned next week by black
trade unions.
   They also said that, on June 12, they would start a campaign for
the release of political prisoners.
   The campaign is to end July 18th _ the 70th birthday of jailed
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said the clergymen's plans might be regarded
by some as civil disobedience.
   ``We are not trying to undermine authority or advocate
anarchy,'' he said. ``We are distinguishing between two different
kinds of authority'' _ that between God and man.
   The government has recently banned numerous groups such as
unions and newspapers from conducting political activity.
   Anti-apartheid factions in the church, which was not initially
included in the ban, have begun to take up the struggle where these
groups left off.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, mixed-race leader of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, said he had hoped the statement adopted by
the convocation would have been stronger, calling for more protests
and direct confrontation with the government.
   ``It will take time. But we are moving away from a theology of
protest to a life of protest and resistance,'' Boesak said.
   On the church podium were about 45 of the clergymen who attended
the convocation, including Tutu and Boesak.
   ``What this convocation wants to say is that the church of Jesus
Christ has no choice but to stand up for the poor and weak and
oppressed in this country,'' said Boesak. ``We say to the South
African government ... we must be more obedient to God than to
you.''
   During the convocation, workshops were held to discuss a range
of anti-apartheid tactics, including ``non-cooperation and
non-collaboration'' with the government.
   The agenda suggested that targets of civil disobedience could
include tax payments, military service and racially oriented laws
such as those mandating segregated residential areas.
   The convocation was sponsored by the South African Council of
Churches, which includes major Protestant denominations active in
the fight for black rights. Also participating were the Roman
Catholic Church and a number of independent African churches.
   Organizers said political conditions in the country have
worsened since leading clergymen decided in early February to
organize the convocation.
   They cited the effective bannings of 17 anti-apartheid
organizations, the closure of two opposition newspapers and pending
legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political
groups.

   Actor Don Ameche, who won an Oscar for his
role as an oldster given another shot at being a youngster in the
movie ``Cocoon,'' has turned 80 but isn't looking for anyone to
draw attention to the fact.
   ``He has rejected any attention on his birthday,'' said

   Ameche finished ``Cocoon II'' in Florida on Saturday and
returned to his Los Angeles-area home. How he spent his birthday,
which was Tuesday, was not disclosed.
   The 1985 film ``Cocoon'' was Ameche's 50th screen appearance.
During his heydey as a 20th Century Fox leading man in the 1930s
and '40s, Ameche was a utility star who was equally popular in
musicals, comedies and dramas.
   Previously, his greatest fame stemmed from the title role in
``The Story of Alexander Graham Bell.''

<HEAD>Reported Earthquake Was Really Strip Mine Blast, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekend tremor labeled as an earthquake
was a strip-mine blast, a geologist says.
   Michael Hansen of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
Division of Geological Survey said the blast at 12:18 p.m. Saturday
was labeled an earthquake by the National Earthquake Information
Center and state officials based on information on seismographs.
   ``It was picked up on a number of seismographs ... as far west
as St. Louis,'' Hansen said Tuesday.
   The blast registered 3.5 on the Richter scale of ground movement
and was centered near the southeastern Ohio community of Gaysport.
   ``Usually, we can tell the difference between a quarry blast and
an earthquake on the seismograph,'' Hansen said. But he said in
this case the seismographic waves appeared to be those of an
earthquake.
   Because Hansen remained suspicious, he checked with mining
companies Tuesday and learned one had set off a blast precisely at
the time the ground waves were recorded.
   ``We were not able to find very many people who felt the
earthquake,'' Hansen said. ``That was kind of strange, too.''
   Hansen said earthquakes have been reported in that portion of
the state most recently in 1953.

   ``Crocodile Dundee II,'' starring Australia's
wonder down under, Paul Hogan, was moviegoers' favorite at the
nation's box offices, outmuscling ``Rambo III'' in a battle of
sequels last weekend.
   ``Willow,'' George Lucas' $55 million medieval fantasy, drooped
to third after making its debut as No. 1 the previous weekend.
   Ticket sales for ``Dundee'' and ``Rambo'' totaled $50 million in
the first six days of release, while ``Willow'' sales were down 10
percent last weekend to $7.5 million.
   Audiences during the four-day Memorial Day weekend paid more
than $29 million to see ``Crocodile Dundee II'' and $21 million to
``Rambo III,'' in which Sylvester Stallone takes on communists in
Afghanistan.
   ``Willow,'' which cost $55 million to make, brought in $8.3
million in its opening weekend and $18.6 million since its release.
   ``Some think `Willow' is fading and some think $18 million is
great,'' said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., which surveys
box office performance. ``We'll have to see.''
   In fourth place was the Sean Penn-Robert Duvall street gang film
``Colors,'' with $2.43 million in receipts, followed by
``Beetlejuice'' with $2.41 million after nine weeks of release.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo today, while stock prices surged following an overnight
advance on Wall Street.
   After opening higher at 125.23 yen, the dollar climbed further,
closing at 125.35 yen, up a strong 0.55 yen from Tuesday's finish.
   ``The dollar held steady between 125.10 and 125.37 yen
throughout the day in mixed trading,'' said a foreign exchange
dealer with a major Tokyo commercial bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   There were active selling orders from export-related industries
but the dollar was supported by buying by financial organizations,
he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 193.60 points Tuesday, added another
287.21 points, or 1.04 percent, closing the day's trading at
27,703.91.
   Share prices rose almost across the board, encouraged by
Tuesday's rise on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 74.68 points and rose about the 2,000-point level,
traders said.
   Wall Street's rally prompted Tokyo investors to erase their
worries about the possibility of a hike in the U.S. discount rate,
an analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a heavy 2.5 billion
shares, up from 1.7 billion shares on Tuesday. It was the heaviest
volume this year, and near the market's record of 2.83 billion
shares set in March last year.
   Prominent among winners were steels, constructions and
chemicals. Drugs, electricals and automobiles also gained ground.

<HEAD>Fomer Welfare Mother Becomes Surgeon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who beat poverty and welfare to
become a surgeon says anyone can do the same, if they are
determined.
   The reception Dr. Charon Gentile got when she landed at Los
Angeles International Airport recently was considerably different
than when she first arrived in Los Angeles 11 years ago.
   At that time she was a welfare mother, a high school dropout
from Milwaukee, cradling her 3-month-old crying baby in her arms.
   She had $30, a gift from a shelter for battered women.
   Late last month, she returned to Los Angeles as a newly
certified general surgeon.
   Gentile, a proud new graduate of the prestigious Mayo Medical
School in Rochester, Minn., was greeted by her son Jimmy, now a
cheerful-looking 11-year-old.
   Gentile's mother was at her south-central Los Angeles home
planning a surprise party for her daughter.
   ``If I could get up on top of Mount Everest and tell about this
kid, I'd do it,'' Alberta Gentile said of her daughter. ``She is
just an inspiration.''
   More than 100 people showed up at a restaurant in suburban
Hawthorne recently to celebrate Gentile's success.
   Gentile, 28, was greeted by former neighbors and former
co-workers from the public clinic where she got her first taste of
medical life as a clerk.
   Also present was the administrator at that clinic who told
Gentile that she should become a nurse.
   Today, he marvels at her accomplishment.
   ``Honestly, I didn't think she could go through medical school _
with all the discipline that required _ and still raise her
child,'' said Tony Rodgers, administrator of the H. Claude Hudson
Comprehensive Health Center.
   Gentile didn't take Rodgers' advice.
   She skipped high school and passed a test giving her a Graduate
Equivalency Diploma.
   Then, she enrolled at Los Angeles-Southwestern Community
College. A year later, she transferred to Loyola Marymount
University, where she took premedical courses and graduated cum
laude in 1984.
   Her residency in general surgery begins in a few weeks at the
naval hospital in Portsmouth, Va.
   ``I think anybody can do it if they try,'' she said. ``People
tend to settle for so little when they don't have to. ... I'm sorry
that most women don't think it's an option for them.''
   Racial discrimination was an added burden during her studies,
said Gentile, who is black.
   ``One time (a dean) told me that the reason they let me into
medical school was so future generations of minorities, like my
son, would have a place in the world; but I wasn't really qualified
to be there,'' Gentile says.
   That hurt, but it increased her determination to become a doctor.
   ``As far as I can remember, that's what I wanted to be,''
Gentile said. ``I think it was a response to people telling me I
wasn't going to be anything.
   ``They say, `You can't.' Therefore you say, `I can.'...
Actually, I don't think it's that amazing. Anyone can do it.''

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
denies his government is using food as a weapon in northern
provinces where secessionist insurgencies and crop failures
threaten the lives of 3.2 million people.
   For the first time, the Ethiopian leader also accused Arab
countries of backing the rebel movement. He claimed the Moslem
nations want to consolidate their control of the Red Sea.
   During Tuesday's six-hour news conference, Mengistu's first with
foreign reporters in two years, he also called for better relations
with Washington.
   The moustachioed Marxist leader spoke with unprecedented candor
on numerous other issues, gesticulating with passion, occasionally
smiling and laughing.
   Mengistu denied his government is using food as a weapon in the
north, where the war and a government counteroffensive have
jeopardized a massive Western-financed relief effort for millions
of people facing starvation in Eritrea and Tigre provinces.
   ``How is it possible, how is it imaginable that a government
which came to power by the will of the people ... can be accused of
using food as a weapon,'' Mengistu said. ``We revolutionaries do
not live for ourselves, we live for others.''
   In early April, the government ordered all foreign relief
workers out of Eritrea and Tigre for security reasons.
   The International Red Cross at first said it was defying the
order to recall its 25 or so workers, citing a ``humanitarian
responsibility for the fate of some 5 million people'' in the two
drought-stricken provinces.
   When the government insisted that the Red Cross workers leave
the areas, the agency locked up its supplies and trucks and left.
   On May 22, Ethiopia gave the Red Cross 15 days to hand over the
food.
   Red Cross officials denied earlier requests because they said
they must be present to supervise the food's distribution. In the
past, there have been allegations that food destined for starving
farmers has fed Ethiopian troops.
   Mengistu said the rebels are using the food issue ``to elicit
international sympathy and support for them to promote their
propaganda activities against us.''
   On Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
Mengistu had promised when the two met two days earlier to allow
the United Nations to expand its role in the north to ensure the
continued flow of aid.
   The chief U.N. representative in Ethiopia, Michael Priestley,
said Mengistu had promised ``in principle'' to allow more U.N.
personnel into the north and to permit them to move outside
government-held towns.
   Rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front have been
fighting for 27 years in Africa's oldest civil war and have won
major victories this year with the capture of several towns.
   Mengistu, who is in his mid-40s, made no reference to a younger
insurgency by rebels of the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, who
have been fighting for 14 years.
   During the conference, Mengistu said unspecified Arab nations
were backing the Eritrean group.
   Rebels ``have embarked on a project of convincing the Arab world
of an alleged oppression of the Moslems in Ethiopia in order to
invoke the sympathy of the Arabs,'' he said.
   He said Arabs were helping the rebels in order to ``keep
Ethiopia from the riches of the Red Sea.''
   Ethiopia's ports of Assab and Massawa, both in Eritrea, are the
only Red Sea ports not controlled by Arab states. Ethiopia would be
landlocked without them.
   In the past, Mengistu has always said Western nations supported
the rebel movement.
   On Tuesday, Mengistu said the rebels also had won support from
leftist countries, which diplomats identified as Cuba and the
Soviet Union. About 2,500 Cuban troops stationed in Ethiopia have
refused to fight in the north.
   Mengistu defended his country's Marxist revolution of September
1974, calling it ``human and democratic'' and claiming it had
improved the lives of the country's 42 million people.
   He warned that relations with the United States would be hurt if
Congress decides to stop annual imports of 20,000 tons of Ethiopian
coffee, a move it is debating.
   Still, Mengistu said he hopes for better ties with America: ``We
have always pushed for better relations with the United States and
I hope the United States will reciprocate ... Once upon a time we
were good friends.''
   Western diplomats were puzzled by Mengistu's conciliatory
attitude.
   They pointed out that Ethiopia at the last minute caused Chester
Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, to
cancel a visit in January when Ethiopia announced he would not be
meeting Mengistu.
   In February, Crocker said he believed Ethiopia was not serious
about improving relations with the United States.
   Once-warm U.S. relations with this East African country
deteriorated after the 1974 revolution in which Mengistu and a
clique of fellow army officers overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie.
   The United States continued to arm the new military government
until Somalia invaded Ethiopia in 1977.
   In a dramatic superpower flip-flop, the Soviets started backing
Ethiopia and the United States switched to Somalia.

   The Cuban coast guard has seized an American
yacht with three men on board found carrying about 13,200 pounds of
marijuana, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported.
   In a dispatch from Havana on Tuesday, the agency quoted unnamed
Interior Ministry sources saying the yacht Caribbean King was
intercepted and seized Monday afternoon off the town of Mor, in
Holguin Province.
   It identified the three men only as a Cuban living in Miami and
two citizens of the Dominican Republic, and did not give their

   The drug, contained in 208 packages, was inicinerated by Cuban
authorities, said the dispatch, monitored in Mexico City.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung today
criticized American interference in Korean politics and said only
drastic changes in U.S. policy can stop a wave of anti-American
sentiment in South Korea.
   He said South Koreans resent U.S. support for this country's
past authoritarian regimes and Washington's demand that Korean
markets be opened to U.S. imports. Kim said the United States
should not try to influence or control events in South Korea.
   ``First of all, the United States should act up to our
expectation for democratization if it wants to restore sincere ties
here,'' he told the Seoul Foreign Correspondents Club.
   The opposition leader criticized U.S. requests for South Korea
to increase its contribution to the costs of keeping about 42,000
U.S. troops in the country under a mutual defense pact.
   The United States has also been pressing for greater access to
South Korean markets to help reduce Seoul's $10 billion trade
surplus with Washington. Korean farmers strongly oppose any moves
to open domestic markets for fear of hurting their business.
   Radical students have staged a series of protests over the past
two weeks to demand the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and the
removal of American troops. The protests have turned violent.
Radicals have attacked U.S. diplomatic buildings and fought police.
   Kim said the recent protests reflected public dismay over U.S.
policies. ``There would be no more anti-U.S sentiment as long as it
remains the patron of democracy and meets the wishes of the Korean
people,'' he said.
   Government officials and other political leaders say anti-U.S.
sentiment is confined to a tiny radical minority and most South
Koreans are pro-American.
   Kim predicted that the Olympic Games in Seoul that begin in
September will lead to ties with the Soviet Union and China and
help South Korea end its heavy dependence on the United States. But
he ruled out drastic changes in South Korea's relations with the
United States in trade and other areas.
   South Korea has no formal ties with communist nations because of
its rivalry with communist North Korea. The Soviet and Chinese
decisions to attend the Olympics are expected to lead to ties.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics because the
International Olympic Committee has rejected its demand to co-host
the Games.
   Kim expressed disatisfaction with ``foot-dragging'' reforms
proposed by the government and charged it with being ``insincere in
liquidating the evil legacy of the previous government.''
   Roh defeated Kim and other opposition candidates in the Dec. 16
presidential elections.
   Kim said today that the United States helped Roh win by inviting
him to Washington before the elections, giving the impression he
was endorsed by the United States.
   He said South Korea's democratic development would be ensured by
the political neutrality of the armed forces, which he said have
been used to ``maintain the dictatorial regimes in power.''
   ``I firmly believe the great bulk of the military opposed
intervention in politics ... even though it still maintains
considerable influence.''

<HEAD>Car Bomb In Beirut On Anniversary Of Karami Assassination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in west Beirut today,
where streets were nearly empty because Moslems went on strike to
mark the first anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister
Rashid Karami.
   Police reported no injuries.
   A police spokesman said a white Mercedes-Benz packed with 44
pounds of explosives went off at 8:20 a.m. in the Bir Hassan
district.
   ``The explosion shattered windows, but no casualties were
reported, apparently because the streets were empty because of the
strike,'' the spokesman said. He cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   Banks, schools, shops, government offices, gasoline stations and
other businesses closed in west Beirut and other Moslem areas.
   Karami, a Sunni Moslem who was close to Syria, was killed last
June 1 when a bomb exploded aboard a military helicopter that was
flying him from north Lebanon to Beirut.
   Syrian-backed Moslem leaders have blamed the assassination on
Israel and the right-wing Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main
militia.
   Both have denied involvement. An official investigation into
Karami's assassination has made no progress.
   Today's car bombing was the third in Lebanon this year. By
police count, 89 people were killed and 189 wounded in the earlier
bombings.
   Sixty-nine people were killed and 111 wounded April 23 in the
northern port city of Tripoli, Karami's predominantly Sunni Moslem
hometown, when a pickup truck packed with explosives went off in a
crowded vegetable market.
   A car rigged with 220 pounds of TNT exploded in Christian east
Beirut Monday, killing 20 people and wounding 78.
   The Lebanese Forces blamed Syria for Monday's bombing. The blast
came four days after 2,400 Syrian troops moved into Beirut's
southern slums to end three weeks of bloody fighting between rival
Shiite Moslem militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and
1,000 wounded.
   The Christians are at odds with Syria, the main power broker in
this country that has been embroiled in civil strife since 1975.
   Christian President Amin Gemayel torpedoed a Syrian-brokered
peace treaty in December 1985, claiming it stripped Christians of
their traditional power.
   The Syrians control west Beirut, most of the city's southern
slums and Lebanon's eastern and northern provinces. The Christians
refuse to let the Syrians into their enclave north of Beirut.
   Police said Syrian officers supervised an exchange of prisoners
between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
pro-Syrian Amal militia in south Beirut during the night.
   Police reported that Hezbollah released 120 Amal men, while Amal
freed 31 men it had captured.

<HEAD>Students Who Assault Teachers Will Be Expelled, City Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students who assault teachers will be expelled
and some classrooms will be get panic-button-like alarms under
sweeping security measures announced in response to a series of
attacks against teachers.
   The security plan also will include use of metal detectors,
electromagnetic locks, and more police in certain schools, Mayor
Edward I. Koch said Tuesday after meeting with schools Chancellor
Richard R. Green and other officials.
   In addition, Koch said, the officials agreed to ask the state
Legislature to upgrade the crime of assaulting a teacher or other
public official from a misdemeanor to a felony punishable by more
than a year in prison.
   Six teachers have been attacked during the past 1{ weeks.
   On Tuesday, a 27-year-old teacher was shot in the leg as she
left a school in the Bronx after dismissing her class, police said.
The bullet grazed her right thigh, and she was treated at a
hospital and released. The shot was fired by one of two men who
were arguing nearby. The shooter was not believed to be a student,
police said.
   Also Tuesday, a 31-year-old teacher was punched in the face by a
15-year-old student in a special education class at a Manhattan
high school, police said. The student was arrested and charged with
third-degree assault and then released, said Officer Peter
O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   ``The notion you have a right to free education is assumed,''
Green said. ``Students who violate that right by assaulting
teachers or any other school personnel will forfeit that right for
the rest of the school year.''
   He said students who engage in anything ``beyond a normal fight
will find themselves without a public education in New York City.''
   Until now, abusive students were suspended or transferred to
other schools. The city was researching whether it needs action by
the Legislature to permit expulsions, the mayor said.
   The recent outbreak of school violence included a baseball-bat
attack on one teacher and another who was burned when she picked up
a huge firecracker tossed into her classroom.
   Frank Sabrino, a Board of Education spokesman, said that from
last July 1 to April 30, there were 969 reported assaults in the
city's schools, 198 on teachers.
   The police patrols will be instituted at the 200 schools with
the highest number of serious incidents, officials said.
   Koch said metal detectors will be put in some schools on a test
basis and identification cards will be issued for everyone in the
school system. In addition, electromagnetic locks will be installed
so that a signal will sound when outside school doors are left
open, and teachers will be able to push a button in the classroom
that will let the security office listen in.

   A hurricane swept across parts of
Bangladesh for two days this week, killing at least six people,
injuring hundreds more and destroying thousands of homes, officials
and news reports said today.
   A government official at Gaibandha, 124 miles north of Dhaka,
said three people were killed and 170 injured when the storm hit
the area on Monday and Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least
1,500 houses, mostly made of mud and straw, were blown away. Crops
over a wide area were damaged.
   Newspapers said at least three other people were killed in other
parts of the country. Hundreds of others were reported injured, the
Bangladesh Times newspaper said.
   The storm followed floods in northern areas of the country,
caused by the Brahmaputra river bursting its banks.
   The government says at least 13 people have been killed in the
floods but local newspapers put the figure at more than 50.
   Floods and heavy rain are common in Bangladesh at this time of
year, when the annual monsoon begins.

<HEAD>Martin Luther King Day Bill Inches Forward In Arizona</HEAD>

   A state holiday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. won preliminary Senate approval by one vote, but
the future of the bill was uncertain.
   ``We'll have to see what the (Republican) caucus wants to do,''
Senate President Carl Kunasek said after Tuesday's vote.
   Kunasek, a Republican who blocked a similar measure earlier this
year, is not required to bring the bill to the floor for a final
vote.
   The bill cleared the calendar for debate on a 14-13 vote
Tuesday, but 16 votes are needed for final passage by the 30-member
Senate, and sponsors were unsure whether they could muster the
needed support.
   One of the three Republican senators absent Tuesday, John
Mawhinney, has said he would vote for a holiday for the slain civil
rights leader, while another, Jeff Hill, opposes it. Sen. Jacque
Steiner walked off the floor shortly before the measure came up,
and said later she had not made up her mind how to vote.
   The King measure has been controversial for years in Arizona,
which has separate February holidays for George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln. Many Republicans say they want to keep a separate
day for each president because Lincoln, a Republican, is important
to them.
   The federal government has combined the Washington and Lincoln
days into a single holiday and created a day for King on the third
Monday in January.
   The state Senate passed a King holiday like the federal day in
1986, but the House rejected the bill.
   In 1987, the House passed a King holiday only to see the Senate
bottle it up in committee.
   The governor at the time, Bruce Babbitt, then issued an
executive proclamation declaring a King holiday, but his Republican
successor, Evan Mecham, rescinded it, citing advice from Attorney
General Bob Corbin who said only lawmakers could create a paid
holiday for state employees.
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 when the Senate convicted
him in an unrelated impeachment trial.
   House leaders said they would wait for the Senate to act first
this year, and a King bill cleared the Senate government committee
but was mired in the Rules Committee, which Kunasek controls.
   On Tuesday, three Republicans joined the Senate's 11 Democrats
in tacking the King day provisions onto a state pension bill that
had already hit the floor for debate.
   Kunasek said he believed the amendment might violate a provision
in the state constitution requiring that each bill deal only with
one subject. He said Senate attorneys would examine the question.
   During the debate on the measure, opponents said the question
should be referred to the voters.
   ``I have yet to see one poll where the people of Arizona want a
paid holiday for Martin Luther King,'' said Republican Sen. Peter
Kay.
   Supporters said the state was losing prestige and tourist
dollars because of international publicity about the controversy.

<TEXT>
   The lead content of water exceeds federal safety
standards at half the elementary schools in Boston tested,
according to a preliminary state report, and officials say some
affected buildings will get bottled water.
   Samples from 40 of the 81 public and private elementary schools
show higher levels of lead than the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's allowable level of 50 parts per billion, according to the
Department of Public Health study released Tuesday.
   Nineteen schools have levels in excess of 20 parts per billion.
The EPA has been considering lowering the maximum level to 20 parts
per billion.
   Twenty had lead in their drinking water that was less than 20
parts per billion.
   Further tests are scheduled to determine the source of the lead.
   ``This is not an issue specific to Boston,'' said Brad Prenney,
director of the state Child Lead Poison Prevention Program. ``It is
an issue (that is) state and nationwide.''
   School Superintendent Laval S. Wilson said bottled water will be
supplied to the public schools with contaminated water. ``We want
to make sure our young people and staff have appropriate water to
drink,'' he said.
   State and city officials said lead poisoning rarely results from
drinking water that is tainted with lead.
   But high levels of lead in drinking water can add to lead levels
that may already be present in a child's body from other sources,
such as soil or lead-based paint, the officials said.
   Lead poisoning is known to cause brain damage and can result in
death.
   State officals said the test results are similar to those from
tests of homes in recent years.

<TEXT>
   Morocco and Algeria, which re-established
diplomatic ties last month, have done away with visa requirements
and plan to establish air, sea, rail and telecommunications links,
according to a joint announcement.
   Beginning Sunday, Moroccans and Algerians will be able to cross
into each others' countries with a valid passport. Four frontier
posts _ two in each country _ are being set up for that purpose,
the statement said.
   The announcement came late Tuesday at the close of a one-day
visit here by Algerian Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who met with
his Moroccan counterpart Driss Basri.
   It said a mixed committee would study how best to facilitate the
passage of goods and people and re-establish air, sea, rail and
telecommunication links. The report is to be submitted by July 5.
   The two North African countries, at odds for 12 years over the
Western Sahara territory, re-established diplomatic relations on
May 17.
   They broke diplomatic ties in 1976 after Algeria recognized the
Saharan Democratic Arab Republic set up by Polisario Front
guerrillas seeking independence for the Western Sahara.
   The Western Sahara was annexed by Morocco in 1975. Algeria
harbors and arms the guerrillas.
   The establishment of relations between Algeria and Morocco and
the bid to remove barriers comes amid preparations for the Arab
summit meeting in Algiers starting June 7.
   A ``mini-summit'' of the five North African leaders is to be
held on the sidelines of the Arab summit, according to Algerian
officials. It will be the first such gathering of Algeria, Morocco,
Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya since they became independent of
European colonial rule.
   They all seek a united Maghreb, or North Africa.

<HEAD>Bakker Says He, Tammy Should Be Given Chance To Save PTL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER BRYANT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker says he and
his wife, Tammy, should have a chance to salvage the failing
ministry before its liquidation in bankruptcy court.
   ``I think everybody else has had a chance,'' Bakker told
reporters Tuesday outside PTL headquarters. ``It's gone through so
many regimes; it's being sold off. What would be wrong with giving
Jim and Tammy a chance?''
   Similar previous pleas by the PTL founder to leaders who
succeeded him have been rebuffed.
   PTL's opinion that Bakker could never return as the ministry's
leader has not changed, ministry spokesman David West said Tuesday.
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds, who is overseeing the
ministry's bankruptcy reorganization, ``agrees with the legal
opinion presented by our attorneys that Bakker cannot return,''
West said.
   Bakker, who left the television ministry in March 1987 amid a
sex-and-money scandal, returned to PTL's Heritage USA theme park at
the request of Roe Messner, its primary builder and PTL's
second-largest creditor.
   Bakker said the meeting was to back up Messner's claims against
PTL in bankruptcy proceedings.
   He said he was shocked by what he heard in the meeting with
Messner and attorneys for PTL, Messner and Bakker. Bakker said most
the records left behind when he left PTL were destroyed. ``Almost
all of the blueprints of all the buildings are missing,'' he said.
   When asked who might have destroyed the records, he said, ``Any
of them who might want to take over the ministry.''
   Pressed for specifics, he said, ``I don't know.''
   Bakker said he wants to buy back the ministry if it is
liquidated.
   ``I would set up offices near here, which I probably will do,''
he said. ``As every piece of ministry comes up for sale, I would
buy it to restore it to the people it was meant for.''
   The ministry is up to $130 million in debt. A reorganization
plan calling for the sale of much of PTL's assets is up for final
approval by Reynolds in Columbia on June 16.
   ``I want to see the ministry restored 100 percent,'' Bakker
said, adding that the future ``looks bleak'' for the ministry. ``We
want it brought back. We want it redeemed.''
   Later, at the offices of the Bring Bakkers Back Club and
Concerned PTL Partners, Bakker said he was back to stay ``until
Heritage USA is a full Christian retreat again.''
   The Bakkers have left their home in California, and are
returning to their home in Gatlinburg, Tenn., said Bakker attorney
Ryan Hovis.
   ``We are here today to say we are going back on television,''
Bakker told about 60 jubilant supporters at the Brinn Back Bakkers
Club. ``If the good folks at PTL won't let Jim and Tammy try to
save PTL, then we'll go on television ourselves out here and we
will make our appeal to the nation.''
   Bakker left PTL after charges that Jessica Hahn, a church
secretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with
him. His departure was followed by revelations the Bakkers led a
lavish lifestyle at PTL.
   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., is investigating
Bakker, and he is involved in lawsuits with PTL and former Bakker
attorney Roy Grutman.

<HEAD>Schlueter Gets Chance To Form New Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
prepared to form a minority government after talks on a majority
coalition broke down, Denmark's public radio said.
   Schlueter was appointed as chief negotiator 10 days ago with the
task of putting together a government program that could win
approval from a majority in the Folketing, the 179-seat parliament.
   But the Social Democrats, Denmark's biggest party, and
Schlueter's Conservatives failed to close the gap between them on
economic and defense policy.
   Schlueter, who headed a center-right government until the
inconclusive election of May 10, now has support from a majority of
the eight parties to try to form a new minority coalition.
   After 20 days of political jockeying all attempts to build a
majority government appeared doomed.
   The election was called following a parliamentary row over a
toughening of Denmark's peacetime ban on nuclear arms which
provoked strong objections from its NATO allies.
   Analyists predicted Tuesday that the most likely outcome would
be a coalition of Conservatives, Liberals and Social Liberals
commanding a total of 67 seats.
   But the 10-seat Social-Liberals, who hold the balance of power
in the new parliament as they did in the previous one, had not
decided whether to join a new Schlueter administration.
   The Social Democrats and the allied far-left Socialist People's
Party together have 79 seats. Efforts to form a majority coalition
between them and the Social-Liberals failed earlier.

<HEAD>U.S. Accuses Soviets of Smear Campaign Over Nazi Allegations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Embassy official accused the Soviets today
of engaging in a ``smear campaign'' by charging that a dissident
who met with President Reagan was a Nazi war criminal.
   The allegations against Nikolai Rozhko, described by a U.S.
official as an American-born man living in the western Soviet
Union, surfaced in Soviet state-run media Tuesday.
   The embassy official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said the Soviets disliked Rozhko because he is
campaigning to emigrate, and ``is a focal point for others who want
to leave.''
   The Soviet charges are part of a ``smear campaign to pressure
him to cease his activities,'' said the official.
   A student questioning Reagan at the president's session at
Moscow State University was swift to grill the U.S. leader on why
he invited the German ``Polizei,'' or Gestapo, to his meeting.
   The president replied that he knew nothing about such charges.
Nor did White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater when asked about
Rozhko later at a news conference.
   But Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov reiterated charges by
the state news agency TASS that Rozhko was a war criminal who began
collaborating with the Nazi police in 1942.
   Rozhko ``participated in the killing of Soviet partisans and the
arrests and tortures of civilians (maybe Jews too?),'' TASS said.
   It reported that Rozhko was sentenced to death by firing squad
by a military tribunal in 1944, but that the sentence was later
commuted to 20 years' imprisonment and Rozhko was released on
parole in 1955 by a government decree.
   It gave no further background on the charges.
   A U.S. source who asked not to be identified said Rozhko lives
in Grozdno, in the western province of Byelorussia, a region of the
Soviet Union that suffered greatly after the Nazis invaded in 1941.
   Millions were killed in the occupied Soviet Union and many
thousands of others jailed or executed on charges of collaborating
with the Nazis, a charge that is viewed extremely negatively by a
Soviet public constantly reminded of the nation's suffering in
World War II.
   Gerasimov said Soviet journalists who attended Reagan's
reception for the dissidents _ which was criticized by Soviet
officials _ turned up the background on Rozhko by looking at Soviet
records.
   They ``were rather curious and looked into the dossier of the
invited,'' Gerasimov explained.
   ``They found out that one of them in fact was a policeman
sharing in the occupation of our country by Germany ... so he was a
former Nazi agent and a war criminal,'' Gerasimov said.
   The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Rozhko
was born in the United States and came to the Soviet Union as a
child with his parents. He has been trying to emigrate for the past
20 years, but the Soviets have denied him permission to leave.
   The source suggested that Soviet authorities have charged before
that Rozhko had a Nazi background, but never presented firm proof
nor implied that his history blocked his emigration.
   ``The Soviet government never once gave us one shred of evidence
of his Nazi activities,'' the official said. ``This was not an
issue (on Rozhko's emigration) until the Soviets brought it up this
week.''
   The official said he was speaking without direct access to
Rozhko's file and could not give precise details on the man's
background, but believed that he has a brother living in California.
   The official said he had the impression that Rozhko had served
time in a Soviet jail, but he did not know on what charges.
   Reagan's meeting with the refuseniks, unlike all other events in
his program, was reported with negative comment by the Soviet media.
   The Communist party daily Pravda and government newspaper
Izvestia on Tuesday criticized Reagan's meeting. Referring to a
speech Reagan delivered to the dissidents on Monday, Pravda noted
he had said ``it's time'' for more Kremlin reform.
   ``Indeed, it's time. Time to stop speculating on the problems of
human rights using this serious question as an easy reason for
self-advertisement and politicizing,'' Pravda said.
   Izvestia criticized Alexander Ogorodnikov, a religious activist
at the meeting, Lev Timofeyev, a campaigner for press freedom,
Rozhko and Abe Stolar, a 73-year-old American who has campaigned
since 1975 for his family to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
   Like Rozhko, Stolar was brought to the Soviet Union as a child
by his parents.

<HEAD>Tropical Depression Greets Start Of Atlantic Hurricane Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 Atlantic hurricane season
began today with the National Weather Service already tracking the
first tropical depression of the year.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression's center was just south of the
western tip of Cuba, or about 150 miles southwest of Havana. The
depression, drifting toward the northeast, contained winds up to 30
mph and was not expected to strengthen.
   If the system's maximum sustained winds reached 39 mph, it would
be called Tropical Storm Alberto.
   In conjunction with the start of the six-month season, the
weather service released a study estimating that the death toll
from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted.
   Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties
from Maine to Texas, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier
islands is virtually impossible, said Bob Sheets, director of the
National Hurricane Center.
   Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier
thought must be evacuated under certain conditions, Sheets said.
   Sheets said there are not enough shelters to handle the added
load. And there are serious concerns how glass-windowed high-rises
would fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during the
evacuations.
   ``We've not had a strong category three or category four
hurricane of record strike a ... glass city,'' he said. During a
weaker hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flying
everywhere.''
   Hurricanes are rated on a one-to-five scale. Five, the most
severe, has wind speeds exceeding 150 mph.
   The Hurricane Center director refused to make predictions about
the 1988 season, saying no one has convinced forecasters they can
reliably predict the number and severity of the storms.
   A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30,
sees 10 named tropical storms with rain and winds exceeding 39 mph.
Six become hurricanes with drenching rains and winds over 74 mph,
said hurricane specialist Bob Case of the Geo-Stationary
Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite.
   In 1987, there were three hurricanes and four tropical storms in
the Atlantic.

   A West German pilot says bad weather
caused him to fly his small plane over Soviet territory over the
weekend and that his jaunt into Russian airspace was a mistake, not
a political statement.
   Andreas Sommer said he blundered across the border in bad
weather Saturday in a single-engine Cessna 150 and did it again on
Sunday.
   Sommer said he didn't know that Saturday marked the first
anniversary of a flight by Mathias Rust, who stunned the world by
flying a light plane through Soviet air defenses to Red Square.
   Rust now is serving a four-year prison term in Moscow.
   Sommer's flight caused a diplomatic flurry, particularly because
of suspicions the incursion had something to do with the Moscow
summit between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He said he hopes the summit ``brings peace and detente,'' but
his vacation flight had nothing to do with it.
   In Oslo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lasse Seim said the plane
crossed the Soviet border while on a 100-mile flight from Ivalo,
Finland, to Kirkenes on Norway's Barents Sea coast.
   He said it went deeper into Soviet territory when it returned to
Ivalo on Sunday, staying in Soviet airspace for as long as 30
minutes.
   Sommer, a part-time Hamburg bus driver with 23 years as an
amateur pilot, said he passed into Soviet territory both days while
flying in a cloud cover at 1,000 feet.
   He said he said he first learned that he had strayed into Soviet
territory on Sunday when Norwegian air controllers warned him:
``You are on Soviet territory. Return.''
   ``The weather at the time was so bad I was prepared to land any
place, but there were only lakes and forests and I decided to
return to Finland immediately,'' Sommer told a reporter for the
Aftonbladet newspaper.
   Sommer said he saw no Soviet aircraft scrambling to intercept
him and had no contact with Soviet air controllers.
   Matti Autio, of the Finnish Border Patrol, told The Associated
Press that Sommer was questioned after landing on Sunday for
deviating from his flight path, but was not detained.
   The Norwegian national news agency NTB quoted Soviet Embassy
official Valery Nesteruchkin in Oslo as calling the overflight a
``bad joke.''
   Seim said Norway contacted Soviet authorities on Sunday, and
``we have the impression that they followed the plane. They knew
about it.''
   The Aftenposten newspaper speculated that the Soviets may have
refrained from shooting at the plane because of the Moscow summit.
   Seim said the Soviet Border Commission asked for a meeting with
the Norwegians on Monday, when they handed over a formal protest.
   Rust was 19 at the time he made the flight. On Sept. 4, 1987, he
was found guilty by a Moscow court of illegal entry into the Soviet
Union, violating international flight regulations and malicious
hooliganism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp, but
now is being held in a Moscow prison.

   June Buchanan, an education pioneer who
co-founded Alice Lloyd College in the 1920s and was mayor of this
remote Appalachian Mountain valley town, died 21 days short of her
101st birthday.
   Ms. Buchanan died of natural causes Tuesday at Our Lady of the
Way Hospital in Martin, according to college spokesman James
Silliman Jr. She had been hospitalized recently for pneumonia,
Silliman said.
   Ms. Buchanan, who lived on campus and was known as ``Miss June''
by students and faculty, was to be buried this afternoon on a hill
overlooking the college, beside co-founder Alice Lloyd, said school
President Jerry C. Davis.
   ``She was a living legend,'' said Davis. ``You don't replace a
June Buchanan or an Alice Lloyd.''
   Davis said he believed Ms. Buchanan was the last surviving
member of a group of education pioneers who set up some of eastern
Kentucky's first schools after the turn of the century.
   The Syracuse, N.Y., native arrived in Pippa Passes in 1919 to
take on the monumental task of educating a largely illiterate and
isolated mountain population.
   Ms. Lloyd had arrived from Boston in 1916 and began operating
the school out of a one-room shack in 1916. The two women founded a
two-year college program at the Caney Creek Community Center in
1923. Ms. Lloyd died in 1962.
   Ms. Buchanan oversaw the school's transition to a four-year
private college in 1981. Last year, Alice Lloyd College reported an
enrollment of 530.
   Ms. Buchanan often paid college staff members out of her own
pocket when the school's funds ran low, said Silliman.
   She remained active in raising funds for the college until about
a year ago, when health problems limited her activities. At the
time of her death, Ms. Buchanan was a member of the board of
trustees and mayor of Pippa Passes, which has about 400 residents.
   She is featured in a music video and docudrama about the
college's origins called ``Miracle on Caney Creek,'' which is to be
distributed this fall to schools across Kentucky and eventually
around the nation.
   Ms. Buchanan is survived by a sister, Cherry Buchanan Thompson
of Syracuse. Her husband, David H. Hall of Hindman, died 14 years
ago.

<TEXT>
   A military court today sentenced a Lebanese
man to 30 years in prison for participating in a guerrilla attack
that killed three Israeli soldiers on patrol in south Lebanon.
   Anwar Mahmad Mubaba Yassin, 20, was the only survivor of the
10-man guerrilla band that carried out the Sept. 15 surprise attack
in which five Israeli troops were also wounded.
   One of the Israelis who died in the attack was a U.S.-born
soldier, Alex Singer, from Washington D.C., who was killed on his
25th birthday.
   After the sentence was read, Yassin tried to lunge at the
three-judge panel. He struck a military policeman before being
overcome by several other officers and led handcuffed out of court.
   According to the charge sheet, the guerrilla band had intended
to attack an artillery emplacement belonging to Israeli-backed
Lebanese militiamen inside Israel's self-declared ``security zone.''
   Instead, the guerrillas were intercepted by an Israeli patrol
and a gunbattle ensued, the indictment said.
   Military prosecutor Rubin Wolf had asked for a life sentence for
Yassin, who was charged with being a member of the Lebanese
Communist party and a radical faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The three judges said that because the band did not intend to
attack Israeli forces or Israel, they would sentence him to 30
years.

   Heavy thunderstorms roared across parts of Texas and Oklahoma
early today, dumping heavy rainfall across a vast area and
triggering flash flooding in at least 10 Texas counties.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the morning hours from
western Iowa and Nebraska across Kansas, eastern Colorado, Oklahoma
and north-central through south-central Texas. Rain was scattered
from the northern half of the Pacific Coast into eastern Washington
and the Idaho Panhandle.
   Local flood warnings were posted in northern Texas, where heavy
rain caused flooding and closed low-lying streets elsewhere.
Overflowing creeks and streams left Highway 377 near Comanche under
about 14 feet of water.
   Flash flooding was widespread in 10 counties, including the
Dallas-Fort Worth area, and forecasters warned that other parts of
Texas could be in store for flooding later today as the storm
system that triggered the drenching rain moved northeastward.
   As almost 7 inches of rain fell in sections of Texas from late
Tuesday through early today, flash flood watches were posted in the
Hill Country and north-central Texas, as well as in western and
central Oklahoma.
   One person died Tuesday in a weather-related three-vehicle
accident on a rain-slickened street in Amarillo. In Caldwell,
thunderstorms produced hail and winds gusting to more than 50 mph,
downing trees and power lines.
   In Cape Hatteras, N.C., a high of 91 degrees Tuesday set a
record for May 31 and marked the city's first 90-degree day for the
month of May in 115 years of record-keeping. The previous record
high for the month was 88 degrees on May 30, 1881, and May 25, 1962.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across the
upper half and ports of the lower half of the Mississippi Valley,
the eastern half of Texas, Oklahoma, the central Plains and eastern
South Dakota; and showers over New Jersey, Pennsylvania, southern
New York state and southern Florida, as well as the northern
Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s in northern
Maine; the 60s and 70s over the remainder of New England and
northern New York state; the 60s from the northern Rockies across
the northern and central Pacific coast; the 90s in the desert
Southwest and southwest Texas; and the upper 80s and the 90s from
central Florida across the Virginias, and from southern Wisconsin
and southern lower Michigan across the central Gulf Coast and into
the lower Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 79 degrees at Key West, Fla., and
Laredo, Texas.

   Laos has rejected American charges that
officials of that Communist nation may be involved in drug
trafficking.
   Laos' official radio said Harriet Isom, charge d'affaires of the
U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, was presented with a letter that said
the charges affected Laos' ``honor, dignity and prestige.''
   The letter was quoted Tuesday in a broadcast by domestic state
radio, a text of which was obtained from a Western embassy in
Bangkok today.
   On May 11, a State Department spokeswoman said there were
numerous reports that government and military officials of the Lao
People's Democratic Republic were involved in the drug trade.
   The spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said the department had
submitted a report to Congress on March 1 stating that opium
cultivation and heroin production in Laos had increased
considerably in the past two years and the trend was likely to be
irreversible.
   The letter said Laos was ``extremely surprised to learn this as
relations between Laos and the United States have been further
improved another step, that is, the Lao side has done its utmost in
searching for the missing Americans (from the Vietnam war) while
the United States has also provided humanitarian assistance for the
people in the area affected by the natural disasters.''
   The letter said that after the Communist government came to
power in 1975, it had to deal with the consequences of the Vietnam
War, including opium, marijuana and heroin addiction under the
former regime.
   ``The Lao government has been trying to eliminate opium
cultivation, provide medical treatment for drug addicts and reduce
their number and come close to achieving an addiction-free
society,'' it said.
   U.S. narcotics officials estimate that 150-300 metric tons of
opium were produced in Laos in 1987, mostly by hill people for whom
it is an economic mainstay. The United States has no narcotics
control program in Laos, as it does in the other two countries that
also are part of the major drug-producing ``Golden Triangle'' _
Thailand and Burma.

<TEXT>
   The nation's second-largest city survived May
without being destroyed by a disastrous earthquake, contrary to
dire predictions by astrologers and followers of the 16th-century
French seer Nostradamus.
   That nugget of good news is followed by a dire prediction of
another sort, this time from members of the scientific community
who say apocalyptic prophecies are a kind of industry that thrives
in trend-conscious California.
   Astronomer Andy Fraknoi said he expects more somber prophecies
because ``for this rather large and lucrative New Age business to
keep churning out sales, they need something cosmic every year or
so.''
   Fraknoi, executive officer of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific in San Francisco, blamed the attention the Nostradamus
prediction got on the media for failing to emphasize that
scientists said the predictions were bunk.
   The seismic scare was spurred by a purported prediction in vague
poems by the astrologer Nostradamus, who died in 1566. In the 1981
movie, ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' Orson Welles claimed
Nostradamus forecast a quake would destroy the ``new city,''
supposedly Los Angeles, when certain planets were aligned in May
1988.
   Psychic Hamilton Farmer also predicted an 8.5-magnitude quake
would wreak havoc, while other psychics and astrologers offered a
variety of dates for Southern California's demise.
   Much of the doomsaying focused on May 10, although Nancy
Reagan's personal astrologer, Joan Quigley, predicted the quake
would hit May 5.
   The comic strip ``Doonesbury'' satirized the predictions, and
scientists called the forecasts nonsense, saying Nostradamus didn't
predict a quake, the planets weren't aligned and wouldn't trigger a
quake if they were.
   But thousands of truly fearful residents called hot lines at
Griffith Observatory and the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
   Some stocked up on emergency supplies and Nostradamus books and
videotapes, while others left town, including an estimated 1,000 or
more Cambodian refugees who were frightened by a strong real quake
that rocked Los Angeles last October.
   ``We need a campaign for the media to just say no _ no
astrology, no UFOs, no Bigfoot stories, no psychics,'' Fraknoi
said. ``When you get tempted, just call another journalist and
they'll help you just say no.''
   Another figure prominent in the scientific study of the heavens
criticized the prophecy business.
   ``We've gone through the month of May with extraordinary
unfounded predictions of a catastrophic earthquake in Los Angeles,
and to me, this is like yelling fire in a crowded theater. Those
who scared people should be ashamed of themselves,'' said Griffith
Observatory director Edwin Krupp.
   ``There were many different people predicting every date of the
month before we were done,'' Krupp said Tuesday. ``Perhaps to the
disappointment of those who had predicted a quake and counted on
one, the City of Los Angeles is still here.''
   About 30 quakes occur daily in Southern California, most too
small to be felt, Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said.
   The biggest quake all month in the region measured a barely
respectable 4.0 on the Richter scale on May 17, and was centered
east of Borrego Springs, about 125 miles southeast of Los Angeles,
he added. No damage or injuries were reported.
   Melissa Hatfield, an employee at the Phoenix metaphysical
bookstore in Santa Monica, said the scientists ``are pretty
close-minded about prophesying and forseeing the future.''
   So why did Los Angeles survive?
   ``From what I've heard, because I've talked to a guy who's
really looked into Nostradamus, the planets don't line up until
1999. So that's when it (the big quake) is supposed to be,'' Ms.
Hatfield said. ``It should occur May 10, 1999. So everybody was
scared for nothing. I'm moving away in 1999.''
   Krupp scoffed at that, but noted that scientists do expect a
catastrophic earthquake is inevitable. The California Office of
Emergency Services says a major, devastating quake in Southern
California is more than 50 percent likely sometime within the next
25 years.
   ``If there's a good side to this (Nostradmus scare), I'd bet a
lot of people stocked up on bottled water and canned food and did
all the other things to prepare for an earthquake,'' Finn said.

   The long-simmering rivalry between Nancy Reagan
and Raisa Gorbachev flared up anew today, with the American first
lady acknowleging they were in ``Mexican standoff.''
   Although the two women maintained an appearance of cordiality
and near-constant smiles during a brief tour of an icon storage
vault, their last one-on-one get-together of the Moscow summit
erased earlier attempts to paper over the strained impasse that
marks their relationship.
   ``I want to say something. I want to say something now, OK?''
Mrs. Reagan cut in at one point as Mrs. Gorbachev attempted to stop
the press from questioning the American first lady.
   Mrs. Gorbachev backed away, but pointedly looked at her watch as
the U.S. first lady chatted a bit with members of the White House
press corps.
   The incident recalled a similar one during the December summit
in Washington, when Mrs. Gorbachev lectured frequently on U.S.
history, art, and political life, leaving Mrs. Reagan attempting to
get in a few words.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, said after the
event, ``They are from two totally different worlds.''
   Noting that Mrs. Reagan has spoken out more in Moscow than she
did at the Washington summit, Mrs. Crispen said she believed the
two women now had ``more balance'' and equality in their
relationship.
   Instead of meeting Mrs. Reagan as planned by the door of the
vault, Mrs. Gorbachev had entered first and informed the waiting
press corp that they could have ``a dialogue'' about the art. ``The
guests are late,'' she noted.
   After Mrs. Reagan arrived and the two women shook hands, Mrs.
Gorbachev presented the first lady with a bouquet of roses and a
large coffee-table style book of pictures from the gallery.
   She also presented reporters with a copy of the same book,
proposing that they give it to ``whomever has covered the summit
best.''
   Mrs. Reagan raised her eyebrows in a look of mild consternation.
She then stepped forward, and insisted that she be given equal time
with the journalists.
   She thanked Mrs. Gorbachev and the gallery staff for making
arrangements to allow her to see the now-closed museum works, and
said she was aware that very few people were granted a chance to
view them.
   When reporters tried to question the two women, Mrs. Gorbachev
responded, ``We have decided there would not be any interviews.
Please allow us to show Mrs. Reagan the remaining art.''
   She retreated to the background, however, when journalists
continued pressing for time with Mrs. Reagan.
   Told that Mrs. Gorbachev had spoken at length about the icon
collection, but had not mentioned it's religious heritage, Mrs.
Reagan responded, ``I don't know how you can neglect the religious
implications. I mean they are there, when you see them.''
   The first lady said she was pleased with her visit, and that she
hoped to return so that she might be able to view the artistic and
architectural treasures of the nation once again.
   Asked if she'd become a convert to communism during her trip,
the first lady laughed heartily, saying, ``Oh, no.'' And she said
Soviets weren't ready either to convert to capitalism.
   Mrs. Reagan indicated that the five-day trip, her first to the
Soviet Union, had not changed her views. ``We have two different
ways of living, two different philosphies,'' she said.
   Asked about her relationship with Mrs. Gorbachev, the first lady
laughed at the maneuvering that had just occurred, shrugged, and
declared, ``a Mexican standoff.''
   Mrs. Reagan had requested a viewing of the famed icons of the
Tretyakov Gallery. Since the museum has been closed for renovation,
the first lady was allowed to view a collection of the art in a
high-tech, temperature controlled storage vault.
   Even though the two women had tried to paper over the reports of
a feud, Mrs. Reagan left the impression during a day trip Tuesday
to Leningrad that she'd just as soon let the subject drop.
   In a meeting with reporters aboard her plane, Mrs. Reagan said
the Soviet people ``are very warm and very open'' but that she was
less impressed with her high-level contacts. ``Their philosophies
and positions are completely different from ours,'' she said.
   But given the repeated hand-holding between the first ladies
during a tour of Kremlin churches on Sunday and at later official
functions, Mrs. Reagan was asked who started it all.
   ``I don't know. It just sort of happened,'' the first lady said
with a shrug of her shoulders.
   Although Mrs. Gorbachev declined to accompany Mrs. Reagan to
Leningrad, the Soviet first lady arranged for Lidiya Gromyko, the
wife of Soviet President Andrei Gromyko, to go instead.
   The first lady said she found Mrs. Gromyko ``very nice, very
friendly, very warm.''
   But asked if she had the same reaction to Mrs. Gorbachev, Mrs.
Reagan smiled, and sat silent for a full 12 seconds pondering her
answer.
   ``Well, she's a .... everybody's different,'' she finally said,
evoking a hail of laughter from the reporters.
   When someone asked if Mrs. Gromyko lectured as much as Mrs.
Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan joined in the uproarious laughter.
   ``Just between us?'' Mrs. Reagan asked one reporter, quipping,
``How many viewers and readers do you have?''
   Another long pause, ending with the plea, ``I'm desperately
trying to think!''

   An acid spill at a factory released toxic
fumes into the air, forcing the evacuation of up to 2,000 residents
and sending 70 people to the hospital for treatment, authorities
said today.
   The leak occurred around 6:15 p.m. Tuesday at a
National-Standard wire and cable plant, and police evacuated people
living within three miles of the plant, said police dispatcher
Russell York.
   The area was declared safe about 9:15 p.m., and residents were
allowed to return, said Mayor Larry Clymer. Between 1,000 and 2,000
people live in the affected area in the southwestern Michigan city
of 15,000, according to York.
   Seventy people were treated for exposure to the fumes at
Pewating Hospital but none was admitted overnight, said nursing
supervisor Mary Ann Weaver.
   Many were players and spectators at softball fields near the
plant, Weaver said. Two of those treated were police officers, York
said.
   At least 130 people were sheltered temporarily at Ballard
Elementary School, school Superintendent John Huffman said.
   The accident apparently occurred after hydrochloric acid and
another acid were mixed in a storage tank, causing the tank to
rupture and the acids to form a puddle on the plant floor, said
Dennis Sexton, a dispatcher for the Berrien County Sheriff's
Department.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in Europe early today after a Japanese financial
official said the currency's recent rise could be short-lived.
   Gold bullion, underpinned by speculative buying of platinum,
leveled off in Europe at the higher price of $457.
   After rising in New York late Tuesday on the back of firmer U.S.
interest rates, the dollar opened steady in Europe today, then
dropped after Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told reporters
he thought a sustained rise in the dollar was unlikely.
   Traders said the remark heightened speculation that central
banks of the world's seven major industrialized nations would
intervene in the market to brake the dollar.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7225 West German marks, down from 1.7292
   _1.4355 Swiss francs, down from 1.4437
   _5.8055 French francs, down from 5.8215
   _1.9328 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9333
   _1,280.50 Italian lire, up from 1,279.95
   _1.2330 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2357.
   The dollar advanced on the British pound, which dropped to
$1.8320 from $1.8385.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 125.23 Japanese yen, up from
124.80 yen on Tuesday. In later London trading today, the dollar
slipped to 125.15 yen.
   Gold bullion settled at higher levels in Europe after rising in
tandem with platinum. Heavy speculative buying by Japanese
investors pushed platinum to a high of $670 an ounce in Tokyo
overnight, before easing to $620 in London.
   At midmorning, London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended
gold price of $457 a troy ounce, down from an opening bid of
$458.30 but up from Tuesday's late rate of $454.80.
   Gold also was bid at $457 in Zurich, up from $455.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $458.55, up
from $455.80.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.75 a troy ounce,
up from $6.65.

<HEAD>Pregnant Women Given Dilantin Without Consent During Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 240 pregnant women were given a drug linked
to birth defects without their knowledge as part of a study, and
officals are considering disciplining the researchers.
   Dilantin, a drug commonly used to treat epilepsy, was given by
two Cook County Hospital anesthesiologists to about 245 pregnant
women to determine whether it could reduce fetal stress in
Caesarean births, hospital spokesman Terrence Hansen said Tuesday.
   Five of the women had consented to participate in the
hospital-approved study from September 1987 through January, said
Dr. Robert Miller, chairman of the hospital's scientific committee.
   The other women were given the drug without their knowledge and
without approval from the hospital's review board, said Miller,
who, unlike Hansen, said he understood that only some of these
approximately 240 women were pregnant.
   Miller said Dilantin has been linked to birth defects when
administered early in pregnancy. But he said the women received the
drug 15 minutes before delivering their babies.
   The president of the Cook County Board, which oversees the
hospital, said he would hold a meeting Monday to discuss punishment
for the doctors, who have not been identified.
   ``I was appalled to think that men in the medical profession
would do that,'' board President George Dunne said Tuesday. ``They,
of all people, should know that you don't experiment on patients
without obtaining their written consent.''
   The Illinois Department of Public Health, which regulates the
licensing of hospitals, is aware of the doctors' action but is
barred by state law from revealing whether it is investigating,
said spokeswoman Penny Strong.
   Spokesman Terry Levin of the Cook County state's attorney's
office declined to comment on whether his office was investigating
to see if criminal laws were violated.
   The women all received a single, smaller-than-normal dose of the
drug, Hansen said. Two of the babies died because of unrelated
complications, Hansen said.
   Several studies have reported higher incidences of birth
defects, including heart abnormalities and retardation, among
babies born to women who use Dilantin and other anti-epileptic
drugs.
   Miller said he did not agree with the doctors' actions but did
not consider them unethical.
   But a medical ethicist called the practice a ``serious abuse''
of the medical profession.
   ``It seems to me that it simply goes against the principles of
biomedical ethics ... (which) really require that any person
enrolled in a research project be informed of that and be given a
chance to consent or refuse,'' said James Childress, a religion and
medical education professor at the University of Virginia.
   ``What it amounts to (is) ... basically using human beings as
means to other ends ... not treating them as ends in themselves,''
he said. ``Even though the risk was limited, it was still a serious
abuse.''
   Hansen said the failure to gain the women's consent was a
violation of hospital policy.
   The hospital's executive medical staff recommended May 18 that
the doctors be given probation, a warning that would pave the way
for stricter measures if they further violate hospital policy,
Hansen said.
   ``An ultimate decision (on what action is taken against the
doctors) would rest with the board of trustees,'' which is to meet
Monday, Hansen said.
   Hansen said none of the women has sued the hospital.

   A passenger train slammed today into
the back of a gravel-laden freight train on a main line in
southwestern Netherlands, killing two people and injuring 20, a
Dutch railway spokesman said.
   The cause of the collision, the country's worst in nearly six
years, was not immediately known, said spokesman Hans Meijer.
   One of the dead was believed to be the passenger train's
engineer, Meijer said. The other had not been identified.
   Two of the injured passengers were in serious condition, said
Meijer.
   The accident occurred at about 10:40 a.m. when a four-car
passenger train slammed into the stationary freight train, Meijer
said in a telephone interview from the railway's head office in
this central Dutch city.
   The passenger train, whose speed could not immediately be
established, was on its way from Roosendaal, a major junction 60
miles south of Amsterdam, to Vlissingen in the province of Zeeland,
Meijer said.
   Visibility was good at the site of the accident between the
stations of Rilland-Bath and Krabbendijke, where the double-track
Roosendaal-Vlissingen main line runs in a slight bend, he said.
   ``We haven't been able to establish why the gravel train was
standing still at that particular point, and why the engineer of
the passenger train didn't see it, or whether the signals failed,''
Meijer said.
   The Roosendaal-Vlissingen line is equipped with automatic
signals.
   Both tracks were blocked by the wreckage of both trains, Meijer
said, adding that the damage to the line and the overhead power
lines was considerable.
   Fatal train collisions are rare on the technically advanced
Dutch railway network, which is one of the busiest in the world.
   The last serious train accident occurred in December 1982, when
three passengers were killed in a collision near the port city of
Rotterdam.

   A boy born to a Latvian couple has been named
Ronald in honor of President Reagan, the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported today.
   The parents, rail worker Romuald Saltsevich and his wife,
Biruta, said they believe the Moscow summit between Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will bring a peaceful future for
all children, according to Tass.
   The baby, the couple's fifth, weighed 11 pounds at birth, the
news agency said. It did not say when the baby was born or where in
Latvia the couple lives.
   During the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Washington, Tass reported
that twin boys born to a Moscow couple Dec. 8 were named Ronald and
Mikhail in honor of the arms treaty signed by both leaders.

<HEAD>Number of Soviet Jewish Dropouts Reaches Record High</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs to UPDATE with figures from Geneva group.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Soviet Jewish emigrants who
decided against coming to Israel reached a record high in May, when
more than 90 percent chose to settle elsewhere, a Soviet Jewish
activist told the Israeli newsagency Itim.
   Chaim Chessler, head of the Public Council for Soviet Jewry, was
quoted as saying Tuesday that soon no Soviet Jewish emigrants will
come to Israel unless they are flown via Bucharest, Romania,
instead of Vienna, Austria, where they are free to immigrate to
other Western countries.
   Israeli officials are embarrassed by the high dropout figure
because of their 20-year-long battle for the right of Soviet Jews
to emigrate on the grounds that Israel is their homeland.
   Israeli leaders claim 400,000 Soviet Jews want to settle in
Israel. But less than 20 percent of those who leave the Soviet
Union actually settle here.
   Chessler said that of the 1,169 Jews who left the Soviet Union
in May, just 110 came to Israel, a drop of nearly 7 percent from
April.
   Of the 4,695 Soviet Jews who have emigrated so far this year, 18
percent have settled in Israel, he added.
   Meanwhile, in Geneva, the Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration announced that Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union
through Vienna, Austria, reached a new seven-year high in May, when
1,145 Jews arrived at that city's transit center.
   May marked the fourth straight month of rising Jewish emigration
through Vienna, bringing the total for 1988 to 4,547 Soviet Jews
arriving there, the committee said.
   The figure was the highest since April 1981, when 1,155 Jews
left the Soviet Union through the Austrian capital.
   More than 250,000 Jews have found new homes since the committee
began its resettlement program in 1971.
   The committee did not include figures for the number of Soviet
Jews coming through Bucharest. Shmuel Binsky of the Public Council
on Soviet Jewry in Jerusalem said 24 Jews emigrated through
Bucharest in May.

   Here at a glance are some of the key points raised
by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during his news conference
Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS AND ARMS CONTROL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev noted that developments have become possible ``due to
realism'' but that it is ``not an easy process at all.''
   The 24-page document agreed at this meeting lays ``bricks so to
say for the building of our future relationship. It is a sign for
movement into the 21st century.''
   The exchange of ratification documents on the intermediate-range
weapons treaty ``turned the Moscow meeting into a watershed
political event in the Soviet-American dialogue and in world
politics as a whole.''
   Yet he said it is not easy to make progress on strategic arms,
calling negotiations on this issue ``the most complex task we
confronted in post-war politics.'' ``Step by step, we are moving
towards a treaty.''
   But he strongly criticized the contrary attitude that he said
had led to last-minute difficulties on agreeing the text of the
joint statement. ``I believe that we have missed a chance to take
an important step forward toward civilized relations,'' he said.
   He added however, that ``even though not everything has been
achieved as we would have wanted it, we will not make any dramatic
conclusions.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev said ``there has been some progress in this sense,''
using wording that suggested resolution of some individual cases.
But he strongly criticized what he called ``propaganda gambits''
and ``all sorts of spectacles, all sorts of shows'' in apparent
allusion to Reagan's meeting Monday with dissidents and refuseniks.
   ``I'm not filled with admiration for this part of the visit,''
Gorbachev added.
   He noted that Reagan had had a chance to get to know Soviet
people and emphasized that the president, asked on Tuesday whether
he still stuck to his March 1983 view of the Svoiet Union as an
``evil empire,'' had said he did not.
   ``He said no and he said this within the walls of the Kremlin,
right in the heart of the evil empire,'' Gorbachev said. ``We take
note of this.''
   Reagan's ``evil empire'' comment sparked a torrent of vicious
comment when it was made, leading to an escalation in Soviet
attacks that culminated in comparision between Reagan and Adolf
Hitler in the deep freeze that followed the shooting down of the
Korean Air liner in September 1983 and the breaking off of arms
talks in Geneva in November that year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REGIONAL CONFLICTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On the Middle East, Gorbachev said for the first time that as
soon as an international conference on the region is convened, ``we
are prepared to address ourselves to regularizing relations with
Israel,'' severed in 1967.
   In general, Gorbachev said ``real possibilities have appeared
for solving regional problems,'' but gave no specifics.
   He cited the Afghanistan agreement as an example of what could
be achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring parties
to solve the conflicts, but noted that if Soviet forces now come
under attack from rebels as they withdraw, ``we shall react
accordingly and appropriately. That should be absolutely clear.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JACKSON-VANIK AMENDMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After talking about what he called the contrary attitude of the
United States on some issues, Gorbachev singled out economic
relations.
   ``Authoritative parts of American business circles would like to
do business. They are faced with intimidation and all sorts of
restrictions,'' Gorbachev said.
   Alluding to the Jackson-Vanik amendment, he said, ``There is
indeed a most unfavored nation status with regard to the treatment
of the Soviet Union.''
   ``Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living? One
is physically dead, the other is politically dead. The amendment
was passed in totally different circumstances a decade ago. We
should base our policies on present-day realities.''
   The amendment, passed by Congress in 1974, requires that any
communist nation give assurance of free emigration to be entitled
to most-favored-nation trade status.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, at an impasse this week on strategic arms negotiations,
celebrated a past summit success today by exchanging final
ratification documents on last December's pact on
intermediate-range weapons.
   But they deadlocked on the explosive issue of space-based
defenses and failed to take steps to cut concentrations of Eastern
and Western troops in Europe.
   ``We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,''
Gorbachev told reporters.
   While accusing Reagan of ``incomprehensible maneuvers'' on
conventional forces, Gorbachev also registered a lack of progress
in settling a long-standing dispute over the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   He said he had proposed an exchange of data and cross-visits to
facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is tested.
But he said the problem remained in the path of a new treaty and a
fifth summit meeting at which it would be signed.
   At a glittering ceremony in the Kremlin's St. Vladimir's Hall,
though, Reagan and Gorbachev signed documents to put their 1987
treaty to ban intermediate-range missiles in force.
   Reagan called the accord a ``first step toward a brighter
future, a safer world,'' while Gorbachev declared ``the era of
nuclear disarmament has begun.''
   The Soviet leader said he and Reagan had agreed at their fourth
summit meeting that ``the immediate task before us'' was to
complete the START treaty to sharply reduce strategic nuclear
weapons. ``It can and must be accomplished,'' he said.
   Future American and Soviet leaders cannot reverse course, the
57-year-old Gorbachev said. ``I don't think anyone can close that
book and put it aside.''
   Reagan agreed. ``We must not stop here,'' he said. ``There is
much more to be done.''
   He said a joint statement to be issued later in the day would
reflect ``more progress has been made toward a strategic arms
treaty in our meetings.''
   As the two leaders put the unprecedented ban on medium-range
missiles and monitoring program into effect, they set the set the
stage for American and Soviet monitors to take up stations in each
other's lands to guard against cheating.
   Two Senate leaders, Democrat Robert Byrd and Republican Bob
Dole, told reporters the so-called INF agreement was a crowning
achievement for Reagan. But both said he should move cautiously on
the more extensive strategic arms pact.
   ``Let's not have a framework adopted that lock us in,'' said
Dole, R-Kan.
   Reagan and Gorbachev are expected to issue a joint communique
before Reagan's departure Thursday that, among other things, would
note progress that has been made in the U.S.-Soviet relationship
since Gorbachev took the Kremlin helm in 1985 and Reagan ceased
calling Moscow the ``evil empire.''
   And despite the failure to reach a breakthrough in arms control,
the two sides made some headway on a stubborn issue: how to keep
track of each other's elusive mobile missiles in the event of a new
accord.
   ``We think we have most of the elements,'' Secretary of Defense
Frank C. Carlucci said in a CBS-TV interview. ``We're presenting it
to the Soviets. Some of the elements they've accepted.''
   Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser, told
CNN that ``there's been quite a lot of convergence in U.S. and
Soviet thinking on the verification of mobile missiles. So we`ve
made progress.''
   But, Powell said, ``not enough to say that the treaty is at
hand.''
   Anf Carlucci said unless the Soviets stop trying to block the
U.S. Star Wars program, ``obviously we can't get an agreement.''
   The treaty the leaders are exchanging is the first in history to
abolish an entire category of nuclear weapons. It was ratified last
Friday by the Senate and 17 hours later by the Soviet Presidium. It
bans all missiles in the range of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   Byrd, who arrived here Tuesday with Dole to mark the Senate's
ratification of the INF accord, said Reagan's ``discipline and
strength'' prodded the Soviets to negotiate the accord. ``I don't
believe anyone else could have done that,'' he said.
   Dole called the treaty ``probably the highlight of his second
term. It is a small step, but it is a step towards arms reduction.''
   Gorbachev and Reagan had hoped to complete a vastly more
important treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet armories of long-range
bombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50
percent, but disputes over verifying the pact and the Reagan's Star
Wars program spoiled the plan.
   Instead, they separated out a single provision for advance
notification of missile launch tests. It was signed Tuesday. They
instructed their senior negotiators to make as much progress as
they could on the obstacles to a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START) and left open the possibility of a fifth summit meeting to
sign it before Reagan leaves office in January.
   Progress on the proposed START treaty came on a U.S. proposal
for verifying limits on mobile missiles and a compromise on
counting air-launched cruise missiles, said a senior U.S. official,
who spoke on condition he not be further identified.
   But no progress was reported on Star Wars, the main impediment
to a START agreement to cut to cut long-range weapons.
   At the December summit, both leaders said they hoped to sign a
strategic arms pact in Moscow, but talks stalled over Star Wars,
mobile missiles, rules on counting cruise missiles aboard
warplanes, curbs on cruise missiles on submarines, and a U.S. call
to phase out heavy Soviet SS-18 missiles.
   Gorbachev expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks,
although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed by
the end of the Reagan presidency.
   Reagan said he would not bargain away Star Wars, formally known
as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' said Reagan.
   Because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles, the United
States had wanted to ban them, although it is developing one, the
Midgetman. The Soviets declined to get rid of their two mobile
missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25.
   During the summit, American negotiators offered a proposal they
had been working on for months, to restrict mobile missiles to
carefully defined geographical areas, dubbed ``garrisons,'' which
would be monitored by on-site inspection as well as surveillance
from spy satellites.
   ``The Soviets reacted positively to our proposal,'' said a U.S.
official, speaking not for attribution.

   A deli owner testified he was promised
part ownership of actor Paul Newman's food company in exchange for
promoting the products.
   Julius Gold claimed Tuesday that he was to receive a 1@12th
interest in Newman's Salad King Inc. and any spinoff corporations
for helping develop and sell Newman's Own salad dressing, spaghetti
sauce, lemonade and popcorn.
   Newman took copious notes on the opening day of testimony in the
Westport deli owner's suit. The actor sat beside author, longtime
friend and business partner A.E. Hotchner.
   Gold testified about taste tests and bottling discussions. At a
meeting in 1982, he said, the possibility of payment for his
efforts was discussed.
   The jury must decide whether Newman and the other defendants,
Hotchner and food distributor David Kalman, owe Gold a share in the
business.
   Newman's attorneys deny Gold's claims.
   It was not immediately known if Newman would take the stand.
   Since 1982, Newman's Own has donated all of its more than $15
million in profit to charity and helped create a camp for seriously
ill children.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa's Court of Appeals has reluctantly
allowed prosecutors to use handwriting analysis in selecting jurors
but warned of a possible ``chilling effect.''
   ``Citizens may shy away from jury service if they know part of
serving is to have a determination made from their handwriting that
they are such things as `sexually frustrated' or `not a hugger,'''
the court said Tuesday.
   Despite its worries, the court refused to order a new trial in a
burglary case in which handwriting analysis was used in picking
jurors. The defendant, Merle LeRoy Knerr, had claimed that
prosecutors had gained an unfair advantage.
   In refusing to order a new trial, the court said it is ``a
recognized practice for an attorney to make investigations of
prospective jurors.''
   To warrant a new trial, it must be shown that prosecutors took
part in ``systematic and intentional exclusion of an identifiable
eligible group,'' the court said.
   At the same time, the court said of handwriting analysis,
``After reviewing the information presented by the expert we find
it to be of very minimal benefit to the jury selection process.''
   The appellate court also noted that it's already tough to get
citizens to accept jury duty.
   ``We have concern that the knowledge such procedures are used to
uncover information on jurors could have a chilling effect on
citizens' response to the call for jury service,'' the court said.
   ``Additionally, because of the number of persons employed in the
county attorney's office there is the possibility of inadvertent
disclosure.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says 11 Palestinians Have Died From Tear Gas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with U.N. report on tear gas deaths. Changes
byline.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. spokesman said today tear gas fired by
Israeli soldiers has killed 11 Palestinians, including a
seven-day-old infant, and has caused dozens of miscarriages since
an Arab uprising began six months ago.
   A spokesman for the army said the report was being checked.
   New figures released by Israeli officials, meanwhile, indicate
the casualty toll in the uprising in the Israeli-occupies
territories is higher than previously believed.
   The army said Tuesday that 207 Palestinians had been killed,
including 157 by gunfire from Israeli soldiers. The United Nations
says 199 Arabs have been killed, 11 of them from tear gas.
   A left-wing legislator quoted a confidential document as saying
5,133 Arabs have been injured since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
called the tear gas report ``a matter of concern to us.''
   ``We have repeatedly urged the government of Israel to use
non-lethal means to control violent demonstrations,'' she said.
   Bill Lee, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, said
most of the tear gas casualties were a result of the crowd control
gas being fired into closed rooms such as shelters, clinics and
homes, by troops dispersing demonstrators.
   He said 1,285 Palestinians from refugee camps in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip were treated in hospitals for breathing problems
caused by the tear gas.
   ``The gas is not normally lethal when used according to
prescribed directions, but it can be when fired into enclosed
spaces,'' Lee said.
   The 11 fatalities were reported through the end of April by
doctors who work in clinics in U.N. administered refugee camps, Lee
said. He said most of those killed were either infants, one as
young as seven days, or people over 65.
   Also among the victims was a 35-year-old woman in Gaza who died
along with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely as a
result of inhaling tear gas, Lee said.
   Palestinian hospital officials have repeatedly claimed that
Israeli soldiers were using a new, more toxic gas on demonstrators.
Israeli army officials denied it.
   Lee said the gas used by Israel apparently causes muscle spasms
which can trigger early labor or miscarriage, and that dozens of
such cases have been reported in the occupied territories.
   Dr. John Hiddlestone, director of health affairs for the U.N.
agency that aids Palestinians, said in Vienna on April 14 after
visiting the occupied territories that the Israelis were using a
gas against Palestinians that causes abdominal pain, miscarriage
and muscular weakness.
   ``I am a physician and people are having symptoms other than
normal tear gas symptoms,'' he said.
   Oakley, the U.S. spokeswoman, said the gas sold to Israel is
commonly used by U.S. police and the military. She said U.S. firms
had obtained government export licenses to sell the gas.
   The army's death toll of 207 Palestinians was not explained and
brought the toll beyond the 199 counted by the United Nations. The
army said it was still investigating how 50 of the 207 died.
   U.N. statistics indicate 167 Palestinians have been fatally shot
by Israeli troops during the uprising and that 11 were killed by
Jewish settlers. Lee said the rest died from tear gas, beatings and
other means.
   The left-wing member of Parliament, Dedi Zucker, quoted a top
defense official as saying military ``harassment and maltreatment''
of Palestinians was the chief reason that unrest continues in the
occupied lands.
   Zucker of the liberal Citizens Rights Movement said the
official, whom he refused to identify, spoke during a meeting with
several legislators.
   Zucker also quoted a confidential government document as saying
5,133 Palestinians have been injured in the uprising.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a closed-door meeting of
legislators that the ``Intifadeh (uprising) has only cooled off on
the surface while underneath the goals are glowing as hot as
before,'' the Jerusalem Post daily reported today.
   Rabin who held two meetings in the past week with pro-Jordanian
moderate Palestinians, said Tuesday he would continue such talks
``even with people who hold extreme views.''
   He told Israel radio he decided to arrange the talks because he
was convinced the Palestinians now realized that ``with stones and
firebombs they can achieve nothing.''

<HEAD>American Named Best Sommelier Of French Wines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Lawrence Stone said today he won the
second international competition for best sommelier in French wine
and spirits by using his creativity to defeat a Frenchman.
   ``The judgment was very close, but I clearly won,'' he said of
the two-day competition, which ended Monday night. ``Over the two
days there were many opportunities to make mistakes and I made
less.''
   Frenchman Philippe Faure-Brac placed second and Japan's Mitsuo
Kogai of the Prince Hotels in Tokyo placed third.
   The competition, decided by a panel of international judges, was
organized by the International Association of Masters in French
Gastronomy and the Union of French Wine Stewards.
   It included tests of technical knowledge of French wines and
vineyards, blind taste tests and harmony between wines and dishes.
   Stone, 36, has been sommelier since 1984 at the Four Seasons
Olympic Hotel in Seattle. He was named best sommelier in French
wine and spirits in the United States in 1986 and three times has
received the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence.
   Stone said being creative helped him win.
   ``In the marriage of food and wine (category), you have to be
especially imaginative and relaxed and deal with the panel like you
were dealing with customers ... find new ideas, new combinations of
food and wine,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``The judges don't want to be bored. They want to be surprised.''
   Asked about winning over a Frenchman, he said, ``I think the
French are finding that surprising and maybe disappointing.''
   Stone said he had no one favorite wine.
   ``It's like saying one prefers just one kind of music. You can't
restrict yourself.'' California wines ``are in the top caliber,''
he said, adding that Washington state ``has some great Cabernets.''
   But choosing one wine, ``would be like a father who has a
favorite child.''

   President Reagan said today he has found a new
breed of leadership in the Soviet Union that has eased differences
between the superpowers but his policy remains: ``trust but
verify.''
   His fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev over,
Reagan told a windup news conference in Spasso House, home of
American ambassadors in Moscow, ``I am never going to relax my
belief in the need for verification.''
   Reagan acknowledged that his view of the Soviets has changed,
but he said that was due to changes within the Kremlin leadership
and not his own personal beliefs.
   The president was reminded that at his first news conference in
the White House in 1981 he said that Communist leaders are willing
to lie and cheat in pursuit of world domination.
   Asked if that was still his view, he said in 1981 he had merely
been quoting what Communist leaders themselves had said. Using the
Russian words, he said with a smile, that his policy remains trust
the Soviets, but insist on verification.
   Reagan repeatedly spoke of the ``satisfactory relationship''
that had developed between himself and Gorbachev, who, he said, ``I
have found different than previous Soviet leaders.''
   ``A large part of it is Mr. Gorbachev as a leader ... I read
Perestroika and I found much in it that I agreed with,'' Reagan
said.

   Sinhalese extremists bombed a
government building, torched trains and forced shops to close in
southern and central Sri Lanka today to disrupt provincial
elections, authorities said.
   The government ordered police to shoot anyone causing a
disturbance.
   At least five people were injured when a bomb exploded in a
government building at Nuwara Eliya town, 64 miles east of Colombo,
according to officials in the capital who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   There were no other reports of casualties. However, offficials
said the explosions and fires damaged three trains bound for
Colombo, halting or delaying some rail service.
   Reports reaching the capital said government buildings and buses
were set ablaze in several towns in southern and central Sri Lanka.
In some places, extremists disrupted water, electricity and
communication lines, the officials said.
   State-run radio made special announcements that police and
security forces had been ordered to shoot anyone causing
disturbances.
   In Colombo, several shopkeepers closed their stores after
posters were shoved under their doors warning that they would be
attacked by Sinhalese Liberation Front members if they conducted
business.
   Police said posters also had appeared in southern Sri Lanka
stating that the front had ordered residents to stay at home
beginning this afternoon. Police and other authorities said the
front was trying to disrupt Thursday's voting.
   The front has opposed the elections, which are part of a peace
plan aimed at ending the nearly five-year Tamil separatist
insurgency on the island.
   A general manager for the railway department, G.P.S.
Weerasooriya, said fires broke out on two trains approaching
Colombo. He said the fires disrupted rail service to outlying areas.
   S. Ayupala, a police official in Panadura town, said front
members exploded a bomb on another train and removed railway ties
and spikes from the tracks.
   Residents in three of Sri Lanka's nine provinces went to the
polls April 28 to chose district councils in voting won by the
governing United National Party. The western and central provinces
vote Thursday for members of local government councils and the
southern province votes June 9. Dates for polls in the
Tamil-dominated northern and eastern provinces have not been
announced.
   The Sinhalese front says the Indian-brokered peace accord signed
in July gives too many concessions to the Tamils, who form 18
percent of the country's 16 million people.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population. The Sinhalese
front has threatened to kill anyone who supports the peace plan.
   Tamil rebels launched their separatist struggle in 1983,
claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese.
   The peace plan calls for the formation of district councils to
give additional powers to the provinces, and in effect gives the
Tamils more control. The Tamil rebels renounced the pact last year,
saying it did not go far enough.

<TEXT>
   The son and widow of a pilot who made an
early flight across the Pacific joined 200 aviation buffs in
marking the journey's 60th anniversary.
   The dinner Tuesday was in honor of the 1928 flight by Sir
Charles Kingsford-Smith and a three-man crew. The four made the
10-day trip from Oakland to Brisbane, Australia, in a Fokker
Trimotor dubbed the Southern Cross.
   Kingsford-Smith ``made a significant contribution to the
progress of aviation,'' said Australian consul David Rutter,
chairman of the event at the Oakland Hilton Hotel.
   Dignitaries marking the anniversary in Australia took part in
the celebration via ham radio.
   Kingsford-Smith disappeared over the Bay of Bengal on a later
flight from Britain to Australia. His son, Charles Kingsford-Smith
Jr., was 2 at the time.
   Ten years ago, the younger Kingsford-Smith retraced his father's
flight.
   ``I never got to know my father as a man, so I wanted to get
some insight into what it was like for him,'' he said. ``I felt
like I grasped what the flight was like for my father and his crew,
but I think I'll leave the 100th anniversary flight to my kids.''
   ``I can't believe it's been 60 years,'' said the former Lady
Mary Kingsford-Smith, now Mrs. Frank Noldin. ``I think it's
fabulous that this much interest has been shown in the flight.''

<HEAD>Report: $3 Billion Treasure About Sunken Portuguese Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sunken 16th century Portuguese
ship discovered off in waters between Malaysia and Indonesia
carries about $3 billion in gold and precious stones, a newspaper
reported today.
   The haul is ``believed to be one of the biggest lost treasures
of the world,'' the chief minister of Malacca state, Abdul Rahim
Thamby Chik, was quoted as saying.
   The official, quoted by the daily New Straits Times, reported
the treasure was on board the remains of Flor De La Mar, once the
flagship of the Portuguese navy in the area. It struck a reef and
sank in the Straits of Malacca in January 1512, a few months after
an 800-ship Portuguese armada captured the Malacca Sultanate.
   The ship, with a cargo he estimated at $3 billion, also carried
Malay weavers and women, he said.
   Rahim said he had held talks with a salvage group this week, but
would not identify the company or disclose further details about
its location, the newspaper said.
   The National News Agency Bernama, The Star and other dailies
also reported that Rahim said the ship has been found and that
Malaysian officials and those of an unidentified foreign country
have been contacted in connection with salvaging the treasure.
   Other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
foreign government is believed to be Indonesia and the treasure is
lying off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra in the
Straits of Malacca.
   The state minister was quoted Tuesday in Malacca, about 90 miles
south Kuala Lumpur. A spokesman at his home said ``he had gone
out'' today and could not be contacted.
   The Portuguese remained in the Malacca region of Malaysia for
100 years until the Dutch conquered it in 1641. The British landed
in Malaysia in 1786 and then took control of the region.
   Malaysia and Malacca got independence from the British in 1957.
   Malacca is a state of Malaysia. The island of Sumatra is about
40 miles across the Straits of Malacca from the state.
   Rahim said the salvage group has agreed to finance the salvaging
of the treasure. But he said international laws stipulate that
treasures found at the bottom of the sea should be divided among
the country of origin of the treasure, the country where the
treasure was found and the finder of the treasure.
   The Malaysian government will not pay any cost for the salvage
other than providing protection for the team, he said.

   A high school boy and girl performed a
sex act in a classroom in front of at least a dozen students,
authorities said.
   The students, both 16 and ninth-graders at Chattanooga High
School, were charged Tuesday with agreeing to perform a sex act for
money, police said.
   The boy, who also was charged with indecent exposure, had
offered the girl $20, said Charles Traughber, Hamilton County
Juvenile Court intake supervisor. The teacher was out of the room
when the incident occurred, officials said.
   Hearings will be held to determine whether disciplinary action
against the students should be recommended to the school board,
including possible expulsion next year, said Clifford Hendrix,
interim schools superintendent.
   ``The thing that bothered me about this whole incident was not
only just the alleged act itself between the two students but also
the reports that the other students sat there and observed it and
did nothing and didn't report it,'' Hendrix said.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Communist Party Ends Conference With Upbeat Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party ended a
three-day conference by issuing an upbeat statement on the nation's
economic crisis that failed to criticize party leaders, as
delegates had demanded.
   ``The party is capable of seeking and finding a way out of the
political and economic crisis,'' said a 38-page document issued
Tuesday at the end of the conference, according to the official
Tanjug news agency.
   The statement also directed ``competent institutions and organs
to complete the reform of the economic system, based on strong
orientation toward market economy, by the end of the year,'' the
news agency said.
   At least four delegates, among 40 who objected to the final
text, said it failed to single out party leaders responsible for
the economic crisis.
   ``We have discussed one thing for three days and put down a
different thing in this document,'' one delegate, Predrag
Zivanovic, said.
   Many of the 800 delegates at the conference had accused the
party leadership of bungling and demanded their resignation. Some
delegates said the failure to solve economic problems was
destroying public trust in the party.
   Yugoslavia launched on Saturday its latest economic austerity
program designed to cope with a foreign debt of $21 billion,
Europe's highest annual inflation at 170 percent and an
unemployment rate of 15 percent.
   Economic problems have caused increasing social and labor
unrest. Last year there were more than 1,500 strikes involving more
than 300,000 workers who protested low and declining standards of
living.
   ``Young people are reluctant to join the Communist Party because
they have no confidence in our organization,'' Metka Tekavcic, a
Slovenian delegate, declared during one debate at the conference.
   Fewer than 10 percent of Yugoslavia's 23 million people belong
to the party and the number has been declining rapidly.
   In the opening speech of the conference on Sunday, party chief
Bosko Krunic rejected calls for a multiparty system. He also
predicted there will be new ``social upheavals'' once the austerity
measures, which include sharp price rises and wage controls, begin
to affect the nation.
   The measures were recommended by the International Monetary Fund.
   Some delegates also called for an extraordinary party congress,
but Ivan Brigic, a Presidium member, said such a conngress would
imply ``doubt that the plans of this party conference will be
materialized,'' the news agency said.
   He said the Central Commmittee alone will determine the leaders
responsible for the economic crisis if there is no improvement by
year's end.
   Before the document was adopted, Drasko Milicevic, a
representative of Serbia said it has ``too many words, too many
`one should,' `one needs,' `one must' ... the words we have all
become tired of.'' He demanded ``a drastic reduction'' of the text
to two or three pages _ ``with clear tasks.''

   Videotape retailers plan to use private
detectives and a boycott threat to strike back at a group that says
it will picket their stores in support of stricter anti-obscenity
laws taking effect today.
   The Minnesota Cleanup Project plans to protest at about 50
stores throughout the state Saturday to urge enforcement, said
Robert P. Heinrich, director of the anti-pornography organization.
   The amended law specifically includes videotapes in its
definition of materials that may be banned as obscene.
   David Ballstadt, president of a firm that runs 10 videotape
stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, said store operators would
retaliate by hiring detectives and tracing protesters' license
plates to find where they are employed.
   Letters will be sent to the employers telling them their
products will be boycotted because of their employees' activities,
he said.
   ``If these people think they can walk around and express their
freedoms, which they have a right to do, they're going to have to
pay a price, just as we have to,'' Ballstadt said.
   At issue are amendments approved by the 1988 Legislature to
bring the state's law into conformity with obscenity rulings of the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``The changes technically are not that great, but they do
provide some tools for prosecutors to use,'' said state Solicitor
General Norm Coleman.
   The previous law provided only for civil penalties; the new law
provides for criminal penalties, he said. Conviction on a first
offense carries up to one year in prison, a $3,000 fine or both.
Subsequent convictions carry a prison term of up to two years, a
fine of up to $10,000 or both.
   Heinrich, whose group is an affiliate of the Berean League, a
conservative Christian lobbying organization, said, ``Anything on
film or video is more enticing than a still picture, and this
material is readily available to children of all ages and people of
all ages.''
   The protesters, Heinrich said, will picket ``major hard-core
pornography outlets'' that have refused to remove what the group
considers obscene materials from their shelves.

<HEAD>Drug and Alcohol Testing Of All Recruits Starts Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department begins testing all
military recruits for drug and alcohol abuse today.
   All enlisted recruits as well as officer candidates applying to
the military academies and Reserve Officer Training Corps program
will be tested for alcohol, marijuana and cocaine.
   Applicants attempting to join the National Guard and the
reserves also will be tested.
   Congress ordered the drug testing program last December when it
approved the Pentagon's fiscal 1988 budget bill, requiring that it
start by the first week of June.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci decided last January to
start the testing at military processing stations around the
country on June 1.
   ``Positive findings for marijuana and alcohol will result in an
enlistment ineligibility for six months on the first test,'' the
guidelines state. ``Positive findings for cocaine will result in an
enlistment ineligibility for one year. A positive second test on
any of the three drugs will result in a two-year period of
enlistment ineligibility.''
   The Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force signed up almost
317,000 recruits in fiscal 1987.
   The testing has been opposed by some officials in the Defense
Department on grounds it is too expensive as well as unnecessary,
since all military personnel on active duty face random drug tests
at any time.
   A teen-ager planning to join the military can abstain from drugs
for a brief time and probably pass the test, noted one manpower
official, who asked not to be named.
   Congress approved a budget amendment sponsored by Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., who said that ``a drug-screening program is
logical and long overdue.''
   ``The time to start catching the users is before they join the
armed forces, when the government has no obligation to them,''
Hollings said.
   Carlucci, in setting out test guidelines, concluded recruits
should be tested ``for drug and alcohol use during their
pre-enlistment physical examinations,'' using a breathalyzer or
blood alcohol test for alcohol detection and urinalysis for
marijuana and cocaine detection.
   The standard for alcohol impairment will be a blood alcohol
level of .05, the directive said.

<HEAD>Church of England Drops Commentary Linked to Cleric's Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Church of England is dropping the traditional
anonymous commentary from its next clerical directory because of
the suicide of a theologian who used it to lambast Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, officials said today.
   The Church Commissioners and the Central Board of Finance, which
together oversee church investments and assets, said the commentary
was ``no longer a viable option.''
   Oxford University canon Gareth Bennett, 68, was found dead Dec.
7, five days after publication of his preface in the 1987-88
edition of the directory.
   The essay accused Runcie of being indecisive and overly liberal.
Although the article was unsigned, suspicion quickly fell on
Bennett because of his stature as a leader of the church's
conservative wing.
   It was widely interpreted as the opening shot in a campaign to
pressure Runcie into retirement and to block any attempt to replace
him with a liberal.
   Bennett was found dead in the garage of his home with a hose
leading into his car from the exhaust. Church officials later
confirmed that he wrote the preface.
   The Church Commissioners and Central Board of Finance said they
considered the possibility of publishing a signed commentary in
Crockford's Clerical Directory, but decided against it.
   The essay will be dropped from the 1989-90 edition of
Crockford's, the official biannual list of Anglican clergy, but no
decision has been made on whether to eliminate it permanently, a
joint statement said.

   Hundreds of enraged Israeli workers broke into
the Finance Ministry today, smashing windows and clashing with
police who fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, police said.
   A Jerusalem police spokesman said five policemen were injured
slightly and four demonstrators were detained.
   Israel army radio said 15 workers were injured by tear gas
inhalation and several ministry officials were injured by broken
glass.
   The violence started when 400 workers from Beit Shemesh Engines,
the nation's largest producer of airplane engines, demonstrated
near the ministry to protest the breakdown of talks on compensation
for 260 workers laid off from their jobs.
   ``The workers did not obey our orders and overturned a police
barrier, lightly injuring five officers,'' Lt. Alex Lapidot said.
``Then several dozen broke into the ministry, smashing windows and
plants.''
   Israel radio said the workers set a fire outside the building,
then used a garbage can to force open the door and vandalize the
ministry.
   Lapidot said police fired tear gas grenades to break up the
clash. The radio said paramilitary border police and mounted police
were also called in.
   ``We do not fear tear gas,'' Moshe Levy, head of the workers'
committee, shouted through a megaphone as he led the workers to
another protest in front of Israel's nearby parliament building.
   No further violence was reported.
   The ministry's deputy director, Victor Medina, told Israel radio
the demands of the workers were ``highly exaggerated'' and could
not be met.
   Ministry spokesman Yitzhak Feinberg would not disclose specific
details of the labor talks.

   The body of an automobile passenger thrown
30 feet from a wreck went undiscovered for six hours because the
driver didn't remember that someone had been riding with him, says
a man who helped the motorist.
   Peter John Finch, 34, of Chuluota died early Tuesday after being
thrown against Albert Vest's house from a car that drifted off the
road and hit a fence, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The body
cleared 10-foot weeds, police said.
   Vest said no one in the Vest family heard the accident, but they
did hear driver James Albritton of Chuluota knock on the door
following the wreck.
   Albritton, 31, was in shock and did not remember if anyone had
been riding with him, Vest said.
   Vest said he and troopers searched around the car for evidence
or passengers and found none. He said they did not think to look by
the house because it was so far from the car. About 5:30 a.m., Vest
went to bed.
   Three hours later, he and some neighbors walked over to look at
the car and the damaged fence, he said. They looked toward the
house and saw Finch's body.
   A Highway Patrol spokeswoman said Albritton remembers nothing of
the accident. He was listed in stable condition at Winter Park
Memorial Hospital.

   The first monkey born at a breeding colony
started by Walt Disney World has begun a three-year stay with a
family to help train the animal to assist handicapped people with
household tasks.
   ``We've been waiting two years for this,'' said Shirley Koehler
when Disney World officials Tuesday gave her Rusty, a 6-week-old
capuchin monkey. ``I can honestly say it's just like having my
first child. It's that exciting.''
   Disney started a colony of 63 monkeys in January and hopes to
produce 25 monkeys a year for a program called Helping Hands:
Simian Aides for the Disabled.
   By living with Koehler and her husband, Rusty will learn to
trust humans; the Koehlers, in effect, will be Rusty's foster
parents. Then Rusty will go to Boston University School of Medicine
for six more months of training.
   The Koehlers are not disabled.
   Eventually, Rusty will learn to take food from a refrigerator
and place it in front of its owner, put a Thermos in a holder, open
its lid and put in a straw.
   The animal will also learn to clean up spills and bring a
quadriplegic a mouth stick, which is used to type and turn book
pages.
   The program was started 10 years ago by Mary Joan Willard, a
behavioral scientist at Boston University. Seven monkeys from other
breeding programs have been placed with quadriplegics and 11 more
are in training.
   Nearly 70 more are in foster homes across the United States.

   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev today
condemned rebel attacks on Soviet troops withdrawing from
Afghanistan and said it ``should be absolutely clear'' that his
forces would respond to any further assaults.
   He also told a televised news conference at the close of his
summit talks with President Reagan that the Soviet Union will
consider restoring diplomatic relations with Israel as soon as an
international conference on the Middle East is convened.
   Gorbachev indicated, however, that disagreements over
Palestinian representation and other issues still block agreement
on calling an international conference. The Kremlin severed
relations with Israel in 1967 over Israel's six-day war against its
Arab neighbors.
   At separate post-summit news conferences, Reagan and Gorbachev
both cited the agreement on a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan as
an example of how the superpowers can help settle regional
conflicts by working with parties that are directly involved.
   But Gorbachev noted Afghan rebel attacks on Soviet troops and
the embassy in Kabul, including one attack near Kandahar on Tuesday
in which several Soviet soldiers died.
   If Soviet forces come under attack as they withdraw, ``we shall
react accordingly and appropriately,'' Gorbachev said. ``That
should be absolutely clear.''
   A senior U.S. official, speaking only on condition that he not
be identified, said Gorbachev clearly meant that his army would
return fire if attacked by Moslem rebels battling the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul.
   This official said Gorbachev complained to Reagan during their
summit talks about the attacks on withdrawing Soviet troops.
   At the same time, however, Soviet chief of staff Marshal Sergei
Akhromeyev outlined details of the schedule for withdrawal of an
estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets recently disclosed that 311 of their soldiers were
missing in action there. President Reagan told a Moscow State
University students Tuesday that the United States was willing to
assist efforts to find the missing troops.
   Gorbachev said today that American and Pakistani authorities had
been contacted and that ``we shall do all we can to return these
people to their homes.''
   On the Middle East, Gorbachev said ``there has been a drawing
closer of our positions'' with superpower agreement on the need for
an international conference. Problems of Palestinian representation
and an agenda are still to be resolved, he said.
   ``We've given the Americans several years of opportunity to go
it alone'' in the Middle East, Gorbachev said. ``They saw that they
couldn't.''
   Gorbachev told reporters that ``real possibilities have appeared
for solving regional problems,'' but neither he nor Reagan
discussed details of their discussions on Central America, southern
Africa, Cambodia and Korea.

   A fire broke out in the basement of a
luxury hotel and forced the evacutation of 400 guests, including
Spanish guitarist Paco De Lucia. Officials said two hotel employees
were injured.
   A maintenance manager and a worker at the Dan Panorama Hotel
suffered minor burns, and a firefighter suffered smoke inhalation,
hotel officials said.
   But no guests were injured and there was no substantial damage,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the fire started when a cooking gas canister exploded
while a new grill was being tested in the basement. Four ambulances
and six fire brigade vehicles rushed to the scene.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan
concluded four days of summit talks today with an impasse on a
major arms control agreement but muted differences on human rights.
The Soviet leader called their meetings ``a blow to the foundations
of the Cold War'' and Reagan said ``we must not stop here.''
   In remarks after their formal talks ended with smiles and
handshakes, Gorbachev said Reagan had disavowed his description of
the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' and noted with satisfaction
that he did it ``within the walls of the Kremlin.''
   Reagan in turn praised Gorbachev's moves to open up his
country's society to the point of suggesting that Soviet refusal to
permit thousands of dissidents to emigrate over a period of several
decades may be due to an unresponsive bureaucracy rather than
deliberate government policy.
   Asked at a news conference if he wasn't letting Gorbachev off a
little too easy on that score, Reagan replied, ``I just have to
believe that in any sort of government some of us do find ourselves
bound in by bureaucracy.''
   Both men vowed to persist in efforts to negotiate a new treaty
calling for sweeping reductions in nuclear weapons despite their
inability to achieve a breakthrough in four days in Moscow.
   The president said he hopes for an arms control agreement by the
end of his term in January to supplement the INF treaty that was
formally ratified during his four days in Russia. But, he quickly
added, ``I am dead set against deadlines.''
   ``We can look with optimism on future negotiations,'' he said,
even he continued to defend his proposal for Star Wars, which has
been a key stumbling block in superpower arms-control negotiations.
   ``The conversations are still going on and they are still being
discussed and I say progress is still being made or we wouldn't be
talking as we are,'' he said. But Reagan said ``I honestly can't
answer that question'' when asked whether he thought he and
Gorbachev would meet once more time as the leaders of the two
superpowers.
   It was Reagan's decision to soft-pedal differences on human
rights that seemed likely to be his most memorable comments at a
news conference televised live in the United States _ particularly
after his meeting two days earlier with dissidents who told him
personally of their imprisonment and internment in labor camps
during their struggle to emigrate.
   The leaders ended their fourth summit by exchanging the
documents of ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear arms
treaty (INF) signed last December. They said they will press to
complete an elusive agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons by
up to 50 percent.
   ``The first lines have already been written into a book of the
world without nuclear weapons,'' Gorbachev said. ``... I don't
think anyone can close that book and put it aside.''
   In his news conference _ the first such session ever held by a
Soviet leader in Moscow _ Gorbachev said the president's Strategic
Defense Initiative remained as one key obstacle to an offensive
arms agreement, along with a dispute over limits on submarine
launched cruise missiles.
   He said he told Reagan that the view that the so-called Star
Wars program is strictly a defensive one is ``just not serious.''
The issue snagged dramatic bargaining during the second sumit held
in 1986 in Iceland.
   In a brief ceremony in the Kremlin's St. Vladimir Hall, Reagan
and Gorbachev shook hands four separate times, giving no indication
that differences on issues had soured the warm personal
relationship they have displayed here. In his remarks to reporters,
Gorbachev generally praised Reagan although he said American
economic and arms policies were often contradictory.
   Gorbachev summarized their meetings as ``big politics, politics
that affect millions of millions of people.'' He said that with the
INF treaty, ``the era of nuclear disarmament has begun.''`
   Reagan, praising the INF treaty as historic because it mandates
the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons, said, ``We
must not stop here, Mr. general secretary. There is much more to be
done.''
   Despite the lack of major agreements, it was an upbeat windup to
the fourth summit in 30 months between the two leaders and the
first visit to Moscow by an American president in 14 years.
   Gorbachev made a point of noting that Reagan had said he no
longer viewed the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire.'' Reagan said
Tuesday he had been talking about ``another time, another era.''
   The Soviet leader said, ``We take note of this,'' remarking that
``Everything flows, everything changes.''
   In the absence in a strategic arms pact, Gorbachev said ``we
will not make any dramatic conclusions'' at this summit. However,
he said, they were moving ``step by step'' toward an eventual
treaty.
   Reagan had made a point during his visit of mixing criticism
with praise for the Soviet record on human rights and freedom.
Gorbachev said that when Reagan ``tried to persuade me to change my
mind,'' I said, your explanations are not convincing... I am not
filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit..''
   In developing his theme, Gorbachev said, ``... But big politics
means difficult politics,'' a reference perhaps to the strategic
arms negotiations that remains snagged, and to the human rights
issues that continue to divide the superpower nations.
   ``Big politics also means big responsibility,'' he continued.
``It cannot be built on pursuing only one`s own interest'' in the
movements toward ``a nuclear free and non-violent world.''
   ``President Reagan and I have agreed that the immediate task
before us,'' achievement of a reduction of 50 percent in strategic
nuclear arsenals, ``can and must be accomplished,'' the Soviet
leader said.
   Reagan and Gorbachev congratulated each other, and exchanged
pens used to sign the INF documents, while an audience of
high-ranking officials and dignitaries looked on. First ladies
Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev sat next to one another on the
front row.
   December's intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty requires the
destruction of all nuclear missiles on each side with a range of
300 to 3,400 miles. It was the first superpower nuclear arms pact
in 16 years.
   The far more expansive treaty that eluded Reagan and Gorbachev
would have provided for cuts of 30 to 50 percent in the
superpowers' stockpiles of strategic missiles, bombers and
submarines.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who present for the exchange of
treaty documents, said it was unlikely the Senate would have a
debate and ratification vote on a strategic missile treaty, even if
Reagan and Gorbachev negotiated such a pact before Reagan leaves
office next January.
   ``My suggestion would be that we make haste slowly, that we not
go too fast,'' Byrd said at a joint news conference with Dole.
``There are big problems ... a verification terrain that would be
strewn with booby traps and mine-fields.''

   If C. Rabon Martin wants to run for a seat
on a state regulatory agency, he can't do it under the name Wilbur
Jimbob Rogers.
   Martin said Judge Robert Caldwell dismissed his request for a
name change Tuesday because he was leery of ``sanctioning this
statewide big political joke.''
   Martin, an attorney and candidate for the Corporation
Commission, which regulates state utilities and the oil and gas
industry, said the judge also expressed concern that the ``intent
of it is to be confusing to the voter.''
   ``He thought it would be a bad idea for me professionally,''
Martin said.
   Martin said while his action may help establish ``parameters for
buffoonery,'' it was a ``joke that also has a moral. The intent is
to kick people in the pants and say, `Think before you vote.' ''
   In a May 11 court petition, Martin said he wanted the change
``as a measure of the degree of respect and regard ... for
Oklahoma's political heritage.''
   He said he selected Wilbur in honor of Wilbur Wright, a former
state labor commissioner often cited as an example of the political
value of a famous name.
   Martin liked Jimbob for its ``basic down-home appeal,'' and
thought ``anyone named Rogers has always been able to get elected
to anything in Oklahoma,'' where the humorist Will Rogers was born.
   He said he would have changed his name back to C. Rabon Martin
after the election.

   Here is a text of President Reagan's opening
statement and news conference Wednesday at Spaso House:
   If just this one time I might speak for all of you as well as
myself, I would like to extend my thanks to General Secretary
Gorbachev, all of his associates in the Soviet government and the
people of Moscow for all they've done to make our stay here a
pleasant one and this summit conference the success it has been.
   This is my fourth summit. For some in our governments and some
of you in the media, the number is higher. But a good deal of
important work has been accomplished here in Moscow.
   The personal relationship between Mr. Gorbachev and me and the
various members of our respective delegations has continued to
deepen and improve. The personal relationships and hopes for peace
are not by themselves enough. I think history will note that in our
approach to the summit process the United States has sought a
consistency of expression as well as purpose.
   Out of every turn, I've tried to state our overwhelming desire
for peace; I've also tried to note the existence of fundamental
differences. And that's why it's a source of great satisfaction
that those difference in part as a result of these meetings
continue to recede.
   In addition, spokesmen for the Soviet government have noted the
change of policy, indeed the profound change of policy, that has
occurred in their own government. The United States is fully
cognizant of this change and aware of its implications.
   In noting the differences that still stand between us,
therefore, my desire has not been to sound a note of discouragement
but one of realism. Not to conduct a tutorial but to give the kind
of emphatic testimony to the truth that over the long run removes
the illusion and moves the process of negotiation forward. From our
standpoint, this approach has borne fruit at previous meetings and
again at this summit conference.
   And here, permit me to go back for just a moment to our first
summit meeting at Geneva. There, we agreed on certain fundamental
realities that would govern our relations. That a nuclear war
cannot be won and must never be fought. That the United States and
the Soviet Union bear special responsibilities for the risk of war.
That neither side should seek military superiority over the other.
   We affirmed our determination to prevent war, whether nuclear or
conventional. And our resolve to contribute in every way possible
along with other nations to a safer world. We also set out a broad
agenda and initiated a new process of dialogue to address the
sources of tension in U.S.-Soviet relations. Since Geneva, we have
achieved through a sustained effort progress across this broad
agenda.
   Our first discussions here in Moscow focused on the important
matter of human rights, individual freedoms. The United States
views human rights as fundamental to our relationship with the
Soviet Union and all nations. From the beginning we stressed this
point, and are encouraged by recent signs of progress in the Soviet
Union. I believe where people have the right to speak, write,
travel and worship freely, creative energies are released. On
several occasions I've said that nations do not distrust each other
because they're armed, they are armed because they distrust each
other.
   For the past three years, General Secretary Gorbachev and I have
worked to build a relationship of greater trust. And we both
recognize that one way to do that is to improve understanding
between our two countries through broader people-to-people contacts.
   A series of agreements to expand U.S.-Soviet bilateral
cooperation, including cultural exchanges, have been concluded. We
agreed to expand our student exchange programs with the goal of
allowing hundreds and eventually thousands of Soviet and American
high school students to study in each other's classrooms. For our
future relations, academic, cultural and other exchanges are of
greater importance.
   Turning to regional issues, Mr. Gorbachev and I agreed that
there must be peaceful solutions to these conflicts. Our goal is to
advance independence, security and freedom. The Soviet decision to
withdraw from Afghanistan is significant, and we agree that
building on the Afghan settlement leads to an approach to other
regional problems. Our discussions also dealt with Cambodia,
Angola, Ethiopia, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf and Central
America.
   Each of our summit meetings moved us farther toward an INF
treaty, capped by today's exchange of ratification instruments
which now makes it a reality. Each meeting has also moved us
farther toward meeting the even greater challenge of crafting a
treaty to reduce our strategic nuclear arsenals.
   In Geneva, the general secretary and I agreed on the concept of
50 percent reductions, and in Reykjavik on numerical limits for
warheads and delivery vehicles; in Washington, on intensive work to
complete a START treaty, including comprehensive verification
provisions building upon those in INF. Here in Moscow, we've made
important additional strides toward that objective.
   Verification is one of the most important and most difficult
issues for us, and I'm pleased to report progress in this area,
too. We've moved forward in other areas as well, including
agreements on an experiment to improve the verification of existing
nuclear testing treaties and notification of strategic ballistic
missile launches.
   Finally, let me say how deeply moving I have found my
discussions with various citizens of the Soviet Union. The monks of
Danilov, the dissidents and refuseniks, the writers and artists,
the students and young people have shown once again that spiritual
values are cherished in this nation. It's my fervent hope that
those values will attain even fuller expression.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: fuller expression.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, I know you touched on this, but in your first
news conference in 1981 you said that the Soviets lie and cheat to
pursue their ends of world domination. What has really changed your
mind? Can the American people really trust the Russians now?
   A: Well, Helen that was the first press conference that I had
held since being elected president and the question that came to me
was, could we believe the Russians or would they lie to us? And my
answer at that time was not expressing my opinion. I said I will
answer that with their own words and then I cited some of the
leaders of the communist movement in the Soviet Union that said
that the only immorality was anything that slowed the growth of
socialism, and that there was no immorality in lying or cheating or
doing anything of that kind as long as it advanced the cause of
socialism. Now that was my answer. So it wasn't my opinion. I was
quoting what their leaders themselves, the beginners of that
particular system had said.
   Q. Do you still think that?
   A: I think right now of course, as I've said, ... trust but
verify. But I think that there is quite a difference today in the
leadership and in the relationship between our two countries. And
we have held very productive meetings that I think were productive
for both sides.''
   Q: On the START treaty, what are the areas of progress and what
was the specific progress that you achieved here, and why do you
think that you can conclude the treaty this year when Senate
leaders are urging you to go slow, and this summit, with all its
momentum, wasn't able to break the impasse?
   A: Well, the Senate leaders themselves brought the ratification
papers here that we just received today on the INF treaty. It meant
changing their own schedules a great deal and speeding up the
ratification process. I think that we can count on them to feel the
same if we are coming to final agreement on a START treaty. But I
want to remind you of one thing that we've said over and over
again: the START treaty is infinitely more complex than the INF
treaty, and therefore there's going to be continued negotiation on
a number of points. And then it will depend on the Senate. Once, if
we have agreed upon a treaty, it is their responsibility to
thoroughly study that treaty and then issue ratification of it if
they find it satisfactory.
   We can hope, I would hope that before the year is out that we
could eliminate the differences that still exist. But if not I
would hope that my successor would continue, because here we are
getting at I think the most important reduction that should take
place in nuclear weapons. The most destabilizing are the
intercontinental ballistic missiles in which someone pushes a
button and minutes later a part of the earth blows up. And that's
why, and the thing that I expressed my hope about, is that not only
have we said 50 percent, but in that first meeting in Geneva, the
general secretary proposed the idea also of reducing by half our
nuclear missiles.
   Q: Could you go over the areas of progresss on START that you
achieved here?
   A: No, I don't think that I should go on. The conversations are
still going on and there are things still being discussed. And as I
say, progress has been made or we wouldn't still be talking the way
we are.
   There's a young lady in the back that I think is native to the
scene.
   Q: Mr. President, is there something in Soviet-American
relations that you would advise your successor to leave behind? And
is there something that you would specially advise to take to the
future?
   A: Yes, if these negotiations and so forth are still going on, I
will do everything I can to persuade my successor to follow up and
to continue. And, as a matter of fact, I think I'll tell him that
he will find the Russian people most warm, and hospitable and
friendly.

<TEXT>
   Remains dug up this week are those of the Green
River Killer's 40th victim, but the commander of the search for the
nation's worst known serial killer says it's unlikely the find will
lead to a breakthrough in the six-year-old case.
   The bones and skull of Debra Lorraine Estes, a runaway who long
had been feared a victim of the killer, were identified Tuesday
through dental records.
   In addition to the 40 women known dead, eight missing women are
listed as probable victims of the killer, who frequently dumped
bodies in clusters in woods east and south of Seattle.
   Ms. Estes, who was 15 when she vanished nearly six years ago,
had been on the missing list until her remains were found Monday by
workers digging post holes at a new apartment complex in Federal
Way, a town between Seattle and Tacoma, said King County Police
Sgt. Steve Davis.
   ``Like everything else that comes up, this answers one question
and poses 100 more,'' said Capt. Robert Evans, commander of the
King County Police Green River task force.
   He said it was unlikely the discovery would yield any
breakthroughSoviet society. How do you feel about the fact that
they have kept dossiers on these dissidents with whom you've met,
and doesn't that contradict your view that there have been
improvements here, and that this is a more open society under Mr.
Gorbachev?
   A: Well, no, the figures themselves reveal that improvements
have been made. Some 300 people have been freed from imprisonment,
a number of people. The lists that we bring are names that have
been brought to our attention by relatives or friends, their own
relatives for example living in our country now. And I have brought
those names to the general secretary and explained the personal
interest that we have in them, and a great many of them have since
been allowed to come to our country or to other countries that they
preferred such as Israel, and so I think that there has been a
sizeable improvement. And we still are going to continue doing that.
   Q: The very people with whom you met have now been investigated
by Soviet authorities and might be subject to some form of
retaliation. Mr. Gorbachev said today that you no longer feel that
this is the evil empire, that you told him that within the Kremlin
walls. Doesn't this contradict your new feeling of optimism about
the Soviet Union?
   A: No, because as I say he has received the latest list that I
brought here. And previous experiences with this, a great many of
those people have people have been allowed to come to our country.
   Q: Yesterday you did say you no longer believe the Soviet Union
is an evil empire. You said that was another time, another era.
What's changed? Is it just Mr. Gorbachev's succession to the
general secretaryship, or have you yourself changed or expanded
your view of the Soviet Union?
   A: No, I think that a great deal of it is due to the general
secretary who I have found different than previous Soviet leaders
have been, but that also as we have pursued this we have found them
willing to enter into negotiations with us. And I think that enough
progress has been made that we can look with optimism on future
negotiations.
   Q: Is there anything that you have learned, that you personally
have expanded or changed your views because you've had an
opportunity to learn more about this country and about their system
... or is it just Gorbachev?
   A: Well, a large part of it is Mr. Gorbachev as a leader and I
think there have been changes here as they have sought to make _
well, I read `Perestroika' and I found much in it that I could
agree with.
   Q: Mr. Gorbachev said that he thought you could have achieved
more in this summit. Specifically, he went on to say that on the
issue of the ABM interpretation and treaty he said that you had
gone back on your word, that in Geneva you had agreed that you
would no longer seek military superiority and that by holding to
the development of SDI you were seeking superiority in outer space
and that therefore you had gone back on your word. Are you seeking
superiority in outer space? Can you reach a START agreement without
some accomodation on SDI and the START question?
   A: SDI in my mind _ maybe some of my people wouldn't agree with
me _ but the whole thing was my idea, to see if there could not be
developed a defensive weapon that would make it virtually
impossible for nuclear missiles to get through to their targets in
another country. And from the very beginning, I have said that if
and when such a system can be developed I would support the idea of
making it available worldwide, because since we all know how to
make nuclear missiles, sometime there could be a madman come along,
as a Hitler came along, who could then make those missiles.
   But that my idea would be the sharing of the knowledge of SDI as
a defensive weapon would be accompanied by the total elimination of
nuclear weapons. And I happen to believe that this will be a lot
better world if we get rid of all the nuclear weapons. And that is
what my dream of SDI is, that it can be the tool by which we
eliminate those weapons.
   Q: Gorbachev said today that he did not believe it's for
defensive purposes. ... You failed to convince him despite the fact
that you're on such good terms with him.
   A: I know he has said that before. Well, maybe he just doesn't
know me well enough. But from the very first I have said that that
is my goal for that defensive weapon. There is nothing offensive
about it. It cannot hurt or kill anyone. It can just make it
impossible for missiles to get through the screen.

   Q: About this effort you again stated today to try to get a
START treaty before you leave office. You have less than eight
months left in office. Mikhail Gorbachev could have 10 years. By
setting up any kind of deadline, no matter how unofficial, aren't
you putting all the pressure on the U.S. side?''
   A: Oh, no, no. We set no deadline. I said we are going to
continue working toward that. And I could hope that maybe in that
period of time, but no, I am dead set against deadlines. You don't
make a treaty just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point
in time. The treaty is ready when it is a good treaty and good for
all sides involved. And that's what we'll do instead of setting a
deadline and then saying, ``Well, let's sign it because we've
reached the deadline.'' It has to be good.
   Q: To prevent U.S.-Soviet relations from being mixed up in
politics, are you willing to rule out a summit until the
presidential campaign is over in November?
   A: I'd make any decision of that kind based on how I thought it
could affect the situation. If it gave a promise of success, then
go for it.
   Q: Why do you favor repeal on two-term limit on U.S. presidents
when Gorbachev is promoting the idea of limited terms for the
Soviet Union?
   A: I would hesitate to comment on that. This system of
government here, you do not have a national election in which all
of the people vote to see who would be the leader. My objection to
the constitutional amendment that was passed in our country
limiting a president to two terms was the fact that that is the
only office in the United States in which all the people vote for
the candidates for that office. And it seems to me that it is an
infringement on the rights of our people in a democracy to tell
them that they can't vote for someone because of a time limit. I
think it impinges on their right to vote for whoever they want to
vote for for as many times as they want to vote for them. That is
the principle of democracy.
   Q: You talked a lot about how it is a positive thing for
students from both countries to mix and mingle. ... Do you think
part of your positive feeling about the Soviet Union these days
comes as a result of greater tolerance you've developed as a result
of your meetings with Mr. Gorbachev?''
   A: Well, I have found that Mr. Gorbachev and I, I think, have a
very satisfactory relationship. But at the same time I am never
going to relax my belief in the need for verification of agreements
that we might make. I'm quite sure that he feels the same way.
   Q: In your first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev he suggested the
reduction of half-a-million military personnel ... but there was no
follow-up.
   A: No, this proposal, this was ... just a suggestion made of the
removal of a half-a-million men on the NATO line on the European
front. This has to be considered _ we think that we are coming to a
point, and that he himself is willing to, of reductions in
conventional weapons along that front, and conventional forces as
well as the nuclear forces. But the simple removing of a
half-a-million men would not be exactly equal, because his military
would be moved a short distance back away from the front. Well,
there's a 3,000-mile ocean between where our men would have to be
moved. And in the event of an emergency we'd have an ocean to cross
to get our men back there and equal. So that has to be considered.
   Q: Regarding your comments on human rights, Gorbachev said he
``I did not have a lot of admiration for that part of the trip.''
... Did he say anything to you specifically about the meeting with
dissidents or your remarks at Danilov monastery or the remarks
yesterday at the writers' union?
   A: No, but I do know that he and others have had a feeling that
in some way our concern with this is interfering in your internal
government policies. I have explained to him, and I think maybe he
has seen the point, our country's very unique. All of us, either by
ourselves or through our ancestors or our grandparents or parents,
came from someplace else. We're about the only nation in the world
that can say that. As a matter of fact, the estimate is that one
out of eight Americans trace their parentage and their heritage, if
not their own emigration, to the Eastern bloc. I have put it this
way that you don't stop loving your mother because you've taken
unto yourself a wife. So the people in America do have a feeling
for the countries of their heritage.
   In my case it was a great-grandfather on one side and a
grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side. Well, Americans
retain that feeling of friendship and loyalty to the countries
that, as I say, were, are their heritage. And so when we feel that
people are being unjustly treated, imprisoned for something that in
our country would not be a crime calling for such a sentence, our
people get aroused, and they come to us and they want help, they
want something done.
   A wife who's been waiting for eight years for her husband to be
allowed to leave this country to join her, things of this kind we
don't think are really interfering with someone else's business. We
think it's very much our business to bring it to the attention
where we feel that there's an injustice to the government. And I
have explained this to the general secretary and I think mhe has
seen the justice of what I've said because many of the individuals
that we've brought to his attention have now been released from
confinement here and have been allowed to emigrate, come to other
countries, to our country.

<HEAD>30 Die In Clashes Between Soldiers And Rebels</HEAD>

   At least 30 people were killed in
clashes between government troops and communist rebels in the past
five days, including six soldiers who were ambushed south of
Manila, the military said today.
   In another incident, 10 armed men believed to be rebels abducted
a vice mayor and killed a village leader in Ilocos Norte, military
officials in the northern province said today.
   They said the body of Rudy Balbag, chief of the Dadaor village
was found today near the house where he and Vice Mayor Willie Gaces
of nearby Bangui town were abducted the night before.
   Lt. Col. Romeo Acop, Philippine Constabulary provincial
commander, said the two men were attending a funeral wake in Dadaor
when heavily armed men arrived Tuesday. The armed men dined with
Balbag and Gaces, then bound them and took them away, Acop said.
   The latest clash between government forces and the communist New
People's Army occurred Tuesday when guerrillas killed six soldiers
in a mountain village in Laguna province, 35 miles southeast of
Manila, a military report said.
   The report said the soldiers were on foot patrol when a 40-man
rebel band, waiting in ambush, open fired. The rebels withdrew
after a brief firefight.
   On Samar island, 400 miles southeast of Manila, soldiers killed
three guerrillas during a skirmish Tuesday near the town of
Salcedo, a Philippine Constabulary report said.
   In another incident, Philippine Constabulary soldiers gunned
down two members of a 70-man insurgent force Tuesday in the town of
Bansud in Oriental Mindoro province, 130 miles south of Manila.
   On Mindanao island, government troops on Tuesday killed six
rebels in repulsing an attack by 100 guerrillas in the town of
Valencia in Bukidnon province, 550 miles southeast of Manila, said
Philippine army chief Brig. Gen. Mariano Adelem.
   He said the rebels attacked an army detachment in Valencia but
fled after government reinforcements arrived. There were no
casualties on the government side, Adalem added.
   Maj. Laureano Palanas, spokesman of the military's Southern
Command, said communist rebels killed two militiamen and a civilian
Saturday in a village outside Tangub city in Misamis Occidental
province, 490 miles southeast of Manila. Palanas said the three
were on their way to report on a rebel attack on their village when
they were killed.
   In a nearby village, another rebel force killed three civilians
and three militiamen, Palanas said. He said four rebels were killed
by soldiers.
   The rebel army, the armed wing of the outlawed Communist Party
of the Philippines, has been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.

<HEAD>Program In Works To Exercise Sea Turtles To Protect Them From
Sharks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exercise program in the works for
endangered sea turtles won't have them racing hares but may help
them dodge sharks, scientists say.
   Scientists at the National Marine Fisheries Service are
developing a regimen for the more than 1,000 Kemp's Ridley turtles
raised in captivity each year and released into the Gulf of Mexico
in an effort to save them from extinction.
   In captivity, the turtles are too aggressive to be placed
together in a tank and have to live in one-gallon plastic milk
cartons or other small containers in larger tanks, said Tim
Fontaine, manager of the federally funded program to save the
turtles.
   The turtles get virtually no exercise, Fontaine said. About the
most they can do is flap inside their containers. As a result, they
may not be as expert as they could be at dodging predators once
they are released into the Gulf, Fontaine said.
   Scientists fear that the more than 13,500 Ridleys already
released into the Gulf have been too vulnerable to their No. 1
enemy _ the shark.
   Fontaine, working with Charles Caillouet, chief of the life
studies division for the fisheries service, has developed an
exercise system that involves pumping water through the tanks to
create a current the turtles can swim against.
   The flow would be continuous during daylight hours, except
during feeding periods, Fontaine said. There would be no current at
night.
   The program is being tested with 120 hatchlings that will be
nine to 11 months old at the end of the experiment. Sixty turtles
will be tested in the exercise environment and 60 will be in
regular tanks.
   The turtles' stress hormone levels will be checked periodically,
Fontaine said. ``If we find that it is causing too much stress,
then we'll have to try some other approaches,'' he said.

   Q. Gorbachev said he proposed a draft statement using the words
``peaceful coexistence'' and your first response was ``I like it,''
but after meeting with aides you changed your mind. Why?
   A. Well, I liked the whole tone, the general tone of it, and
what it was seeking to achieve was what we were both seeking to
achieve. But I said at the same time I would take it to our people,
and I took it there and they studied it and saw where there could
have been certain ambiguities in there that would not achieve the
general thought of what was bring proposed. We were in agreement
with the general thought. So some rewriting was done by our own
people. And when the total statement is released to you I think you
will find that we have achieved what it was he had with the
paragraph that he proposed, and it has been achieved and improved
to the point that it is clear and unmistakable, that it achieves
the purpose that he had in mind.
   Q. What's the substitute, the better term your aides have
advised you to use?
   A. No, peaceful coexistence, both pieces achieved the same end,
but the other one had ambiguities in it _ and I don't think it was
intentional _ but they could have been used to justify doing
something else that was not in keeping with the entire goal of the
statement here.
   Q. Do you believe that essentially it is just bureaucratic
lethargy that has caused emigration problems in the Soviet Union?
   A. I'm afraid that I have to confess to you that I think one of
the sins of government, and one with which we must deal and never
have been able to be completely successful with, and this includes
our own government, is that the bureaucracy once created has one
fundamental rule above all others: preserve the bureaucracy. And I
think that governments will always ... find that they are having to
check on bureaucracy and make sure that it is not abiding by its
own rules and taking the easiest course. And so, I wouldn't picking
(sic) on one government other than another.
   Q. Gorbachev said he did not find your arguments on human rights
in the United States convincing.
   A. I think that there is a mistaken view, and oh, how I yearn to
have him come to our country for long enough to see some of our
country, I think there's a mistaken view about the things that
occasionally dominate the press, about prejudice, racial or
religious, in our country, about people, the so-called street
people that apparently have no place to live. And I think these
problems, these are socio-economic problems in our land, we have
them, of course. We also try to deal with them. But I don't think
he quite could understand a recent situation: a young lady living
on the sidewalks of New York, living out there on the sidewalk,
winter and summer, and so for her own sake, the police picked her
up to bring her to where she could be placed in a shelter and she
took her case to court and won her case in court that she should be
allowed to go back and sleep on the sidewalk where she had been
because that's what she preferred to do. Well, when you have a free
country, how far can we go in impinging on the freedom of someone
who says this is the way I want to live? I think we could
straighten him out if he saw what we did in our country.
   Q. In this room on Monday you heard moving stories of people who
had been in prison, dissidents, religious people, and then you went
to Moscow State University and then you wrote it off to
bureacuracy. Is that really your view that it is only the
bureaucracy, it is not a willful policy of the government here to
keep these people from emigrating?
   A. No, I can't say that it is when I don't know that much about
the system, but the question was presented to me on the basis that
it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle. Maybe I should illustrate to
you why I feel the way I do about bureaucracies.
   Once during the war I happened to be involved in a situation in
which one level of the military wanted a warehouse full of filing
cabinets, wanted permission to destroy the files so they could use
those filing cases and they were able to prove that the documents
had no historic value, they had no bearing on present day
government at all; they were just useless.
   And so the message went up through the ranks requesting
permission to destroy these obsolete files. And then back down
through the ranks from the top command, endorsed by each level of
command, came the reply: ``Permission granted _ provided copies
were made of each file destroyed.''
   Q. Don't you think you're letting Mr. Gorbachev off a little
easy on just saying it's bureaucracy?
   A. No, as I said, I don't _ the way the question was framed, I
thought there was a possibility of that. No, but I just have to
believe that in any government, some of us do find ourselves bound
in by bureaucracy, and then sometimes you have to stomp your foot
and say unmistakably I want it done. And then maybe you get through
with it. But I have great confidence in his ability to do that.
   Q. You said if there was progress toward a START treaty you
would be willing to come together a fifth time. ... Have you made
enough progress that you now think a START treaty is likely within
your term?
   A. I honestly cannot answer that. I don't know. Let me just give
you what the mechanics are. Our people have been steadily in
Geneva, both sides, Soviet people and our people, both sides
working on this treaty, knowing what we hope to achieve, and
they're working there, and as I say, they've made progress. There
is no way to judge and there is no way that I would give them a
date and say, ``Please, you have to get this by such and such a
time,'' because that's not the way to get a good treaty. I want a
good treaty.
   Q. Is the only condition under which you would have a fifth
summit with Gorbachev if there was a good START treaty ready to be
signed.
   A. Well, you can't rule out, something else might come up that
necessitates our getting together and settling something other than
that particular treaty. So no one can say, no, there will be no
need for a summit.
   Q. What have you learned in your first trip to Moscow?
   A. I'm going to do one answer because I've wanted to say this
and I say it every time I get a chance: I think that one of the
most wonderful forces for stability and good that I have seen in
the Soviet Union are the Russian women.

   President Reagan muted his long-standing criticism
of the Soviet leadership today and said emigration barriers may
arise from a Kremlin ``bound in by bureaucracy'' rather than
willful Soviet policy.
   At a summit windup news conference, the president avoided any
direct criticism of his host, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
and said Kremlin officials believe that raising questions about
emigration constituted ``interfering'' in internal matters.
   Reagan also held out hope that an agreement on sharp slashes in
the superpowers' nuclear arsenals still could be achieved before he
leaves office but said he he was dead set against deadlines.
   But his comments on arms control were overshadowed by his
suggestion that Soviet leaders should not be personally blamed for
the restrictions which put Soviet citizens in labor camps and keep
thousands of Jews and other Russians from leaving.
   ``I just have to believe that in any government some of us do
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' Reagan said.
   He said in such instances a leader must stomp his feet and
demand that wrongs be set right and he suggested he thought
Gorbachev was doing that.
   ``I have great confidence in his ability to do that,'' Reagan
said, noting that Gorbachev has been responsive when Reagan gave
him lists of hardship cases.
   The president was asked by an American reporter whether he felt
he was ``letting Mr. Gorbachev off a little easy on just saying
it's bureaucracy'' that bars Russians from leaving.
   The question grew out of Reagan's reply to a student at Moscow
State University on Tuesday about dissidents and refuseniks, those
who have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or are
otherwise punished merely for seeking permission to leave.
   ``I'm not blaming you; I'm blaming bureaucracy,'' Reagan told
the student. ``We have the same type of thing happen in our
country...''
   On other issues, Reagan:
   _Expressed optimism that the United States and Soviet Union
could come to terms on a treaty to reduce their arsenals of
strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   ``The conversation are still going on and they are still being
discussed and I say progress is still being made or we wouldn't be
talking as we are,'' he said.
   _Refused to commit himself to a fifth summit with Gorbachev, but
did not rule out the possibility of one, even without a START
agreement to sign.
   _Said he and Gorbachev have a ``very satisfactory relationship
but at the same time I am never going to relax my belief in the
need for verification of agreements that we might make.''
   _Maintained that his disavowal of his earlier characterization
of the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire'' results from changes
instituted by Gorbachev.
   ``I read Perestroika and I found much in it that I agreed
with,'' Reagan said. ``Perestroika,'' meaning restructuring, is the
title of a book by Gorbachev.
   But it was his remark about Soviet bureaucracy that raised the
most pointed question.
   ``In this room on Monday,'' the reporter said, ``you heard
moving stories of people who had been in prison, dissidents,
religious people, and then you went to Moscow State University and
then you wrote it off to bureacuracy. Is that really your view that
it is only the bureaucracy, it is not a willful policy of the
government here to keep these people from emigrating?''
   In response, Reagan said the the question had been ``presented
to me on the basis that it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle.''
   Actually, the student's question had been why had Reagan invited
only refuseniks and dissidents to meet with him the previous day.
   Throughout the summit, the president has soft-pedaled his
customary attacks of the communist system.
   He was reminded that at his first news conference in the White
House in 1981 he said that Communist leaders are willing to lie and
cheat in pursuit of world domination.
   Asked if that was still his view, he said in 1981 he had merely
been quoting what Communist leaders themselves had said. Using the
Russian words, he said with a smile, that his policy remains:
``trust, but verify.''
   He said he has found Gorbachev ``different than previous Soviet
leaders'' and that ``we can look with optimism to future
negotiations'' to reduce strategic arms.
   Reagan met with reporters shortly after Gorbachev, at the first
news conference he had ever held in the Soviet Union, noted with
pleasure that Reagan had retracted his characterization of this
country as an ``evil empire.''
   Reagan said Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders ``have had a
feeling that in some way'' American concern with human rights
conditions in the Soviet Union constitute ``interfering in your
interal government policies.''
   Asked about prospects from agreement on START in his term, he
said, ``I honestly cannot answer that, I don't know.''
   He said negotiators are continuing working in Geneva on the
difficult issues involved, but ``There is no way that I would give
them a date (for completion)... because that is not the wqay to get
a good treaty.''

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that
ousted Moscow Communist Party chief Boris Yeltsin will be asked to
account for an interview with Western news organizations in which
he criticized a member of the ruling Politburo.
   In an unprecedented public airing of high-level Kremlin
disputes, Gorbachev also denied reports of a rift between himself
and Yegor Ligachev, 67, the party's theoretician and No. 2 figure
in the Politburo.
   Gorbachev answered reporters' questions at a news conference,
broadcast live from the Soviet Foreign Ministry, at the close of
his summit talks with President Reagan. It was the first time that
a Soviet leader had held a news conference in Moscow.
   Yeltsin told CBS-TV and the British Broadcasting Corp. in
interviews broadcast Monday that Ligachev was blocking reforms and
should resign. Yeltsin said on ABC-TV today that he had been
misquoted in the BBC interview.
   Gorbachev said Yeltsin's ``position is at variance with that of
the Central Committee,'' to which Yeltsin still belongs.
   ``We at the Central Committee will demand from Comrade Yeltsin
explanations as to what it is all about and what he is after,''
Gorbachev said.
   Yeltsin, 57, was ousted as Moscow party boss in November and
from the Politburo in February after he made an angry speech before
the Central Committee, which has more than 300 members and meets
several times a year to vote on party policy.
   Gorbachev denied Yeltsin's charge that Ligachev was blocking
reform, and sought to quell rumors of friction between himself and
Ligachev, who is widely believed to be leading a conservative
faction on the ruling Politburo.
   ``As for Comrade Ligachev and his resignation, no such problem
exists, either in the Central Committee or in the Polituro. That is
all. That is what you should proceed from and that is the way it
will be,'' Gorbachev said emphatically.
   In his interviews broadcast Monday, Yeltsin said Ligachev should
step down ``because processes in the party are too slow, because
the party is still lagging behind, because the process of
democratization is not developing ... and Comrade Ligachev is the
main person responsible.''
   In an interview taped Tuesday and broadcast today on ABC's
``Good Morning America'' show, about the time that Gorbachev was
answering reporters' questions, Yeltsin said the transcript of his
BBC interview was ``an outright fabrication.''
   He said there was ``absolutely no talk of resignation
whatsoever.'' And he denied telling the BBC interviewer that he was
upset with Gorbachev.
   ``Also apart from politically being, well, outright fabrication,
I would say this is not the first time they've let me down from
purely a human standpoint,'' Yeltsin said.
   Gorbachev today offered some details of the Central Committee
meeting at which Yeltsin gave the speech which led to his ouster.
   ``Just as you are asking me questions, the statement he made at
that meeting had not been planned. We had an exchange, a
free-for-all,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader said that besides Yeltsin, 27 committee
members spoke. ``The opinion of all 27 speakers was that the
generalizations made by Comrade Yeltsin regarding the Central
Committee, its secretariat and the Politburo were wrong, and his
statement was recognized as being politically erroneous,'' he said.
   Soviet officials have refused to release the text of Yeltsin`s
speech, citing Communist Party tradition and rules.
   In his earlier interviews, Yeltsin denied the authenticity of
versions of the speech that circulated in Moscow, but confirmed he
had urged that the reforms be accelerated.
   Gorbachev said he had not read the Yeltsin interviews.
   ``I have asked for the exact wording of what Comrade Yeltsin has
said,'' Gorbachev told reporters.
   In the ABC interview broadcast today, Yeltsin said those who are
opposing and trying to slow down Gorbachev's policy of perestroika,
or economic restructuring, are unorganized.
   ``Since each of them is going it alone, then of course it's just
a group of people which, no matter how you try to estimate its
numbers, is not organized,'' he said.
   ``That is, it's not the kind of organized opposition who has its
own program, or is an organized kind of opposition to perestroika
or its thesis or anything like that,'' Yeltsin said.
   Even if Gorbachev's reforms fail, ``the chances are very good''
that he will remain in power, Yeltsin said.
   ``There are great difficulties in perestroika,'' he said.
``Perestroika also has a moral side. People's spirit, their
culture, the renewal of society, the revolutionary overhaul of
society _ are these really things that can happen in one, two or
even three years?''
   Said Yeltsin: ``It won't be our generation which will complete
perestroika, that's my opinion.''
   Feodor Burlatsky, a former Central Committee member and now a
commentator for the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta, told reporters
Tuesday that if Ligachev were a true foe of Gorbachev's economic
and social reforms, he would face severe punishment.
   ``If Ligachev has his own views, it is only natural. It is
another thing to lead some conservatives, and I think this is not a
fact,'' Burlatsky said. ``If such a person appears on the political
scene, he would be out of the leadership.''
   Alexei Arbatov, deputy director of the Institute for
International Economy and International Relations, said in an
interview he did not agree with Yeltsin that Ligachev is blocking
reform.
   Arbatov's father, Georgy, a Central Committee member and head of
the Institute for the Study of the U.S.A. and Canada, told
reporters that ``in our point of view, I don't think it was too
correct'' of Yeltsin to use the Western news media to mount his
attack.

<HEAD>Fish, Seal Deaths Blamed On Waste Polluting North Sea Waters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A government minister today called for
international action to reduce pollution in the North Sea and
Baltic Sea after thousands of fish and hundreds of seals were
reported dead along their shores.
   Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer told a special Parliament
committee meeting that action to reduce the dumping of wastes was
needed because of ``strong suspicions'' it threatened sea life.
   During the meeting, the opposition Greens Party demanded the
government immediately ban ships from getting rid of chemical and
other wastes at sea.
   About 50 dead seals have been found on West German shorelines in
the past month, while about 300 have been discovered along
Denmark's coasts, Toepfer said.
   He said biologists checking the dead seals discovered they were
suffering from a virus that caused their deaths. Experts last
weekend said pneumonia was the ``final cause'' of death.
   Thousands of tons of fish meanwhile died from a blanket of
yellow sea algae in the North Sea, Toepfer said.
   The algae, up to 10 feet thick in some places, spread from the
coasts of Norway and Sweden and now threatens Denmark, Danish
officials said.
   West German reports have said the fish were dying from slime
from the algae, which coated their gills and prevented them from
breathing.
   Experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers and
phosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramatic
growth of the algae.
   In Norway, fish farmers were advised to kill their fish. Resort
owners in western Denmark fear news of the algae may ruin the
summer tourist season.

<TEXT>
   A man paid $20,000 to carry out a
murder arranged through an ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine has
been sentenced to the maximum 40 years in prison for the bungled
grenade bombing three years ago.
   Richard Michael Savage, 39, of Knoxville, Tenn., was convicted
April 6 on charges of soliciting a murder contract in the bombing
of Dana Free's Houston-area home. Free was not at home at the time
of the bombing.
   Savage, who offered no defense at trial, ran a ``gun for hire''
advertisement in Soldier of Fortune in 1985.
   A teminally ill Colorado widow pleaded guilty to paying Savage
$20,000 to kill Free, her former business partner. Alice V. Brado,
who later died in prison, said Free bilked her out of her life
savings of $300,000.
   U.S. District Judge James DeAnda sentenced Savage on Monday.
   ``I think that he deserved to get the maximum in this type of
case,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Cobe.
   Savage already is serving a 40-year term in federal prison for
arranging the beating death of the former assistant city manager of

<HEAD>Reagan News Conference At A Glance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are highlights from President
Reagan's news conference following his summit talks with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>EMIGRATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Avoiding any direct criticism of Gorbachev, the president said
Soviet emigration barriers may arise from the Kremlin's being
``bound in by bureaucracy'' rather than a willful Soviet policy of
preventing Jews from leaving the country. He said Gorbachev has
been cooperative when injustices were brought to his attention.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>ARMS CONTROL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Reagan held out hope for agreement before he leaves office next
January on a treaty reducing U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range
strategic nuclear weapons by 50 percent. But the president said
he'd refuse to give negotiators in Geneva any deadlines because
``that is not the way to get a good treaty.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>SUMMIT MEETING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The president refused to commit himself to a fifth summit
meeting with Gorbachev, but did not rule out the possibility that
it might be held, even if a weapons treaty is not ready for
signing. ``Something else may come up,'' he said. ``No one can say,
`No, there will be no need for another summit'.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>US-SOVIET TIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan said his personal relationship with Gorbachev ``continued
to deepen and improve'' and their fundamental differences
``continue to recede.'' Nonetheless, he said, ``I am never going to
relax my belief in the need for verification of agreements that we
might make.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>EVIL EMPIRE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The president said his disavowal of an earlier reference to the
Soviet Union as an ``evil empire'' resulted from changes instituted
by Gorbachev. He said he'd read Gorbachev's book, ``Perestroika,''
about economic reforms and ``I found much in it that I agree with.''

<HEAD>St. Louis Hospital First To Have Remote Heart Attack Treatment
Device</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital here is testing a new briefcase-size
device that allows doctors to save some heart attack victims no
matter where they are by activating a life-saving jolt of
electricity via a telephone hookup.
   Jewish Hospital will use the portable MDphone transtelephonic
defibrillator on a trial basis for nine months to a year, hospital
officials said Tuesday.
   The electronic device could free certain patients from long
hospital stays, said Dr. Rodolphe Ruffy, director of arrhythmia
services at the hospital.
   The MDphone allows heart patients to stay at home while
retaining immediate access to the treatment base station at the
hospital, he said.
   When a patient or another person opens the unit, which can be
plugged into a standard phone jack, the hospital base station's
phone number is automatically dialed and medical personnel can give
directions over the phone.
   Upon application of adhesive electrode pads to the patient's
chest, doctors at the hospital can monitor the patient's
electrocardiogram on a computer screen at the base station. The
patient's history can also be called up.
   The doctor then can, if necessary, activate the defibrillator to
try to restore a normal heart beat by administering an electric
shock, Ruffy said.
   ``The MDphone is the first interactive medical system capable of
treating life-threatening arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) by
telephone,'' said S. Eric Wachtel, president of MEDphone Corp. of
Paramus, N.J., which developed the device.
   ``If treatment is not administered within four to six minutes
after the onset of fibrillation, brain damage is likely to occur,''
he said. ``Our tests have proven that the MDphone makes it possible
for patients to be diagnosed and defibrillated at the scene of the
emergency within two minutes of the onset of symptoms, considerably
faster than ambulance response time.''
   Ruffy said the agreement with MEDphone Corp. calls for a fully
operational 24-hour emergency response system at Jewish Hospital
within about a month. He said the hospital would then begin to
recruit candidates for the service.
   Ruffy said that eventually a network of hospitals would have the
system and that any of them could treat a patient.
   MDphone already has been tested on about 100 patients at various
hospitals and has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, Ruffy said.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan
today announced an international conference to help establish a
global system to verify nuclear weapons tests.
   In his speech to the General Assembly's special session on
disarmament, Takeshita said Japan, the only nation that has had
atomic weapons used against it, would co-sponsor the conference
with the United Nations. The meeting in Tokyo would aim to exchange
seismological information used to detect nuclear tests, he said.
   ``Japan experienced unspeakable horrors as a result of the
atomic bombs that were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki,'' he told delegates. ``The Japanese people solemnly pray
that nuclear weapons will ultimately be eliminated so that a
nuclear holocaust can never be repeated.''
   Takeshita did not disclose the date of the planned conference in
Tokyo.

   On Tuesday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said the
United Nations can help the world disarm by monitoring and
verifying arms control agreements between the superpowers and other
countries.
   The U.N. leader said that the international body could make a
``significant contribution'' to disarmament pacts ``in ways
agreeable to the parties concerned.''
   Speaking at the opening of the special session, Perez de Cuellar
said U.N. military observers and peacekeepers could help monitor
and verify arms agreements.
   He said world military spending totals about $1 trillion a year,
while the annual U.N. budget is only about $721 million _ and about
$700 million is outstanding in unpaid contributions by member
states.
   The United States owes more than $200 million _ withheld because
of U.S. fiscal constraints and disagreements with United Nations
policies.
   The four-week disarmament session moved into high gear today.
Takeshita was among about 25 heads of state and government slated
to address the 159-member body during the session.
   Many members, such as Iran and Iraq, Israel and its Arab
neighbors, Greece and Turkey, India and Pakistan are feuding or
engaged in regional arms races.
   Speakers will include Takeshita and President Raul Alfonsin of
Argentina today and, in the course of debate, Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi of India, President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan, Afghan
leader Najib and others.
   The current assembly is the third special session on disarmament
in 10 years and diplomats say numerous issues separate the United
States and its allies from the Soviet Union, socialist countries
and the developing world.
   No breakthroughs are expected and many diplomats are seeking to
avoid confrontation and unproductive criticism of the United States.
   Differences between the superpowers include priorities for
nuclear and conventional disarmament, the urgency of a swift, total
and comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, the United States'
insistence on developing a space-based missile defense system, the
issue of diverting military spending to development and other
issues.
   Lynne M. Hansen, the assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, said that the United States will continue
testing nuclear weapons because ``the concept of deterrence
undergirds our security.''
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky condemned
the ongoing U.S. tests and Washington's concept of nuclear
deterrence ``not only because of (its lack of) practical usefulness
but because of the immoral nature of this kind of deterrence.''

   Continental Airlines says there's no doubt one
of its aircraft was endangered by a small plane flying in
restricted airspace, but a federal official says he has only the
co-pilot's word as evidence.
   According to the airline, the close call occurred Monday at
about 7,000 feet and five miles southeast of Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport, the destination of Flight 283 from Boston.
The DC-9 was carrying 79 people.
   The co-pilot told Continental officials he had finished making
some notes, looked up and saw a small aircraft ``coming right at
us,'' said airline spokesman Bruce E. Hicks.
   The pilot swerved to avoid the plane. A flight attendant hurled
to the floor suffered bruises.
   Hicks said the co-pilot, whom he refused to identify, described
the small plane as a Piper Aztec or Seminole.
   ``The first officer (co-pilot), the captain, vice president of
flight operations and president (of Continental) are all
dumbfounded that there is apparently a question as to the details
of the incident,'' Hicks said Tuesday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board are investigating the airline's report,
but an FAA official said, ``We can't even confirm there were two
planes.''
   Dennis Ragle, air traffic control manager for the FAA at
Hopkins, said, ``There is no tangible evidence there was another
plane, other than what the (co-pilot) said. The only thing we
really have is that a Continental co-pilot said there was a plane.''
   Ragle said that four air traffic controllers were unable to spot
the second plane on radar after the report. He said radar was
effective at that altitude and that ``it is not really explainable
that we don't see the target (the second plane).''
   ``If there was another airplane, it would have been in violation
of several federal aviation regulations,'' he said.
   A Continental spokesman, Ned Walker, said small planes could be
missed by radar if they are not using transponders, which give
radar observers specific information.

   Republican Robert McMillan, a lawyer who
lost his only other bid for elective office 24 years ago, today
officially opened his campaign to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
   McMillan, 55, emerged only after several prominent Republicans,
including U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and Ronald Lauder, former
U.S. ambassador to Austria, refused to challenge the popular
two-term senator.
   ``I have been blessed with a wonderful and loving family; I live
in a beautiful home, and I have been successful in business,''
McMillan said in a statement. ``Now it is time to pay back the
American system that has been so good to me.''
   McMillan conceded that he faces an ``uphill battle'' against
Moynihan, but said he has ``one thing in my favor, the issues.''
   ``For too long, the Democratic senator from New York has chosen
to ignore the problems that confront the average family in this
state,'' he said.
   McMillan pledged to make acid rain, day care for working
families, garbage disposal and an anti-drug campaign among his top
domestic policy interests. In foreign affairs, McMillan said that
he would stand behind Israel and that the United States should
battle communism by improving the economies of developing nations.
   McMillan is an attorney in a Garden City, N.Y., firm. His only
previous attempt at elective office came in 1964, when he was
easily defeated in a special election for a New York City Council
seat.
   McMillan will be trying to overcome statewide obscurity much in
the same way fellow Republican Alfonse D'Amato did when the former
Hempstead town supervisor captured New York's other senatorial seat
in 1980.
   D'Amato's victory was among the few bright spots in more than a
decade of often lopsided defeats for Republicans seeking statewide
office in New York, where registered Democrats outnumber
Republicans by about 1 million.
   Many times, Republicans have had trouble just finding candidates.

<HEAD>U.S. General Says Iran Building New Silkworm Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS CORONADO IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran is about
to complete a major new Silkworm missile complex in the Strait of
Hormuz, the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East said
today.
   Iran, despite recent losses in a sea battle with the U.S. Navy,
is ``not out of the game,'' said Gen. George B. Crist, chief of the
U.S. Central Command, which has administrative responsibility for
the region.
   The Iranians have been ``very circumspect and careful,'' Crist
said, ``but I don't get any feeling that the Iranians have run up a
white flag or that sort of thing ... I would not say they have
given up their thoughts about trying to get to us.''
   Crist said a major Silkworm missile complex was under
construction at Kuhestak, overlooking the central part of the
Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf. Silkworms fired
from there with a range of 50-60 miles would ``cover the entire
strait,'' he said.
   The four-star Marine general spoke to members of a Pentagon news
media pool aboard the Coronado, the navy's flagship in the gulf.
   He said the super-sophisticated ``Aegis'' missile cruiser
Vincennes, which arrived in the gulf during last week, was deployed
partly because of the new Silkworm facility.
   The 9,400-ton ship's long-range air surveillance and weapons
systems represents ``a quantum leap forward in our ability to
handle that threat,'' Crist said.
   The Kuhestak missile site is a fixed installation as opposed to
the mobile launcher used by Iran in the past. It could be
operational by late summer, he said.
   Iran was suspected of having mobile Silkworm sites in the Faw
Peninsula in the northern gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Crist's
comments indicated more missiles could be positioned at the new
site.
   The Silkworm is a Chinese version of the 30-year-old Soviet Styx
missile. Subsonic and crude by modern standards, it nevertheless
can be devastating to ships.
   On April 18, U.S. forces destroyed two Iranian offshore
platforms, sank a patrol boat and crippled two frigates in a series
of gulf battles.

   Officials said no charges will be
filed in a Memorial Day boating accident in which seven people died.
   Yalobush County Coroner Stanley True said Tuesday the sheriff's
office found no foul play in the drowning of six young women and
the man who tried to rescue them. The coroner ruled the deaths
accidental.
   Robert Armstrong, who was operating the 16-foot flat-bottomed
fishing boat Monday, acknowledged the boat was overloaded. He said
the boat's occupants were on a slow ``joy ride,'' splashing each
other when the vessel capsized.
   Armstrong swam to shore. Another occupant of the boat clung to
the boat and was rescued by a fisherman.
   Witnesses told the Sheriff's Department the boat was about 30
yards from the shore of the 25-acre lake when the accident
occurred. The bodies were recovered in eight to 10 feet of water.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: a treaty. ...</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I feel that we have now approached a situation where we should
note that here too, insofar as the hot trouble spots (on the)
planet are concerned, real possibilities have appeared for solving
these regional problems, for untying _ unraveling these knots _
these tight knots on the basis of political approaches, on the
basis of a balance of interests.
   In substance, we have noted today that first there is
Afghanistan, then secondly there is the processes concerning the
Middle East. There is some joining closer together of positions and
a maturing of understanding that there is a need to resolve the
problem on the basis of an international conference. ...
   Then there is the problem of Campuchia, thanks to the
initiatives taken by Viet Nam and Campuchia of late. That problem
too is now becoming one which can be _ which does lend itself to
solutions very soon. There are processes under way in Latin-Central
America, in southern Africa, solutions are possible. ...
   I have always emphasized and I emphasize this in my
conversations with the president, as with all other Americans, we
should not _ we must not lose our chance. And in this connection, I
said outright to the president that the signing of the agreement on
Afghanistan is a precedent which goes far beyond the limits of that
problem alone, because it is the first case, first example, where
the United States and the Soviet Union, together with those
directly involved in the conflict, signed an agreement which opens
up an avenue for a political solution of that problem. ...
   In questions concerning human rights, humanitarian issues, there
has been some progress in this sense. I posed the question in my
talks with the president. I said there are facts relating to this
sphere, individual cases, which do appear. We've always been giving
attentive consideration to them, and we shall continue to do so.
... The more I think over this situation, the more I come to the
conclusion that I can see that the American administration does not
have a real understanding of the real situation insofar as human
rights are concerned. They just don't know about the processes in
the sphere of democracy and democratization in this country. ...
   So I suggested to the president, let's organize, within the
framework of inter-parliamentary exchange, a permanent seminar
which would gather together members of our parliaments,
representatives of political circles, public circles, and they
should then exchange information and assessments. ...
   The president _ somebody asked the president whether he still
considered the Soviet Union to be an ``evil empire.'' He said no,
and he said that within the walls of the Kremlin, next to the
czar's gun, right in the heart of that ``evil empire.'' We take
note of that. As the ancient Greeks say, everything flows,
everything changes. Everything is in a state of flux. ...
   Today, when we were able to see that you cannot resolve any of
the world's problems through military means _ where we came more
and more to the conclusion that they have to be resolved
politically, by political means on the basis of a balance of
interest, on the basis of respect for the social choice. And
whether we want to or not, we must all learn to live in peace in
this real world of ours. ...
   And proceeding ... from the fact that there is an understanding
_ in fact, that there are lessons which we have drawn from the
events in the past years, we suggested, let us then make a
statement to that effect _ a joint statement to that effect. Here
is the draft that I suggested to the president:
   ``Both of us proceeding from an awareness of the obtaining
realities in the present day world believe that no problems in
dispute are insoluble and that they should not be resolved by
military means, that peaceful co-existence is something that we
resolve as a universal principle of international relations, and
that the equality of all states, non-interference in domestic
affairs, and freedom of socio-political choice should be recognized
as inalienable and mandatory for all.''
   I gave the president both the Russian and English text. He read
it and he said, ``I like it.'' But when today we met in order to
finalize the text of the joint statement it turned out that not
everybody likes it among those who surround the president, that
kind of a statement. And that's what we were debating this morning.
...
   We were not able either to agree on the subject of talks on
conventional arms in Europe. ...
   Now I'm thinking, there's so much talk that we should not move
forward to 50 percent cuts in strategic arms unless we address
ourselves to reductions in conventional arms and armaments in
Europe. But as soon as we try to suggest some _ make some real
proposals, in order to get that process under way, we immediately
come up against some kind of incomprehensible maneuvers and
attempts to deviate from that _ from the issue. When everybody
voiced concern over the fact that the Warsaw Treaty supposedly has
a preponderance, we said, ``OK, let's exchange data, let's exchange
data.'' The other side immediately tried to dodge the issue. ...
   The Americans did not accept our bold plan, three-phase plan for
eliminating asymmetry and disbalances in Europe aimed at building a
structure of non-offensive arms and armed forces, with a
considerably lower level of arms. We feel that we've missed a good
chance to impart some good dynamics, both to relations between the
two most powerful military groups, and thereby to promote
international security as a whole. ...

   A former New Jersey legislator who said he
was trying to save his clothing business has been placed on three
years' probation for paying $17,300 in bribes to secure $7.2
million in federal contracts.
   Joseph Chinnici, who served 16 years as a legislator before
retiring in January, also was ordered by U.S. District Judge Thomas
O'Neill Jr. on Tuesday to perform 300 hours of community service.
   Chinnici, 68, pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy and making
false statements.
   His Major Coat Co. of Bridgeton, N.J., which also had pleaded
guilty, received contracts worth more than $75 million from the
Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia.
   More than two dozen individuals and companies already have
pleaded guilty to involvement in the conspiracy at the center,
which supplies clothes and other items to U.S. military personnel
throughout the world.
   ``In my heart, I know that everything I have done was done to
save my business and the jobs of the many people it employs,''
Chinnici said in a statement issued after his sentencing.
   He could have received up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000
fine. He and his company have paid more than $400,000 in
restitution.
   O'Neill ignored the request of Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee
Dobkin that Chinnici be sent to jail as a deterrent to others.
   The judge cited Chinnici's public service record and said his
disgrace, the burden on his family and the virtual destruction of
his business were punishment enough.

   With George Bush looking on, a
Republican member of a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission said
today the panel would not be swayed from doing its job by Bush's
declaration that he would oppose any tax increase.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., said he thought such comments were
premature.
   Frenzel, who is here at Bush's vacation retreat for the second
of two days of talks on economic issues, told reporters, ``We are
not going to get involved in any presidential campaigns.''
   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee, said
Tuesday that he would ignore what he said was a likely
recommendation from the National Economic Commission for a tax
increase to reduce the budget deficit.
   During a picture-taking session today on the porch of the vice
president's seaside home, Frenzel was asked if he felt Bush's
remarks would inhibit his own work on the commission.
   ``I took an oath to work on the commission and to do it well,''
Frenzel said.
   At that point, Bush interrupted, saying, ``I hope the commission
will listen a little bit to the American people in this election. I
think that's what an election is all about. The commission can take
an objective look at (taxes) and do whatever it wants. But I'd be
more persuaded by what Americans say.''
   Former deputy Treasury secretary Richard Darman, one of a
half-dozen private economists here for the talks, said taxes were
``off the table and nobody has raised it yet.''
   Bush was asked to comment on Democratic charges that his call
for closing the budget deficit with a modified freeze on spending
and with no new taxes was not realistic.
   Bush said: ``It is not surprising the Democrats would say that.
All they want to do is spend and tax. There is no change I can see
or hear out on the campaign that would lead you to believe anything
other than that on the Democratic side.''
   One day earlier, Bush, who touts himself as a would-be
``education president,'' said local taxes may have to go up if his
call for better schools is heeded.
   ``They may have to,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``Ninety-three percent
of the money for education comes from sources other than the
federal government. If it's taxes, that's where it has to be.''
   Bush's comments came as he repeated his oft-stated opposition to
a federal tax increase.
   ``I've pledged no tax increase and I'm going to stay with it,
period,'' Bush said.
   The vice president, speaking after meeting with a group of
private economists, also cautioned the Federal Reserve Board
against clamping down too tightly on credit in the name of fighting
inflation.
   ``I'm not hypercritical of the Fed, but I don't want to see
action taken that's going to shut down economic growth in this
country,'' Bush said.
   The deficit-reduction panel, formed earlier this year, plans to
submit its recommendations to Congress on Dec. 21. In addition to
members appointed by the Reagan administration and by both parties
in Congress, the panel will have two members named by whoever wins
the election in November.
   ``It seems to me that the commission might well come up with a
tax increase. And I'll be saying, `Wait a minute. I've taken my
case to the American people to hold the line on taxes.'''
   Bush has proposed eliminating the budget deficit with what he
calls a ``flexible freeze'' on spending. All programs, except
Social Security benefits, would be held at 1989 levels plus
inflation. Increases in one area would have to be offset by
decreases in another.
   The vice president holds a second day of talks today with the
same group of economic advisers. Among them is Martin S. Feldstein,
a Harvard economist who quit his job as President Reagan's chief
economist in 1985 when his advocacy of a tax increase to reduce the
budget deficit ran afoul of the administration's stance against
general tax increases.
   Bush said that during his meeting Tuesday with the economic
advisers, ``there was an expression of hoping that Fed policy would
not be too tight.''
   ``I think watching for signs of inflation is fine,'' Bush said.
``But as a word of caution, I wouldn't want to see them step over
some boundary that would ratchet down, tighten down, the economic
growth.''
   The nation is in its 65th month of economic expansion, a
peacetime record. An economic downturn before the election could
spell big troubles for Republicans' election prospects, most
economic and political consultants agree.
   The Bush campaign has been having some economic problems of its
own lately _ a shortage of cash.
   Two months ago, Bush aides reported that they only had $4
million left to spend before the Republican convention. Aide Robert
Teeter said Tuesday that the amount has now dwindled to just under
$1.5 million.
   The vice president said over the weekend that the squeeze may
mean some curtailing of campaign travel in the weeks ahead.
   The Bush campaign has had no trouble raising money, but it is
close to bumping up against the pre-convention federal spending
limit of $27 million.
   The campaign has raised $29.5 million, of which about $2.5 is
not subject to the ceiling.

   An Italian journalist jailed in Afghanistan has been
pardoned and will be released shortly, the Foreign Ministry
announced today.
   President Najib of Afghanistan assured an Italian envoy at a
Kabul meeting today that he signed a decree to pardon Fausto
Biloslavo, the ministry said, adding that the journalist is
expected to be freed by Thursday.
   Biloslavo, who worked for the tiny Albatross news agency, was
captured last year after entering Afghanistan from Pakistan with
Moslem guerrillas. He was convicted in March of espionage and
sentenced to seven years in prison.
   There have been conflicting reports on when he entered
Afghanistan and the date of his arrest. Earlier reports from
Afghanistan said he was detained in July, but his news agency and
the Foreign Ministry said today he was captured in mid-November.
   Biloslavo had shared a jail cell with French photojournalist
Alain Guillo, who was freed last Saturday after nine months
imprisonment in Afghanistan.
   The Italian envoy, Bruno Bottai, secretary general of the
Foreign Ministry, went to Afghanistan with a message from Italian
President Francesco Cossiga asking Biloslavo's release on
humanitarian grounds, the ministry said.

   Lewiston (Maine) Journal on the commercialization of Memorial
Day:
   For too many others, the meaning of Memorial Day has been lost
in the shuffle of commercial interests.
   For them, the day means little more than time off from school or
work. It means officially opening up the cottage on the lake and
having a picnic. It means a Memorial Day sale at the department
store. ...
   Congress, while admittedly responding to the call of many
citizens, didn't help preserve the day's meaning by deciding in
1971 to change the observance of Memorial Day from May 30 ... to
the last Monday of the month in order to give the citizenry a
three-day weekend. ...
   The call to war may be the most dreaded anyone can face. But
these men and women were there when their country needed them the
most.
   They served in the interest of forging our freedom in the
Revolutionary War, or preserving it in subsequent wars.
   For this, their memory must never be forsaken.

   Intelligencer Journal, Lancaster, Pa., on the summit:
   Little of substance is promised in the summit between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but it is guaranteed to
be historic.
   Not since ... the days of detente has the future between the two
superpowers so brimmed with hope.
   The future appears bright for a number of reasons, beginning
with the fact that the United States and Soviet Union are speaking
to, rather than at, each other. Glasnost and perestroika have
dulled the edge of speeches about an evil empire.
   Increased dialogue has inevitably led to better understanding.
The three previous summits have shown that as leaders from the two
superpowers get to know each other, their actions and responses are
more predictable and stable.
   So the headline value of this summit may be nil. But in terms of
the future, it may lay a solid foundation for further negotiations,
which could lead to a notable cutback in nuclear weapons.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on the GOP presidential campaign
strategy:
   If a widely circulated letter is any indication, Republican
strategy for the 1988 presidential race is heading straight for the
gutter.
   The letter, written by James Jatras of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee, concerns Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democrats' likely nominee.
   Dukakis isn't attacked for his views of foreign affairs or the
economy. Instead, the letter smears Dukakis for his standing with
the Greek Orthodox Church, branding him an ``apostate.''
   The Jatras letter accuses the governor of being soft on
communism and violating Orthodox teaching because he supports the
right to abortion. But the chief reason Dukakis is not a
communicant of the church, Jatras points out, is his marriage to a
Jew.
   This sort of attack is beneath contempt. ...
   Attacking a candidate's standing with his church has no place in
presidential politics. It's time Republicans learned that.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on President Reagan's veto of the
trade bill:
   As it's written, the (trade) measure is too protectionist.
   Perhaps its worst effect would be to reduce the president's
discretion in trade policy, possibly forcing him to impose
sanctions on trading partners.
   Surely the United States can conduct business to its advantage
without risking trade wars.
   It's probably too late to work up a more palatable version of
the bill before the Congress adjourns Oct. 8.
   Passing a trade bill, if that happens, will probably be the work
of a new Congress and a new president.

   The Phoenix (Ariz.) Gazette on teachers:
   You have tolerated incompetent or unpleasant colleagues,
well-meaning principals, a few ungrateful parents and unresponsive
school board members.
   You heard you were paid too much, for doing too little. You
heard you were America's last hope for greatness.
   The time has come to take down the posters and the charts.
   You can breathe in thoughts of a few days' rest before summer
school. You lightly dwell on private promises to strengthen ties
with a husband, daughter or son, always in place while you taught,
but somehow not quite close enough.
   So the year is over, teacher. You can close the classroom door.
It was a job well done.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on air safety:
   Now it's cracks in some airliners.
   How many more reports of deficiencies in the planes the public
depends on for transportation can be issued before public
confidence in the safety of American air transportation is entirely
gone?
   In the past decade, confidence in air travel has been flagging
to the point where some travelers refuse to book seats on certain
kinds of planes.
   Certainly after the Aloha Airlines problem, the ``elderly'' 737
will join those ranks.
   Maybe it's like putting a finger in a dike, but surely stricter
inspection practices should be put in force and tests be conducted
to determine just how old an airliner can be before it is retired.

   Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch on New Jersey's takeover of the
Jersey City public schools because of ``managerial bankruptcy'':
   The underlying cause of Jersey City's education impoverishment?
In a word: politics. ...
   The victims of the politicization of Jersey City's schools are,
of course, the children, 85 percent of them black or Hispanic. Only
one in four of them is able to pass a basic proficiency
examination, compared with 80 percent of students throughout the
state.
   It is no wonder that little learning occurs in a system so
heavily infected by boss politics.
   Under the reform law championed by Republican Gov. Thomas H.
Kean, the state will have five years to set the system aright,
assuming that its takeover survives legal challenge in the first
place.
   How much the state can accomplish is debatable, but if it at
least can free local education management from the paralyzing grip
of local cronyism, it will have helped.

   Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Israel and peace in the Middle East:
   President Reagan hit the nail smack on the head when he made a
point of lauding Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres for backing
United States efforts to get Middle East peace negotiations going
again.
   If Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir felt the smack, good;
if he modifies his opposition to the peace plan because of the
smack, so much the better.
   Shamir has consistently spurned the plan, refusing to consider
any variant of the ``land for peace'' formula on which hope for a
settlement rests.
   A principled stance, perhaps _ but one lacking any sign of
reasoned flexibility. ...

   Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel on U.S. efforts to oust
Noriega:
   A clumsy political exercise has come to an embarrassing end.
There will be new episodes but, for now, Reagan administration
efforts to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega from power in Panama are over.
   One can only hope that the administration's Central American
strategists, if there are any, will use the respite to regroup and
try to formulate a coherent policy to deal with the man who has
outmaneuvered them at every turn.
   What began months ago with blustery assertions by White House
officials that Noriega was packing his bags turned into an
escalating series of rejected U.S. concessions and ended with the
intended deportee more firmly entrenched than ever. ...
   Small wonder that the kindest thing that diplomatic analysts
from other governments in Central America and Europe can say about
U.S. policy in Panama is that it has been inconsistent and
incompetent.

   The Brunswick (Ga.) News on House Speaker Jim Wright:
   The concern voiced over Speaker Jim Wright's alleged breaches of
House ethics rules is no mere teapot tempest, as he would have us
believe.
   Though some of his conservative opponents have been muttering
about this for some time, and would love to catch him out, the
dispute cannot be shrugged off as a political vendetta.
   Any such characterization went out the window when Common Cause,
which has a solid reputation for probity and often takes a liberal
stance on public questions, called for an ethics committee inquiry.
   Wright's sour claim that Common Cause was a ``handmaiden'' for
conservatives out to get him is not credible.
   The speakership is a powerful position. The person who occupies
it can do a lot for and against members of the House.
   But the ethics committee, if formally asked to investigate, will
have an overriding responsibility to do so. And if Wright is
blameless, an investigation reaching this conclusion would serve
his interests as well as those of the House and the electorate.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on drug abuse:
   Cocaine has lost is charm for affluent yuppies. That means drug
use is down, right?
   Wrong.
   What used to be the recreational drug of the rich has become a
highly dangerous street drug used by the unemployed poor. That's
not particularly startling news, but it could have an effect few
have considered.
   More and more of the wealthy are realizing the danger of cocaine
and have stopped using it as a ``party drug.''
   The message that cocaine is dangerous and addictive is getting
through to the middle class. But, that same message is not making
it to the inner city.
   Although it might not be as visible as it once was, cocaine ...
remains a big problem.
   Writing it off as a plague of the inner city poor will not make
it go away.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on plastic gun
legislation:
   The Senate Judiciary Committee took a reasonable, necessary and
courageous stand in unanimously approving legislation that would
ban plastic guns and any other firearms that elude metal detectors
and X-ray machines.
   There are some groups in this nation who are fearful that any
restriction on handguns, even those made of plastic, will somehow
abridge their rights to bear arms.
   Hunters, law-abiding target-shooters and responsible citizens
who arm themselves for their own defense hardly need to argue for
armor-piercing bullets or undetectable pistols.
   We hope that the willingness of congressional leaders to take a
stand ... despite threats of political retaliation at the polls,
will lead to a candid and courageous review of a whole series of
gun-control regulations.

   Chillicothe (Ohio) Gazette on President Reagan's veto of the

   President Reagan's veto of a major trade bill ... came as no

require companies to give employees 60 days' notice of plant
closings and large-scale layoffs.

had a voluntary plant closing provision.
   Wait. Let's get this straight.
   Corporations, which in the past have thrown workers on the
street with but a few hours of notice, endangering their lives,
their benefits and their futures, should change their ways because
Congress asks them to?
   Executives armed with golden parachutes have yet to pick up on
the basic immorality of sudden plant closings and the turmoil they
create. Will they do more than laugh at the toothless provision the

   The Buffalo (N.Y.) News on legalization of drugs:
   A recent poll listed drug addiction as the nation's most
important problem, and hardly a day goes by without news of
drug-related crime or the corrosive effects of drug abuse on our
society.
   Thus it comes as a shock to hear people actually proposing to
legalize heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
   The mayors of Washington, Baltimore and Minneapolis and several
congressmen declare that the war on drugs has failed and the United
States should consider legalizing drugs and treating addiction as a
health, not a crime, problem.
   Then addicts would not have to steal to get drugs, they argue,
and the drug traffic, with all its corrupting influences, would
fade away.
   There is a certain superficial appeal to this argument, which
cites the example of Prohibition and the crime connected with it.
But it is a desperate ``solution'' that only underlines how
desperate the drug problem is. ...
   The move to legalize drugs is a well-meaning but misdirected
effort.

   The Register of Orange County, Calif., on the economy:
   Seven months ago economic doomsayers said the Oct. 19 stock
market crash would plunge the nation into a recession, possibly a
depression. It didn't happen.
   Last week the government revised upward its figures for economic
growth for the first quarter of this year, to 3.9 percent.
   So now guess what the doomsayers are chirping? That the economy
is growing too fast, and that the growth will spark a new round of
inflation and interest hikes. ...
   Contrary to the doomsayers' predictions, we continue to enjoy
strong economic growth with low inflation because we continue to
make it easier for companies to produce goods. ...
   Unfortunately, we'll be lucky just to maintain the status quo.
   Protectionism (which induces distortions that actually hurt our
companies in the end) is in the air, next year will probably being
higher taxes no matter who is elected president ... and the Federal
Reserve, itself spooked by the doomsayers' inflation scare, has
begun tightening the money supply.
   This in turn, may dampen growth, and could even give us a
recession.
   When will Americans realize that government is the cause of our
economic problems, not their solution?

   Well, we aren't satisfied. After all, God and everyone else
knows that there are two types of cheese _ Wisconsin cheese, which
is the real stuff, and other cheese, which isn't.
   How did this happen? Where was the governor? The Legislature?
Why did no one notice that our heritage was being stolen?
   A cheese museum outside of Wisconsin? The shame of it!

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis said today that ``of
course'' rival candidate Jesse Jackson deserves consideration for
the No. 2 spot but added that he's not ready to make a choice with
the last batch of primaries coming up next Tuesday.
   Republican George Bush, meanwhile, looked on outside his Maine
summer home as a GOP member of a bipartisan deficit-reduction
commission said the panel would not be swayed from doing its job by
Bush's declaration that he would oppose any tax increase.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., said he thought such comments, which
Bush reiterated one day earlier, were premature.
   Bush retorted: ``I hope the commission will listen a little bit
to the American people in this election. I think that's what an
election is all about. The commission can take an objective look at
(taxes) and do whatever it wants. But I'd be more persuaded by what
Americans say.''
   Frenzel was among a group of economists and others meeting with
Bush Tuesday and today.
   Dukakis, in Boston, called for expanded college opportunities
for Americans and proposed a new national student loan program that
would rely on payroll deductions for repayment.
   After the speech, Dukakis said that ``of course'' Jackson
deserved consideration for the vice presidency, but he answered
with a blunt ``No'' when asked if Jackson deserved special
consideration because of his success during this year's primary
elections.
   ``He's somebody who's done a remarkable job, has great gifts and
great strengths,'' Dukakis said when asked if Jackson was qualified
for a spot on the ticket. ``I respect and admire him a lot.''
   Dukakis said he had not given any thought to picking a running
mate and would not do so until after the final primaries June 7.
   The biggest of those primaries will be in California, and both
Dukakis and Jackson were flying to that state late today for
final-weekend campaigning.
   Jackson, with virtually no chance of overtaking Dukakis in the
national delegate race, is focusing increasingly on the Democratic
National Convention in July and the clout he expects to wield there.
   ``I do not foresee confrontation,'' Jackson said Tuesday as he
campaigned in New Jersey. But he added that his supporters may take
their issues to the full convention if they feel slighted by party
platform writers.
   ``There's room to take one's case to the floor,'' Jackson said.
   He also said he has ``earned consideration'' for the No. 2 spot
on the ticket, although he won't say whether he's interested in it.
   Dukakis has been discouraging discussion of possible running
mates. ``I can tell you I have not spent two minutes of my time on
the subject,'' he told reporters after a Baltimore fund-raiser
Tuesday night.
   As for any claims Jackson might have, the front-runner said:
``He himself said he thought it was the nominee's responsibility to
pick a running mate, and I agree with that.''
   Jackson is continuing to fire up crowds, even as he tacitly
concedes that his presidential bid is all but finished.
   ``When our hope is alive, we push back mountains and remove
ceilings,'' he told a crowd at a shopping center in Willingboro,
N.J. on Tuesday night. ``On our way to the White House, there are
no more impossible dreams.''
   Jackson was campaigning in New Jersey this morning, then leaving
for California.
   Dukakis, for his part, was mapping out his post-primary
strategy. His aides are indicating he'll plunge directly into his
fall campaign after the final round of primaries on Tuesday in
California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   Those contests are expected to give the Massachusetts governor a
mathematical lock on the nomination. Rather than taking a
traditional pre-convention break, however, the Dukakis ampaign will
hit the road again.
   ``We want to spend a good part of June out there in America,
traveling, telling people who Mike Dukakis is and why he would be a
good president,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   The Massachusetts governor was spending most of today on state
business, then flying to California tonight for two days of
campaigning.
   Bush was still at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where
he has been holding strategy sessions since last week. On Tuesday
he met with economists, including Martin Feldstein, the former
chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.
   Bush said after the meeting that he would reject any call for a
federal tax hike, even if one is called for by a blue-ribbon
bipartisan commission now working on ways to bring down the
enormous federal deficit.
   ``I'll be saying, wait a minute, I've taken my case to the
American people to hold the line on taxes,'' the vice president
said. However, he said that in order to carry out his education
policies, local school taxes might have to be raised.

   A candidate for Sonoma County
supervisor whose handsome, square-jawed face appears smiling on
campaign posters has angered some women who claim he is using his
looks to win election.
   Tim Smith, 37, was the object of a demonstration Tuesday by
placard-carrying women protesting the ``glitzification'' of county
politics.
   ``He'd look better standing next to Vanna White than he does
running for office,'' said Bebek McGee, leader of the demonstration
downtown.
   She claims Smith spends too much money and time wooing female
voters between 18 and 35 with his glossy, lavishly illustrated
brochures showing the blond, blue-eyed candidate.
   ``You don't vote for someone because you think he's a hunk,''
McGee said.
   Smith, who was an aide to U.S. Rep. Doug Bosco, said he is
amused by the criticism. ``Whose picture was I supposed to put on
my signs?'' he asked.
   Neither of Smith's rivals in the non-partisan race is pictured
on campaign posters in the county, where issues such as sewage
treatment plans and building permits typically stir political
passions.
   The most recent polls show Smith running a close third in his
district behind Eric Anderson and Jack Healy, candidates shorter on
looks and money.
   Men tend to back Healy, 62, a Santa Rosa councilman more
development-oriented than his two rivals, according to the polls.

   Two armed men held up a bus carrying West
German tourists early Wednesday and made off with money, jewelry
and suitcases, police said.
   None of the 40 passengers was injured in the robbery at about 3
a.m. at a rest step along the A-9 highway between Nimes and Avignon
in southern France.
   Police said two armed men, their faces hidden with hoods,
boarded the bus and forced passengers to hand over their valuables.
They took off in a waiting car driven by an accomplice.
   The bus was coming from Spain and headed to several towns in
West Germany. It continued its trip several hours after the
robbery. Police said the passengers were frightened but unharmed.

   NATO said Wednesday it appointed U.S.
Adm. Frank B. Kelso II as Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic to
replace U.S. Adm. Lee Baggett Jr.
   Baggett is retiring from the Navy, the U.S. mission to NATO said.
   A statement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said its
Defense Planning Committee, meeting at alliance headquarters,
``agreed with great regret to release'' Baggett from his post at
President Reagan's request.
   The NATO panel said it also accepted Reagan's request that Kelso
be named as Baggett's replacement. The transfer of commands is to
take place this fall, NATO said.
   Kelso is commander-in-chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and
deputy commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command. Baggett was
appointed to his NATO position in September 1985.

<HEAD>Summit Jarred Soviet Bureaucrats Into Rare Efficiency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Is your air conditioning working? Would you like
to interview any Soviet officials? Do you need to rent a car? How
can I help?
   These are strange words, coming from Soviet managers who have
elevated the ways of bureaucracy to a high art and service
employees whose languor is renowned.
   But they were jarred into an unusual degree of efficiency and
solicitous good manners when President Reagan, hundreds of U.S.
government officials and nearly 5,000 journalists descended on the
Soviet capital.
   The effort at being gracious summit hosts has not been flawless,
but neither has it escaped the approving notice of foreign visitors
who have known Moscow in its more natural state.
   A stack of pre-printed applications sat on a desk at the Foreign
Ministry's press center in the International Hotel. Reporters
covering the summit could apply in writing for interviews with
anyone from human rights activists to arms control negotiators.
   Physicist Andrei D. Sakharov, a former human rights activist who
was released from internal exile in 1986, plans to hold a news
conference Friday at the Foreign Ministry's request, because of
numerous applications from visiting reporters.
   At the Rossiya Hotel, where many journalists are housed, cooks
produced plates of three fried eggs Tuesday for breakfast guests
who had grumbled a morning earlier when the dish was unavailable.
   Lettuce, unknown in the Soviet Union except for a pale, bitter
facsimile called ``salat,'' has been served at breakfast, lunch and
dinner.
   Waitresses who usually slouch in the shadows have been scurrying
about with fresh linen napkins. Fire prevention workers patrol the
halls of the Rossiya, which sleeps 5,500 guests.
   Moscow's ubiquitous police who ordinarily arrest offenders with
a wave of their white-striped batons have settled for shrugs and
tolerant smiles this week when confused American motorists make
illegal turns.
   ``Is everything working to your satisfaction?'' a manager at the
International Hotel inquired during his inspection of a room that
had rented as summit office space.
   ``It's warm in here,'' he said. ``Is the air conditioning
working?''
   Soviet political commentators and social scientists have milled
around the press center, giving and taking interviews and
volunteering occasionally to serve as interpreters.
   The official news agency Tass went into full gear for its summit
coverage.
   It published a stream of background articles, from the history
of St. Catherine's Hall to the menu for Gorbachev's state dinner in
Reagan's honor Monday night. Ordinarily, information about the
heavily guarded Kremlin or the Gorbachevs' socializing is treated
like state secrets.
   The city, which was spruced up for the summit, has been
unusually well maintained and operating smoothly this week. But all
bets are off once Reagan leaves Thursday to return home.
   The tenacious bureaucracy bends now and then, but it has never
been known to break. Some state services have continued steadfastly
in their old, inefficient ways of doing things.
   Intourist, the monopoly state travel agency, urged those
traveling to Moscow for the summit to hire interpreters and
chauffeur-driven cars. Payment was required in advance, denying
customers the chance to reduce or withhold payment for
unsatisfactory service.

   A strong earthquake jolted the
Moluccas islands and Timor island in Indonesia but caused no
injuries or damage, officials said Wednesday.
   The earthquake on Tuesday was centered deep below the ocean away
from populated areas, said Ibnu Purwono of the Geophysical Agency
in Jakarta.
   The temblor disrupted electricity in the suburbs of Darwin in
northern Australia but caused no serious damage or injuries there
either.
   Purwono said the earthquake was centered in the Banda Sea 320
miles south of Ambon and 1,750 miles east of Jakarta.
   He said the earthquake measured 6.2 on the Richter scale.
   The scale is a guage of the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 6 on the scale can cause severe damage.

   The Ariane 4 rocket, expected to become Europe's
workhorse for commercial launches, will be launched for the first
time on June 10, authorities announced Wednesday.
   The trial launch without payload is intended to demonstrate the
rocket's readiness for operational flights starting in late 1988,
said a joint statement by the European Space Agency and
Arianespace, the agency's commercial arm.
   The rocket will be launched from the agency's base in Kourou,
French Guiana.
   Ariane 4 is the most powerful of the Ariane series of European
launchers. Technicians can vary the number of solid or liquid fuel
booster rockets and adapt the upper portion of the launcher
according to the payload.
   Arianespace plans to build and launch 70 Ariane 4s.

<HEAD>Court Says Deification of Slain Soldier Was Constitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's armed forces did not violate the
Constitution when a slain soldier was made a Shinto god against the
wishes of his Christian widow, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
   Yasuko Nakaya lost a 15-year battle when the nation's highest
court reversed lower court decisions upholding her complaint. She
said the Self Defense Forces had violated her constitutional
freedom of religion by deifying her husband at a Shinto shrine.
   Her husband, 1st Lt. Takafumi Nakaya, was killed in a traffic
accident while serving in the Ground Self Defense Forces in January
1968. Mrs. Nakaya, then 34 and a member of the United Church of
Christ in Japan, laid her husband's ashes to rest at Shinai Church
in Yamaguchi. He was not a Christian.
   Four years after his death, Nakaya was enshrined and deified.
His widow filed her suit the next year, in 1973.
   In her legal action, the first individual lawsuit contesting the
government on an issue involving religion, Mrs. Nakaya also sought
$8,000 in compensation from the government for her mental anguish.
   ``I have long suspected that the Supreme Court was an
institution obsequious to the powerful. Today, I'm sorry to see
that the court is,'' Mrs. Nakaya told reporters after the decision.
   Takako Doi, leader of the major opposition Japan Socialist
Party, told the same news conference: ``I would call the ruling a
compromise by the guardian of the constitution made in favor of the
government's way of thinking.
   ``I feel like we're being driven back to the past,'' Mrs. Doi
said.
   Mrs. Nakaya has said she filed the suit to challenge the
possible revival of the militarism that revolved around Japan's
traditional Shintoism before and during World War II.
   Before 1945, soldiers killed in action or while on duty were
automatically given the status of gods and their names were
inscribed in Shinto shrines.
   The practice was discontinued under the new constitution, which
guarantees freedom of religion and was written under U.S. guidance
after Japan's defeat. But soldiers killed on duty are sometimes
enshrined at the request of the association of retired Self Defense
Forces members, called ``taiyukai.''
   In its 14-1 vote Wednesday, the Supreme Court said the armed
forces were not directly involved in the case of Lt. Nakaya and
that the ``taiyukai'' had him enshrined. The lower courts had ruled
that the armed forces had a direct role in the enshrinement.
   Shintoism is said to have emerged at the dawn of Japanese
history and crystalized as a religious system during the Nara
period in the eighth century.
   As the state religion before 1945, it stressed the divinity of
the emperor and the worship of nature, ancestors and ancient
heroes. The military used Shinto shrines and ceremonies to promote
nationalism among the Japanese.
   The Rev. Mototsugu Ogata, chief guardian of the Gokoku Shrine in
Yamaguchi, said in a telephone interview, ``Lt. Nakaya is one of a
total of 52,099 enshrined in a big, tall sacred mirror at this
shrine ... established in 1941. They are mostly those killed in
World War II.''
   Like the others, Nakaya's name has been written in a sacred list
as ``mikoto Takafumi Nakaya,'' said the Shinto priest. ``Mikoto''
is the Shinto term for god or deity.
   The religion respects several types of deities, including
ancestral gods, gods revered for virtues, gods revered for their
works and gods whose wrath is to be feared.
   Shintoism, a religion of ceremony rather than dogma, coexists in
Japan with Buddhism, the other major religion. The exact number of
adherents is not known, and many Japanese practice both religions.
There are also about 1 million Christians among the 122 million
Japanese.

<HEAD>Police Say Rapists and Killers Among Rebels Seeking Amnesty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapists, killers and robbers were among
113 rebels who surrendered under an amnesty that guarantees
immunity from prosecution, police said Wednesday.
   Officials said the amnesty was a success and they believe
virtually all the rebels turned themselves in by the deadline at
midnight Tuesday.
   ``I cannot think of any dissidents still remaining in the
bush,'' Wednesday's Harare Herald newspaper quoted Home Minister
Moven Mahachi as saying.
   Mahachi said intelligence estimates were that 100 to 120 rebels
were at large before President Robert Mugabe announced the amnesty
April 19.
   Among those granted amnesty is Morgan Sango, who was Zimbabwe's
most wanted man and called himself Gayigusu _ ``Grind the Bush'' in
the Ndebele language.
   Sango, in his 30s, fought as a guerrilla in the seven-year war
that transformed the white-governed British colony of Rhodesia into
black-governed Zimbabwe on April 18, 1980.
   He deserted from the army in 1982 after Joshua Nkomo, the former
opposition leader, was fired from a coalition government for
allegedly plotting a coup against Mugabe.
   Most of the rebels were loyal to Nkomo's Zimbabwe African
People's Union (Patriotic Front), whose power base is the minority
Ndebele tribe. Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front) is strongest in his dominant Shona tribe.
   As a dissident gang leader roaming the rolling bush country of
Matabeleland province in western Zimbabwe, the Ndebele homeland,
Sango was blamed for a wave of murder, robbery and rape.
   He is alleged to have led the gang that axed 16 white
missionaries and family members to death six months ago, including
five children and five women, on two Pentecostal communal farms
near Bulawayo, the Matabeleland provincial capital.
   Like the others who surrendered under the amnesty, Sango is
immune from prosecution that almost certainly would have cost him
his life. The government has promised a rehabilitation program to
ease them bak into society.
   Mugabe offered the amnesty, the first since independence, after
he and Nkomo signed an agreement Dec. 23 to merge their political
parties.
   An amnesty Britain offered under a cease-fire before
independence was accepted by about 50,000 guerrillas loyal to
either Nkomo and Mugabe, some of whom were among the 113 who turned
themselves in this time.
   ``Smelling Blood'' Mavovonka led the last gang of 12 men to
surrender hours before the deadline. He told reporters in the Nkayi
district of northern Matabeleland:
   ``We went out to the bush because of misunderstandings. Our
leaders have now seen that what they were doing was wrong and they
have corrected their mistakes. That's why we are here.''
   Mahachi, the home minister, said last week the amnesty would not
be extended and rebels refusing it would be hunted down and killed.
   ``I am sure the amnesty is 100 percent successful,'' he said
Tuesday. ``There may be one or two or three still outstanding. The
problem is that we were not certain of the total number, but the
number which we have received is about what we expected it to be.''

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes In Lebanon On Anniversary of Karami's
Assassination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in Moslem west Beirut
on Wednesday on the first anniversary of Prime Minister Rashid
Karami's assassination. Police said there were no casualties.
   The car bombing, the first in west Beirut this year, was
reported at 8:20 a.m. in the Bir Hassan district during a strike to
mark Karami's assassination. A police spokesman said the stolen
white Mercedes-Benz was loaded with 44 pounds of TNT.
   ``The explosion shattered glass in the area but no casualties
were reported, apparently because the streets were empty because of
the strike,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity according to regulations.
   Banks, schools, shops, government offices, gas stations and
other businesses closed in west Beirut and other Moslem cities in
accordance with the strike call.
   Karami, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem politician, was 65 when he
was killed June 1, 1987 by a bomb explosion aboard a Lebanese army
helicopter that was flying him from north Lebanon to Beirut.
   Pro-Syrian Moslem leaders have accused Israel and the Lebanese
Forces alliance of rightist Christian militias of assassinating
Karami.
   The Jewish state and the command of the Christian militia denied
involvement. An official investigation has issued no finding.
   The explosion on Wednesday was the third car bombing in Lebanon
this year. On April 23, Karami's hometown of Tripoli was rocked by
a powerful car bomb explosion that killed 69 people and wounded 111.
   A blue Volvo car rigged with 220 pounds of TNT exploded in
Christian east Beirut on Monday, killing 20 people and wounding 78.
   The Lebanese Forces blamed Syria for Monday's attack, which came
four days after 2,400 Syrian troops deployed in Beirut's southern
slums to end three weeks of fighting between rival Shiite Moslem
militias that killed nearly 300 people and wounded 1,000.
   The Christians are at loggerheads with Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon. Syria controls west Beirut, most of the city's
southern suburbs and the nation's eastern and northern provinces.
   The police spokesman said Syrian officers supervised overnight a
swap of prisoners between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and the pro-Syrian Amal, Arabic of hope.
   He said Hezbollah released 120 members of Amal captured during
the 21 days of clashes in south Beirut and Amal freed 31
Hezbollahis.

<TEXT>
   Management locked out 20,000 striking
workers at a Hyundai Motor Co. plant Wednesday and said there was
little chance of settling a 3-day-old strike for higher wages.
   Meanwhile, at Hyundai Precision and Industry Co. in Changwon,
striking workers freed one of the 11 company executives they took
hostage Friday.
   Both companies are subsidiaries of the massive Hyundai group
conglomerate.
   Officials at Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest carmaker,
said they had no choice but to lock out workers in Ulsan on the
nation's southeast coast.
   ``The lockout is inevitable because there are little chances of
resolving the dispute in a short period of time,'' said one company
executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   After two days of work slowdown, Hyundai Motor workers struck on
Monday, demanding wage increases of up to $180 a month. The company
offered $105.
   The company employs 25,000 people, including 20,000 union
members who went on strike and 5,000 management workers who
remained at work.
   After the lockout on Wednesday, the carmaker's unionized workers
left the plant and said they would not return at least until
Monday. They said they would help farmers with the spring rice
planting during the period.
   Hyundai workers earn an average of $610 a month after one year,
$750 after five years and $960 after 13 years, the company said.
   Hyundai officials said the strike cost them $18.6 million a day
in lost sales. About two-thirds of the Hyundai production are
intended for exports to the United States, Canada and other
countries.
   At Hyundai Precision and Industry Co. in the southern city of
Changwon, 2,000 striking workers released Chairman Chung Mong-ku.
He was taken from the plant to a hospital where he was treated for
high blood presure and exhaustion.
   Company President Yoo Ki-chul and nine other high-ranking
officials were still being held by the strikers. Workers blocked
all gates to the plant where the 2,000 workers produce trains and
unspecified defense equipment.
   Hyundai Precision workers took the officials hostage to press
their demand for wage increases of up to $180 a month. The company
offered a $55 increase.
   Company officials and strikers agreed after 10 hours of talks to
resume negotiations Thursday on calls for higher wages. The company
agreed to give Yoo full power to negotiate with the union.
   Hyundai officials said they would ask the government not to
bring criminal charges against union members who seized parts of
the plant and held Chung hostage. The deal followed a government
warning that police would be used to rescue the executives.
   All 2,000 workers at another Hyundai Precision plant in Ulsan
went on strike on Friday to demand higher wages. A striker who
stabbed himself in a suicide attempt Tuesday was reported in fair
condition at a hospital.
   Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest used to try and
shame or discredit superiors such as the government or company
executives.
   In another development, Justice Minister Chung Hae-chang on
Wednesday ruled out the possibility of releasing more political
prisoners in the near future.
   ``The government is not considering taking any extraordinary
actions to release political offenders,'' Chung told reporters.
   Chung pointed out that the government had already released 1,275
political prisoners under three amnesties since summer 1987 and
reinstrated the civic rights of 8,710 people who were blacklisted
for political offense.
   ``There are few people who are eligible for amnesty. Another
exceptional amnesty would be detrimental to maintaining law and
order,'' Chung said.
   The opposition demanded that the government of President Roh
Tae-woo free all ``prisoners of conscience'' as a step toward full
democracy. The opposition recently said there are 560 political
prisoners it wants released.
   Government officials said the opposition list includes some
alleged North Korean spies and many who were already set free. The
officials say about 200 political offenders are currently in jail,
serving terms or awaiting trial.

<HEAD>Jewish Emigration From Soviet Reaches Seven-Year High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached a
new seven-year high in May with 1,145 Jews allowed to leave, the
agency helping them resettle said Wednesday.
   May marked the fourth straight month of rising Jewish
emigration, bringing the total for 1988 to 4,547 Soviet Jews
arriving at the Vienna, Austria, transit center, according to the
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.
   But the number going to Israel has declined, with only 97 of the
May arrivals resettling there, committee spokeswoman Regina
Boucault said. In April, 1,077 Soviet Jews emigrated and 162 went
to Israel.
   The May figure was the highest since April 1981, when 1,155 Jews
left the Soviet Union.
   More than 250,000 Jews have found new homes since the
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration resettlement program
began in 1971. In the early years, most proceeded to Israel but
recently the number has declined sharply.
   The committee did not include figures for the number of Soviet
Jews coming through Bucharest, Rumania. Shmuel Binsky of the Public
Council on Soviet Jewry in Jerusalem said 24 Jews emigrated through
Bucharest in May.
   In Jerusalem, a Soviet Jewish activist told the news agency Itim
that the number of Soviet Jewish emigrants who decided against
coming to Israel reached a record high in May, when more than 90
percent chose to settle elsewhere.
   Chaim Chessler, head of the Public Council for Soviet Jewry, was
quoted as saying on Tuesday that soon no Soviet Jewish emigrants
will come to Israel unless they are flown via Bucharest instead of
Vienna, where they are free to immigrate to other Western countries.
   Israeli officials are embarrassed by the high dropout figure
because of their 20-year-long battle for the right of Soviet Jews
to emigrate on the grounds that Israel is their homeland.
   Israeli leaders claim 400,000 Soviet Jews want to settle in
Israel. But less than 20 percent of those who leave the Soviet
Union actually settle there.
   Chessler said that of the 1,169 Jews who left the Soviet Union
for Vienna and Bucharest in May, just 110 came to Israel, a drop of
nearly 7 percent from April.

<TEXT>
   Before concluding my statement, let me just share with you one
general impression _ and if I did not mention this, I would not be
honest with you or truthful, if I omitted to say this: It is my
impression ... there is a lot of contradictions in the American
position. ... Now, let me explain where I see this contrariness. On
the one hand, we have a joint statement that there should be no
war, that war is inadmissible, we are engaged in a businesslike
dialogue about arms reductions, we're talking about preferences for
political solutions. And yet, on the other hand, we keep hearing
... _ we heard words about a stake made on strength. ...
   This is to be seen in the economic ties also, where an
authoritative part _ sections of the American business circles are
in favor of cooperation, but they are faced with intimidation with
all sorts of restrictions. There is indeed a most unfavored nation
treatment in respect to the Soviet Union. We had a very intense
discussion with the president yesterday on this subject. And I
asked, ``Why should the dead hold onto the coattails of the
living?'' I mean the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. One of them's already
physically dead. The other's politically dead. ``Why should they
hang onto our coattails?'' I asked. This was _ the amendment was
passed in a totally different situation a decade ago, but in this
changed world of ours, we should think and base our policies on
present day realities. ...
   Q. You mentioned twice in your comments just a few moments ago,
you talked about missing chances, and you have also talked about
politics is the art of the possible. So I ask you with this
administration and its president, is it going to be possible to
have a treaty, to have a START (strategic arms reduction) treaty,
if the Americans insist on keeping the SDI (strategic defense
initiative) program going?
   GORBACHEV: I am sure that there still is a possibility to
achieve a treaty this year and I'm reinforced in this optimism by
the headway we have made _ Moscow and Washington have made in this
past period _ and also the exchange of views here almost around the
clock. It gives me grounds to voice such an optimistic assessment.
...
   Q. Mr. General Secretary, several times in the past few days you
were asked if there would be a fifth summit conference with
President Reagan possible in the fall, and you answered usually,
``Yes, it is possible, it is possible, but it depends on how things
go at this meeting.'' Now that this meeting is about over, do you
see enough headway _ progress _ to warrant a fifth meeting with
President Reagan in the fall?
   GORBACHEV: I link the possibility to arrive at a treaty, and
therefore, I believe, that a fifth meeting is also possible, and
that possibility is still at the very real. So, the whole thing
hinges upon that one question. ...
   Q. The Arab countries highly assess your recent words about the
Palestinians who are now waging a courageous struggle against the
Israeli occupiers. Would you tell me what you achieved in your
meetings with Mr. Reagan on the Palestine issue and on the Middle
East settlement as a whole?
   GORBACHEV: ... There is an understanding among the international
community and in the Security Council among its permanent members
that the solution should be solved along the lines of an
international conference. The content of that conference has not
yet been determined though. ...
   We cannot decide for the Arabs, how the Palestinians participate
in the international conference. Let them decide for themselves,
let the Arabs decide. What we should do, the Americans and the
Soviet Union, we should respect their decision. It's a vast Arab
world out there, and we must recognize Israel's right to security.
We must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination. In what form? Let the Palestinians, with their
friends the Arabs, decide on that. ...
   Q. There's been a wide perception that differences over the
American SDI program have been one of the major obstacles to a
START Treaty. Have you made any progress in resolving differences
over SDI at this summit? If so, exactly what progress has been
made? And do you still continue to believe that that may be a major
obstacle in reaching a START Treaty?
   GORBACHEV: In responding to your last question I say yes, I do,
because it means destabilization and it doesn't meet normal logic
to reduce strategic offensive arms on land and to build a bridge
for such arms into outer space. Although the Americans say that
this is a purely defensive weapon, we do not think that is. ...
   Allegedly the U.S. side is ready to share its secrets with us.
And I said to the president at that time, I said, ``Permit me, Mr.
President, not to agree with you and to call in question that
statement of yours. Why? Because right now we can't even agree on
how to verify sea-based cruise missiles on two types of vessels
because you're not ready to agree. So how can we rely on your
divulging all of your secrets concerning SDI? That's just not
serious, it's beyond the framework of reality.'' ...

   While police searched London's sewers for bombs
and set up barricades Wednesday, the Lord Mayor's harried staff
spruced up the 12th century Guildhall where President Reagan will
speak en route home from the Moscow summit.
   Clearly unaccustomed to the tumult surrounding U.S. presidential
visits, the mayor's spokeswoman, Carole Barbone, glanced at the
city's motto inscribed on the Guildhall _ ``Domine Dirige Nos.''
   ``It means `God Direct Us,' or the alternative version, `God
Help Us,''' she chuckled as workers strung up American flags,
lugged in potten chrysanthemums and polished the Lord Mayor's
silverware.
   Reagan arrives Thursday, the final leg of a 10-day trip that
also took him to Helsinki, Finland and Moscow.
   The president wrapped up his summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev on Wednesday, as both leaders stressed improved
relations between the superpowers and pledged to press forward with
their quest for a treaty their arsenals of strategic nuclear
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   During his two-day London stopover, Reagan will have afternoon
tea with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, hold talks with
Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Noboru Takeshita
of Japan and deliver a major speech summing up his meetings with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   American tourists watching the changing of the guard at the
palace were delighted that their president was coming.
   ``We'll probably change our plans just to see him,'' said Craig
Moritz, 24, an economics graduate from Houston, Texas, who is
vacationing with his sister, Kirsten. ``It makes you feel good that
he is somewhere you are.''
   Sheila Cronin, 57, of Hopatcong, New Jersey, also planned a
second visit Thursday ``just to see what Reagan is like up front.''
   At the Guildhall on Friday, Reagan will pass along a corridor
lined with Lord Mayor Sir Greville Spratt's personal bodyguard of
pikemen and musketeers, and will be preceded by ceremonial
sword-and mace-bearers into the Great Hall to deliver his speech on
East-West relations to the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
   Six truckloads of flowers and plants have been ordered to spruce
up the austere wood-paneled rooms, including red, white and blue
carnations woven into the shapes of the Union Jack, the Stars and
Stripes and the flag of the City of London.
   The Nicaraguan Solidarity Campaign said playwright Harold Pinter
and actress Julie Christie would be among 10 celebrities near the
Guildhall during Reagan's speech, attending a silent protest
against U.S. policy in Central America.
   The Reagans will stay at Winfield House, the 35-room residence
of Ambassador Charles Price in Regent's Park.
   Part of Regent's Park and the road around it will be sealed off,
with marksmen positioned on surrounding roofs. Sewers have been
checked and even the cable access doors on lamppost bases have been
sealed with metal strips.
   The Mall, a wide boulevard leading through St. James's Park to
Buckingham Palace, was lined Wednesday with metal barricades, and
mounted police directed traffic.

   The Iraqi army ``set up'' Iran in April for
one of its worst military defeats with an elaborate, month-long
deception campaign of troop movements that demonstrated the growing
maturity of Iraq's forces, senior Pentagon officials say.
   Having rapidly recaptured the Faw peninsula six weeks ago in an
operation that succeeded beyond all expectation, the Iraqis since
have reclaimed another piece of their occupied territory near the
southern city of Basra with a similar surprise attack, the
officials noted.
   The victories mean it now is conceivable that Iraq can break the
stalemate in the 7{-year war with Iran, the sources continued.
   While there is no evidence that Iraq will try to invade Iran, it
appears Iraq now has the ability to ``systematically evict''
Iranian troops from its territory, the officials said.
   Such victories, when coupled with the political and economic
problems confronting Iran, may be enough to force a truce
settlement.
   The sources _ ranking defense officials with access to U.S.
intelligence data _ agreed to discuss developments in the Iran-Iraq
war during interviews conducted over the past week. The officials,
who spoke only upon condition they not be named, suggested the
administration had new reason to hope the Iran-Iraq war might wind
down _ allowing the United States to reduce its own commitment of
naval forces to the Persian Gulf.
   The sources agreed that Iraq had surprised not only Iran but
also U.S. intelligence agencies with the timing of its land
offensives. They further disclosed:
   _Iraq spent the month before the April 17 attack on the Faw
peninsula moving troops all around the country, generally toward
the north. When they were ready, the Iraqis used their superior
roads and military logistical system to send 50,000 to 60,000
troops streaming back south to Faw in one coordinated movement.
   ``They set up the Iranians masterfully,'' one official said.
``The Iranians never saw it coming.''
   ``They achieved surprise,'' a second official added. ``In the
course of this plan, they moved units around in ways that Iranian
intelligence were likely to be deceived, then reassembled these
units in a stealthy and rather sudden way. ...
   ``And they just ran over the Iranians like a steamroller running
over a cockroach. It was really something. They had expected it
(the operation) to take five days and it took them a day and a
half.''
   This source noted the Iraqi military had received ``an awfully
lot of bad press'' in the past, ``but our conclusion has been that
they've gotten steadily better. We have observed with interest the
maturation of the Iraqi armed forces as an entity.''
   _In the course of retaking the Faw peninsula, ``the Iraqis
digested real quickly the fact the Iranians really didn't fight
very well,'' one official said.
   Thus emboldened, the Iraqis set up another assault operation and
punched through Iranian lines near Basra on May 25, once again
routing Iranian forces.
   ``This was another steamroller,'' an official said. ``It took
the Iranians a couple of months to capture (this area), with 60,000
to 65,000 dead. The Iraqi army and air force recaptured it in five
hours.''
   _The Iraqis recently provided yet another example of their
willingness to become more aggressive, mounting a major air strike
against Iran's Larak Island oil terminal.
   Iraqi jet fighters have struck the terminal before. What made
the May 14 attack different, the sources said, was the willingness
of the Iraqi pilots to slow down, fly low and use heavy iron bombs
instead of guided missiles.
   The bombs pack much more explosive power than missiles like the
Exocet and the result was that Iraq ``just drilled'' several huge
oil tankers, putting them out of commission.
   _Iran appears to be suffering real recruitment problems in
convincing its youth to join the Revolutionary Guard for duty at
the front lines. The Iranians have been ``equipment-poor'' for some
time; ``now they're becoming a people-poor armed force,'' one
official said.
   _Iran is going out of its way to monitor the location of U.S.
warships and refraining from attacks on merchant vessels if Navy
ships are close enough to intervene, the sources said.

<HEAD>Church of England To Drop Controversial Anonymous Essay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Church of England said Wednesday it will drop
the traditional anonymous preface from its next directory because a
theologian committed suicide after using the last one to criticize
the archbishop of Canterbury.
   A joint statement by the Church Commissioners and the Central
Board of Finance, which oversee church investments and assets, said
the commentary was ``no longer a viable option.''
   Asked to elaborate, a spokesman cited ``a lot of publicity and
the search by the media for the author and the tragic death of
Gareth Bennett.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The preface will be dropped from the 1989-90 edition of
Crockford's Clerical Directory, the official biennial list of
Anglican clergy, but no decision has been made on whether to
eliminate it permanently, the statement said.
   ``It has only been dropped for the 1989 edition to allow us more
time to consider,'' the spokesman said. ``We shall consider the
position again later.''
   Bennett, a 68-year-old Oxford University canon, was found dead
Dec. 7, five days after the 1987-88 edition of the directory
appeared with his preface.
   It accused Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie of being
indecisive and overly influenced by liberal pressure groups, and of
surrounding himself with liberal bishops. Runcie is spiritual
leader of the church and leads the world's 70 million Anglicans,
including 3 million American Episcopalians.
   The preface attacked moves within the state church toward
ordaining women as priests, an issue it said was spreading disunity
through the Anglican communion.
   Although the article was not signed, suspicion fell on Bennett
because of his stature in the church's conservative wing, his
influential position and his academic distinction.
   Runcie, 66, often has criticized Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's conservative policies, and the preface was widely
interpreted as the beginning of a campaign to bring about his
retirement and prevent a liberal from succeeding. Bishops and
archbishops customarily retire on their 70th birthday.
   Bennett denied to colleagues and reporters that he wrote the
preface, but was found dead in the garage of his home with a hose
leading into his car from the exhaust pipe. Church officials later
confirmed he was the author.
   He did not leave a suicide note, but wrote in a diary four days
before his death: ``I should be lucky to weather this business
through without disaster.''
   A strong clue to authorship was the preface's informed criticism
of divisions among Episcopalians in the United States following
ordination of women priests there. Bennett had been a visiting
professor at the University of South Carolina since 1975.
   The Church Commissioners and Central Board of Finance said they
considered publishing a signed commentary in the next directory,
but decided against it.

<HEAD>Two First Ladies Maneuver For Spotlight In Feisty `Mexican
Standoff'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev dropped all
pretense of a hand-holding friendship Wednesday in a feisty
competition for the spotlight that Mrs. Reagan called a ``Mexican
standoff.''
   President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev
traded generous comments as their fourth summit drew to a close,
but their wives managed to erase within minutes the image of a warm
relationship they'd tried to portray earlier in the week.
   Although the two women maintained the appearance of cordiality
during a tour of an icon storage vault, their contest for the
spotlight was the toughest of any of their get-togethers since they
met in Geneva in 1985.
   ``I want to say something. I want to say something now, OK?''
Mrs. Reagan cut in at sharply one point as Mrs. Gorbachev attempted
to stop reporters from questioning the American first lady.
   Mrs. Gorbachev backed away, but pointedly looked at her watch as
the first lady chatted with members of the White House press corps.
   The incident recalled a similar one during the December summit
in Washington, when Mrs. Gorbachev frequently offered comments
about history, art and political life, as Mrs. Reagan attempted to
get in a few words.
   Since then, press accounts have dwelled on the apparent coolness
in the women's relationship. But during several of their sessions
this week, Mrs. Gorbachev took Mrs. Reagan's hand in a public
gesture of friendship, as she did on their Sunday stroll about the
Kremlin's Cathedral Square.
   During Wednesday's session with reporters, Mrs. Reagan laughed
at the maneuvering that had just occurred, shrugged and declared,
``a Mexican standoff.''
   Later, the first lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said of
the two women, ``They are from two totally different worlds.''
   Noting that Mrs. Reagan has spoken out more in Moscow than she
did at the Washington summit, Mrs. Crispen said she believed they
now had ``more balance'' and equality in their relationship.
   Mrs. Reagan had requested a viewing of the famed icons at the
Tretyakov Gallery, which houses the finest collection of Russian
art in the world. It was begun by Paul Tretyakov, the son of a
wealthy Moscow merchant, who donated it to the state in 1892. The
museum has been closed for renovation since 1986.
   Instead of meeting Mrs. Reagan as planned by the outside door of
the gallery, Mrs. Gorbachev had come to the special vault where
they were to view the art and informed the waiting press corp that
they could have ``a dialogue'' about the masterpieces of medieval
icon painting.
   ``The guests are late,'' she noted.
   The Soviet first lady then expounded on the 12th and 13th
century works, quoting the great Russian author Feodor Dostoevsky
as she pointed to the ``Virgin of Vladimir,'' which is revered as
having saved Moscow from the Tartars. Another, ``The Trinity,'' by
Andrey Roblov, is said to be the most beautiful icon ever painted.
   After Mrs. Reagan arrived and the two women shook hands, Mrs.
Gorbachev presented her with a bouquet of pink roses and a large
coffee-table style book of pictures from the gallery.
   She also presented reporters with a copy of the same book,
proposing that they give it to ``whomever has covered the summit
best.''
   Mrs. Reagan raised her eyebrows in a look of mild consternation.
She then stepped forward, insisting that she had something she
wanted to say.
   She thanked Mrs. Gorbachev and the gallery staff and said she
was aware few people were granted a chance to view rare icon
collection.
   When reporters then tried to question the two women, Mrs.
Gorbachev tried again to get the tour under way, saying, ``We have
decided there would not be any interviews.''
   But journalists pressed Mrs. Reagan to respond, telling her that
she should have ``equal time'' with the Soviet first lady. Upon
realizing that Mrs. Gorbachev had spoken at length with reporters
before she arrived, a broad smile crossed Mrs. Reagan's face and
she plunged into her own dialogue.
   Mrs. Gorbachev then retreated to the background.
   Told that Mrs. Gorbachev had not mentioned the icons' religious
heritage, Mrs. Reagan responded, ``I don't know how you can neglect
the religious implications. I mean they are there, when you see
them.''
   Asked if she'd become a convert to communism during her trip,
the first lady laughed heartily, saying, ``Oh, no,'' adding that
the Soviets weren't ready to convert to capitalism, either.
   ``We have two different ways of living, two different
philosophies,'' she said.

   Q. While 5,000 journalists have been here for the summit,
suddenly Soviet domestic politics have become rather unusual.
(Ousted Moscow Communist Party leader) Mr. Boris Yeltsin, in an
interview on television, calls for the resignation of (the
Kremlin's No. 2 man) Mr. (Yegor) Ligachev. ... How do you assess
the current political situation in the Soviet Union as we move into
the party conference period? And what is your opinion of Mr.
Yeltsin's call for Mr. Ligachev's resignation?
   GORBACHEV: ... (Comrade Yeltsin) is a member of the Central
Committee of the CPSU, after all. So what he says and what he talks
about was in fact a subject for discussion at the October plenary
meeting last year. Twenty-seven people spoke out at that meeting,
and just as you are asking me questions, he suddenly came up and
his statement, the statement he made at that meeting, was _ had not
been planned. ... The opinion of all of the 27 speakers was that
the generalizations made by Comrade Yeltsin concerning various
aspects of activity of the Central Committee, the activity of the
Secretariat, the Politburo, that opinion was wrong. And his
statement was recognized as being politically erroneous. So the
discussion was there, the decision was taken, and so Comrade
Yeltsin seems to be in disagreement with the decision taken by the
Central Committee of the Party. Well then, if that is so, we must
ask him in the Central Committee, and we shall demand that he
explain his position and what he's out for. It means that his
opinion is at a variance with the opinion of the Central Committee
of the Party.
   As for Comrade Ligachev and his retirement, that problem simply
is nonexistent, and that's all. That's what you should proceed
from, and that's the way it will be. ...
   Q. Mr. Secretary, when you were in Washington, you said to Mr.
Reagan that the Soviet Union was prepared to stop arms deliveries
to Nicaragua if the United States stopped financing the Contras.
Then later (Soviet Foreign Minister) Mr. (Eduard) Shevardnadze and
(Secretary of State) Mr. (George) Shultz discussed that issue, and
we were told that the Soviet position had changed to an agreement
to stop deliveries to Nicaragua if the United States stopped
deliveries to the whole of Central America. Can you explain to us
the reason for the change in that position, if it's correct, and
what you discussed today on Central America? Did that advance the
issue?
   GORBACHEV: Today we had a detailed discussion of this problem _
very detailed. We looked back at the history, and when we do look
back into history, we have different explanations and views. But I
suggested that we take as a starting point today's reality. The
Contadora process is with us, the Guatemala Accords. There's been
an armistice, a cease-fire. And there is some movement towards a
political settlement, and we must base ourselves on that process
and lend our support and give an opportunity to the forces opposing
each other. ...

   President Reagan, to the surprise of some
refuseniks, said Wednesday that emigration barriers preventing
people from leaving the Soviet Union may be the result of
bureacratic snags rather than deliberate Kremlin policy.
   In a summit-finale news conference, Reagan also said that it was
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev who changed his view of the
Kremlin as an ``evil empire.'' He said Gorbachev, his partner at
four summit meetings, was ``different than previous Soviet leaders
have been.''
   The president said he hoped to conclude a U.S.-Soviet treaty to
cut strategic nuclear arsenals by half before leaving office, but
said it was more important to get a good agreement than to meet a
January deadline.
   Winding up his first visit to the Soviet Union, Reagan answered
questions at a news conference under hot television lights in a
ballroom of the Spaso House, the American Embassy residence where
he stayed during his five-day visit here.
   Reagan refused to rule out the possibility of a fifth summit
before leaving office in eight months.
   ``Something else might come up that necessitates our getting
together and settling something other than that particular
treaty,'' Reagan said. He was referring to the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), still being negotiated by the United
States and Soviet Union.
   ``So, no one can say, no, there will be no need for a summit,''
the president added.
   Avoiding any direct criticism of Gorbachev, Reagan said the
Soviet leadership believed that his meetings in Moscow with Soviet
dissidents, refuseniks and others constituted interference in
internal matters. The topic had been a centerpiece of his
activities here, but abruptly ended after a speech Tuesday at
Moscow State University.
   At his news conference, Reagan was asked repeatedly about his
comment a day earlier about dissidents and refuseniks, people who
have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or are otherwise
punished for merely seeking permission to leave or speaking out
against the Soviet system.
   ``I'm not blaming you; I'm blaming bureaucracy,'' Reagan had
told a Soviet questioner. ``We have the same type of thing happen
in our country...''
   Asked Wednesday if he thought the problem merely was one of
bureaucratic intransigence instead of a deliberate policy, Reagan
said, ``No, I can't say that _ it's one I don't know that much
about the system.''
   The questioner persisted, asking if he weren't ``letting Mr.
Gorbachev off a little easy on just saying it's a bureaucracy?''
   ``I just have to believe that in any government some of us do
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy, and then sometimes you have
to stomp your foot and say, unmistakably, I want it done.
   ``And then maybe you get through with it. But I have great
confidence in his ability to do that,'' Reagan said of Gorbachev.
   However, his answer met immediate skepticism.
   Abe Stolar, a Chicago-born Jew who has been trying to get his
family out of the Soviet Union since 1975, said Reagan's answer was
``naive. Maybe that's a bad word to use, may it's just innocent.''
   Stolar said ``I personelly believe that it is Soviet policy.
None of it is accidental and none of it is purely bureaucratic.''
   Tanya Zieman, a Soviet refusenik, asked if she felt the
bureacracy was responsible, said, ``Of course not. The bureaucracy
has nothing to do with it.''
   She speculated that Reagan merely did not want to spoil some
agreement with Gorbachev on human rights.
   ``My impression was that he just didn't want to anger our side
more,'' she said. ``My feeling is as if some agreement is reached
and he does not want to hamper it by saying nasty things.''
   Zieman's family was to have been visited by Reagan until Soviet
authorities passed word that the family would never be allowed to
leave if Reagan paid a call.
   Reagan met with reporters shortly after Gorbachev.
   At the first news conference he had ever held in the Soviet
Union, the Kremlin leader noted with pleasure that Reagan had
retracted his characterization of this country as an ``evil
empire.''

<HEAD>Afghan Insurgents Claim Capture of 32 Government Posts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan Moslem guerrillas said they
overran 32 government military posts around the Afghan provincial
capital of Baghlan near a major Soviet troop withdrawal route.
   The report could not be independently verified, and Western
diplomatic sources contacted Wednesday in Islamabad said they could
not confirm it.
   They said it sounded exaggerated, but they agreed it could
indicate there was heavy fighting around the city 120 miles north
of Kabul and 75 miles south of the Soviet Union.
   The Peshawar-based Mujahedeen Alliance said in a telex statement
Tuesday night that 1,500 troops and militiamen fighting for the
communist government surrendered or were captured around Baghlan
between May 22 and May 28.
   It said the insurgents captured nearly 900 automatic rifles and
machine guns and ``millions of rounds of ammunition.''
   The statement said fighting was still going at the time of the
broadcast on Tuesday. It did not say whether the fighting involved
Soviet forces or just Kabul government troops.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas say they already control the area
surrounding the southern part of the road below the mountains, but
they say they are letting the retreating Red Army pass peacefully.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and replaced
the communist government with another one. More than 100,000 troops
have been helping the Marxist government fight Moslem rebels.
   The Soviet Union signed an agreement with the United States,
Pakistan and Afghanistan last month in Geneva to withdraw its
troops, and the pullout began May 15.

   Salvadoran President Jose Napolean Duarte,
admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center for treatment of what
he called a bleeding ulcer ``of a malignant nature,'' began tests
today to determine if his condition could be cancer.
   Duarte, 62, was taken to Walter Reed after arriving Tuesday
night at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington.
   Walter Reed spokesman Pete Esker said today that Duarte ``rested
comfortably last night and began medical evaluation and tests this
morning.
   ``He is in good spirits and his condition is stable,'' Esker
said in a short statement. ``It is not appropriate to comment
further until all his tests are completed.''
   Duarte's illness has been described by those around him as both
an ``ulcer'' and as ``a tumor.'' The Salvadoran president himself
said it was an ulcer of ``a malignant nature.''
   A physician who is an expert on stomach diseases, but who is not
associated with Duarte's care, said that it often is difficult to
determine if an illness is the result of an ulcer or is caused by a
stomach cancer.
   ``It is not at all uncommon for there to be confusion,'' said
Dr. J. Michael Hamilton of the National Cancer Institute. ``When
you look at the two things, they may be very similar.''
   Extensive tests or even surgery may be required to resolve the
question, Hamilton said.
   As he prepared to leave from Illopango military airport in El
Salvador on Tuesday, Duarte told reporters of his illness and
described himself as ``a man who fights.''
   `The designs of God are unpredictable,'' Duarte said. ``What I
have is a bleeding ulcer seven centimeters (2{ inches) long in the
stomach, of a malignant nature.
   ``The doctors have said that the prognosis is reserved until
studies are made in the United States ... I don't know what is
going to happen.''
   Asked how to interpret Duarte's description of his ulcer
presidential spokeswoman Ana Maria Ruiz wiped away tears and said:
``What do you want him to say? Cancer? He can't.'' Ulcers in
themselves are neither malignant nor benign.
   Media Communications Minister Roberto Viera, asked about the
president's statement, said Duarte has ``a large tumor'' in his
stomach. ``The doctors don't want to characterize it until they do
a biopsy,'' Viera said.
   Duarte told reporters: ``You all know me. I have been a man of
crisis, a man of battle, a man who fights. I have fought against
all the vicissitudes, against dictatorships for so many years in
search of democracy; against the country's biggest crisis; against
an earthquake, three droughts. And now God gives me this other
test.''
   He traveled to the United States aboard a U.S. Air Force C-141
transport aircraft converted into a hospital plane for the six-hour
flight to Washington.
   Duarte bid farewell at the airport to about 200 members of the
Cabinet, legislature, supreme court and diplomatic corps, clasping
many of the dignitaries in long embraces. His wife Ines, next to
him on a slightly raised platform, wiped away tears.
   The climate of the ceremony was one of barely concealed grief,
with members of Duarte's extended family weeping and rubbing
reddened eyes.
   The absence leaves Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount in
charge.
   The president, a staunch U.S. ally who is in the final year of
his five-year term, leaves a troubled country. Leftist guerrillas
are waging an 8-year-old campaign to topple the government.
   Duarte's Christian Democrats suffered a telling defeat in
legislative and municipal elections in March. The rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, won control of the
unicameral congress, which had been dominated by Duarte's party.
   The Christian Democrats are torn by infighting that has
threatened to split the organization.
   Former Cabinet Minister Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes was declared
the party presidential candidate at a convention last month. But
rival Fidel Chavez Mena, backed by a significant party sector,
challenges the validity of the nomination.

<DATELINE>GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the tourist season
under way, superintendents of the National Park Service convened an
extraordinary meeting today on how to safeguard America's natural
heritage and were told to ``stand up for your park's resources.''
   The four-day conference at Jackson Lake Lodge, the first of its
kind in 12 years, was called by National Park Service Director
William Penn Mott. All 341 superintendents were invited to the
gathering in the shadow of the Grand Teton.
   ``If the last decade has taught us anything, it is that parks
are no longer islands,'' said Mott. ``I am asking you to stand up
for your park's resources. ... We cannot expect someone else to do
that for us. We must be willing to do that ourselves.''
   The director said coming together in ``this beautiful place will
renew our creativity, replenish the strength of our commitment, and
unite us in meeting the wonderful and awesome challenges ahead.''
   Mott described the National Park system as the storehouse of
America's greatest treasures, but added, ``there are, however, some
ominous `cracks' in the storehouse.''
   Although Mott did not single out specific threats to the
national parks, increasing pressures include commercial and
residential development along park boundaries, timbering, oil
drilling, and pollution of park resources.
   Several sessions during the next few days will focus on those
threats and ways park superintendents will try to deal with them.
   Mott said the Park Service must ``reach out to and work with
adjacent landowners and land managing agencies to let them know the
potential impacts of their actions on park resources. ... We must
reach out into the surrounding communities ... and work with
government agencies and the private sector to resolve problems
before they reach crisis stage.
   ``That is our challenge as we move into the 21st century,'' said
Mott.
   In a morning news conference, Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn.,
chairman of the House Subcommiteee on National Parks and Public
Lands, advocated reorganization of the park service to give its
director a more independent role.
   Vento has introduced a bill calling for presidential appointment
of the director and confirmation by the Senate for a fixed term.
Vento said such a move would ``free the director to be an
advocate'' and remove him from the political arena.
   The meeting comes on the brink of summer, as many national parks
and recreation areas gear up for record crowds. It is also the
latest chapter in the continuing controversy over the nation's
officially preserved natural heritage.
   ``This is not a regional or headquarters agenda, this conference
is by and for the superintendents,'' said George Berklacy, chief of
public affairs for the park service.
   ``I think it is a very serious, professional thing that they
have done'' in holding the conference, said T. Destry Jarvis, vice
president of the National Parks and Conservation Association, a
Washington-based non-profit citizens group.
   ``I think it's very important that the National Park Service
enhance the notion that this is a single service, with a single
purpose,'' said Jarvis, who planned to attend the meeting as an
observer. ``I'm sure they will get a lot of business done that
would not occur if they weren't together.''
   ``It is in the best interest of the country,'' said Steve
Whitney of the Wilderness Society, adding that the superintendents
``shouldn't wait another decade for another one.''
   The National Park system includes 49 full-fledged national parks
and 292 other units, including national recreation areas and
national seashore areas, encompassing 77 million acres.
   Last week, the Wilderness Society issued a report calling on the
federal government to move all hotels and other concessions out of
the parks.
   The report also identified what the environmental organization
deemed were the 10 most endangered parks, among them Yellowstone.
   The National Parks and Conservation Association also recently
issued a report, compiled during three years, that recommended a
$50 million annual increase in the park service's budget just to
fix a backlog of resource management problems.
   The Park Service itself issued a 1980 report to Congress on the
``State of the Parks'' that identified more than 4,000 individual
threats.
   A recent General Accounting Office survey concluded that the
agency had an unmet need of $1.9 billion for maintenance and
capital improvements in the 1987 fiscal year. ``Because of
advanced, continuing deterioration, some of these assets may be
lost permanently,'' the study said.
   The Reagan administration has proposed a Park Service budget of
$779 million for the next fiscal year.
   One conference session deals solely with the federal budget
process and the Park Service.
   The tab for the meeting is estimated at $600,000, said Berklacy.
He noted that this year's regional and zone superintendents'
meetings, which cost about $300,000 in all, have been cancelled.

   AIDS activist Albert Bell marched into
the governor's office and offered a handful of condoms to the
receptionist.
   ``I'd like to give these to the governor. It's the only thing
we've been offered for safety in six years,'' said Bell, a San
Diego resident who was among those calling for more action against
AIDS.
   There is growing frustration in California among the medical
community, victims' advocacy groups and AIDS patients over
government efforts they say are fractured, adrift in a leadership
vacuum and hampered by the governor's conservativism.
   Against that background, supporters of political extremist
Lyndon LaRouche have for the second time placed an AIDS initiative
on the statewide ballot that would allow medical authorities to
quarantine victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Voters will decide the issue, Proposition 69, on June 7. The
first such measure was rejected overwhelmingly two years ago.
   Critics accuse Republican Gov. George Deukmejian of worrying
more about offending conservative voters than saving homosexuals
and intravenous drug users who are hit hardest by AIDS.
   Deukmejian boasts of increasing AIDS spending, up to $65 million
this fiscal year from $3.4 million four years ago and almost 50
percent more than the next four states with high AIDS caseloads
combined. He has included $75 million in AIDS funds in his 1988-89
budget proposal.
   A George Washington University study put California's AIDS
allocation for the 1987-88 fiscal year at $58 million, lower than
the governor's figure but far higher than New York's appropriation
of $16.4 million. Florida was next at $12.5 million, followed by
New Jersey at $7 million, according to the study.
   ``In the coming year, our state will continue its leadership in
the fight against this deadly disease,'' he said recently.
   The 13,106 California cases reported to the Centers for Disease
Control make up 21.5 percent of the national caseload, second in
the nation to New York's 15,729, or 25.8 percent.
   The state Office of AIDS said 58 percent of the California
victims, or 7,744 people, had died by April 30.
   Deukmejian opposes Proposition 69, but critics say he is silent
too often on AIDS issues, allowing state policies to be determined
by politics rather than public health considerations.
   The state has clamped down on graphic AIDS educational material
in the wake of protests by conservative organizations that the
material teaches promiscuity and homosexual sex.
   ``You have to make sure you do not offend people who are, in
essence, paying the bill,'' Thelma Fraziear, chief of the state
Office of AIDS, said.
   Groups professing traditional family values argue that condoms
aren't 100 percent effective and that abstinence should be promoted
as the best means of AIDS prevention.
   The California Medical Association supports the use of explicit
language to reach some audiences. But the state Republican Party
censured the San Francisco AIDS Foundation for educational
literature that Republican leaders considered obscene.
   Fraziear said AIDS, by its nature, is fraught with politics.
``We are dealing with subjects that are not generally discussed in
mixed company. ... You get a lot of built-in fears that you don't
get with other programs,'' she said.
   She characterized the state as balancing opposing interests and
insisted politics haven't interfered with the mission of education,
testing and research.
   But with health care for AIDS victims alone costing an estimated
$1 billion, and with the epidemic expected to strike 35,000 more
Californians by 1991, AIDS experts say the state isn't doing nearly
enough.
   Stan Hadden, an assistant to state Senate leader David Roberti
and a recognized AIDS expert in the Capitol, said the state's low
profile forces county health officers and volunteer groups to take
the lead.
   ``To put it bluntly, I wish we could get rid of the state Office
of AIDS and put the San Francisco County Office of AIDS in
charge,'' Hadden said. ``I think they're much more aggressive.''

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute to
President Reagan on Wednesday for retracting his characterization
of the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' but he blamed the
American side for the failure to make more tangible progress at the
fourth superpower summit in 30 months.
   In the first nationally televised Moscow news conference by a
Kremlin leader, Gorbachev hailed the continuing U.S.-Soviet
dialogue and said ``it is vitally necessary'' that his meetings
resume after Reagan's successor takes office in January.
   In a good-natured, wide-ranging session with Soviet and foreign
reporters, the Communist Party chief held forth for nearly two
hours, alternately praising the tone of U.S.-Soviet dialogue while
criticizing specific U.S. positions.
   Gorbachev noted that ``within the walls of the Kremlin, next to
the Czar's gun, right in the heart of the evil empire,'' Reagan had
responded, ``No,'' when asked if the Soviet Union still deserved
the appellation he gave it in March 1983.
   Reagan explained Tuesday that his characterization, one of the
most-quoted of Reagan's presidency, was made in ``another time,
another era.''
   ``We take note of this,'' Gorbachev said, drawing on an ancient
Greek saying to add, ``Everything flows, everything changes.''
   Gorbachev said his meetings with Reagan were ``in-depth and at
times intense discussions right up to the last minutes.''
   He described the talks as respectful and productive, but
indicated emotions ran high at times, saying he and Reagan were
``standing up at the table'' to make their points.
   ``I think that the meetings once again demonstrated the fact
that we are indulging in realistic dialogue,'' the 57-year-old
Soviet leader said.
   Gorbachev said he believed a treaty cutting strategic nuclear
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent was still possible this year,
despite the failure to break the logjam that has blocked progress
toward an agreement since the Washington summit last December.
   Asked if he expected to meet Reagan again before the president
leaves office, Gorbachev said it was unlikely unless there is an
unforeseen breakthrough in the strategic arms talks.
   He said the United States rejected several Soviet proposals for
inclusion in a 24-page joint statement issued on conclusion of the
talks.
   Both sides agreed there should be no war between them, yet the
Americans objected to describing their goal as ``peaceful
coexistence,'' or even ``coexistence,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev's remarks were contained in a 50-minute opening
statement followed by a question-and-answer session that ran about
an hour with questioners picked by Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov from a show of hands of some 300 Soviet and
foreign journalists.
   The general secretary reiterated his criticism of ousted Moscow
party boss Boris Yeltsin, a one-time protege, and dismissed
Yeltsin's suggestion that the Kremlin's No. 2 man, Yegor Ligachev,
should resign.
   Last October, at a closed meeting of the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee, Yeltsin criticized the slow pace
of perestroika, Gorbachev's campaign to modernize the Soviet
economy and society, and offered to resign. Gorbachev said
Wednesday that his one-time protege, who had risen to non-voting
membership on the ruling Politburo, was overruled by fellow members
of the Central Committee.
   He said he had not seen Yeltsin's recent comments in interviews
with Western television networks but would ``demand from Comrade
Yeltsin explanations as to what it is all about and what he is
after.''
   As for Ligachev and reports he was being pushed from power,
Gorbachev said ``no such problem exists'' with the man widely
perceived as the leader of a conservative faction opposing
Gorbachev in the Politburo.
   ``Perestroika will win out,'' he said of speculation that the
reform movement could be in trouble. He also said he had heard no
alternative to his reforms and concluded, ``There can be some
maneuvers ... but we have undertaken irreversible change.''
   Gorbachev, sitting at a table with key members of his summit
negotiating team, dominated the session with a self-confident air.
Speaking off the cuff much of the time, he made his points
gesturing with his hands and flashing a smile.
   At one point, when he realized that some American correspondents
couldn't understand because their translation devices weren't
functioning, he directed a good-natured reorganization of the
seating, telling Soviet reporters to take chairs where the
earphones weren't working.
   Many reporters, including NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, whom Gorbachev
singled out by name, stood up and switched seats in the
just-renovated auditorium in the Soviet Foreign Ministry press
center.
   The party chief indicated that the United States and Soviet
Union had made a recent breakthrough in long-stalled conventional
arms talks in Europe but accused the United States of
``incomprehensible maneuvers'' that scuttled any mention of that in
the closing communique.
   Asked about the prospects for a fifth summit, Gorbachev said,
``I like the possibility for a meeting with just one problem, if we
have an opportunity to achieve a treaty concerning offensive
arms.'' He said the president's Strategic Defense Initiative was
one sure obstacle, along with a dispute over limits on
submarine-launched cruise missiles.
   Later he said he told Reagan the president's view that the
so-called Star Wars program is strictly defensive was ``just not
serious.''
   Asked about the Middle East, Gorbachev said for the first time
that as soon as an international conference on the region is
convened, ``we are prepared to address ourselves to regularizing
relations with Israel,'' severed in 1967.
   He cited the Afghanistan agreement as an example of what could
be achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring parties
to solve the conflicts, but noted that if Soviet forces now come
under attack from rebels as they withdraw, ``we shall react
accordingly and appropriately.''
   On human rights, he said that when Reagan ``tried to persuade me
to change my mind, I said, `Your explanations are not convincing
... I am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit.'''
   Reagan met with a group of dissidents and refuseniks during his
five-day visit here but scrapped a plan to visit a family of
would-be Jewish emigrants. Sources said the Soviets warned U.S.
officials the family would never be permitted to leave the country
if the Reagans followed through with their plan.
   After talking of what he called the contrary attitude of the
United States on some issues, Gorbachev singled out economic
relations.
   ``Authoritative parts of American business circles would like to
do business,'' he said. ``They are faced with intimidation and all
sorts of restrictions.''
   He cited the Jackson-Vanik Amendment which links trade
opportunities to emigration freedoms and said he told the president:
   ``Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living? ...
The amendment was passed in totally different circumstances a
decade ago. We should base our policies on present-day realities.''
   As he has before, Gorbachev described the agreement to eliminate
intermediate range (INF) nuclear weapons as ``a watershed political
event in the Soviet-American dialogue.''
   Earlier, in remarks at the exchange of final INF papers, the
Soviet leader summarized the proceedings as ``big politics ...
worthy of new times.''
   ``The era of nuclear disarmament has begun,'' Gorbachev said.
   In his news conference statement, Gorbachev was sharply critical
of the U.S. stand on reducing the non-nuclear forces in Europe of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   He said Reagan had rejected a Soviet proposal to exchange data
on the troops as a first step toward a massive reduction, but ``the
other side immediately tried to dodge the issue.''
   Gorbachev said the United States engaged in ``incomprehensible
maneuvers'' and ``we missed a chance to take an important step
forward to a civil relationship.''

   President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev reported progress Wednesday over two obstacles to a
strategic arms deal, but ended their fourth summit divided over the
main impediment, the U.S. Star Wars program.
   ``I would hope that before the year is out that we could
eliminate the differences that still exist,'' Reagan said. But
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.
   After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered their
negotiators to return to Geneva on July 12 to work on a proposed
treaty to cut superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50
percent.
   Gorbachev told reporters ``it is still possible to sign an
agreement in this administration.'' Reagan said, ``Conversations
are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say
progress is still being made or we wouldn't be talking as we are.''
   In a 24-page joint statement, the two leaders announced
``achievement of substantial additional common ground'' on two of
the five major disputed areas on the proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), ways of monitoring mobile missiles and
counting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on warplanes.
   Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched ahead
on other arms control issues.
   They exchanged ratification protocols for the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces treaty (INF) to eliminate medium-range nuclear
missiles, which was signed at the Washington summit last December
and ratified by the Senate last Friday and by the Soviet assembly
of presidents 17 hours later.
   During the summit, Gorbachev and Reagan also signed two lesser
arms control agreements, one requiring advance notifice of
ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification
procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.
   On the START treaties, U.S. officials said they had restated
opposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles.
   ``It is the position of the United States that such missiles
should be banned unless the United States and the Soviet Union can
reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective
verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear
weapons carried by such missiles,'' U.S. officials said.
   U.S. officials, in a briefing paper given to reporters, said
that acceptable verification rules would require, among other
things, restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas,
means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all such
weapons, and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspected
violations.
   The two sides remained far apart on Star Wars and how to
negotiate reductions in conventional armies.
   ``We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,''
Gorbachev told reporters.
   The Kremlin leader, who has used all four meetings with Reagan
as forums to air his opposition to Star Wars, said he had proposed
resolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspection
of facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is
tested.
   But no strategic arms treaty is possible, he said, without an
agreement assuring that development and deployment of strategic
defenses does not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
And a fifth summit would not be possible without a START deal, he
said.
   On the opening day of the talks, U.S. and Soviet officials said,
Gorbachev suggested to Reagan that they exchange data on
conventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts, as proposed by
the Russians in 1986.
   U.S. officials say they will not directly negotiate conventional
cuts with the Soviets, because the matter must be agreed upon by
the 33 nations taking part in the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   Those talks also include discussion of alleged Soviet violations
of human rights provisions of the original conference accord,
signed in Helsinki in 1975.

   A Bedouin couple invoked the honor
of their desert tribe in demanding the death of an unwanted
son-in-law, a prosecutor said today as the two went on trial of
charges of soliciting murder.
   Suad and Ghada Tarawneh of Toledo, Ohio, are accused of plotting
to kill their daughter's husband and his family and asking that
photos and body parts be sent back as proof their honor had been
restored. No one was hurt.
   Assistant State Attorney William Dimitrouleas today quoted from
secretly taped conversations he said showed the plot was serious.
   ```In Syria, he would be bones in the dirt,'' he quoted Tarawneh
as saying of his son-in-law. ```If he continues to live, he will
destroy my life.'''
   Police said Tarawneh, 46, had hired a detective to kill his
son-in-law, Mouataz Abdulsalam, his younger sister and his mother,
Mrs. Tawaneh's sister.
   The detective was secretly cooperating with authorities. The
alleged plot was broken up and the Tarawnehs, who left Jordan 18
years ago, were arrested in February on charges of conspiracy and
solicitation to commit murder.
   The Tarawnehs' daughter, Raniah, had backed out of an arranged
marriage and run off with her Syrian cousin Abdulsalam in 1986 at
age 17. The two settled in Tamarac. Tradition required the insult
be avenged, authorities said.
   Defense attorney Don Spadaro portrayed Tarawneh as a heavy
drinker and who did not necessarily mean what he said.
   ``This case involves severe family problems,'' said Spadaro.

   The government said Wednesday its chief
economic forecasting gauge rose a modest 0.2 percent in April, an
increase analysts said signaled continued healthy economic growth
for the rest of this presidential election year.
   It marked the third consecutive monthly increase in the Commerce
Department's Index of Leading Indicators, following an identical
0.2 percent rise in March and a giant 1.5 percent February surge,
which had been the largest gain in more than two years.
   In other good news for the economy, the government reported that
orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods shot up 1.2 percent
in April to a seasonally adjusted $218.7 billion following an even
bigger 1.6 percent March increase, indicating that industrial
production will be increasing during the months ahead.
   In a third report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending rose 0.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $401.8
billion as a big increase in investment on new factories helped
offset a decline in government construction projects.
   Analysts discounted the drop in the volatile government sector
and focused instead on the strength in factory construction, which
pushed this category up a remarkable 39.1 percent higher than it
was a year ago. They said this reflected a rush by businesses to
expand operating plants to meet the heavy demand for U.S. exports.
   ``All of the reports today spell nothing but good news for the
economy in this election year,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
for the Boston Co. ``By and large, we have got a strong expansion
in industrial America with the orders suggesting increased
production, more jobs and good income generation.''
   Economists have been busy in recent days boosting their growth
forecasts for 1988, based on the report last week that the overall
economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a
robust 3.9 percent rate in the first three months of the year.
   This was far better performance than had been forecast
immediately after Oct. 19, when the record plunge in stock prices
raised fears of an imminent recession. Instead, growth has raced
ahead, pushing unemployment down to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent in
April.
   ``It has been an amazing year,'' said David Wyss, chief
financial economist at Data Resources Inc. ``The ability of the
economy to ignore the stock market crash has really surprised us.''
   Wyss said his company now was predicting the GNP would grow 3.2
percent this year, which would be the best economic performance
since a 6.8 percent surge in 1984. In each of the last two years,
GNP growth has been a more modest 2.9 percent.
   All of this should be good news for Vice President George Bush,
who hopes his presidential campaign will benefit from a feeling
among voters that the Reagan administration has done a good job
managing the economy.
   The March increase in the leading index originally was reported
as a much stronger 0.8 percent rise. However, weakness in consumer
and business borrowing pulled the index down sharply.
   But analysts said they were not concerned about the big downward
revision, which had been expected. They said if the trend toward
smaller monthly increases in the leading index continues, it might
be signaling slower growth by the end of 1988 or in early 1989, but
any such slowdown probably would not be evident until after the
Nov. 8 election.
   Many economists still believe that while 1988 will be a good
year, the country is likely to enter a recession sometime in 1989,
brought on by rising interest rates and higher inflation.
   The Federal Reserve already has made three moves in the past 2{
months to tighten credit conditions in an effort to dampen
inflationary pressures.
   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the Chamber of
Commerce, blamed the Fed actions for the slower increases in the
leading index in the past two months and said the situation is
similar to mid-1984 when Fed credit-tightening brought on a period
of sluggish growth before the Fed relented and started easing
credit.
   ``Let us hope the Fed backs off again,'' he said. ``If it does,
the prospects for the U.S. economy remain basically sound.''
   The 0.2 percent April rise in the leading index reflected
increases in five individual indicators and declines in four others.
   The biggest source of strength was rise in the length of the
average workweek, followed by gains in the money supply, a drop in
initial unemployment claims, a rise in raw materials prices and an
increase in plant and equipment orders.
   The biggest negative factor was a speed-up in delivery times for
business orders, which is viewed as indicating weaker demand. Other
negative forces were a decline in stock prices, a drop in building
permits and a drop in orders for consumer goods.
   The various changes left the index at 192.2 percent of its 1967
base of 100.

Election</HEAD>

   Sinhalese extremists on Wednesday
burned more than 15 government buildings, stabbed a policeman to
death and injured eight people with a bomb in attacks aimed at
stopping provincial elections.
   The government responded by ordering police and security forces
to shoot on sight anyone caught destroying government property.
   The elections are scheduled for Thursday to comply with a
provision of a peace accord aimed at ending the minority Tamils'
five-year insurgency.
   Extremists among the majority Sinhalese say the pact made too
many concessions to the Tamils and have vowed to kill anyone who
supports it.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
explosions and fire also damaged three trains bound for Colombo on
Wednesday.
   One of the trains was stopped by three gun-wielding youths in
Nebomob, 20 miles north of Colombo, said the officials and
travelers. The youths, believed to be Sinhalese extremists, ordered
passengers off the train and then set two of the coaches ablaze
with gasoline. No injuries were reported.
   The policeman was stabbed by three Sinhalese in the southern
town of Galle, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said one Sinhalese extremist was shot to death in an
encounter with police north of Colombo and a second died when a
firebomb he was going to throw at a government building just south
of Colombo blew up in his hand.
   In another attack, four government officials and four policemen
were seriously injured when a bomb went off in Nuwara Eilya's town
hall 60 miles east of Colombo as poll workers prepared for
Thursday's voting. Police blamed the attack on the nationalist
Sinhalese Peoples Liberation Front.
   The front told people in the election area to stay inside for 36
hours and put up posters threatening to kill anyone who tried to
vote.
   The police spokesman said more than 15 government buildings were
set ablaze by the Sinhalese extremists, mostly in western and
southern districts. The buildings included post offices,
development offices and town halls, he said.
   Businessmen said extremists ordered them to shutter their shops,
and many merchants said they complied for fear of reprisal. Some of
the shops opened later in the day.
   Government announcements on state-run radio and television said
police ``have been given orders to shoot on sight any person
engaged in the destruction of public property'' and said the
elections would go ahead.
   The voting Thursday is to elect new district councils in the
western and central provinces. The capital at Colombo in the
western province.
   More than 3.6 million voters are eligible to vote in the
elections to choose 158 representatives.
   The balloting was called for in the peace accord signed on July
29, 1987 by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and Sri Lankan
President Junius R. Jayewardene. The signing led to rioting in
which several hundred people were killed or injured.
   The government blamed the Sinhalese front for instigating the
riots. The violence on Wednesday was the worst since those riots.
   The front has been blamed for the deaths of more than 300 people
since the pact was signed, many of them government officials or
members of Jayewardene's governing United National Party. Several
candidates were killed before district council elections April 28
in four other regions.
   Tamil rebels have been waging a guerrilla war since 1983 for
more political autonomy or an independent homeland in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population, say they are discriminated against
by the Sinhalese, who control the government and military.
   India has become involved because it is the dominant regional
power and because its 60 million ethnic Tamils are sympathetic to
the Sri Lankan cause.
   India has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to enforce
the accord, but they are posted in the north and east to deal with
Tamil problems.
   The Sinhalese front was outlawed after an abortive attempt in
1971 to overthrow the Sri Lankan government. It has been regrouping
in recent years and has been blamed for a series of violent acts,
including the attempted assassination of Jayewardene in August 1987.

<TEXT>
   MOSCOW (AP) ) _ Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole raised the
possibility Wednesday that Congress might relax trade restrictions
on the Soviet Union, as Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev complained
that such restrictions did not reflect ``present-day realities.''
   Gorbachev blasted the Jackson-Vanik amendment, in which Congress
denied certain U.S. trade benefits to the Soviet Union as long as
the Soviets restrict emigration by Jews and others.
   ``Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living?''
Gorbachev asked, referring to Jackson-Vanik. ``One is physically
dead, the other is politically dead,'' he said.
   The measure is named for its chief sponsors, the late Sen. Henry
Jackson, D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio.
   Dole, R-Kan., said Gorbachev had complained to him about
congressional restrictions on trade at the dinner party President
Reagan hosted Tuesday night.
   Gorbachev told him at the dinner he was ``a little frustrated''
by adoption in Congress of resolutions condemning the Soviet Union,
Dole said. ``He indicated it made his job that much more
difficult,'' Dole said.
   ``Authoritative parts of American business circles would like to
do business,'' Gorbachev said at a news conference. ``They are
faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions ... We should
base our policies on present-day realities.''
   Dole did not hold out much hope that Congress would relax trade
restrictions this year, but said: ``I think if this relationship
continues to grow, there are always possibilities that changes will
be made.''
   At Reagan's invitation, Dole and Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd spent 24 hours in the Soviet Union where they came to watch
the ceremonial exchange of the ratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty eliminating a class of weapons.
   The senators said changes in Soviet Union paved the way for
better cooperation between the superpowers, but they were
pessimistic that a treaty cutting long-range nuclear weapons could
be negotiated, or ratified by the Senate, this year.
   But the two senators called for other initiatives, such as the
parliamentary exchanges mentioned by Gorbachev.
   Byrd said he was pleased that Gorbachev recently agreed to allow
the mass distribution of Bibles in the Soviet Union. ``I have
written to the general secretary commending him on taking this step
and urging that there be an expansion of this effort,'' Byrd said.
   Byrd also proposed that the superpowers agree to cooperate in
the war against illicit drugs. ``Instead of the suggested joint
mission ... to Mars, we could work jointly on the war on drugs,''
he said.
   Dole, whose right arm is crippled because of a war injury, said
Reagan and Gorbachev should pledge their support for the rights of
the disabled.
   Saluting Reagan for his part in producing the accord, Byrd said,
``I don't think anyone else could have done that. He came along at
the right moment.''
   Said Dole: ``Ronald Reagan has come a long way since 1981.'' He
said Reagan was in a unique position to negotiate with the Soviets
because of his ``conservative credentials.''

   The following are excerpts from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's news conference on Wednesday:
   (The general secretary's remarks through an interpreter.)
   GORBACHEV: We have completed the fourth meeting, fourth in three
years between the general secretary of the CPSU (Communist Party of
the Soviet Union) and the United States president, and this alone
is not simply a matter of arithmetic. I would say that this is of
great political import to have four meetings in just three years.
It signifies the intensity of the political dialogue, and it shows
the character, the level of our relations, and I guess this in
itself is meaningful. ...
   The meeting did indeed show how important is the dialogue
between the Soviet Union and the United States, and it has
confirmed yet again how right we were in choosing the path we took
in Geneva two and a half years ago. To Reykjavik and Washington,
that path has led us to Moscow. ...
   Everybody is interested in Soviet-American relations being
switched on to a normal and healthy track. ...
   And so, I ask, why has this become possible, this intense
dialogue, this process, which is of immense importance? I think it
is due to realism. I'm speaking about realism in politics, in the
policies of the Soviet Union and of the United States of America
because it is a realistic approach, on the one side, that has
ensured the possibility of this process. ...
   The relations, which bore within them a terrible threat to the
very existence of mankind and to peace, became more positive and
acquired positive dynamism. The two most powerful nations began to
reform their relationship in their own interest and in the interest
of the world community at large. ...
   The major result is a continuation of dialogue, which now
encompasses all of the key issues of world politics, of bilateral
relations. This meeting, once again, demonstrated the fact that we
are indulging in a realistic dialogue. ...
   Also characteristic, and this you will find in the final
document ... the concept that in this dialogue of ours ... we are
laying down prerequisites, the bricks, so to say, for the building
of our future relationship. It is a sign of movement into the 21st
century.
   Now, what have we achieved specifically? I would mention the
fact that we have completed the process concerning medium- and
shorter-range missiles, and this fourth meeting gave an added
impetus to the process and we exchanged instruments of
ratification. This is not simply a formality, and let me just use a
solemn formula ... that completion of the procedures and
introduction into force of the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces) treaty has turned the Moscow meeting into a watershed
political event in the Soviet-American dialogue and in world
politics as a whole.
   It is not only the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United
States that can congratulate themselves, but also their allies and
the entire world public, the entire world community. It is a common
victory for reason and realism. And it has become possible because
today, on all continents, in every nation, in every country,
regardless of social choice and of other values, which each people
chooses for itself, there is a common understanding and awareness
that the world had reached the brink and that it had to be stopped,
that event had to be stopped and the door had to be opened leading
in another direction towards a nuclear free and non-violent world
and towards making international relations more healthy.
   Many made their real and substantial contribution to achieving
this major victory. And I must note these facts and also mention
the contribution of the press, even when the press posed the most
difficult questions before the negotiations, that, too, was a
necessary contribution that helped to make the dialogue more
concrete, more convincing in finding solutions, finding new
arguments in elaborating the forms of verification and control. ...
   The president and I ... have approved a joint statement. It
summarizes what _ the advances made since Washington and what has
been achieved here in Moscow. At the same time, this statement
confirms a sort of agenda for the Soviet-American dialogue for the
future. It is, in short, an important political document which
hallmarks a whole phase in our relations. The most important points
in it are those clauses which relate to the importance of building
up political dialogue between the nations, intensifying the talks
and negotiations and then I would mention further _ I would note
progress made in the sphere of disarmament. This is a very
difficult process, especially if you take the question of strategic
offensive arms. It's not an easy dialogue. ...
   I must state very firmly that step-by-step we are moving toward
a treaty on strategic offensive arms. ... I will say that if we
effectively conduct our business, and if the present administration
_ and of course, this applies to both countries _ if we act
effectively, using all of our possibilities and opportunities, we
can achieve a treaty. ...

<TEXT>
   Battery Thomson, nestled on the
shores of Sullivan's Island flanking Charleston harbor, was built
years ago for a German attack that never came.
   But on recent evenings, the World War I-era cement and stone
bunker has become the torch-lighted stage for portraying a much
older conflict: ``Wat Tyler,'' Richard Sewell's dramatic account of
a peasant revolt in 14th century England.
   Running Horse Productions of Los Angeles is staging the premiere
of the play as part of Piccolo Spoleto, a companion festival to
Charleston's Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
   The production deals with the 1381 uprising in which Tyler
marched with an army of 10,000 serfs to confront King Richard II,
then 14.
   Karl Wiedergott, who recently did a pilot for a new CBS-TV
series called ``Limited Partners,'' plays the role of Tyler. Robert
Winley is John Ball, an itinerant priest who inspired Tyler.
Richard Horvitz, who recently appeared in the movie ``Summer
School,'' plays the king.
   Of the 20 cast members, 12 are from Los Angeles and eight from
Charleston. The actors are volunteering their time for the
production.
   ``We're doing a $50,000 show for $18,000,'' said Nathan
LeGrande, one of the co-producers. ``It would cost $75,000 in L.A.''
   Cast members helped build risers for seating, helped assemble
scaffolding for light towers and spent hours in the hot sun
clearing a battery of weeds and broken glass.
   The audience is escorted through a cave-like door of the bunker
and through a hallway lined with candles. On the other side with
underbrush lining the battery, the scene takes on the aura of a
medieval castle.
   Before being taken over by the production, the battery was a
hangout for youths who live on the island where master of the
macabre Edgar Allan Poe wrote ``Annabel Lee'' and ``The Gold Bug.''
   Locals on the island of weathered beach houses have opened their
doors to the West Coast cast.
   ``We've been getting a lot of attention because it's an unusual
project as a whole,'' LeGrande said.
   Local merchants have donated food, neighbors have put up
relatives of cast members while 13 actors are living in a beach
house provided by a resident.
   For Doug MacHugh, who has appeared in a number of TV series and
has the part of Jack Straw in the play, the production is a chance
to perform away from Los Angeles.
   ``It's a new piece without the L.A. environment,'' he said. ``We
get to work with something untouched, and we get Sullivan's Island
too.''

<HEAD>Factory Construction Spurs Increased Construction Spending in
April</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Construction spending advanced 0.1 percent in
April as a boom in factory construction helped offset weakness in
government projects, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
   The department said building activity rose to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $401.8 billion in April, up 1.4 percent
from a year ago.
   The April advance followed a big 1.3 percent jump in March and a
0.4 percent February increase.
   But analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and
instead focus on a big 8.8 percent rise in spending on industrial
plants, which put activity in this sector up a remarkable 39.8
percent above where it was a year ago.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the gain reflected the boom in export sales,
which has meant plants in many industries are operating near full
capacity.
   ``Industry was trying to cut costs in 1982 and 1983 by slashing
capacity and closing down plants,'' he said. ``The growth in
construction is a reflection of increased international demand
running against a production supply that had been cut back too much
in previous years.''
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said that
while the construction figures so far this year have been strong,
he expected weakness in the months ahead in both residential and
non-residential building because of the recent increases in
interest rates.
   Government construction, after soaring 5 percent in March, fell
by 3.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $79.3 billion. But
analysts said this swing in a volatile category was not worrisome
and they predicted further gains in the months ahead based on
increased federal money for highway projects which Congress
approved last year over President Reagan's veto.
   Residential construction posted a 0.4 percent advance in April
to an annual rate of $191.9 billion. This reflected a 0.8 percent
increase in construction of single-family homes and a 1.4 percent
drop in apartment construction.
   Apartment building is now 22.2 percent below the level of a year
ago as this sector continues to be hurt by changes in the tax law
and high vacancy rates.
   Non-residential construction climbed 2.1 percent in April to an
annual rate of $94.4 billion. In addition to the big 8.8 percent
advance in industrial construction, office construction posted a
1.1 percent increase while construction of shopping centers and
other commercial buildings rose 2.9 percent.

<HEAD>Money Stores to Accept Fine Payments on Traffic Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic scofflaws are getting relief _ not from
the fines but from lines at court.
   Three First Independent Money Stores soon will accept fine
payments in a program that will help clear 36th District Court,
which processed more than 400,000 traffic violations last year,
Chief Judge Adam A. Shakoor said.
   The Money Stores, owned by First Independence National Bank,
Detroit's only minority-owned bank, will get a 50-cent fee from
each ticket.
   Traffic violations can be paid by mail, but people too poor to
maintain bank accounts are unable do so because fines must be paid
with a check or money order. Thirty percent are paid in person,
Shakoor said.
   ``The 36th District Court is a people's court, and we intend to
provide more community-oriented services that will ultimately make
the court run more smoothly,'' Shakoor said.
   Beginning June 13, motorists can pay fines on all traffic
violations. The program may be expanded for parking violations.
   First Independence, which opened the Money Stores more than a
year ago to provide banking services to lower-income Detroit
residents, lost $500,000 on the stores last year and expects to
lose $230,000 this year.
   The fees collected from the fine payments will help, said Don
Davis, chairman of First Independence.
   The Money Stores were chosen for the program because the
facilities have computer systems that are compatible with the
court's, Shakoor said, adding officials eventually hope to make the
service available at other banking institutions. Shakoor said he
knew of no other program like Detroit's in the country.

   Tape, sheer fabric and grease are no
longer enough between topless dancers and their audience.
   City Council has amended a pornography ordinance that previously
specified what body parts had to be covered but not that the
covering had to be opaque. The council changed that on Tuesday.
   Some women ``were covering their breasts with Vaseline or
grease, because the ordinance did not say what type of covering was
needed,'' said Brenda Nichols, assistant city attorney. There also
were reports that women used see-through fabric or clear tape to
skirt the ordinance.
   City Council is trying to stamp out adult businesses, said Mike
Gibson, a lawyer who represents some of the businesses.
   ``If you comply with the first ordinance they pass, they change
it to make sure no one can comply,'' he said.
   The amendment takes effect immediately, and anyone violating it
is subject to arrest. Strip shows are allowed by law, but the adult
entertainment business has to be at least 1,000 feet from homes,
schools, churches, parks or other adult establishments.

<HEAD>Airport Parking Cashiers Stole Up to $2 Million, Police Say</HEAD>

   Parking cashiers at Los Angeles International
Airport skimmed as much as $2 million from customers' parking fees
by substituting low-value tickets for higher-priced ones, court
documents said.
   The cashiers obtained bogus parking tickets by rolling shopping
carts over sensors and then traded $2 stubs for those turned in by
customers who paid up to $100, according to documents unsealed
Tuesday.
   The cashiers pocketed up to $250 an hour, police said in
affidavits seeking search warrants.
   More than 30 employees of Parking Concepts Inc., which operates
the 25,000-space airport parking concession, were indicted May 19
on charges of embezzling city funds. Officials estimated that as
much as $2 million had been skimmed.
   According to the documents, new applicants for parking cashier
positions were forced to pay up to $3,000 to gain the $7-an-hour
jobs, but were assured by managers that they could make that money
back through the alleged embezzlement scheme.
   Twenty-three defendants pleaded innocent to embezzlement charges
Tuesday; preliminary hearings were scheduled for June and July.
Three others were arraigned last week; two were to enter pleas June
7.
   Deputy District Attorney Peter Berman declined comment on the
status of the remaining defendants.
   Police infiltrated Parking Concepts last June after an anonymous
tip alerted authorities to the scheme, Detective Floyd Simmons Jr.
said.

   They're alive and well, but children who undergo
kidney transplants are also extremely short because the medication
they take to ensure the transplant isn't rejected hinders their
growth, doctors say.
   Since young kidney recipients want to grow normally, doctors are
trying new therapies, with some success, to help them in body and
spirit.
   ``They're taller and they're much happier,'' said Dr. Amir
Tejani, director of renal services at the State University of New
York Health Science Center at Brooklyn.
   About one-fourth of all young kidney recipients can be treated
successfully without a steroid commonly combined with the potent
anti-rejection drug cyclosporine, Tejani reported Tuesday at the
annual conference of the American Society of Transplant Physicians.
   The steroid, known as prednisone, inhibits the growth plate in
the bone from functioning normally. It also causes acne and
puffiness, most noticeably in the face.
   ``This is a very important study since the whole point of doing
transplants is to achieve growth,'' said Dr. William Harmon, a
nephrologist at Children's Hospital in Boston.
   ``Even for a third of them to grow normally, then by all means
we should be doing this for our kids or at least trying,'' said Dr.
Lawrence G. Hunsicker, the society's president.
   Like children suffering from other serious illnesses, children
with kidney failure tend to be extraordinarily short, sometimes
barely topping 4 feet.
   By the time they undergo a transplant, it's often too late for
these children to catch up on past growth. Even if they receive
transplants at a very young age, the medication necessary for
helping to prevent their bodies' immune systems from attacking the
new organ stunts their growth.
   Perhaps the best-known case involves Gary Coleman, star of the
former television series ``Diff'rent Strokes.'' The 19-year-old
actor, who's undergone two kidney transplants, is under 5 feet tall.
   ``The issue is a big one'' for these children, said Dr. Ira
Greifer, medical director of the National Kidney Foundation. ``A
lot of the patients, especially the younger ones, want to take the
risk (of rejection) for the extra inches.''
   Some patients, in fact, cheat on their medication in a desperate
attempt to improve their appearance, according to Tejani.
   ``You can't tell them it doesn't matter (if they're short) when
it matters to them,'' Greifer said. ``You can't tell them the world
is made up of small people when Americans are getting taller.''
   About 1,200 youngsters 16 and under experience kidney failure
every year in the United States, according to Greifer. Six hundred
to 800 of them eventually receive new kidneys; they comprise fewer
than 9 percent of the total number of kidney transplants performed
annually.
   The operation is quite successful. One year after
transplantation, up to 85 percent of them still have properly
functioning kidneys, according to experts.
   For his research, Tejani studied 53 children and selected 30
whose transplanted kidneys were functioning well enough to undergo
the experiment. The 30 were taken off prednisone.
   Twenty-three of them proved to be treatable solely with
cyclosporine at the time. However, nine of the 23 had to return to
prednisone later, after experiencing mild episodes of organ
rejection, Tejani said.
   The remaining 14 _ a little more than one-fourth of the original
53 children in the study _ have been off prednisone for up to 4{
years without any episodes of organ rejection or side effects,
according to Tejani. More important, all of them have grown,
including one 17-year-old boy who has reached 5 feet, 8 inches.
   In patients unable to be weaned off prednisone, Tejani has
administered growth hormone, enabling them to catch up on some of
their lost growth.
   Doctors at the University of California at Los Angeles also have
begun giving growth hormone to certain kidney transplant patients
as well as children on dialysis.
   ``The data seems good,'' said Dr. Vera H. Koch, a clinical
fellow at UCLA. ``There seems to be hope.''

   Afghanistan has responded to a humanitarian appeal
from Italy and pardoned an Italian journalist jailed for 6{ months
on charges of espionage, the Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday.
   In Kabul, the Afghan capital, President Najib said he would
consider the Italian request, Kabul television said. In a later
report, Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan, said a
``decree was passed by the (Afghan) president on the release.''
   Italy's Foreign Ministry and Western diplomats in Kabul said
they expected Fausto Biloslavo, 26, to be freed by Thursday.
   Biloslavo, who worked for the tiny Trieste-based Albatross news
agency, was arrested Nov. 14 after entering Afghanistan with
anti-government guerrillas. He was convicted of espionage in March.
   Earlier reports from Kabul said he was arrested in July 1987.
   Kabul television showed Najib meeting an Italian delegation
headed by Bruno Bottai, secretary general of the Foreign Ministry.
Bottai went to Afghanistan with a message from Italian President
Francesco Cossiga asking Biloslavo's release on humanitarian
grounds.
   Biloslavo had shared a jail cell with French photojournalist
Alain Guillo, who was freed Friday after nine months imprisonment
in Afghanistan. Guillo also had been convicted of espionage after
entering Afghanistan with the guerrillas.
   Guillo, 45, was convicted Jan. 4 and sentenced to 10 years
imprisonment.
   Biloslavo was sentenced to seven years.
   Biloslavo's mother, Grazia, reached in Trieste, said she planned
to fly to Rome to await her son's return as soon as she receives
confirmation that he has been freed. ``I'm still shaken up, I can
hardly believe the news,'' she said.

   Mozambique's right-wing rebels claimed
Wednesday their guerrilla forces attacked an major Mozambican army
base, tore up railway tracks and killed 28 people, including a
British military instructor.
   In a statement released in Lisbon, the rebel Mozambican National
Resistance said 16 army regulars, nine Zimbabwe support troops, two
Cuban advisers and the Briton were killed Sunday at the base at
Magude, 75 miles north of the capital of Maputo.
   In Maputo, the British Embassy said Wednesday it had no
information to corroborate the claim that a British military
instructor was killed.
   The rebel note identified the Cubans as Alexandre Gimenez and
Frederico Lopez. The Briton's name was given as Richard Thone.
   James Allan, Britain's ambassador to Mozambique, told the
national news agency AIM that his embassy had no record of anyone
named Thone and had received no first-hand report of any Briton
being killed or injured.
   Allan said a British team trains Mozambican soldiers at a base
in Zimbabwe but does not have military personnel stationed in
Mozambique, except for an attache at the embassy.
   In the rebel statement, the group denied charges by the
Mozambique's Marxist government that the rebels still receive South
African backing despite a 1984 non-aggression pact between
Mozambique and South Africa. It has claimed earlier killings of
British military instructors posted in Mozambique.
   Zimbabwe and Tanzania have sent support troops to aid the
Mozambican army in its 11-year campaign to stop the bloody bush
insurgency.

   President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev reported progress Wednesday over two obstacles to a
strategic arms deal, but ended their fourth summit divided over the
main impediment, the U.S. Star Wars program.
   ``I would hope that before the year is out that we could
eliminate the differences that still exist,'' Reagan said. But
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.
   After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered their
negotiators to return to Geneva on July 12 to work on a proposed
treaty to cut superpower nclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50
percent.
   Gorbachev told reporters ``it is still possible to sign an
agreement in this administration.'' Reagan said, ``Conversations
are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say
progress is still being made or we wouldn't be talking as we are.''
   In a 24-page joint statement, the two leaders announced
``achievement of substantial additional common ground'' on two of
the five major disputed areas on the proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), ways of monitoring mobile missiles and
counting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on warplanes.
   But U.S. arms negotiator Edward Rowny said there was ``a lot of
room'' to go in the two areas.
   And he said ``we didn`t get anywhere'' on the two biggest
obstacles to a treaty: keeping track of submarine-fired cruise
missiles and Soviet objections to Reagan's Star Wars
missile-defense program, formally known as the Strategic Defense
Inititiative.
   Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched ahead
on other arms control issues.
   They exchanged ratification protocols for the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces treaty (INF) to eliminate medium-range nuclear
missiles, which was signed at the Washington summit last December
and ratified by the Senate last Friday and by the Soviet assembly
of presidents 17 hours later.
   During the summit, Gorbachev and Reagan also signed two lesser
arms control agreements, one requiring advance notifice of
ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification
procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.
   On the START treaties, U.S. officials said they had restated
opposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles.
   ``It is the position of the United States that such missiles
should be banned unless the United States and the Soviet Union can
reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective
verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear
weapons carried by such missiles,'' U.S. officials said.
   U.S. officials, in a briefing paper given to reporters, said
that acceptable verification rules would require, among other
things, restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas,
means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all such
weapons, and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspected
violations.
   The two sides remained far apart on Star Wars and how to
negotiate reductions in conventional armies.
   ``We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,''
Gorbachev told reporters.
   The Kremlin leader, who has used all four meetings with Reagan
as forums to air his opposition to Star Wars, said he had proposed
resolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspection
of facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is
tested.
   But no strategic arms treaty is possible, he said, without an
agreement assuring that development and deployment of strategic
defenses does not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
And a fifth summit would not be possible without a START deal, he
said.
   On the opening day of the talks, U.S. and Soviet officials said,
Gorbachev suggested to Reagan that they exchange data on
conventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts, as proposed by
the Russians in 1986.
   U.S. officials say they will not directly negotiate conventional
cuts with the Soviets, because the matter must be agreed upon by
the 33 nations taking part in the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   Those talks also include discussion of alleged Soviet violations
of human rights provisions of the original conference accord,
signed in Helsinki in 1975.

<HEAD>US Seeks to Strip Citizenship from Seattle Man Accused of War
Crimes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department moved Wednesday to
strip U.S. citizenship from a Seattle man accused of being part of
an execution squad that murdered unarmed Jews and other civilians
for the Nazis during World War II.
   Valdis Didrichsons concealed his service in the Latvian Security
Auxiliary Police in 1941 and 1942 when he entered the United States
in 1950 under the Displaced Persons Act, the government alleged in
a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle. A native of
Latvia, Didrichsons became a U.S. citizen in August 1956.
   Assisting in persecution makes a person ineligible to immigrate
to the United States and requires revocation of citizenship. The
denaturalization case against Didrichsons is the first step in a
process which could lead to deportation.
   The objective of the Arajs Kommando, as the auxiliary unit was
known, was to assist in the persecution and murder of people
considered to be racially undesirable or enemies of Nazi Germany in
occupied Latvia, said Neal Sher, director of the Justice
Department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special
Investigations.
   Didrichsons assisted in persecution, said the complaint, and
concealed his membership in the Kommando when he applied for
citizenship as well as when he entered the country.
   The Justice Department also has instituted legal proceedings
against Konrads Kalejs of Chicago and Mikelis Kirsteins of
Syracuse, N.Y., who allegedly served with Didrichsons in the
Kommando in 1941.

   Delegates to a special United Nations
session on disarmament on Wednesday urged the United States and the
Soviet Union to ban underground weapons tests and scrap their
nuclear arsenals.
   Speakers began addressing the special session as President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev concluded their Moscow
summit meeting with an impasse on achieving major cuts in strategic
nuclear weapons.
   But the assembly praised the superpower treaty eliminating
intermediate-range nuclear weapons as a breakthrough because it
scraps a whole class of nuclear weapons for the first time.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden called for complete
nuclear disarmament and said the use of nuclear arms could threaten
the survival of civilization.
   ``One cannot reach peace by frightening other countries,'' he
said.
   ``The United Nations could and should have a central role in the
sphere of disarmament, and is the most appropriate organization to
carry out verification functions on behalf of the international
community,'' he said.
   It can provide unique services, as a repository of data and
source of impartial observers and experts, he said.
   He called for 50 percent cuts in strategic weapons, complete
abolition of all tactical nuclear weapons, prevention of a nuclear
arms race in outer space, a comprehensive nuclear test ban, the
signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and the removal of
nuclear weapons from naval vessels.
   Carlsson also condemned the use of chemical weapons in the
Iran-Iraq war and said the buildup of anti-personnel lasers also
must be stopped.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan, the only nation that
has been the target of an atomic attack, said his people pray for
disarmament. Japan's constitution prohibits the presence or
development of nuclear weapons.
   Takeshita announced that Japan plans to convene an international
conference with the United Nations to share Japanese technology in
seismology to verify nuclear testing. He said it could serve as
step toward establishing a global system for verification of
nuclear testing.
   He said Japan would increase its assistance to the United
Nations to prevent conflicts, noting that Japan recently
contributed $20 million to the United Nations, including $5 million
for use in Afghanistan where the world body mediated a settlement.
   The Japanese leader said he was considering the dispatch of
personnel for election supervision, transportation, communication
and medical services to Afghanistan.
   President Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe delivered the opening
address as chairman of the non-aligned movement. He condemned the
superpowers for the nuclear arms race and said military spending
should be diverted to development.
   He said the international community must work toward achieving a
nuclear-free world with the help of the United Nations and the
multilateral Conference on Disarmament.
   Mugabe called for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty _ a
measure opposed by the United States _ and he opposed the
militarization of outer space _ a reference to the U.S. space-based
missile defense initiative, or ``Star Wars.'' He called for the
establishment of nuclear-free zones, including Africa.
   More than 25 heads of state and government will address the
159-member General Assembly in the next two weeks in the third
special session on disarmament in 10 years. The world body then
will adopt resolutions on disarmament, from nuclear to chemical,
and steps to achieve it.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev acknowledged after five days of summit talks Wednesday
that they remain divided by ``serious differences'' over efforts to
end regional conflicts from Central America to the Middle East.
   Nonetheless, U.S. officials held out hope for progress in
southern Africa, and the two leaders cited the Soviet pullout from
Afghanistan as an example of what the superpowers can achieve if
they work together with warring factions.
   Gorbachev sent a strong signal that Soviet forces withdrawing
from Afghanistan would return fire if subjected to continuing
attacks from Moslem rebels battling the Soviet-backed government in
Kabul.
   ``We shall react accordingly and appropriately,'' said
Gorbachev, referring to recent assaults on Soviet troops and the
Soviet Embassy in Kabul. ``That should be absolutely clear.''
   The Soviets disclosed last week that more than 13,000 of their
troops had been killed since they intervened in Afghanistan in
December 1979.
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said Gorbachev raised the issue of attacks on
withdrawing troops directly with Reagan this week. On Saturday, the
Soviet Foreign Ministry publicly protested continued arms shipments
to the Afghan rebels from Pakistan.
   Another U.S. official, also speaking privately: ``We'll stand by
Pakistan.''
   Soviet chief of staff Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev was reported to
have presented a detailed plan for withdrawal of the estimated
115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan, indicating that Moscow
intends to abide by the Geneva agreement to remove all its forces
by Feb. 15.
   The final communique issued by Reagan and Gorbachev said their
talks had ``revealed serious differences both in the assessments of
the causes of regional tensions and in the means to overcome them.''
   The leaders were able to agree only ``that these differences
need not be an obstacle to constructive interaction'' on regional
conflicts, the statement said.
   In other developments:
   _ Gorbachev told a televised post-summit news conference that
the Soviets are ready to consider restoring diplomatic relations
with Israel once an international conference on the Middle East is
convened. But he said several issues yet to be resolved included
Palestinian participation in the conference and topics to be
discussed.
   The Soviet Union and all its Eastern bloc allies except Romania
severed ties with Israel in 1967 over the Six Day War. The Kremlin
sent a consular delegation to Israel last year, and other East
European nations have strengthened their ties with the Jewish state
in recent months.
   _ A U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said summit talks on southern Africa went well. He said the two
sides set a September deadline for completing a complex deal
involving withdrawal of 40,000 Cuban troops from Angola and
reconciliation of that country's Marxist government and U.S.-backed
guerrillas.
   Another potential area of U.S.-Soviet cooperation may involve
locating the 311 Soviet troops reported missing in action in
Afghanistan. Reagan signaled U.S. willingness to help, and
Gorbachev said Wednesday that contacts had been made with U.S. and
Pakistani officials in behalf of the MIAs.
   On the Middle East, Gorbachev said that ``there has been a
drawing closer of our positions,'' citing agreement that an
international conference is needed.
   ``We've given the Americans several years of opportunity to go
it alone'' in the Middle East, Gorbachev said. ``They saw that they
couldn't.''
   Other conflicts discussed by the two leaders and their
delegations included Central America and the Iran-Iraq war.
   The Reagan administration has tried to persuade the Soviets to
support an arms embargo against Iran and Iraq but Moscow has
hesitated. U.S. officials say Kremlin leaders want to avoid souring
future relations with neighboring Iran.

   Animal rights officials are
investigating a complaint that a teacher used a shovel to beat an
opossum and five of its babies to death.
   The incident marks the second time in two years a teacher at
Greater New Bedford Voc-Tech High School has been investigated for
killing an opossum.
   In May 1986, the executive direcor of the Animal Rescue League
in New Bedford, sought charges against a chef-instructor at the
school for butchering an opossum for a cooking demonstration. But a
judge refused to bring charges.
   An investigator for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals went to the school Tuesday after an anonymous
complaint, according to Stephen J. Torre, director of the law
enforcement department for the Boston-based organization.
   Cruelty to animals is a criminal offense. If the killing is
found to be done with malicious intent, the penalty can be up to
$500 in fines or one year in prison, or both.
   The investigator retrieved the animals' bodies from a school
trash bin. They were mangled and one of the babies had been
decapitated, Torre said.
   Jeffrey E. Riley, superintendent-director at the regional
vocational-technical high school, said Tuesday he had heard reports
of the incident and was investigating. He declined to comment
further.
   Officials refused to identify the teacher.

<TEXT>
   A pro-government newspaper Wednesday
published what it claimed was a 2-year-old U.S. document calling
for the destabilization of Panama and refusal to turn over the
Panama Canal in 1999.
   The U.S. Embassy called the publication of the alleged 1986 U.S.
National Security Council document in the newspaper Critica ``an
obvious and gross falsification'' and ``a continuation of the
permanent campaign of propaganda of the Noriega regime against the
United States of America.''
   The paper said the document was ``secret and sensitive'' and
that only seven copies were made for distribution at an NSC meeting
April 8, 1986. The newspaper said President Reagan took part in the
meeting, although the reproduction of the alleged document made no
mention of Reagan.
   The reproduction of the document said, ``The basic issue is
still to guarantee U.S. control over the interoceanic waterway,
keeping it free from Soviet influence, after the year 2000.''
   It said the Panamanian government might be exposed to Cuban and
Soviet intervention after the United States turns over the canal.
   ``Reports of corruption among (some Panamanian officers) provide
an opportunity to launch a campaign to destabilize Panama and
legitimately abrogate the treaties,'' said the reproduction, which
contains several mispellings and typographical errors.
   The Panama Canal Treaties returned the Panama Canal Zone to
Panama in 1977 and call for Panama to take over the waterway itself
at the end of 1999.
   Since the United States and Panama began a dispute about a year
ago, Panamanan officials often have accused the United States of
planning to back out of the agreement.
   The United States is seeking to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who is head of the 15,000-member Panama Defense Forces and
the power behind the civilian government. Noriega was indicted in
February by a federal grand jury in Florida on drug smuggling
charges.
   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions on
Panama in an effort to force Noriega's ouster.

   Presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson
walked on a garbage-covered beach Wednesday and called on
corporations and the federal government to battle pollution more
vigorously.
   Jackson's campaign stop capped five days of seeking votes in New
Jersey, which has its primary next Tuesday. The biggest delegate
prize on that day is California, though, and the Democratic
contender headed back to that state late Wednesday.
   In New Jersey, stepping over broken glass, plastic bottles,
fast-food containers and a woman's shoe, Jackson described this
one-time popular resort beach along the Arthur Kill as an example
of ``economic and environmental violence.''
   ``If the Russians were poisoning our air, if they were dumping
sludge in the water, if they were killing fish, we would call that
chemical warfare and we would negotiate tough,'' said Jackson.
   Nearly all the trash on the beach here, including such hospital
waste as used syringes and plasma bags, floats across from the
Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, N.Y., and residents speak
harshly of New York's disposal practices.
   But Jackson said corporations and the federal government were
most to blame for the pollution. He said that cleaning up the shore
and toxic waste dumps would create jobs and protect the public's
health.
   ``This idea that it's coming from one state to another is one
focus. But in my judgment it's too narrow a focus,'' said Jackson.
``The federal government has an obligation. We must invest in
recycliong plants. We must challenge these corporations and offer
them incentives to build these recycling plants.''
   Jackson, who lags far behind Democratic front-runner Michael
Dukakis in New Jersey polls, used his stay in the state to further
define what he would want at the party convention in Atlanta.
   On Wednesday, he said the party needs him if it wants a victory
in November and said again he deserves consideration as vice
president should he not get the presidential nomination.
   Dukakis, campaigning in New Jersey over the Memorial Day
weekend, also called for stepped-up efforts to battle ocean
pollution. Jackson, asked how he differed from Dukakis on
environmental issues, said the Massachusetts governor's reputation
as a good manager is not enough to battle pollution.
   ``I take the position that we cannot just manage these
corporations as they exist. Their behavior must change. They must
be much more accountable,'' said Jackson.
   As he walked along the beach, a helicopter from the
Environmental Protection Agency skimmed the water. Local officials
said they had never seen one before.
   Jackson attributed the helicopter's arrival to ``Action
Jackson,'' a phrase he urges crowds to chant during rallies, and
said the agency has been ineffective against polluters.
   Richard Cahill, a spokesman for the EPA in New York, said the
helicopter was part of the agency's routine shore monitoring
program and its appearance Wednesday was coincidental.

   Some human rights observers questioned
President Reagan's assertion Wednesday that Soviet emigration
barriers are the result of bureaucratic bungling, but gave the
president high marks overall on his handling of the issue at the
Moscow summit.
   ``It's really hard to know where Reagan was coming from on
that,'' said Dawn Mann, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, an independent policy research institute.
``The fact that there still are several hundred prisoners of
conscience is not attributable to bureaucratic snafus.''
   At his news conference in Moscow, Reagan said emigration
barriers may arise from a Kremlin ``bound in by bureaucracy,''
rather than deliberate Soviet policy.
   ``I think it's unfortunate ... that the president was not more
direct about the real reasons for human rights violations in the
Soviet Union,'' said Juliana Pilon, a Soviet scholar at the
conservative Heritage Foundation. ``After all, who is he kidding?
... It just isn't true.''
   But a Democratic congressman who studies human rights issues,
Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., dismissed Reagan's comments as stemming
from a desire not to criticize his host too harshly while still in
the Soviet Union. ``I think it was more protocol'' than timidity on
human rights, said Yatron, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
human rights subcommittee.
   ``I can think of no one in Congress or the administration who
feels that Moscow's repressive policies are not the results of the
repressive nature of a communist government,'' Yatron said. ``I
would want to give the president the benefit of the doubt.''
   Reagan's comment, which declined to pin responsibilty for
emigration denials directly on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
really was a skillful diplomatic gesture, said Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., the senior Republican on Yatron's panel.
   ``That gives wiggle room for Gorbachev to react, and without
confrontational demands,'' Solomon said. ``I'm confident that it
will work.''
   Solomon and others said overall, Reagan had made human rights a
far higher priority at this fourth summit meeting than at previous
meetings with Gorbachev, and predicted improvements in Soviet
emigration and other human rights areas.
   ``I thought he was very forceful in his presentation of human
rights,'' Yatron said. ``I am cautiously optimistic that the
president's aggressive posture will spark more reforms.''
   ``We couldn't have hoped for more as a human rights
organization,'' said Jeri Laber of Helsinki Watch in New York.
``The president has certainly made this an important issue'' by
meeting with dissidents in the Soviet Union and making strong
statements about U.S. human rights values.
   But she said being diplomatic isn't always the best approach
when dealing with such an issue of inalienable rights. ``You've got
to be vocal and verbal and insistent, even to the point of
irritating'' those you are dealing with, said Laber. ``We recognize
he has a balancing act to do. Given all of that, he's done a very
good job.''
   ``Only time will tell,'' said Mann. ``If more people are
released in the next several weeks, if there are concrete actions,
then we can say Reagan was right to have been so tactful. There's
so much that we don't know.''

   Mississippi Gulf Coast officials say they
hope a good share of Republican National Convention delegates
traveling to New Orleans will also drop in on the bordering
Magnolia state.
   Republicans crowding New Orleans for the Aug. 15-18 convention
will receive delegate packets that promote Mississippi attractions
along with those in the host city.
   ``We have always wanted to include the Gulf Coast, especially
since it is only an hour away,'' said Peggy Wilson, chairwoman of
the convention's media and hospitality committee. ``I have gone to
Mississippi to let the Mississippi people feel this is their
convention.''
   Since Vice President George Bush has locked up the GOP
presidential nomination, delegates will have more free time to
visit Mississippi attractions, said Sen. Bob Usey of Gulfport,
Bush's coast campaign coordinator.
   ``New Orleans can only offer so much. I think we will be
pleasantly surprised,'' he added.

   Orders to U.S. factories surged for the second
consecutive month in April, the government said Wednesday,
indicating that U.S. manufacturing plants will be humming in the
months ahead.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods rose a strong 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $218.7
billion in April. The advance followed an even bigger 1.6 percent
increase in March.
   ``The boom-like conditions in factory America continue pretty
much unabated,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   There was no change in order levels in February and a modest 0.6
percent drop in January. But that was one of only two declines in
the past year.
   Most economists had been forecasting only modest growth in new
orders of 0.5 percent in April. The bigger-than-expected number
likely will do little to alleviate concern among some analysts that
strong demand, particularly for exports, will trigger greater
inflation.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, noted the continuing increase
in the backlog of unfilled orders, indicating manufacturers have
been getting more orders than they can meet.
   ``This should be good news for production in coming months,''
Wyss said.
   The backlog of $418.1 billion was 10.8 percent higher than a
year ago. It jumped by 1 percent in April following a smaller
increase of 0.4 percent in March.
   The strength in new orders in April came in electrical
machinery, lumber and wood products and in petroleum, chemicals and
paper.
   The department revised its estimate of new orders for durable
goods, ``big ticket items'' expected to last three or more years,
to $116.4 billion, up 1.0 percent. The previous estimate for April,
released 10 days ago, was 0.8 percent. The gain in March had been
0.8 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods increased 1.5 percent to $102.2
billion in April following a 2.5 percent rise a month earlier.
   Excluding the volatile category of military goods, orders were
up 1.2 percent in April, the third consecutive increase and the
sixth rise in seven months.
   Defense goods rose 2.2 percent to $10.0 billion in April,
following a whopping 14.6 percent rise in March.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a
barometer of business expansion plans, rose 1.9 percent in April to
$33.1 billion, following a drop of 3.8 percent.
   Analysts are looking for businesses to boost capital spending to
meet the rising demand abroad for U.S. goods, which have become
more competitively priced because of the devalued dollar.
   Orders for electrical machinery climbed 4.2 percent, following a
3.8 percent slide in March. Most of the April strength in that
category came from a large 25.4 percent rise in orders for
communication equipment, most of them from the Defense Department.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel declined 0.3 percent in
April, while orders for transportation equipment climbed a slight
0.1 percent and non-electrical machinery fell 0.6 percent.
   Shipments of manufactured goods were unchanged at $214.6 billion
in April following a 2.7 percent increase in March.

   A tentative settlement reached in a
sex discrimination case against a citrus grower calls for a payment
of $550,000 to women who alleged foremen forced them to trade sex
for job security.
   However, the settlement reached Tuesday has to be approved by a
federal judge and potential plaintiffs in the suit, which attorneys
for the six original plaintiffs say may be broadened to a class
action.
   Some of the six also are part of a 44-person racial
discrimination suit filed against Caulkins Groves in Martin County.
No trial date has been set.
   Caulkins lawyer J. David Richeson said that under the agreement,
the grower admits no guilt by settling the case.
   Under the tentative agreement, Caulkins' insurers would pay
$550,000 in a lump sum to the six women who sued in 1986, alleging
they were regularly forced to trade sex for job security, shuffled
into lower-paying, hard-working jobs and denied advancement.
   Caulkins, a limited partnership based at Indiantown, owns citrus
groves, a feed mill, a juice plant that makes concentrate and a car
dealership.
   From the late 1960s or early 1970s, women employees have given
statements saying they were raped by grove foremen. The latest
incident occurred in 1980.

   Hundreds of factory workers smashed windows and
furniture at the Finance Ministry on Wednesday to press demands in
a labor dispute, and police dispersed them with tear gas.
   Police said five officers were slightly injured. Army radio said
15 protesters were injured by inhaling tear gas and several
ministry employees were hit by broken glass. Israel radio said 16
protesters were arrested.
   ``We didn't intend to break into the ministry,'' Moshe Levy,
head of the workers' committee, said on Israel television. ``We are
sorry for what happened. It was just all the anger and frustration
coming out.''
   Violence began after 400 workers from Beit Shemesh Engines held
an authorized demonstration outside the ministry. A few started
burning tires, pelted the building with stones and eggs, then used
an overturned garbage can to force open the door, Israel radio said.
   ``The workers did not obey our orders and overturned a police
barrier,'' said police Lt. Alex Lapidot. ``Then several dozen broke
into the ministry, smashing windows and plants.''
   Police fired tear gas about 15 minutes later, Lapidot said.
Paramilitary border police and mounted police were called to assist.
   ``We do not fear tear gas!'' Levy shouted through a megaphone as
he led the workers to another rally outside the nearby Parliament
building. No further violence was reported.
   The workers were protesting the breakdown of talks on
compensation for 260 workers laid off at the plant, Israel's
largest producer of aircraft engines.
   Victor Medina, deputy director of the Finance Ministry, told
Israel radio the demands of the workers were ``highly exaggerated''
and could not be met.

   Here is a transcript of Soviet Communist Party
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev's remarks Wednesday on
exchanging documents with President Reagan putting the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty into effect.
   Esteemed Mr. Reagan, distinguished ladies and gentleman,
comrades.
   We are approaching the end of the meeting between the leaders of
the Soviet Union and the United States of America, the fourth such
meeting in three years. The visit of the United States president to
our country is drawing to a close.
   The president and I have summed up the results of a dialogue
between our two countries at the highest level. We have discussed
both the immediate and the longer term prospects for Soviet-US
relations.
   We have signed documents which record what has been achieved and
provide guidelines for the future. Among them, a historic place
will belong to the ratification documents which give effect to the
treaty and intermediate and shorter range missiles.
   The exchange a few minutes ago of the instruments of
ratification, means that the era of nuclear disarmament has begun.
   Assessing the work done over these past few days, we can state
our satisfaction, say what has been happening these few days in
Moscow is big politics, politics that effect the interests of
millions and millions of people.
   Each such meting dealt a blow at the foundations of Cold War.
Each of them made huge breaches in the Cold War fortress and opened
up passages to modern, civilized world politics worthy of the truly
new times.
   But big politics means difficult politics, in which every step
is not easy to take. Weighing carefully each one of our new steps,
we measure it against the security interests of our two nations and
of the world as a whole, for that is the only way to achieve truly
substantial results with the necessary margin of viability.
   Big politics also means big responsibility, and so it cannot be
built on pursuing one's own interest, which is always inherently
one-sided.
   Such politics also needs a great idea. Humankind has conceived
that idea in the pangs of wars and disasters, tragedies and
calamities, strivings and discoveries of the 20th century.
   This, is in our view, is the idea of a nuclear-free and
non-violent world. It is that idea that is inscribed in the mandate
which the Soviet people give to their representatives at the start
to any negotiations. This particularly applies to our negotiations
with the United States of America.
   Addressing the Soviet people and the Americans, addressing all
nations from these hallowed steps of the Moscow Kremlin, I hereby
declare we have been working honestly and with perseverance, and we
shall continue to do so, to fulfill that historic mandate.
   The first lines have already been written into the book of a
world without violence and wars and nuclear weapons. I believe that
no one can now close that book and put it aside.
   President Ronald Reagan and I have agreed that the immediate
task before us, which is to conclude a treaty on 50 percent
reduction in strategic offensive arms, can and must be accomplished.
   In our joint endeavors and discussions we have learned to
understand each other better, to take into account each others
concerns and to search for solutions.
   The atmosphere in our relations is improving. We are working to
make it a constant, not only in our official contacts, but also in
the day-to-day management of Soviet-US relations. In this, too, we
are guided by a mandate from our peoples.
   Thanks to the atmosphere of the meetings in Washington and
Moscow, and as a result of agreements reached, Americans and Soviet
people now have more opportunities for communication and for
getting to know each other. I'm convinced that scientists,
students, schoolchildren, cultural personalities, ordinary
tourists, athletes, and of course businessmen will continue to
enlarge and add new colors to the fabric of cooperative and even
friendly relations. Sometimes they can do that better than
politicians.
   Historians who will one day describe and evaluate what is now
being done have probably not yet been born. But every day babies
are being born who will live in the 21st century, and to whom we
must bequeath a safe and humane world.
   On behalf of the Soviet leadership and the Soviet people, I wish
to tell all those who are concerned and yet hopeful about the
future, we shall work to achieve that goal. And we can only do it
by working together.
   Thank you.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's remarks
Wednesday after he and Mikhail Gorbachev exchanged instruments of
ratification on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Mr. General Secretary, these are historic moments. As we
exchange these documents, the instruments of ratification on this
treaty, the terms of which we formally agreed to last December in
Washington enters into force. Mr. General Secretary, you know that
our way here has not been easy. At crucial moments, your personal
intervention was needed and proved decisive. And for this we are
grateful.
   So too, Mr. General Secretary, you are aware of how important
the objective, not just of arms control, but of arms reduction, has
been to my own thinking and to the policy of my administration
since its outset. Seven years ago, when I first suggested the
concept of a double zero treaty, there were those who said that
this was so unrealistic an idea that it was irresponsible to even
propose it. Others simply dismissed the proposals as a propaganda
ploy or a geopolitical gambit. Skepticism and doubt bring a barren
harvest. Today, on this table before us, we see the fruits of hope,
evidence of what candor and realism can accomplish. We have dared
to hope, Mr. General Secretary, and we have been rewarded.
   For the first time in history, an entire class of U.S.-Soviet
nuclear missiles is eliminated. In addition, this treaty provides
for the most stringent verification in history. And for the first
time in history, inspection teams are actually in residence in our
respective countries. But while this treaty makes possible a new
dimension of cooperation between us, much remains on our agenda. We
must not stop here, Mr. General Secretary. There is much more to be
done. As will be seen in our joint statement later today, more
progress has been made toward a strategic arms treaty during our
meetings. We must try to move forward in the months ahead to
complete this START treaty as soon as possible. So let us continue
to expand the frontiers of trust, even as we verify, Mr. General
Secretary, even as we verify.
   Mr. General Secretary, we have agreed many times that there
remain differences _ important, fundamental differences _ between
us. Yet as we work over the long run to narrow these differences,
as we work for what I hope will be a new era of peace and expanded
human freedom, we must also acknowledge our solemn responsibility
to take steps now to reduce the chances of conflict and to prevent
war. This we have done today, the first step toward a brighter
future, a safer world.
   America's allies and friends welcome this treaty too. We
consulted them fully during its negotiation. We made clear that we
would never put their security or their interests at risk, that on
the contrary we would sign a treaty only if it enhanced their
security, as this one does.
   And, finally, if I may, I would like to take a moment to thank
the United States Senate for their work on this treaty. The way of
democracy is sometimes a complicated way, sometimes trying. But it
is a good way and, we believe, the best way. And once again, Mr.
General Secretary, I want to extend to you and to all those to who
labored hard for this moment, my warmest personal thanks.

<HEAD>Congress Urged To Regulate Test-Tube Baby Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians are overpromising success to women
desperate to have children and there is need for congressional
oversight of the $30 million to $40 million test-tube baby
industry, Congress was told Wednesday.
   ``Under the best of circumstances, infertile couples already
face invasive medical procedures, the risk of dangerous
complications and low success rates,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
``Frustrated couples, many at an emotional breaking point,
shouldn't also have to face those who would exploit their faith in
modern medicine.''
   Wyden, chairman of the House Small Business subcommittee on
regulation and business opportunities, said he wants to determine
what role the government should play in protecting would-be parents
from unscrupulous clinics.
   He called attention to a recent study that found more than half
of the 169 clinics in the United States performing in-vitro
fertilization (IVF) in 1987 never produced a baby.
   ``Despite advances in technology and the claims made by some
clinics, the chance of having a baby from IVF still hovers at one
in ten,'' Wyden said. ``This slim opportunity costs most couples
thousands of dollars. The subcommittee has heard of couples
spending over $22,000 without yielding a baby in the bassinet.''
   The infertility study for the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment showed Americans spent $1 billion last year to combat
infertility.
   Gary Ellis, who directed the OTA study, told the subcommittee
the chances of becoming clinically pregnant _ when a fetus's
heartbeat is detected by ultrasound machines _ is about 17 percent,
and a woman still faces a one in three chance that the pregnancy is
ectopic or that it will end in a miscarriage or stillbirth. An
ectopic pregnancy is one outside the uterus.
   Therefore, he said, a woman's chance of taking home a test-tube
baby is about 6 percent.
   He said that infertility, generally defined as the inability of
a couple to conceive after 12 months of intercourse without
contraception, affects an estimated 2.4 million married couples and
an unknown number of would-be parents among unmarried couples and
singles.
   Wyden's subcommittee also heard from a woman, Vicki Eckhardt,
who said a fertility expert over a four-year span told her seven
times that she was pregnant, but that each time would find the
fetus had been ``absorbed.'' Her husband, Bill, said they had spent
$35,000 on infertility treatments, only to learn from another
doctor that Mrs. Eckhardt probably never had been pregnant.
   The doctor, she said, ``out and out lied to use, telling us I
was pregnant.
   ``Each time I felt like I had failed again, that my own body was
killing our baby,'' Mrs. Eckhardt said. ``But then I would get that
little urge again and want a baby so badly that I would go through
anything.
   ``It's hard to explain to other people, but when you want a baby
so badly and you're afraid you may never be able to have one, it's
all you can think about. It affects the way you see the whole
world.''

<TEXT>
   Mental health advocates filed suit Wednesday
against Gov. Michael Dukakis and his top budget officer, contending
spending cuts ordered to balance the state budget were
unconstitutional and would delay community placement of state
hospital patients.
   The suit by the Alliance for the Mentally Ill said human
services programs bear too much of the burden in the cancellation
of nearly $250 million in planned state spending for the fiscal
year that ends June 30.
   The suit, filed with the state Supreme Court, also asserted that
Dukakis and state Secretary of Administration and Finance Fran
Keefe acted unconstitutionally in rolling back spending without the
approval of the Legislature.
   The alliance asked for an injunction prohibiting the Dukakis
administration from ordering the ``reversions'' _ cuts that do not
affect basic services but cancel or trim planned program expansion.
   No hearing date was set.
   Dukakis, whose state budget problems have become an issue in his
Democratic presidential campaign, has defended his administration's
record in aiding the mentally ill.
   He has said the past three years have seen ``the most
significant expansion in the history of the state'' in spending for
the mentally ill.
   ``We'll do everything we can to make sure patient care is first
class in our state hospitals,'' Dukakis said. ``That is a
commitment I feel very strongly.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pregnancy and abortion rates in the United
States are among the highest found in a new study of Western
nations, averaging 2.56 pregnancies and 0.76 abortions for each
woman of reproductive age.
   Only Greece and Ireland showed higher pregnancy rates, with 4.33
and 3.23 respectively, in the study of 17 industrialized countries.
   Greece also had a higher abortion rate, 2.24, as did Italy, with
0.80, according to researchers at The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a
New York organization that studies fertility issues.
   The study appears in the current issue of the institute's Family
Planning Perspectives.
   The lowest pregnancy rates appeared in West Germany, with 1.64,
and the Netherlands, with 1.68. The lowest abortion rates were in
Ireland, with 0.15, and the Netherlands, with 0.18.
   Abortion is outlawed by Ireland and another nation in the study,
Belgium, although abortions are still relatively easy to to obtain
in Belgium, the researchers wrote. Substantial limitations are
imposed by Australia, West Germany, Greece, and New Zealand, the
scientists said.
   The other countries in the survey were Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. The study
was based on the year of most recent abortion data, which was 1983
for the United States.
   Researchers also compared contraceptive use among the 17 nations
plus Australia, Portugal and Spain.
   Some method of contraception was used in 1982 by about 54
percent of American women of reproductive age, defined as ages 15
to 44, researchers said. That level ranked relatively low, along
with those of Portugal and Spain.
   About 37 percent of the American women used a contraceptive
pill, an intra-uterine device or male or female sterilization, a
``medium'' level of use in comparison to the other countries. That

   Golf is coming to the Soviet Union, thanks to
industrialist Armand Hammer. But don't expect to see many Russians
out on the links.
   The game is so foreign to people in this country that an
interpreter, announcing Hammer's support for an 18-hole course, had
to explain that golf ``is played with a little ball.''
   Hammer, the chairman of Occidental Petroleum with long and close
ties to leaders in the Soviet Union, said he will provide the
foreign currency to help build the country's first golf course.
   The par-72 course will be part of the Nachabino Sports Area
outside of Moscow. The state agency that supervises facilities for
foreign diplomats is sponsoring the course, which is expected to
open in 1991.

   To get American military forces out of the
Philippines Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev should offer much
more than shutting down the biggest Soviet overseas base at Cam
Ranh Bay, Vietnam, U.S. military strategist Brent Scowcroft said
Wednesday.
   A Cam Ranh-Philippines tradeoff by the superpowers ``would be
very much in the Soviet interest but not necessarily ours,'' said
Scowcroft, a retired air force lieutenant general and national
security adviser in the Ford administration.
   ``The Russians don't need that (Cam Ranh) nearly as much as we
do the Philippines,'' he said.
   Scowcroft spoke at a news conference marking the issuance of a
new expert study on forthcoming U.S.-Philippines base negotiations
produced for the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, a non-profit,
non-partisan organization.
   The study noted that the massive Soviet military presence at Cam
Ranh Bay is used as justification for the U.S. military presence in
the Philippines and vice versa. Analysts have said Gorbachev's July
1986 Asian policy speech suggesting a U.S. pullout from the
Philippines implied an offer to reduce the Soviet presence in
Vietnam.
   The Philippine bases, Clark Field air base and Subic Bay naval
station, are vital for deploying U.S. forces to the Indian Ocean
and Persian Gulf while ``the Soviets can get to the Indian Ocean
through the back door'' from the other direction, Scowcroft said.
   He predicted that practical benefits to both countries are
likely to result in enough accomodation to produce a new
U.S.-Philippines base agreement when the current one expires in
1991. ``There is a fair chance that cool heads will prevail,'' he
said.
   Scowcroft and Prof. Fred Greene, a Williams College Asian
affairs expert and editor of the 155-page study, emphasized that
the issues are complex, tangled and emotional.
   Ever since 1947, Washington has handled base arrangements with
the Philippines through executive agreements requiring majority
votes in Congress for implementation.
   However, a two-thirds Senate vote is required to ratify a
treaty, and many in the Philippines are demanding this form for the
next base agreement so as to highlight Philippine sovereignty and
U.S. payment obligations, Greene said.
   That would play into the hands of American senators and others
``who for budget or policy reasons would like to have reductions
around the world, especially if the Philippines insists on a
treaty,'' Greene said.
   Estimating that 20 percent of Filipinos oppose the bases, he
said many are ``very intense and eloquent'' in their opposition.

   Acting Deputy Attorney General Harold
Christensen said Wednesday he believes Attorney General Edwin Meese
III will remain at the Justice Department until the end of the
Reagan administration.
   During his first day on the job, Christensen said ``I don't have
any sense of crisis at all'' and that the department ``is
functioning well,'' despite a wave of departures in the past few
months.
   As the No. 2 official at the agency, Christensen will be in
charge this week at the Justice Department with Meese leaving on a
three-day trip to Munich, West Germany, for a meeting with law
enforcement officials.
   Asked whether he had any reservations when first approached
about coming to the department in view of Meese's ongoing legal
problems, Christensen told reporters: ``I had no qualms then and I
don't have any today.''
   Christensen is filling the post on an acting basis pending the
Senate confirmation process and said he thinks it unlikely he will
wind up running the Justice Department.
   While he has not discussed Meese's plans with the attorney
general, ``my personal perception'' is that he will ``stay through
Jan. 20 ... the attorney general will complete the Reagan
administration,'' Christensen said.
   On Monday night, Meese left open the possibility that he may
resign before Labor Day, but said he first wants to respond to
allegations concerning his ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   Independent counsel James McKay, who has been conducting a
criminal investigation of Meese for the past year, is expected to
issue a report this month raising questions about Meese's ethical
conduct. The questions are to be referred to the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility for review.
   Christensen said ``I have no intention'' of meeting with former
Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and ex-criminal division chief
William Weld, who resigned in protest March 29 over Meese's
continued tenure.
   ``I just want to discharge the responsibilities of my job, which
I perceive as day-to-day administration of the Justice Department
under the direction of General Meese,'' said Christensen, a Utah
trial lawyer.

<HEAD>Ag Exports for March Highest Since December 1984</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. farm exports in March climbed to a
3{-year high of 14.8 million tons valued at $3.3 billion, the
Agriculture Department announced Wednesday.
   ``Agriculture is making an important contribution to the trade
balance of the United States,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng said in a speech to the National Press Club before the figures
were released.
   In his remarks, Lyng predicted around $33 billion in export
sales this year and a positive farm trade balance of perhaps $12
billion.
   March exports easily topped figures for the same month last
year, which were 11.4 million tons valued at $2.4 billion. It was
the best monthly performance since December 1984.
   The nation posted an agricultural trade surplus in March of
$1.38 billion, the fifth straight month that the balance sheet has
been $1 billion or more in the black, the department said. It said
the March surplus was the largest since December 1984 also.
   Fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through March totaled 77.3
million tons valued at $17.8 billion, USDA said. It said that
represented an increase of 13.6 million tons and $3.3 billion from
the same period last year.
   Agriculture Department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988
exports totaling 145.5 million tons and valued at $33.5 billion.
That represents an increase over initial estimates. The higher
forecasts are due to additional sales of animal and horticultural
products, as well as wheat, feeds and fodders and soybeans.
   Animal products are likely to set a record of $5.6 billion,
attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides, skins, red
meats and fats, the department said.
   Exports are expected to be 16 million tons and $5.6 billion
higher than fiscal 1987, the department said. It attributed the
bulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitor
nations and the Export Enhancement Program.
   The Export Enhancement Program, established by Congress in 1985,
pays exporters in government surplus commodities to ship American
grain overseas.
   Meanwhile, the department increased its estimate of U.S.
agricultural imports from $20.5 billion to $21 billion. It said
imports for March totaled $1.95 billion, a gain of $35 million, or
2 percent, over the comparable figure for March 1987. It also was
$24 million, or 1 percent, over the February level.
   Volume of agricultural imports are virtually unchanged since
last year, and fruit juices, nursery products and alcoholic
beverages actually posted declines, the department said. But it
said the lower dollar has pushed up the total import bill.

<HEAD>US Calls Lilly Decision on Herbicide a Setback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly & Co. has dealt a serious setback to
the Reagan administration's anti-cocaine program by refusing to
allow use of a ``safe and effective herbicide'' against
coca-producing areas in South America, the State Department said
Wednesday.
   ``We think the short-term impact is serious,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, alluding to Lilly's decision
last week not to sell to the U.S. government the herbicide
tebuthurion in a coca eradication campaign focused mainly in Peru's
Huallaga Valley.
   She said the firm, which is the sole manufacturer of the
chemical, should reconsider its decision in light of the serious
cocaine problem in the United States. On Capitol Hill, Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla., expressed outrage over Lilly's decision.
   The Indianapolis-based company gave no reason for its decision
in making the announcement last week, citing only ``a number of
practical and policy considerations.''
   But Mrs. Oakley told reporters Lilly apparently was worried
about possible retaliatory measures by ``traffickers or
terrorists.'' The company also had come under pressure from
environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of
the herbicide.
   Mrs. Oakley said the State Department would have preferred to
have worked with the company on resolving its security concerns.
   She said the United States and Latin American governments have
been conducting field tests to identify a safe, effective herbicide
for use against coca for several years.
   Tebuthurion, known informally as ``Spike,'' was considered to be
among the safest and most effective, but no final decision had been
made about which herbicide should be used, Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``According to our information the safety and effectiveness of
spike has been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company.
Numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance
with federal regulations,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for
international narcotics matters, said Lilly made the decision even
though the herbicide has been manufactured for more than 15 years,
has been proven safe by U.S. standards and is widely available in
this country for projects such as clearing brush for rights of way.
   The chemical is sold to other government agencies including the
Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, she said.
   Testifying before a House Government Operations subcommittee
assessing the war on drugs, Ms. Wrobleski said State Department
lawyers are researching whether to propose legislation that would
compel Lilly to sell the State Department the chemical ``in the
vital national interests of the United States government.''
   The safety of Lilly's employees must be weighed against public
concerns about ``the 5 million regular users of cocaine and our
desperate need for a chemical solution to widespread coca
cultivation in the Andes,'' she said.
   English, chairman of the subcommittee, said he was ``stunned and
outraged'' at Lilly and called the company a ``deserter'' in the
war on drugs. He insisted that company representatives appear
before his panel to explain their decision.
   ``We're going to go to any length possible to get our hands on''
the herbicide for use in spraying programs in Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia, Ms. Wrobleski said.
   She said coca crops currently are destroyed by chopping them
down, a slow process that eradicates less than 1 percent of the
total.
   ``Unless we push the chemical button, we cannot dent that
problem appreciably,'' Ms. Wrobleski said.

<HEAD>Nine-Hour Operation to Reattach Boy's Arm Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeons Wednesday gave up trying to reattach
a 5-year-old boy's right arm, torn off at the shoulder, concluding
after nine hours in the operating room that the damage to the limb
and shoulder was too great.
   Fidencio Jaurequi, whose arm became caught in a farm machine
used to sort cherry tomatoes, was in critical condition at Tampa
General Hospital. He was expected to remain in the pediatric
intensive care unit several days.
   Three surgeons from the University of South Florida College of
Medicine spent from 3:15 p.m. Tuesday until 12:20 a.m. in the
operating room.
   ``Preliminary procedures had been performed,'' said Dr. Thomas
E. McKell, vice president of medical affairs. ``Regrettably, the
injury was so severe, with so much destruction of the tissue, that
it was not possible to rejoin the extremity.''
   The child, the son of Salvador and Eustolia Jaurequi of Dade
City, had gone to a barn at Singletary Farms where his mother was
working, according to a co-owner of the 75-acre vegetable farm.
   ``He stuck his arm into the machine'' and it got caught under
the conveyor belt on the roller, said Earl Singletary, who was
outside the barn when the accident occurred Tuesday.
   The severed limb was retrieved from the sorting machine.
   ``I had them put ice on his arm ... and I held a shirt up on his
arm _ that much I knew to do,'' Singletary said.
   Rescue workers arrived 13 minutes after the accident was
reported and packed the limb in ice and a saline solution, said
Pasco County Emergency Services Chief Derryl O'Neal.
   Less than 20 minutes after the accident, the boy and severed arm
were taken by helicopter 45 miles to Tampa General, O'Neal said.
   Three surgeons and three nurses from the hospital's microsurgery
team were called in.
   Singletary said Tuesday that the child should not have been in
the barn.
   ``We don't allow them in the tomato barn for just that reason,''
Singletary said. ``Little kids don't belong around farm machinery.
   ``We have a safety cut-off switch ... but it just happened so
fast,'' he said.

<HEAD>FAA Creating Special Office To Combat Air Drug Trafficking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration plans to
play a greater role in keeping aviation out of the drug trafficking
business, the agency's chief said Wednesday.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor announced he is assigning 13
people within the FAA to a special office that will deal
exclusively with illegal drug trafficking issues.
   ``This is a serious problem and we want to be a serious
player,'' McArtor told reporters after disclosing his anti-drug
plans in a speech to the International Aviation Club.
   McArtor said he wasn't ready to provide details as to exactly
what the new FAA office would do except to say it would coordinate
the agency's efforts to battle the smuggling of illegal drugs by
air.
   ``We're going to be developing their mission as we go along,''
McArtor said, adding that the group may be expanded in the future.
   He said the FAA officials would have no enforcement or police
powers and that he had no intention of confiscating commercial
aircraft should small amounts of drugs be found.
   The Coast Guard and Customs Service recently have been
criticized for confiscating expensive yachts under a ``zero
tolerance'' anti-drug enforcement program when only small amounts
of an illegal drug were found.
   McArtor said the new FAA office would consist of agency security
officers, inspectors and perhaps even air traffic controllers.
   The shift of manpower from the inspector and controller ranks
comes at a time when the FAA has acknowledged shortages in both
areas. McArtor conceded that ``the commitment of 13 people is a big
deal'' for the agency, but that he wants the FAA to ``become a full
player'' in the war against illegal drugs.
   He also suggested the airlines and private pilot groups ``begin
to help police themselves ... to keep (illegal) drugs out of our
industry.''

   Life for John Rambo seems to involve more
death with every adventure.
   Sylvester Stallone's character in ``Rambo III,'' a one-man
fighting machine who fends off an army of Soviets, includes 123
deaths and twice the violence of the previous ``Rambo'' movies, the
National Coalition of Television Violence said.
   The group this week condemned the ``glorification of war and
hatred'' in the 109-minute film.
   ``This film glorifies violence and will promote violent ways of
thinking and behaving in the millions of children, adolescents and
young adults who see this film,'' said coalition psychiatrist
Thomas Radecki.
   ``Rambo III,'' in which the hero goes to Afghanistan to rescue a
friend being held hostage, has grossed $21 million in its first six
days of release.
   Catherine Linclau, a publicist for Carolco Pictures, which
produced the film, was in a meeting Wednesday afternoon and
unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>Aviation Industry Holds Conference In Wake Of Aloha Airlines
Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aviation industry stunned by the in-flight
breakup last month of an Aloha Airlines jet began a formal
re-examination Wednesday of how to ensure that aging aircraft are
kept safe.
   More than 350 representatives from airlines, aircraft
manufacturers, government agencies and various aviation safety
groups launched a three-day conference by debating whether the
industry's approach to maintaining the safety of older planes is
adequate.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor suggested that a central
question which must be resolved is whether to continue the current
philosophy that relies heavily on inspections or shift the focus to
a system of mandatory repairs or, at some point, mandatory aircraft
retirement.
   Concerns about aging aircraft among the commercial airliner
fleets surfaced last month when a 20-foot section of an Aloha
Airlines Boeing 737 tore away at 24,000 feet. A flight attendant
was swept to her death, but the pilots managed to get the plane on
the ground.
   The 19-year-old Aloha plane was one of the oldest Boeing 737s in
service and had accumulated nearly 90,000 takeoffs and landings.
Investigators believe cracking and corrosion in the upper forwared
part of the cabin likely caused the section of the plane to peel
away during flight.
   The central question confronting Wednesday's conference centered
on why the apparent cracking and corrosion on the Aloha plane were
not detected by inspectors. An FAA directive last year had required
closer inspection of older aircraft for cabin skin cracking and
corrosion.
   During the three-day meeting, the industry representatives are
expected to debate whether aircraft design improvements need to be
made and what steps need to be taken to improve the maintenance and
inspection process so that such failures will not occur in the
future.
   ``I think we might find that the procedures are adequate, but
I'm not convinced the procedures are being done with as much
discipline as we might expect,'' McArtor suggested in remarks to
reporters. He said he did not expect any conclusive findings to
come out of the conference, but said it likely will spawn
additional, private sessions in the coming months on the aging
aircraft issue.
   Several members of Congress addressed the group and raised
concerns about the maintenenance of older jetliners.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., suggested that the FAA buy old
jetliners and test them to determine when a plane no longer can be
considred safe.
   ``Only by answering the question `How long can airplanes really
last?' will we be able to put into place guideines which could save
thousands of lives,'' said Glickman.
   But William Hoover of the Air Transport Associaton, the airline
trade group, said that aircraft if properly maintained and
inspected can be flown safely ``throughout their economically
useful life'' and well beyond their design life.
   One of the questions confronting the conference, however, is
whether the industry should continue to use ``economic life'' as
the key factor in determining when a plane should be taken of
service, suggested John Enders, an aviation consultant for the
Flight Safety Foundation.
   As for the heavy emphasis on inspections, Glickman said the
Aloha accident demonstrates the ``inadequacies of the FAA's
maintenance inspection system.'' Aloha Airlines officials have said
repeatedly that they followed all required inspections on the
Boeing 737 that broke apart in flight.
   ``It obviously wasn't sufficient,'' said Enders, the aviation
consultant. ``The (Aloha) inspections were not enough to give the
early warning signs.''

   An AIDS hot line has
expanded from 130 operators to 220 to accommodate a rush of calls
generated in part by an educational pamphlet mailed to 10 million
U.S. homes, officials said.
   ``We're still in the beginning of the rush,'' said Carol
Humphries, coordinator for the National AIDS Hotline in Research
Triangle Park. ``Not everybody in the country has gotten the
pamphlet yet.''
   The government pamphlet ``Understanding AIDS'' forced hot line
officials to recruit operators through advertisements, flyers and
the news media.
   The 24-hour hot line, 1-800-342-AIDS, offers referrals in
English and Spanish for people seeking help in their areas for
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Officials expect 2 million
calls in 1988.
   ``I think we're going to be at full capacity once we get
everyone trained,'' Ms. Humphries said. ``Things have been going
rather smoothly.''
   The hot line is run by the American Social Health Association
under contract with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving it defenseless to
many diseases. It is spread most often through sexual contact,
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. There is no
known cure.

   The Soviet Union has barred the entry of
several Israeli and British lawyers invited to a June 5-7 Moscow
conference on trade and human rights, a Jewish emigration group
said Wednesday.
   Yoram Dinstein, an Israeli expert on emigration, was listed on
the advance meeting schedule as the Western participant _ with two
Soviet lawyers _ in a public discussion of human rights, said Jerry
Goodman, director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   However, Soviet authorities did not grant visas to Dinstein and
three other Israeli legal experts and also barred several
prospective participants from Britain, including David Winter, a
lawyer who has visited the Soviet Union more than 35 times, Goodman
said.
   The Association of Soviet Lawyers and the London-based
International Bar Association are sponsoring the conference,
Goodman said.
   The National Conference on Soviet Jewry issued a statement
quoting the chairman of the group's lawyer's committee, Herbert
Teitelbaum, as saying Dinstein's absence ``will leave the human
rights session without a Western respondent, a situation which
simply cannot be tolerated in the age of purported `glasnost,''' or
openness.
   He said there would be a call for a boycott of the human rights
portion of the conference unless the Soviets grant visas to the
Israelis.
   ``This throwback to a hard-line `pre-glasnost' era is
troublesome, especially on the heels of the just completed
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting, which sought to develop a more
harmonious relationship in many areas,'' Teitelbaum said.
   A man who answered the telephone at the Soviet Embassy said no
spokesmen were available for comment.

   Julie Bryan Moran, a model and television
personality, will be mistress of ceremonies for the 1988 America's
Junior Miss program June 25, organizers announced Wednesday.
   Mrs. Moran represented Georgia in the 1980 Junior Miss program.
   The 52 contestants in this year's pageant arrive in Mobile on
June 12 for rehearsals. The program awards college scholarships and
other prizes to young women from the 50 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico.
   R.C. Lauten, executive vice president of America's Junior Miss,
said the finals will not be televised this year because they will
be held in a small auditorium.
   The finals usually are in the Mobile Municipal Auditorium, which
is undergoing renovations. The finals have been moved to Saenger
Theatre.

   An explosion ripped through a coal
shaft in central West Germany today, killing at least 16 miners and
trapping 40 of their comrades more than 300 feet underground.
   ``There is little hope that other miners can be found alive,''
said Gottfried Milde, the Hesse state interior minister.
   ``It's horrible, my husband is down there!'' said Ingrid Henke,
35. ``My daughters are aged just one and two.''
   One woman who would not give her name, but said her husband was
not in the shaft, said: ``All the women in this part of town are
doing their best to comfort each other.''
   Mayor Bernd Hessler of Borken told a news conference Wednesday
night the bodies of 16 miners had been found and the search
continued for about 40 others.
   What caused the blast had not been determined. Some reports said
explosives stored in the shaft detonated and others said it was due
to a buildup of coal dust.
   ``I have no real hopes. I think we'll have to bury a lot of
people,'' said Klaus Hausmann, a mechanic who has worked at the
mine for 20 years.
   Reports of the number of men trapped in the mine varied
throughout the day, with some officials putting it as high as 60
and others as low as 54. Milde said the total number, including the
confirmed dead, was 56.
   Rescue crews managed to get about 300 feet underground before
the shaft collapsed. ``This reduces the chance of finding many
survivors,'' a police spokesman who requested anonymity told
reporters.
   He said rescue crews were pumping oxygen into the shaft.
   Gerhard Heinz, an engineer for mine owner Preussen Elektra, said
the explosion occurred in a pit between 200 and 450 feet below
ground. Preussen Elektra of Hanover is one of the largest utility
companies in West Germany.

   A Western diplomatic source said today that 28
refusenik cases have not been cleared for emigration, contrary to
information that a Jewish refusenik leader provided earlier to
members of the news media.
   The diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Jewish leader had misunderstood information exchanged at a
meeting of six refuseniks and Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Shifter.
   Yuli Kosharovsky, who has been refused permission to emigrate
for 17 years, said in a telephone interview that the refuseniks
gave Shifter a list of 400 refusenik cases in a meeting Saturday.
   ``The Americans made a presentation about these cases and on 28
of them they received positive answers,'' he said.
   But the diplomatic source said there had been a misunderstanding
in the meeting and that the 28 cases had not been resolved.
   Other Jewish refuseniks said today that more than a dozen
families who previously had been denied permission to emigrate were
told immediately before and during the Moscow summit that they
could leave.
   Refusenik Bella Gulko said the Boris Weinshtock and Iosif
Pilmenshtein families of Moscow had received permission to emigrate
this week, as well as a retiree she only could identify by the last
name Brave.
   She said seven Leningrad families also had receive permission to
emigrate within the past week or 10 days.
   The Soviet decisions seemed to have been related to Reagan's
visit, Mrs. Gulko said, adding that ``usually there are only one or
two'' approvals of exit visas in that length of time.
   It was not known whether any of the names mentioned by Mrs.
Gulko were on Kosharovsky's list.
   Another refusenik leader, Sergei Mkrtchyan, said he was summoned
to the Moscow visa office on Saturday and was given permission to
emigrate on Monday.
   Mkrtchyan is a leader of the ``poor relatives'' group of family
members who refuse to waive financial claims to allow them to
emigrate.
   Mkrtchyan, his wife and year-old daughter demonstrated daily in
downtown Moscow last week. He said he was called to the Moscow visa
office after the last demonstration on Saturday.
   Mkrtchyan said he believed that Reagan's visit ``absolutely''
influenced the Soviet authorities' decision to allow him to leave
the country after he was denied permission for three years. He said
pressure from other Westerners and his own activities also helped.
   Kosharovsky said his list apparently did not include Yuri and
Tanya Zieman and their daughter, Vera. The president had considered
visiting the Ziemans on Sunday, the day he arrived for summit talks
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but decided against it.
   U.S. sources have said that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Bessmertnykh warned U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock last
week that if Reagan visited the Ziemans they would never would be
allowed to leave.
   Among others who met with Reagan on Monday and who apparently
are not on the list approved for exit visas were Benjamin Charney,
Valdimir Kislik and Abe Stolar, according to Kosharovsky.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has been unable to
stem the flood of drugs into this country because of budget cuts
and delays in making crucial detection equipment operational, two
federal agencies said Wednesday.
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost and William Rosenblatt, the
Customs Service enforcement chief, told a House Government
Operations subcommittee they increasingly were frustrated by their
inability to throw more resources into the anti-drug effort.
   They gave the panel a long list of problems they encountered:
patrol boats and planes sitting idle due to a money shortage;
surveillance airplanes with cracks in their wings; construction
delays at new intelligence centers; and delayed installation of
radar balloons along the nation's border with Mexico.
   Yost, whose new, fast patrol boats and airplanes are operating
at only 55 percent of last year's levels, said it was ironic that
Congress is ready to spend huges sums for an escalation of the
military's role in the drug war, but can't find $60 million to get
his vessels in the water and planes in the air full time.
   ``Turn me loose and don't give my mission away,'' he told the
Government Operations subcommittee on information, justice and
agriculture.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the panel, was sharply
critical of the Customs Service, blaming the agency for delays in
installing five radar balloons along the porous Southwest border to
detect airborne drug smugglers. Only one of the five balloons,
called aerostats, is in operation.
   ``This is a terrible failure,'' he told Rosenblatt. ``You are
costing us dearly. There's no sense of urgency about this. That's
the problem.''
   Rosenblatt described a series of delays in site selection,
environmental problems, competitive bidding and even roadblocks
from other government agencies.
   ``We had to work around interference with the military and other
agencies,'' Rosenblatt said. In Alpine, Texas, he said, there was a
problem of interference with a private observatory. In another
instance, Rosenblatt said the National Science Foundation, a
government agency, initially declined to allow an aerostat on a
site.
   That agency has changed its mind, Rosenblatt said.
   ``Two years later,'' English interjected.
   When Rosenblatt said he spent four months seeking competitive
bids for the radar balloons in an effort to save money, English
said, ``In effect, you cost us a heck of a lot of money'' because
Air Force AWACS surveillance planes have had to patrol the
Southwest border to pick up the slack. English said that an AWACS
costs $7,500 an hour to operate.
   ``Without a detection system, interceptors and bust (arrest)
teams are nearly worthless,'' English said. ``You hired pilots,
purchased aircraft and hired bust teams who have to sit on the
ground for up to two years before they will be able to do their
mission.
   ``It calls into question whether the air interdictioin war is
capable of being more than a skirmish in the next two years.''
   Rosenblatt replied, ``We're trying our darndest to get these
things in there. I share your frustration.''
   Yost called it ``an outrage'' that his agency had to cut back
drug patrols. He blamed congressional appropriations committees,
complaining that money was taken from the Coast Guard budget to pay
for mass transit programs.
   President Reagan has asked for $60 million to be switched to the
Coast Guard from other programs of the Transportation Department _
the parent agency _ but Congress has not yet acted, Yost said.
   ``My budget needs to be protected against mass transit,'' Yost
said.
   When Yost told the panel that Coast Guard law enforcement teams
stationed on Navy ships seized just 20 drug vessels last year,
English said, ``It doesn't seem we're setting the world on fire.''
   He suggested reducing the program and using the money for fuel
for the Coast Guard's idle patrol boats.

<HEAD>Panel Says Anti-Discrimination Law Critical To AIDS Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a National Academy of Sciences
committee on AIDS said Wednesday that federal legislation shielding
carriers of the virus from discrimination is crucial to fighting
the epidemic.
   Calling that ``the first of equals'' among several other
recommendations in a new report, Theodore Cooper said providing
adequate protection against discrimination would form the
foundation for many other things that need to be done, such as
expanded voluntary testing for the virus.
   The Reagan administration opposes federal anti-discrimination
laws to protect AIDS carriers, and such protections were dropped
recently from AIDS legislation working its way through Congress.
   Cooper, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of The
Upjohn Co., acknowledged that winning passage will not be easy. He
said the solution is to ``get the message to the attention of both
the president and Congress, reiterate it and make it strong
enough.''
   He called such a federal law banning discrimination
``fundamental to the success of the program'' to combat AIDS.
   Cooper said the need for strong guidance on such basic policy
areas as discrimination legislation is one reason the committee
recommended creation of a new high-level AIDS commission to replace
the White House panel that goes out of business later this month.
   Robin Weiss, staff director of the academy's AIDS committee,
noted that the report issued Wednesday ``places much greater
emphasis on expanded voluntary testing'' than a 1986 report _ in
part as a way to get a better handle on the extent to which the
virus has spread.
   Such an expansion, she added, ``rests on comfort of people being
protected against discrimination'' if they test positive.
   Indeed, a major new element in the updated report _ a joint
project of the academy and its Institute of Medicine _ is a call
for revising the definition of AIDS as a disease to include the
hundreds of thousands of Americans unknowingly infected with the
virus.
   The committee's recommendation to focus on the numbers of those
infected with the virus _ rather than actual AIDS cases reported _
reflected what the panel said was a growing consensus that ``the
vast majority of persons'' with the virus ``will eventually
progress to AIDS if no treatment is found to slow or halt the
progression of the infection.''
   The Centers for Disease Control estimates that as many as 1.4
million Americans are infected with the virus.
   The report said evidence is now ``scientifically conclusive''
that the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is what causes AIDS.
   The panel said many people infected with the virus suffer from
``clinical syndromes and laboratory test abnormalities that signal
the presence of disease but do not meet'' technical guidelines for
being listed as either AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex, known as ARC.
   ``The committee believes that the term ARC is no longer useful,
either from a clinical or a public health perspective, and that HIV
infection itself should be considered a disease,'' said the report.
   ``Viewing HIV infection as a disease is important because it may
eventually be amenable to treatment and patients will need to be
diagnosed and treated as early as possible.
   ``Clinically, it is more accurate to describe HIV infection as a
continuum of conditions associated with immune dysfunction,'' it
said. ``From a public health perspective the important event is
infection rather than full-blown disease because even asymptomatic
infected persons are capable of infecting others.''
   The report also called for development of federal standards for
labs doing AIDS testing and spelled out that the only mandatory
AIDS testing the committee backs is that involving the donation of
blood and organs for transplant.
   In the section calling for a new AIDS commission, the committee
singled out Surgeon General C. Everett Koop for ``continuing superb
leadership'' and cited biomedical researchers, the CDC and Food and
Drug Administration as ``areas of progress'' within the federal
government.
   ``Nevertheless, the committee has concluded that the federal
response has been too uneven,'' it said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   As of May 23, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 62,740 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 35,188 have died since June 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   Here, at a glance, are Wednesday's developments at
the summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUMMIT CONCLUSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The leaders exchanged the documents of ratification of the
intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty (INF) signed last December,
and said they would press for an agreement to cut strategic nuclear
weapons.
   A joint communique said ``common ground'' had been reached
during the summit on verifying the numbers of mobile missiles and
cruise missiles carried by airplanes, important elements in any
strategic-arms treaty.
   ``The first lines have already been written into a book of the
world without nuclear weapons,'' Gorbachev said. Reagan praised the
INF treaty as a ``first step toward a brighter future, a safer
world.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAGAN NEWS CONFERENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan muted his criticism of Soviet leadership and said Soviet
emigration restrictions may be ``bound in by bureaucracy,'' rather
than the result of deliberate Kremlin policy.
   The president said Gorbachev was ``different than previous
Soviet leaders have been,'' and that has eased differences between
the superpowers but, ``I am never going to relax my belief in the
need for verification.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GORBACHEV NEWS CONFERENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev characterized the summit as ``in depth, at times
intense'' and hailed Reagan for disavowing his view of the Soviet
Union as an evil empire.
   On human rights, he said that when Reagan ``tried to persuade me
to change my mind,'' I said, ``your explanations are not convincing
... I am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit.''
   Gorbachev also said the Americans objected to describing the
superpowers' goal in the joint communique as ``peaceful
coexistence,'' or even ``coexistence.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARMS NEGOTIATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Although progress was reported on mobile missiles and
air-launched cruise missiles, the two sides were still divided on
the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program, submarine-fired cruise missiles,
and reductions in conventional forces.
   Gorbachev told reporters ``it is still possible to sign an
agreement in this administration.'' Reagan said progress ``is still
being made or we wouldn't be talking as we are.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REFUSENIKS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At his news conference, Reagan blamed Soviet bureaucracy rather
than Soviet policy for restrictions on emigration, remarks that
surprised some ``refuseniks,'' those denied permission to emigrate.
   Tanya Zieman, a prominent Soviet refusenik, speculated that
Reagan merely did not want to spoil any agreement that was achieved
with Gorbachev on human rights.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev criticized U.S. law that limits trade relations with
the Soviet Union as long as the Soviets restrict emigration.
   ``Authoritative parts of American business circles would like to
do business,'' Gorbachev said at his news conference. ``They are
faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions. ... We
should base our policies on present-day realities.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINAL EVENING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Reagans spent their last evening in Moscow with the
Gorbachevs, sharing the royal box at the Bolshoi Theater for 90
minutes of ballet. The couples then dined privately at the
Gorbachevs' country dacha.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NANCY AND RAISA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev dropped all pretense of a
hand-holding friendship in a rivalry Mrs. Reagan called a ``Mexican
standoff.''
   The women maintained the appearance of cordiality during a tour
of an icon storage vault, but Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press
secretary, said after the tour, ``They are from two totally
different worlds.''
   Told that Mrs. Gorbachev had not mentioned the icons' religious
heritage, Mrs. Reagan responded, ``I don't know how you can neglect
the religious implications. I mean they are there, when you see
them.''

   Here are some excerpts from the Institute of
Medicine report on AIDS issued Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GENERAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee believes that AIDS is a special case among current
diseases. It is a fatal, infectious disease for which there is now
no cure and its sufferers appear to remain infectious for life.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee believes that the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is
scientifically conclusive. ... Current information suggests that
the vast majority of persons who are seropositive _ that is,
carrying antibodies _ for HIV will eventually progress to AIDS if
no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of the
infection.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>SPECTRUM OF INFECTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It has long been apparent ... that many HIV-infected persons
suffer from clinical syndromes and laboratory test abnormalities
that signal the presence of disease but do not meet CDC (Centers
for Disease Control) criteria for AIDS. Earlier in the epidemic,
certain clusters of symptoms were said to belong to an AIDS-related
complex (ARC), which was incorporated in a CDC definition but never
used for case reporting. By now, however, the committee believes
that the term ARC is no longer useful, either from a clinical or a
public health perspective, and that HIV infection itself should be
considered a disease.
   Viewing HIV infection as a disease is iportant because it may
eventually be amenable to treatment and patients will need to be
diagnosed and treated as early as possible. ... From a public
health perspective the important event is infection rather than
full-blown disease because even asymptomatic infected persons are
capable of infecting others.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTIDISCRIMINATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee believes that the fear of discrimination is a
major constraint to the wide acceptance of many potentially
effective public health measures. ...
   The committee supports the enactment of a federal statute
specifically designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of HIV
infection or AIDS.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee believes that the gravity of the HIV epidemic is
such that CDC. ... should be allowed to purchase advertising time
and space and should be supplied with the funds to do so.
   Explicit information on the risks associated with gay sex and
the way those risks can be minimized does not `promote or
encourage' homosexual activities. ...
   One obstacle to more effective AIDS education has been the
long-standing refusal of the media to accept commercial condom
advertising.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TESTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee recommends expanded voluntary testing combined
with counseling of all those whose behavior may have put them at
risk for exposure to HIV. Those who test positive have a moral
obligation to inform and protect their sexual or needle-sharing
partners. ...
   The committee believes that, at this time, the only mandatory
screening appropriate for public health purposes involves blood,
tissue, and organ donation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IV DRUG ABUSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee believes that the gross inadequacy of federal
efforts to reduce HIV transmission among IV drug abusers, when
considered in relation to the scope and implications of such
transmission, is now the most serious deficiency in current efforts
to control HIV infection in the United States.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COMMISSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The committee proposes the establishment of a national
commission on AIDS with a five-year, renewable term. The commission
chair should be a senior, recognized leader, engaged full time in
this capacity and reporting directly to the president. In addition
to the chair, the commission should consist of eight other members,
each of whom is a senior expert of national stature in one of the
areas of particular relevance to AIDS. Each commissioner should in
turn head a panel of experts.

<HEAD>US Envoy Says Noriega Not Strengthened by Collapse of Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's chief negotiator
in efforts to oust Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
said Wednesday that Noriega has not been strengthened by the
collapse of the talks last week.
   ``I don't think he's stronger by any means,'' said Michael
Kozak, a deputy assistant secretary of state dispatched to talk to
Noriega and other Panamanian officials in recent weeks.
   ``He's not on a winning curve right now. He's treading water.
That's something that's not gone away, and it's not going away,''
Kozak told the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere
subcommittee.
   ``General Noriega is a pretty skillful guy ... It's not a stable
situation for him,'' he said.
   Kozak, in his first public appearance since the talks began,
commented only generally on the situation in Panama and declined to
answer specific questions in open session about deals the United
States had offered Noriega or even how many times he had met
personally with the military chief.
   Kozak deferred giving his answers until a closed-door meeting of
the subcommittee immediately after the public session, saying he
had given his word to Noriega that the negotiations would be
confidential.
   He said only that the discussions were not aimed at dictating
the composition of the Panamanian government or the role of the
Panamanian Defense Forces, which Noreiga heads.
   Those ``were issues to be decided by Panamanians, perhaps with
Latin American mediation, but not by the United States,'' Kozak
said.
   ``We continue to discuss with a number of governments in Latin
America the efforts they and we can undertake in pursuit of the
goal of re-establishing constitutional government in Panama,'' he
said.
   Kozak also declined to say specifically what other Latin
American countries were doing to help persuade Noriega to
relinquish power, although he said there is strong support
generally for the effort.
   ``A number of Latin American countries'' are sending their own
emissaries to talk to Noriega, he said. ``There is a fair degree of
solidarity.''
   Asked by subcommittee members to comment on rumors that Noreiga
has been able to cling to power because he has adverse information
used to pressure U.S. officials, including Vice President George
Bush, Kozak said he had no evidence that such information exists.
   ``He has said nothing to me about any information on the vice
president or anything else. As far as I know, there's nothing to
it,'' he said.
   Kozak said there is a danger that the United States might appear
too impatient to be rid of Noriega, and conceded it had been a
mistake to promote the belief that the problem could be solved
quickly.
   ``American impatience emboldens him,'' he said of Noriega.

   Six months of top-secret research may be
worth all the suspense involved if the two McDonald's restaurants
here are permitted to offer an innovation on their menu: ``Gilroy
garlic'' on hamburgers.
   ``We're the garlic capital of the world and we want to continue
that fame in a fast-food restaurant,'' said David Kaplan, owner of
one of the McDonald's and the man who came up with the idea for the
garlic spread.
   Not too surprisingly, grower Don Christopher, who would supply
the garlic, said: ``Garlic's the in-thing to eat.''
   At McDonald's San Jose office, regional Vice President Tom Doran
said the company favors Kaplan's idea but has to see the packaging
and contents before it grants final approval. Prototypes of the
spread were flown to the office Wednesday.
   Actually, more garlic is grown around Fresno than Gilroy. Only
420 acres of garlic are planted in and around Gilroy, while Fresno
has 12,700 acres, agricultural officials said.

   For the first time in Navy history, the
annual shore-based Sailor of the Year is a woman, and Petty Officer
1st Class Beth L. Blevins said Wednesday she was ``shellshocked.''
   ``I'm very sure I was not chosen because I was a female sailor.
I was chosen because I was a good sailor,'' she said.
   As part of the honor, she will receive a promotion to chief
petty officer, be reassigned to the Pentagon, received the Navy
Commendation Medal and get a week's worth of rest and relaxation at
any location in the United States.
   Blevins is the leading petty officer of the airframes division
at Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 40 at the Norfolk Naval Air
Station.
   ``It has been a real long, hard road for a lot of females who
are in non-traditional ratings,'' she said. ``We are just starting
to earn the respect and the recognition for the job we do. It is a
very good opportunity to show everyone in the Navy how far we have
come and much good we do for the military.''
   Similar awards are given to sea-based sailors of the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Reserve Force fleets.

   Fifty-six competitors were eliminated in the
first day of the National Spelling Bee today, a contest in which,
for once, it wasn't just the children who made the mistakes.
   The 61st annual renewal of the competition began with a record
field of 200 contestants. During the third round _ the last of the
day _ 43 of them misspelled their way into elimination.
   Among those making errors were 13-year-old Awilda M. Cintron of
Ceiba, Puerto Rico, who did not begin learning to speak English
until the third grade.
   The eighth-grader misspelled the word strisciando, a musical
direction to play in a slurred, smooth manner.
   As the competition's second round began, bee officials began
handing to reporters a list of the words that had been asked during
the first round.
   But the distribution ceased when a reporter pointed out to a
tournament official that the list misspelled the word
``hitchhike.'' On the list, the word was spelled ``hitchike.''
   ``It was a typing error,'' said bee spokeswoman Susan H. Miller.
   The first entrant to drop out of the tournament was Monekia L.
Gause, 11, of Shallotte, N.C., who misspelled the word ``jargon.''
   The sixth-grader spelled it ``j-a-r-g-i-n.'' Told she had
misspelled the word, she tugged at the sleeves of her pink dress
and left the stage.
   ``I never heard it before,'' Monekia said afterward.
   The first round's only other dropout was Brian Yates, 11, of
Mentor, Ohio, who responded ``hitchhick'' when asked to spell
``hitchhike.''
   The bee has attracted its usual field of gifted children with
enough academic achievements to humble most adults, including its
youngest competitor ever.
   She is Iris Liu, a third-grader from Muncie, Ind., who doesn't
turn nine until June 20.
   Iris, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Taiwan
in 1979 and now own a bookstore, enjoys reading books in English
and Chinese when she isn't pursuing one of her other loves: jumping
rope.
   ``Not really,'' she said Tuesday evening when asked if she was
nervous.
   But as if to show that she's only human, she expressed
uncertainty about her chances of winning the bee, saying, ``They
have some funny words in there.''
   This year's field consists of 102 girls and 98 boys from 47
states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands and Mexico.
   It includes Maxwell T. Kelley, 14, of Oroville, Wash., who
received no formal institutional schooling until the third grade,
according to the bee's biographical booklet.
   Although contest rules allow children who are not yet 16 and
have not progressed beyond the eighth grade, no one competing in
the two-day event is 15 years old yet.
   Last year's winner was Stephanie Petit, an eighth-grader from
Bethel Park, Pa., who correctly spelled ``staphylococci,'' a type
of bacteria. It took 876 words to eliminate the 184 other entrants
in the 1987 bee.
   The 13-year-old Stephanie, like all previous winners, was not
allowed to re-enter the competition. But there are 20 contestants
making their second appearances, and two who are competing for a
third time: Bernard D. Noveloso, 13, of Grand Blanc, Mich., and
Clint W. Taylor, 14, of Durant, Okla.
   The contestants were culled from an estimated 8 million to 9
million competitors nationwide.
   The final authority for words used in the contest is Webster's
Third New International Dictionary, copyright in 1986, and its
addenda section.
   The contest, sponsored by Scripps Howard newspapers, offers
$1,500 plus other prizes to the winner, $1,000 to the second place
finisher, $750 for third place, $500 for fourth, $400 for fifth,
$300 for sixth, $200 each for seventh through 10th, $100 for 11th
through 20th, and $50 to each of the remaining 180 competitors.

<HEAD>Reagan's Muted Rights Comments May Be Aimed At Cut In Europe
Forces</HEAD>

   By muting his criticism of Soviet human rights
abuses, President Reagan may be trying to speed up negotiations
that would substantially cut Red Army forces in Eastern Europe.
   Reagan, who built a political career bashing Reds and in his
first term called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' confounded
observers on Tuesday and Wednesday by attributing Kremlin human
rights abuses to bureaucratic inertia and praising Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for trying to reform it.
   Reagan and his aides attributed the softening of the president's
rhetoric to Gorbachev's efforts to reform the system.
   But the answer to the riddle may lie in Reagan's often-stated
preference for ``quiet diplomacy'' and the link that U.S. officials
have established between human rights and the professed desired of
both sides to reduce conventional arms in Europe.
   Gorbachev, at the opening of the summit on Sunday night,
repeated to Reagan his 1986 proposal for cuts of 500,000 soldiers
in the opposing armies of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance and
the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact.
   Nice idea, said the Americans, but such reductions must come
through negotiations involving all the allies on both sides, and
the ideal forum is the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe now under way in Vienna.
   Those talks grew out of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, in which the
Soviets pledged to observe human rights. For 13 years the United
States has accused the Kremlin of violating the accords, and Soviet
officials are now conceding as much, releasing political prisoners
and allowing greater public discussion of formerly taboo subjects.
   Many Americans, including Sen. Sam Nunn., D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, believe that sharp reductions in
conventional forces should accompany the 30 percent to 50 percent
cuts in long-range nuclear missiles envisioned in the proposed
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   From the American point of view, the main objectives of reducing
conventional arms would be a reduction in the 2-to-1 advantage the
Warsaw Pact holds on tanks and a reduction in the 380,000 Red Army
troops in East Germany.
   Although the edge may have dulled on Reagan's anti-Communist
rhetoric, his schedule was designed to emphasize U.S. concern with
human rights: he met with nearly 100 Soviet dissidents at the
residence of the American ambassador, he pointedly praised the
virtues of American democracy at every turn, he chatted with with
writers, artists and students.
   And U.S. officials let it be known that Reagan had canceled a
meeting with the Zieman family of Jewish refuseniks because a
high-ranking Soviet official had warned that a visit to their home
would kill their application to emigrate.
   Much of the hardball was being played behind the scenes, said a
senior administration official, noting that the American and the
Soviet regularly but quietly were engaged in discussion of human
rights issues.
   The president's statements would be hard to explain, unless
there was something going on behind the scenes. And his spoken
words were particularly puzzling in light of his extra-curricular
activities at the summit, which appeared designed to focus
attention on Soviet human rights policy, especially the
difficulties that Jews face in emigrating.
   But on Tuesday, Reagan told students at Moscow State University
that recalcitrant bureaucrats were to blame for Soviet human rights
abuses. And under pointed questioning at a news conference on
Wednesday, Reagan said similar problems could be found everywhere.
   ``I just have to believe that in any sort of government some of
us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' Reagan said.
   And after four days of talks with Gorbachev, he expressed
confidence that the Kremlin leader was trying and would succeed in
improving the situation.
   Soviet human rights activists attributed Reagan's comments on
human rights to naivete.
   ``The bureaucracy has nothing to do with it,'' said Tanya
Zieman, whose family had waited in vain for Reagan's visit on
Sunday.
   Reagan and his aides may have been calculating that, having made
their views known in Moscow, they should tone down the rhetoric in
hopes of winning long-sought cuts in Soviet conventional forces in
Eastern Europe.

   Elyse Sanchez tried on her new self-esteem
Wednesday and found that it fit just right.
   ``I've finally done something in my life!'' the 35-year-old
mother of four said as her children clung to her long black gown.
   Seventeen years after she dropped out of college and four years
after her husband left her and she went on welfare, Elyse T.
Sanchez was a college graduate _ and something of a celebrity.
   At her graduation from Lehman College in the Bronx, she was
singled out twice by college officials for her outstanding
achievements, which included the highest academic honors _ summa
cum laude _ and a straight-A average.
   She won the Lehman College Retirees Scholarship, the Gertrude B.
Wertenbaker Scholarship and the Marjorie Anderson Memorial Award.
She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
   Her picture was on the front page of the New York Post, which
called her a ``feisty welfare mom.'' There were offers to appear on
morning network news programs.
   And after commencement ceremonies, while other graduates had
their pictures taken by proud mothers and fathers, Ms. Sanchez's
elated children watched as their mother had her picture taken by
legions of newspaper photographers and television cameramen.
   She was asked what it takes for someone to go from the depths of
the welfare system to the heights of academic excellence in a few
short years. She answered without hesitation.
   ``Four children pushing you,'' she said. Her children, ages 8 to
17, were pulling at this point. ``C'mon, Mom, it's time for
lunch,'' they said. But Ms. Sanchez wasn't through talking.
   ``When Walt Disney won the Academy Award for `Snow White,' I
think he got one big Oscar and seven little ones for the dwarfs,''
she said. ``I feel like I should have four little diplomas for the
children.''
   She said the children did many of the household chores while she
went to school and studied.
   ``I wanted to graduate and tell my oldest daughter she's not the
mother anymore,'' she said.
   Four years ago, Ms. Sanchez said, her life had hit bottom. She
and her husband had moved from Jersey City, N.J., to the Bronx, so
he could work for New York City's Social Services Department _ the
distributors of welfare. They found an apartment in a neighborhood
she describes as rough and crime-ridden.
   She had quit her job as an insurance claims adjuster a few years
before, and after her son, Damian, was diagnosed as having a
learning disability, she decided against going back to work. And
then her husband left her, she said.
   At that point, Ms. Sanchez said, she realized she had to go onto
public assistance _ an experience she is still bitter about. ``It's
a system that's designed to keep you down,'' she said. ``It's not
designed to get you off; it's designed to keep you on.''
   After slightly more than a year on welfare, she decided to try
going back to school. Her last attempt, at Hunter College when she
was 17, had been a failure, but she needed to do something to get
over ``a sense that I wasn't worth anything.''
   Lehman College, which is part of the City University of New
York, accepted her into its Adult Degree Program. It was, she said,
``paradise.'' She declared a double major of English literature and
humanities, and she thrived.
   The program offered work at the college, and she continued to
receive welfare payments as well.
   Now Ms. Sanchez is heading to the University of Iowa, where
she's received a fellowship to work toward a Ph.D. in English
literature. She'll get a $17,000 annual stipend plus tuition, and
hopes to work part-time as an editor or secretary.
   Her goal is a teaching position at a ``nontraditional'' college.
   ``I decided on Iowa because I think it will be best for the
whole family,'' she said. ``I'm looking forward to a sense of peace
... and goofy stuff like camping and seeing my kids ride bicycles
and stuff like that.''
   In the meantime, she was asked, does she have any plans? She
thought a minute. ``The laundry,'' she said.

<HEAD>Doctors Report Success With Hard-To-Match Kidney Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is new hope for hundreds of Americans who
are being passed over for kidney transplants because old blood
tests showed them to be extremely sensitive to donor organs,
doctors said Wednesday.
   ``Transplants can be successfully done'' in these patients as
long as the sensitivity tests have turned up negative in the
previous six months, said Dr. Arthur J. Matas, a kidney transplant
surgeon at the University of Minnesota.
   ``Now you're not penalizing anybody,'' said Dr. Robert Soberman,
a nephrologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, where the
study was conducted.
   Matas reported at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Transplant Physicians that patients whose blood no longer tests
positive for extreme sensitivity to donor organs enjoy just as much
success with transplanted kidneys as anyone else.
   In the past, such patients usually were turned down on the basis
of their old sensitivity tests, even if more recent tests show a
change, because doctors have been reluctant to waste precious donor
kidneys on such patients.
   About half of the 13,000 people awaiting kidney transplants in
the United States are considered particularly sensitive to
transplants because of a previous transplant, pregnancy, blood
transfusion or other circumstances that result in an unusually
large amount of cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream, said Dr.
Lawrence G. Hunsicker, president of the American Society of
Transplant Physicians.
   Until now, the best hope for sensitized patients was to receive
a perfectly matched kidney with all six antigens, or genetic
markers, identified. Such perfect matches are extremely rare,
however.
   But Matas said that in about a fourth of these sensitized
patients, the level of cytotoxic antibodies drops on its own for no
known reason. His research concluded that these people do as well
with a transplant as those who were never sensitized.
   From 1983 to 1987, kidney transplants were done on 64 people at
Montefiore Medical Center who had shown sensitivity to transplants
at one time but had negative sensitivity tests for at least six
months.
   Matas and Soberman compared their transplant success rates with
those of 166 other kidney transplant patients at Montefiore, who
all had never tested positive for sensitivity.
   The success rates were about the same. One year after
transplantation, 79 percent of the 64 formerly sensitive patients
had a properly functioning kidney, as did 77 percent of the regular
patients. At three years, the success rates for both groups was
around 70 percent.
   The findings were similar regardless of whether it was a
patient's first, second or even third transplanted kidney, Matas
said.
   While such findings can give hope to many people who are forced
to exist on dialysis for years, awaiting a transplant, the shortage
of donor organs remains a problem for all kidney patients, the
experts said.
   `The worst part of (the new study) is that it only enlarges the
pool of people to get kidneys,'' Soberman said.
   Last year, 8,972 kidney transplants were performed in the United
States, down slightly from than the year before, according to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Early indications are
that even fewer kidneys are being offered for transplantation in
1988.

   Their summit business over, President and Mrs.
Reagan spent their last night in Moscow at the Bolshoi Ballet,
dined privately with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
wife and took an impromptu walk through Red Square.
   After ballet and a 2{-hour dinner Wednesday at a state-owned
dacha in a verdant area just outside Moscow, the Reagans stopped at
Red Square and walked across the cobblestone plaza between St.
Basil's Cathedral and the Kremlin.
   Reagan, holding hands with his wife, described his Soviet
evening on the town as ``wonderful ... very warm and hospitable.''
   He said the couple decided to stop at Red Square ``because Nancy
hasn't seen it. We're leaving tomorrow and I didn't want her to
miss it.''
   Earlier, the Gorbachevs and Reagans shared the royal box in the
world-famous Bolshoi Theater for 90 minutes of ballet. Many in the
audience of about 2,000 people waved and applauded when they
arrived at the opulent red and gold theater, and again before they
departed.
   Reagan and Gorbachev sat next to each other, even moving their
seats closer together as the ballet began, and clasped arms around
each other's waists briefly as they left the theater.
   By contrast, Mrs. Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev, whose relationship
was described by the president's wife as a ``Mexican standoff,''
seemed cool and did not speak. Mrs. Reagan, dressed in a short
white dress and pearls, sat by Gorbachev's side and Mrs. Gorbachev,
wearing blue, sat next to Reagan.
   It was the first non-political evening the Reagans have enjoyed
in three consecutive days of summitry. The Gorbachevs gave a
toast-filled state dinner for their guests Monday night, and Reagan
returned the favor with a dinner for the Gorbachevs at Spaso House,
the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   The royal box in the Bolshoi Theater was draped with U.S. and
Soviet flags, and the orchestra played the national anthems of both
countries. Reagan mouthed the words to the American national
anthem, and Mrs. Reagan held her hand to her heart.
   The Reagans both used opera glasses to watch the Bolshoi Ballet
perform excerpts from ``Sleeping Beauty,'' ``Swan Lake'' and
``Romeo and Juliet.'' The last was performed by Nine Ananiashvili
and Andris Liepa, winners of a 1986 world ballet competition in
Jackson, Miss.
   When it was over, the dancers applauded the superpower leaders
from the stage.
   The Bolshoi Theater, founded in 1776, has six tiers of box
seats. It was the first permanent theater in Moscow, and its ballet
and opera companies gained an international reputation in the 1950s
and 1960s.
   Tickets cost about three rubles ($5) but are nearly impossible
for Soviets to obtain without contacts in the theater or luck
enough to receive an allocation at their jobs.

   Republican attorney Robert McMillan
announced his candidacy Wednesday for the U.S. Senate seat held by
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan since 1976.
   McMillan, 55, promised to run an aggressive campaign against the
61-year-old Moynihan, who's seeking a third term this November, and
stress issues such as day care for working families, garbage
disposal and acid rain that the Republican maintained concern New
Yorkers most.
   ``I know I have an uphill battle, but I have one thing in my
favor _ the issues,'' McMillan said at a news conference. ``For too
long, the Democrat senator from New York has chosen to ignore the
problems that confront the average family in the state.''
   He will be formally designated the Republican candidate during a
meeting next week in New York City of the state's GOP committee,
according to party Executive Director Edward Lurie.
   McMillan is an attorney in the influential Garden City law firm
of Rivkin, Radler, Dunne & Bayh.
   A one-time football player at Adelphi University and bronze star
recipient during the Korean War, McMillan worked on Richard Nixon's
1960 presidential campaign. He also worked in 1964 and 1965 for
Nixon when the former president was a private citizen.
   His only attempt at elective office came in 1964, when he was
defeated easily in a special election for a New York City council
seat.
   McMillan said he has received assurances of help from Vice
President George Bush's campaign in New York.

   In the mean, material world of the 44th
precinct, hard against the Harlem River, Tireak Ghandy was stabbed
to death at age 12 over his $200 bike.
   That was nine years ago.
   Sometimes, people get away with murder. Sometimes, everyone
walks away, except John Hennessy and Gerard Dunn, detectives in the
self-proclaimed home of the world's busiest cops.
   ``We're what they call `off the chart,''' said Hennessy. ``We're
not catching cases. We're just trying to solve the old ones.''
   Hennessy, Dunn and their supervisor, Lieutenant Donald
Stephenson, received ``Cop of the Month'' commendations Wednesday
for the dogged work that led to an arrest in April in the 1979
slaying of Tireak Ghandy. With their families looking on, the three
received the awards and $500 each from First Deputy Police
Commissioner Richard J. Condon.
   The statute of limitations never runs out for homicide in New
York state. Murder cases never die, and the 44th precinct has ones
sitting around from 50 years ago. Time heals some old wounds, but
this case still lay open and bleeding when the detectives inherited
it 2{ years ago.
   Partly it was because he was his mother's only child, and his
mother, Carol, was a decent, hard-working person. Mostly, it was
because he was a child who died the kind of death usually reserved
for people who see it coming.
   ``The kid was doing what every kid who ever grew up in the Bronx
did,'' said Hennessy, 49, who grew up in the Bronx and used to do
the same when he was Tireak's age. ``He rode his bike to Yankee
Stadium.''
   On a warm night at the end of July 1979, Tireak pedaled his new
$200 10-speed to the stadium, to a place in the back where kids
play basketball. He was on his way home when a teen-ager demanded
his bike.
   ``He was a frail little kid,'' Hennessy said. ``This guy was a
lot bigger than him. He was four or five years older. He could have
smacked the kid in the mouth and taken the bike, that's all he
really had to do. He didn't have to stab him.''
   But he did stab him, plunging a knife into the smaller boy's
chest.
   ``A lot of people heard him yell `Don't take my bike!' and
starting to scream, right? He was trying to pull the bike away from
him, and when the kid wouldn't give up the bike, he stabbed him,''
Hennessy said.
   As Tireak fell, the attacker snatched the basketball from his
hands and escaped on his bike. The child was bleeding so badly that
police didn't wait for an ambulance, but drove him to the hospital
themselves. He was dead before they reached the emergency room.
   ``He was so young and innocent, to lose his life over a
basketball and a bicycle,'' said Dunn, 43, who has a daughter
Tireak's age. ``He didn't have a chance. He just didn't have a
chance.''
   People saw the killer's face. They left the neighborhood but
couldn't shake the memory. They remembered, for all the good it
did. The police had no leads.
   ``We asked everyone brought in from that area, and 99 percent of
them didn't know anything,'' Hennessy said.
   About 2{ years ago, the detectives received some information off
the street. Not much, just a fairly common nickname: ``Flaco.'' The
thin man. The informant told them the guy who did it had lived two
blocks from the scene. The detectives persisted. They came up with
a name and a photograph.
   The next job was to find the witnesses, most of whom had left
the area, and persuade them to testify.
   ``We have witnesses to homicides, if you go back two months from
now, they're gone,'' Hennessy said. Most of the murders in the
city's most murderous precinct _ a record 81 last year _ are over
drugs. Money means more than human life, and civic responsibility
smothers under fear.
   ``Witnesses don't want to get involved in a neighborhood like
this,'' Hennessy said. ``They're afraid. We have people all the
time tell us, `Look, Hennessy, Dunn, I'd gladly testify against
this guy, and I'd like to see this guy in jail.
   ```But you know what's going to happen: They'll go after my
mother or my brother or my wife, and I'm not going to do it.' And
you can sympathize with them.''
   Mothers see their sons murdered and refuse to testify. Wives see
their husbands murdered and free their killers by lying in court.
``That's the kind of thing that makes you mad,'' Hennessy said.
They still keep trying.
   The partners spent a year tracking down the witnesses they knew
of and turning up new ones. Most still lived within 25 miles of the
crime. In at least one case, they had to travel 200 miles to find
the person they wanted.
   With the witnesses in line, Hennessy and Dunn arrested Pedro
Lozada, 26, as he visited his parole officer on April 20. Lozada,
released from prison last December after serving three years for
criminal possession of stolen property, never said a word, but the
detectives could see the shock on his face.
   ``He couldn't believe that after all these years, it had caught
up with him,'' Dunn said. ``I guess he figured he'd beat it.''
   Two days later, three witnesses identified Lozada in a lineup as
the youth they saw stab Tireak Ghandy to death. He pleaded innocent
to charges of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery.
   A preliminary hearing was held Wednesday in the Bronx, but it
was adjourned until June 22 to allow the defense to prepare a
motion.
   ``A few of the witnesses felt like, they had lived with this
thing so long, and the kid was such a nice kid, and he had such a
bad death, we got the feeling these people were really glad _ `Let
me help the cops out and get this thing off my shoulders,'''
Hennessy said.
   Sometimes, people get away with murder. Sometimes, they only
think they have.
   ``We never gave up on it,'' Dunn said. ``It was only a matter of
time.''

<TEXT>
   Iran is still a threat
despite military setbacks and is building a new missile site that
threatens the entire Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. commander for the
Middle East said Wednesday.
   Gen. George B. Crist said construction of the Silkworm site was
one reason for deploying a sophisticated U.S. Aegis-type missile
cruiser in the Persian Gulf with long-range air surveillance and
weapons systems.
   He said the ship is ``a quantum leap forward in our ability to
handle that threat'' in Hormuz, the gulf's narrow gateway.
   Iran remains a formidable presence in the gulf despite losing
six naval craft April 18 in clashes with the U.S. Navy, Crist said.
The four-star Marine general heads the Central Command based in
Tampa, Fla., administrative headquarters for U.S. military
activities in 19 countries of the Middle East and North Africa.
   Tehran has been ``very circumspect and careful'' since April 18,
he said, ``but I don't get any feeling that the Iranians have run
up a white flag or that sort of thing. I would not say they have
given up their thoughts about trying to get to us.''
   In an interview with members of a Pentagon news media pool on
the Coronado, the Navy flagship in the gulf, Crist also said:
   _Military analysts determined ``no enemy missiles'' were
launched at three U.S. warships in the Strait of Hormuz during the
fighting April 18, despite reports from shipboad officers that five
were fired. The confusion resulted from multiple radar contacts of
missiles and bombs from U.S. forces, ``and what you were getting
was hits on the system as they picked up seekers and missiles
moving through the air.''
   _A U.S. Navy H-2 helicopter from the destroyer O'Brien took
``evasive action'' to avoid a missile fired by the U.S. missile
frigate Jack Williams. ``It obviously wasn't hit, so there's a
little bit of mystery as to who was firing at what.''
   _Investigators found no evidence that a Marine Corps helicopter
gunship lost later in the day was shot down, as Iran claims. ``We
don't know and probably never will'' know the cause of the crash.
   In New York, diplomats at the United Nations said Iran agreed to
hold more U.N. talks on ending the gulf war but repeated that Iraq
must be branded the aggressor as the first step toward peace. The
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, provided a copy of a
letter from Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, dated Tuesday, stating
Iranian conditions.
   In other developments Wednesday, the death toll rose from one to
two in a mine explosion Tuesday that destroyed a fishing boat in
the Gulf of Oman off the United Arab Emirates. Lloyd's Shipping
Intelligence Unit in London said a second vessel was damaged.
   A net apparently dredged the mine up from the seabed. Shipping
executives said six fishermen were injured but it was not known if
the second dead man had been included in that total.
   The mine exploded near a busy tanker anchorage just south of the
entrance to Hormuz, near where Soviet warships and tankers stop and
north of the usual staging area for American-flag Kuwaiti tankers
and their U.S. Navy escorts.
   Crist said the new Iranian missile site at Kuhestak, overlooking
central Hormuz, is a fixed installation rather than using mobile
launchers as Iran has done in the past.
   He said it might become operational in late summer, ``but that's
a guess. It could be used anytime. They're building one hell of a
big Silkworm site down there, and they've got Silkworms.''
   From Kuhestak, all the inner strait and the northern tip of the
Oman peninsula would be within the Silkworm range of 50-60 miles.
   The Silkworm, officially known as the HY-2, is a Chinese version
of the 30-year-old subsonic Soviet Styx. Although crude by modern
standards, it can be devastating to ships.
   U.S. officials are on record as saying they would respond with
force if any U.S. vessel was fired on or even tracked by a Silkworm
battery's radar.
   There are no signs of work progressing on another suspected
Silkworm site, on Abu Musa island in the southern Gulf, Crist said.
   Silkworms on Abu Musa would threaten the main gulf shipping
lanes and the United Arab Emirates coast. ``Clearly we were
concerned. So we watched it like a hawk, and nothing happened,''
Crist said.
   He said assignment of the Aegis-type missile cruiser USS
Vincennes to the gulf provides ``a much greater surveillance
capability.'' The 9,400-ton vessel arrived during the past week
from San Diego.
   With its state-of-the-art long-range air surveillance radar
system ``we can see a lot farther,'' Crist said, and the Vincennes
also has ``excellent capability'' against Silkworms.
   ``So if they decided to use those missiles over there, Aegis
really represents a quantum leap forward in our ability to handle
that threat,'' he said.

<HEAD>Broadcasters, First Amendment Groups Challenge Rules on Indecency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of broadcasters and other First
Amendment advocates told a federal appeals court panel Wednesday
that the government's rules on indecent broadcasts are
unconstitutionally vague.
   Attorney Timothy B. Dyk said the groups do not challenge the
Federal Communications Commission's authority to govern indecency
on the air, but he said the FCC's policy does not give broadcasters
a clear idea what they can air without fear of sanctions.
   ``What we would like is some guidance'' on what can be
broadcast, he told a panel of three U.S. Court of Appeals judges.
``Broadcasters do not want to risk their licenses.''
   The result of the FCC's policy has been to chill fully protected
speech, Dyk said.
   The FCC in April 1987 cracked down on indecent broadcasts with a
new policy that went beyond simply prohibiting the ``seven dirty
words'' that comedian George Carlin once used in a radio broadcast.
His monologue led to a 1978 Supreme Court decision on indecency.
   The agency said it would enforce the Supreme Court's definition
of indecency: ``language or material that depicts or describes, in
terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities
or organs.''
   The FCC said broadcasts that fit that definition, and not just
programs that used the ``seven dirty words,'' could be subject to
sanctions unless the programs were broadcast after midnight, when
children were not likely to be in the audience.
   The policy serves ``the government's compelling and well
established interest in protecting children's exposure to salacious
material,'' said Diane Killory, FCC general counsel.
   Killory said the decision to set aside the early morning hours
after midnight as ``safe harbor'' represents ``a balancing of a
number of interests'' and ``doesn't lend itself to a precise
mathematical formula.''
   Judge Ruth Ginsburg said the FCC's evidence on the number of
children in the late-night radio audience appeared to be
``flimsy,'' but Killory countered that ``even with all the
resources in the world ... it would still come down to a judgment
call.''
   Killory said the commission's policy was aimed at helping
protect minors from indecent material but was not designed to
displace parents as the primary protectors of children.
   ``It would be unrealistic to assume parents can supervise their
children at all hours of the day and night,'' Killory said.
   Among the groups joining the petition challenging the FCC's
policy are Capital Cities-ABC, CBS, National Broadcasting Co., the
National Association of Broadcasters, Action for Children's
Television, Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio, The
New York Times, The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press
and People for the American Way.

   The AIDS virus probably did not jump from
monkeys to humans but could have infected the common ancestors of
humans and monkeys millions of years ago, researchers say.
   Japanese biologists who have determined the entire genetic code
of the AIDS virus that infects African green monkeys found that the
monkey AIDS virus differed from the two known human AIDS viruses.
If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times, as
some have suggested, the viruses would be identical or nearly so.
   The findings appear in Thursday's issue of the British
scientific journal Nature.

   Researchers studying four AIDS-infected men who
appeared to stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease
said the virus may have stopped reproducing in those patients.
   Tests to pinpoint AIDS are based upon detection of the
antibodies produced by the body to fight the virus. But Alfred J.
Saah, epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public
Health, said the findings do not imply increased dangers of blood
supply contamination, since the instances of AIDS victims who stop
producing detectable antibodies to the disease are ``very, very
rare.''

   An AIDS hotline has expanded
from 130 operators to 220 to accommodate a rush of calls generated
in part by a government educational pamphlet ``Understanding AIDS''
mailed to 10 million U.S. homes, officials said.
   The 24-hour hotline, 1-800-342-AIDS, offers referrals in English
and Spanish for people seeking help in their areas for acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. Officials expect 2 million calls in
1988.

<HEAD>AIDS-SCIENCE ACADEMY</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Sciences committee on
AIDS said federal legislation shielding carriers of the virus from
discrimination is crucial to fighting the epidemic.
   The report also said the hundreds of thousands of Americans
unknowingly infected with the virus should be considered as
suffering from the disease even if they don't have full-scale AIDS.
The panel said there is a growing consensus that ``the vast
majority of persons'' with the virus ``will eventually progress to
AIDS if no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of
the infection.''
   The report called for development of federal standards for labs
doing AIDS testing and recommended that AIDS testing be mandatory
only in cases involving donations of blood or organs for transplant.

<HEAD>City Meets Most Of Payroll, But Some City Employees Still Waiting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An infusion of state money enabled
this financially strapped city to pay most of its 300 workers
Wednesday, five days after their paychecks were due, the city's
treasurer said.
   But city Treasurer Charlotte Moore said unless Mayor Carl E.
Officer authorized the transfer of additional funds into the city's
general revenue account, about 30 city employees would not get paid
for a few days more.
   Officer was in a meeting and could not be reached for comment,
his office said.
   On Wednesday morning, Mrs. Moore said, the town received its
regular quarterly personal property tax payment from the state
totaling $93,464. The payment supplemented money already on hand
and allowed it to meet most of its $274,000 bimonthly payroll.
   But Mrs. Moore said East St. Louis still was $55,000 short of
being able to pay all workers.
   ``We'll pay all police, all firefighters, all public works
employees and then we'll go from there,'' she said. The checks were
issued early in the afternoon, she said.
   The remaining employees might have to wait a few days for their
paychecks until the city's regular state sales tax payment arrives,
she said, unless the mayor authorizes the transfer of motor fuel
tax funds into the payroll account, a move that a state official
said could jeopardize future state support.
   Employees in this Mississippi River town of 55,000 were supposed
to be paid this past Friday. It was the second time in less than a
month that paychecks were delayed.
   Though Officer could not be reached by The Associated Press, he
told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Tuesday that there was enough
money in the city's various bank accounts to cover the paychecks _
if the treasurer would cooperate and issue the checks. He did not
elaborate.
   Officer contended that the late paychecks were ``an unfortunate
situation that is not necessary'' and blamed Mrs. Moore, contending
that she was angry because her entire staff was laid off in April
to help save money.
   Mrs. Moore countered that Officer was upset because she was
enforcing sound accounting policies.
   Dale Klohr, spokesman for the state transportation department,
said that motor fuel tax funds could be used to pay city employees
who do road work but not for other employees. A transfer of motor
fuel funds for other workers would violate department guidelines,
and the department could withhold future motor fuel tax payments,
he said.

<HEAD>Energy Department Forecast On Electricity Demand Doubted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Department forecasts on demand for
electricity are only half as large as they ought to be, a private
forecaster said Wednesday.
   One utility said the industry can easily meet the extra demand
the forecaster sees and avoid brownouts by contracting with
independent producers for power. But another company said it would
be foolish to rely on such a strategy.
   The two views were presented at a forum for reporters sponsored
by Americans for Energy Independence, a group of energy companies
and supporters.
   Already there have been predictions of brownouts by industry
groups in the Pennsylvania-Maryland-New Jersey area this summer.
New York's Long Island could see similar brownouts now that the
state and Long Island Lighting Co. have agreed not to open the
800-megawatt Shoreham nuclear plant.
   The forecaster, John Siegel of the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, a nuclear industry group, said electricity demand would
grow 4 percent this year as manufacturing continues its export-led
boom, 4 percent again next year and in 1990 before falling back to
2 percent annual growth. Growth last year was 4.5 percent.
   The Energy Department originally projected 2 percent growth last
year, and in April forecast 2 percent and 2.1 percent growth for
this year and next.
   John D. Pearson, director of energy analysis and forecasting for
the department, said the department had assumed a slowdown in
economic growth this year which isn't going to happen.
   Pearson commented on Siegel's remarks: ``He has a point,
especially in regard to manufacturing. We're going to take a look
at this (for the July forecast).
   ``But 4 percent? He's off his gourd. We may go up, but I don't
see going above 2{ or 3 percent.''
   In the 1990s, the nation will need to add 135,000 to 210,000
megawatts of generating capacity, Siegel said. Current capacity is
about 680,000 megawatts, and 11,500 megawatts are scheduled to be
installed this year and next.
   The Energy Department earlier this year said the most likely
need in the 1990s is for 55,000 additional megawatts starting in
1992.
   ``I don't think the number is all that crucial,'' said William
W. Berry, chief executive officer of Dominion Resources Inc.,
parent company of Virginia Electric Power Co.
   ``The question is, where is that going to come from? First, not
much is going to come from utility construction. Second, as much as
needed (will come) from the competitive sector.''
   ``It can be built in time, provided we don't study it for the
next two years,'' Berry added.
   Bruce Beam, Washington representative of American Electric Power
Co., the nation's largest private utility, noted that AEP was
``vocally against'' efforts by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to encourage independent producers.
   Beam said AEP would be ``very much in favor'' of Berry's
strategy if regulators ``could relieve the electric utility
industry of its obligation to serve'' all who want to be customers.

   Less than a year ago, Katherine Taylor trudged
through the rough terrain of Sudan, a captive of rebel soldiers.
   Now, she's giving out food and clothing to desperate people in
an urban ministry, in hopes of developing skills to use as a
Christian missionary in Mexico City.
   The 32-year-old Tennessee native, who went to Sudan to teach
English and work as a missionary, says the seven weeks she spent as
a hostage are behind, but not forgotten.
   ``A lot of people don't have certain freedoms and suffer a great
deal. It's one thing to know about it cognitively, but it's another
thing to experience a little of it yourself,'' Ms. Taylor said
Wednesday.
   She was kidnapped last July 7. She and her three fellow
hostages, including two Americans, were freed seven weeks later
thanks to appeals from former President Jimmy Carter and the U.S.
and Kenyan governments, Ms. Taylor said. After a 100-mile walk,
they arrived safely in Kenya on Aug. 25.
   Ms. Taylor remembers being roused from sleep in the middle of
the night by soldiers who claimed they were ``saving our lives.''
   The captors, members of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army,
planned to attack the village and did not want the three ``caught
in the cross-fire,'' Ms. Taylor said.
   The Sudanese rebels have waged a five-year civil war against the
government, which is dominated by Moslems from the predominantly
Arab northern section of the country.
   The Sudanese People's Liberation Army is fighting for government
reforms and autonomy for Sudan's three southern provinces, where
most people are Christian or animist.
   After packing malaria medicine, some first-aid supplies, a Bible
and a few other belongings, Ms. Taylor was led out of the house she
was living in at Bishop Gwynne College near the southern Sudanese
town of Mundri.
   Ms. Taylor said she and three other hostages were forced to walk
through the countryside of Sudan, the largest country in Africa.
   They slept on the side of the road or in rebel camps, ate
sporadically, drank bad water and trudged through waterways, she
recalled.
   ``Certain aspects of the physical parts were hard _ long walks
and bad water,'' she said. ``But the psychological parts were hard,
too ... not knowing how long we would be kept, not knowing what
each day was going to bring.''
   In October, Ms. Taylor arrived in Chicago to work with the
Circle Urban Ministries providing emergency food, clothing and
housing to poor people in the Austin neighborhood on the city's
rough West Side.
   Ms. Taylor said she and four friends are volunteering in the
urban mission as preparation for a missionary project they've been
planning for more than a decade.
   The five _ a nurse, an architect, two teachers and a
businessman-aviation mechanic _ plan to leave for Mexico City after
another year of training and language classes in Spanish.
   ``Our commitment to the Lord is the underlying thing,'' she said.
   ``Everything isn't rosy, but there's a commitment underneath it
_ ours is strong.''
   Ms. Taylor's mother, Martha Taylor of Johnson City, Tenn., said
in a telephone interview Wednesday that the first thing her
daughter wanted to do when she got home was eat broccoli.
   ``We really expected her to be different, but she was the same
old Katie,'' Mrs. Taylor said.

   Tear gas fired by soldiers into enclosed spaces
has killed 11 Arabs in the occupied territories, including a
7-day-old infant, and caused dozens of miscarriages, a U.N.
official said Wednesday.
   Col. Ranaan Gissin, a military spokesman, said the statement was
based on ``unfounded rumors'' and the army could not check it
because no details of the casualties were provided.
   Also Wednesday, a 12-year-old boy was killed when he and other
youngsters in Tulkarem on the West Bank tried to dismantle an army
roadblock made of oil drums and a drum struck him in the head, the
army said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin discussed political issues
Wednesday night with four prominent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,
his third such meeting in a week, a defense official said.
   Authorities would not give the names of Palestinians who
participated, saying their lives might be endangered. Several
prominent Gaza Arabs said they were not invited, including former
Mayor Rashad Shawwa of Gaza City and lawyer Faiz Abu Rahme.
   Gissin said ``medical tests show tear gas can only cause
temporary disablement, never death,'' and the miscarriages resulted
from increased blood pressure after women took part in violent
protests, not from tear gas.
   Burl Alison, a vice president of Transtechnology Corp. of
Sherman Oaks, Calif., which supplied tear gas to Israel, has said
the gas is safe when used properly but can cause death if high
doses are fired into enclosed areas.
   Transtechnology's gas canisters carry a warning not to use it in
enclosed spaces. It stopped selling to Israel last month, citing
concern about improper use.
   U.N. figures say hospitals have treated 1,285 Palestinians for
breathing problems since a rebellion against Israeli occupation
began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the report about tear gas was ``a matter of concern to us. We have
repeatedly urged the government of Israel to use non-lethal means
to control violent demonstratons.''
   Before the latest death, the army said 207 Palestinians had been
killed in the six months of violence. An Israeli soldier and a
Jewish settler also have been slain.
   Bill Lee, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which
cares for Palestinian refugees, said tear gas had killed 11 Arabs
in the territories. He said most casualties from tear gas occurred
when soldiers fired it into rooms of clinics, homes and schools
while dispersing protesters.
   ``The gas is not normally lethal when used according to
prescribed directions, but it can be when fired into closed
spaces,'' he said in an interview.
   In other developments, 22 Palestinian employees of the West Bank
military administration's auto-licensing department resigned
Wednesday. Underground leaders of the uprising demanded they quit
to protest a requirement that Arabs pay their taxes before they can
obtain driving or building permits.
   Police determined that an army private broke regulations by
taking two teen-age members of a paramilitary training group into a
detention center near Nablus last month, where one youth clubbed an
Arab prisoner, the army reported. It said the soldier would be
reprimanded.
   According to the daily Yediot Ahronot, police also will charge
Rabbi Moshe Levinger of Hebron, a leader of Jewish settlers, with
attacking an Arab family.
   An Israeli reserve soldier filed a complaint against Levinger
accusing hin of breaking into the home of Ishak Rahman, grabbing
Rahman's daughter by the throat and beating his wife on the back,
the paper said.
   Levinger told the paper the girl shouted insults at the rabbi's
13-year-old daughter in the street.
   According to Lee, doctors at U.N. clinics said the 11 tear gas
fatalities were recorded through April. He said most were infants,
one only 7 days old, or people over 65.
   ``The people on this list are those doctors believe wouldn't
have died at that particular time if it weren't for tear gas being
fired,'' he said. ``That's my bottom-line criteria.''
   Among the victims was a 35-year-old woman in the Gaza Strip who
died along with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely
as a result of inhaling tear gas, the U.N. representative said.
   He said the gas apparently causes muscle spasms that can cause
miscarriage, and dozens of such cases have been reported.
   The army spokesman, Gissin, countered: ``According to doctors,
not just Israeli doctors, when pregnant women participate in riots
their blood pressure goes up and they have miscarriages caused by
overexcitement, not by tear gas.'' Lee said most victims of
miscarriages weren't involved in protests, but were ``at home when
tear gas was fired into their homes, into a closed confined space.''
   Gissin said soldiers fire the gas into closed quarters only in
rare accidents.
   ``There is no intentional policy to fire into closed quarters,''
he said. ``It may happen that a gas canister can hit a window and
fall into a house, but one canister cannot cause such results.''
   He said the State Department issued its statement ``without
checking the facts'' and had been ``manipulated'' by the media.

   Under the glare of chandeliers and television
lights, 200 youngsters spelled their way through ``nainsook,''
``univocal'' and other exotic words Wednesday in the 61st annual
National Spelling Bee.
   At the end of the third round that wrapped up the day's
activities, 485 words had been spelled, or misspelled, and 144
contestants remained in competition in a hotel ballroom.
   ``Now when I go back home, I'll never hear the end of it,
because I told everyone I was going to win,'' said Angela Martin,
13, of St. Petersburg, Fla. `I'm going to try next year.'' She was
eliminated in the second round for spelling thuggery with only one
``g.''
   The competitors ranged in age from 8 to 14 and, in dress, from
shorts and blue jeans to ties and party dresses.
   One girl, Judy Shieh, 13, of Richmond, Va., wearing a cardboard
crown from a fast food restaurant, looked puzzled by her
assignment: ``foozled,'' meaning bungled.
   ``Does this word have an origin?,'' she asked.
   ``Perhaps,'' replied pronouncer Alex Cameron, an English
professor at the University of Dayton. Judy spelled it right.
   Two of Judy's sisters have been spelling champions and
participated in national bees. But Judy brought her own brand of
showmanship this year _ a different hat for each round, a lucky
toothbrush hanging around her neck and a magic bracelet around her
wrist.
   ``I'm the first'' to wear the hats, she said. She correctly
spelled ``flagitiously,'' meaning scandalously, in the third round,
wearing Mickey Mouse ears.
   The contestants came from diverse backgrounds, some the children
of professors, doctors and engineers, others the offspring of
restaurant and farm workers, custodians and bus drivers.
   Some were so shy their voices were barely audible; others
adjusted their microphones, demanded definitions and boomed their
answers with supreme confidence.
   One boy, Robert Pryor, 11, of Washington, D.C., clutched his
stomach in pain as he approached the microphone, escorted by his
grandfather and a spelling bee official. `E-n-t-o-u-r-a-g-e!` he
exclaimed and, still bent over, headed for a comfort room stocked
with Cokes, couches and consolers.
   Robert was still in contention at the end of the day, correctly
spelling ``utilitarian'' as he leaned on his grandfather's arm.
   The words in the opening rounds included commonplaces such as
comply, calcium and barnyard. They were followed later by
less-familiar terms such as nainsook, a thin, lightweight cotton
fabric; and univocal, or unambiguous.
   Cameron said the slow attrition rate was bound to accelerate
Thursday, the final day of the event, when the survivors were
scheduled to tackle words not included in a book they had been
given to study.
   ``There will be a big difference in the mortality rate,'' he
said.
   The first casualty of the spelling bee was Monekia Gause, 11, of
Shallotte, N.C. `I never heard it before,` she said tearfully after
spelling ``jargon'' with an ``i'' instead of an ``o.''
   Monekia and the others eliminated on Day One were not the only
ones who made mistakes. A list of correct spellings distributed by
spelling bee officials showed ``hitchhiker'' with one ``h'' in the
middle instead of two.
   ``It was a typing error,'' explained Susan H. Miller, a bee
spokeswoman.
   The winner of the bee receives $1,500 and other prizes. Second
prize is $1,000, third is $750, fourth is $500, fifth is $400,
sixth is $300, seventh through 10th is $200, 11th through 20th is
$100 and the remaining 180 are $50.
   The bee is sponsored by the Scripps Howard newspaper group.

<HEAD>Mrs. Dukakis To Check In To Hospital For Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis will undergo tests at a Boston
hospital to determine the cause of pain and numbness she has been
experiencing for the past month, campaign and hospital officials
said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Dukakis, the wife of Democratic presidential front-runner
and Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was scheduled to arrive
in Boston Wednesday evening and check into Massachusetts General
Hospital, hospital spokesman Martin Bander said.
   A preliminary diagnosis Mrs. Dukakis received in California last
week indicated she has two herniated cervical disks in the neck
area. She was in California campaigning for her husband.
   Dukakis told reporters Wednesday that his wife might need
surgery but that a final decision would be made at the hospital.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, spent two days at the Canyon Ranch Health and
Fitness Resort in Tuscon, Ariz., after receiving the preliminary
diagnosis, according to a ranch spokeswoman.
   While at the Boston hospital, Mrs. Dukakis will be under the
care of Dr. Nicholas Zervas, chief of neurosurgery and a longtime
family friend.

<TEXT>
   A passenger express train going more
than 70 mph rear-ended a sitting freight train Wednesday, killing
two people and injuring as many as 29, a Dutch railway spokesman
said.
   The four-car passenger train carrying about 60 passengers
derailed and tumbled down an embankment after hitting the
gravel-laden train in southwestern Netherlands at about 10:40 a.m.,
said spokesman Hans Meijer.
   He said the 39-year-old locomotive engineer of the passenger
train was killed, as was a 79-year-old Dutch woman, identified as
A. Sitter.
   Meijer said nine people were hospitalized, two in critical
condition, and up to 20 others were treated for minor injuries.
   The lead passenger car was left with one end sticking up in the
air, Meijer told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
the railway's head office in this central Dutch city.
   He said the cause of the collision was not immediately known.
   The passenger train traveling at about 74 mph was bound from
Roosendaal, a major junction in the southern Netherlands about 60
miles south of Amsterdam, to Vlissingen in Zeeland province, the
railway spokesman said.
   Visibility was good at the site of the accident between the
stations of Rilland-Bath and Krabbendijke, where the double-track
Roosendaal-Vlissingen main line runs in a slight bend, according to
Meijer.
   He said the freight train was being used to try out a new energy
conservation method and the gravel cars were hooked up to the
electric engine as a simulated payload. The train was supposed to
start and stop three times, he said, adding that it was not clear
``why the engineer of the passenger train didn't see it, or whether
the signals failed.''
   The line has an automatic signaling system, according to the
spokesman.
   Wreckage blocked both tracks and considerable damage was done,
Meijer said.

   Thousands of marchers in Wroclaw chanted
for a ``Revolution of the Dwarfs'' and likened Poland's leader to
an evil dragon Wednesday in a satirical observance of Child's Day,
opposition spokesmen said.
   ``We know nothing about it,'' said a police headquarters
spokesman in the southwestern city when asked for comment about the
public needling of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Parents and grandparents give small gifts to children on Child's
Day, which is observed in Poland each June 1.
   The Wroclaw march and rally was organized by Orange Alternative,
an opposition street theater group that stages frequent
``happenings'' lampooning the government.
   More than 10,000 people took part, said Barbara Labuda, a
spokeswoman for the banned Solidarity trade union in the city, and
Krzysztof Albin of Orange Alternative. They spoke by telephone from
Wroclaw.
   Albin said the main slogan was a call for a fairy-tale
``Revolution of the Dwarfs.'' He said marchers also chanted
``Jaruzelski, dragon of Wawel,'' referring to the dragon once said
to live under Wawel Castle in Krakow, and ``We want a jester
instead of little Wojciech.''
   Included in the chants were rhyming parodies of old Solidarity
anti-government slogans, Albin said.
   Marchers walked from the central market to a square about 15
blocks away, then another 15 blocks to a park on an island in the
Odra River, he said, with some people painting slogans on walls and
a police van en route.
   Police watched but did not arrest anyone, according to Albin.
   In another development Wednesday in Wroclaw, police freed two of
four activists accused of assaulting a factory guard May 5 during
labor unrest, said the wife of one of those still in jail.
   Alexandra Sarata and Jolanta Skiba were freed in response to a
plea by Roman Catholic Bishop Adam Dyczkowski, Maria Pinior said.
Her husband, Solidarity activist Jozef Pinior, and his associate
Czeslaw Borowszyk remain in jail, she said.

   Dozens of members of a group that proclaims itself
an alternative to the Communist Party demonstrated downtown
Wednesday, demanding a multiparty political system and an end to
what they called political repression.
   The protest by members of the Democratic Union, a group formed
in Moscow last month, attracted a crowd of about 200 by a boulevard
near a statue of 19th-century Russian writer Nikolai Gogol.
   ``I think it was the first time there was a political meeting
without repression and I think it was because of the presence of
Mr. Reagan,'' Democratic Union member Yuri Mityunov said later in a
telephone interview.
   Several demonstrations daily have taken place in Moscow during
President Reagan's visit. None of them were broken up by police.
   Mityunov said the group, carrying banners, marched hundreds of
yards to the end of the boulevard and returned to the Gogol statue
in a 1{-hour demonstration.
   Police watched the group closely when it held meetings in Moscow
early in May. They arrested dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants
shortly before he was to act as host at a final meeting of the
group.
   Grigoryants, accused of disobeying a police officer, served a
seven-day jail term.

   George Bush's ``flexible freeze''
plan to end the federal budget deficit by 1993 depends on an
optimistic outlook and a reduction in interest rates by at least 2
percentage points, his economic advisers said Wednesday.
   ``We all concluded that a flexible freeze is the right way to
go, that is indeed doable,'' said former Deputy Treasury Secretary
Richard Darman as Bush ended four days of private talks with
Republican leaders and advisers at his seaside vacation retreat.
   Darman said Bush would contrast his plan to the ``Massachusetts
mirage'' of Michael Dukakis, a slap at the Democratic
front-runner's references to a ``Massachusetts miracle'' of
home-state revival while he has been governor.
   Bush's plan also depends on a reduction in the budget deficit
that is occurring anyway and a fast-rising surplus in the nation's
Social Security trust fund, the consultants said.
   The vice president has said he would reduce the deficit by the
end of a first term by freezing most spending and without raising
any taxes.
   Martin Feldstein, who quit his job as President Reagan's chief
economist in 1985 because his advocacy of a tax increase was at
odds with White House policy, told reporters he was a convert to
the Bush proposal.
   If Bush is elected, financial markets will rally on the
assumption that the deficit will be attacked seriously, Feldstein
suggested.
   ``The markets will respond and bring down interest rates another
notch, 2 percentage points, and that will get us down and get us
within inches of budget balance in 1993,'' said Feldstein, a
Harvard economist.
   However, Bush's declarations that he would reject the advice of
a bipartisan commission studying the federal deficit if it should
call for a tax increase drew skepticism on Wednesday from one of
those he met with, Rep. Bill Frenzel.
   Frenzel, a Minnesota Republican and a member of the blue-ribbon
panel, said the commission's work would not be swayed by Bush's
comments.
   ``We are not going to get involved in any presidential
campaigns,'' Frenzel told reporters during a picture-taking session
Wednesday with the vice president.
   Bush interrupted Frenzel at one point, saying: ``I hope the
commission listens a little bit to the American people in this
election.''
   ``That's what I think an election is about. The commission can
take an objective look and come up with whatever it wants. I'd be
much more persuaded by what the American people say.''
   The National Economic Commission, made up of appointees of the
Reagan administration as well as members of both parties in
Congress, was formed earlier this year to try to come up with a
bipartisan package of deficit-reduction proposals.
   The panel, which will also include two members appointed by the
new president-elect in November, will submit its report in 1989.
   Democratic critics, as well as many private economists, argue
that it is unlikely the budget deficit, $150 billion last year, can
be eliminated without some form of new taxes.
   Bush's proposal calls for a ``flexible freeze'' that would keep
overall spending except for Social Security payments at levels in
the budget approved by Congress for fiscal year 1989, plus
inflation.
   The freeze would be flexible because some spending could go up,
but increases would have to be offset by identical reductions in
other areas.
   So far, Bush has not provided details on which programs he would
like to cut and which ones he would like to see expanded.
   The vice president, who has clinched the Republican nomination,
has also proposed a reduction in the tax on capital gains _ profits
from the sale of real estate, stocks or other assets _ to 15
percent from its current maximum of 28 percent.
   Many economists have suggested that Bush's proposals would not
go far enough in trimming the budget deficit.
   ``I'm not surprised that the Democrats would say that,'' Bush
said Wednesday. ``All they want to do is spend and tax. There is no
change I can see or hear out of the campaign that would lead you to
believe anything other than that on the Democratic side.''
   Bush held two days of talks on economic issues on Tuesday and
Wednesday. They followed similar discussions with outside advisers
last Friday and Saturday on other domestic issues.
   He has been at his retreat overlooking the Atlantic Ocean since
last Thursday and will remain here until Friday, combining strategy
and issues sessions with a vacation.
   Bush said that the economists who advised him assured him that
the U.S. economy was strong.
   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that the Index of
Leading Indicators, a major guage of the country's economic health,
was up in April for the third consecutive month.
   Bush said that none of the half dozen private economists
visiting him foresaw a recession in the coming months.
   Bush who has frequently trumpted the 65-month economic expansion
as a sign of success for Reagan economic policies _ policies he
derided in 1980 as ``voodoo economics'' _ cautioned the Federal
Reserve Board on Tuesday not to do anything that would jeopardize
that expansion.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan concluded
their fourth summit Wednesday in conflict on arms control and human
rights, but still satisfied that their new relationship had
eliminated ``evil empire'' from the superpowers' vocabulary.
   They hailed the progress they achieved in what was probably
their final summit sessions, but Gorbachev grumbled about Reagan's
attempts to change Soviet policy toward dissidents and refuseniks _
those denied visas and punished for seeking them.
   Gorbachev said that he told Reagan ``your words are not
convincing'' when the president tried to persuade him to modify
Soviet policy and Reagan, speaking later, abandoned that tack.
   The president said bureaucracy _ not willful Soviet policy _ may
be responsible for baring thousands of Jews and others from leaving
the Soviet Union.
   ``I just have to believe that in any government some of us do
find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' he told a windup news
conference in the ballroom of Spasso House, the Moscow home of
American ambassadors.
   The Reagans leave Thursday for a day in London en route home.
   His summit work over, Reagan strolled hand-in-hand with wife
Nancy in the moonlight through Red Square at midnight after a night
out on the town with the Gorbachevs.
   Their motorcade stopped between St. Basil's cathedral and the
russet walls of the ancient fortress. About 1,000 onlookers were
held back as the Reagans took in the scene and walked across the
cobblestone plaza.
   If the leaders put new warmth in their relationship, their wives
did not.
   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev engaged in a feisty competition
for the press' attention with Mrs. Reagan cutting in at one point
while Mrs. Gorbachev was talking. Said the first lady, ``I want to
say something; I want to say something, OK?'' Mrs. Gorbachev fell
silent.
   Mrs. Reagan characterized their relationship as ``a Mexican
standoff'' _ a tie.
   A satisfied Gorbachev held a 110-minute news conference _ his
first ever on Soviet soil _ and called the summit ``a blow to the
foundations of the Cold War.''
   For his part, Reagan said again that his characterization of the
Soviet Union as ``the evil empire'' no longer applies.
   The Reagans and Gorbachevs got together Wednesday night to take
in the Bolshoi Ballet then shared a private moment over a cozy
dinner at a government-owned dacha outside Moscow.
   At the ballet, many in the audience of about 2,000 people waved
and applauded when they arrived at the opulent red and gold theater
and again before they departed. The first ladies did not speak to
one another.
   The human rights issue took an odd turn in back-to-back news
conferences that followed the final summit talks.
   Gorbachev said he was ``not filled with admiration at this
aspect of the visit,'' referring to Reagan's meetings with Soviet
dissidents and refuseniks. Reagan dropped his cudgel, suggesting
that Soviet failure to allow free emigration might stem more from
bureaucratic problems than Kremlin policy.
   ``A great deal is due to the General Secretary,'' the president
said of his remarkably softer tone toward the Kremlin. The
statement raised eyebrows among several refuseniks, including Tanya
Zieman who has been waiting 11 years to gain an exit visa.
   Gorbachev, at his own news conference, said the two leaders, in
what will be their final summit unless the remaining arms impasses
are bridged by negotiators in Geneva, ``have freed themselves from
all sorts of propaganda gambits.''
   In fact, Reagan said, ``I'm going to do everything I can to
persuade my successor to follow up and continue'' the policy of
reconciliation. There was no palpable optimism that an offensive
weapons pact can be reached in Reagan's term, but both leaders
pledged to try.
   ``The first lines have already been written into a book of the
world without nuclear weapons,'' Gorbachev said upon exchanging
finals papers the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, a
lesser arms accord that was completed at the 1987 summit. ``... I
don't think anyone can close the book on that and put it aside,''
he said.
   In remarks after a ceremony punctuated with smiles and
handshakes, Gorbachev said Reagan had disavowed his description of
the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire.'' With satisfaction, he said:
   ``Somebody asked the president whether he still considered the
Soviet Union to be an `evil empire.' He said no, and he said that
within the walls of the Kremlin, next to the czars gun, right in
the heart of that evil empire. We take note of that,'' he said.
``As the ancient Greeks say, everything flows, everything changes.
Everything is in a state of flux.''
   It was once hoped that this week's summit would be crowned by an
agreement to slash long-range nuclear weapons 30 to 50 percent.
Instead, the leaders deadlocked on the accord and instead exchanged
final papers on the treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear
weapons.
   Edward L. Rowny, a senior U.S. arms control adviser, said ``we
didn't get anywhere on sea-launched cruise missiles, we did not get
anywhere on the SDI-ABM problem.''
   He referred to a disagreement over how to monitor cruise
missiles carried on warships and on the link the Soviets have made
between the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative and the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The two disputes are the key obstacles to completing the treaty.
   The SDI program, which seeks a space-based defense against
Soviet ballistic missiles, will involve technology tests that the
Soviets say threaten the 1972 treaty.
   Reagan said Tuesday ``it's never been part of the negotiations.''
   On the other hand, a joint communique issued at the end of the
formal talks said ``common ground'' had been reached during the
Moscow summit on verifying mobile missiles and cruises carried by
airplanes.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators were instructed to ``record these
gains'' in the text of the START treaty when they return to Geneva
on July 12 from a six-week vacation.
   Reagan eased off his criticism of the Soviets apparently because
he expects favorable action on the 14 human rights cases he
presented in a list to Gorbachev. Instead of condemning the
communist system, he chided bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Reagan's Remarks On Homeless Cause Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the homeless Wednesday criticized
President Reagan's remarks at a Moscow news conference defending
the nation's treatment of the homeless by citing the case of a
street woman who fought New York City's efforts to hospitalize her.
   They said Reagan inaccurately described the case of Joyce Brown,
the homeless woman who waged the much-publicized battle against the
city.
   Reagan's remarks came in response to a reporter's suggestion
that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not convinced by the
president's statements that serious human rights deficiencies did
not exist in America.
   He said he wished Gorbachev would visit the United States long
enough to correct the ``mistaken view about the things that
occasionally dominate the press, about prejudice, racial or
religious, in our country, about people, the so-called street
people who apparently have no place to live.''
   ``But I don't think he quite could understand a recent
situation: a young lady living on the sidewalks of New York, living
out there on the sidewalk, winter and summer, and so for her own
sake, the police picked her up to bring her to where she could be
placed in a shelter and she took her case to court and won her case
in court that she should be allowed to go back and sleep on the
sidewalk where she had been because that's what she preferred to do.
   ``Well, when you have a free country, how far can we go in
impinging on the freedom of someone who says this is the way I want
to live? I think we could straighten him out if he saw what we did
in our country.''
   Brown, also known as Billie Boggs, was taken off Second Avenue
in Manhattan last year under a city program regarding mentally
disturbed street people.
   Homeless who are believed to threaten the safety of others or
themselves are taken off the streets and put in a special ward of
Bellevue Hospital. They are not taken to a shelter, as the
president said.
   Brown, it was alleged, defecated on the street, shouted at
passers-by and burned money that was given to her.
   A judge ruled that Brown was competent to decide where she
should live. On appeal, she was found to be incompetent, but was
released when another judge found that the city could not force her
to take medication.
   She has not returned to the streets, but is receiving disability
payments and living at a private shelter for the homeless.
   ``Although I have my freedom, I still do not have adequate
housing. Why doesn't the president assist me in getting permanent
housing?'' Brown said in response to the president's remarks,
according to Norman Siegel, her attorney and executive director of
the New York Civil Liberties Union.
   He said she was ``hoping someone from the White House would call
and help her find an apartment.''
   Siegel said Brown's case showed that ``the system was forced to
work to protect her right to individual liberty, but it also served
(to show) in a broader context of the failure to provide adequate
housing.''
   ``Today, in America, there are thousands of homeless on the
streets'' and he attributed it to ``the failure of the Reagan
administration to provide meaningful programs.''
   Peter Smith, president of the Partnership for the Homeless,
which operates shelters in New York and elsewhere, also decried
Reagan's comments.
   ``The president's statement ... suggesting that the shameful
problem of growing homelessness in America is the result of what he
referred to as `street people' who are homeless by choice totally
ignores the fact that the vast majority of homelessness has been
caused by his own policies which have gutted the principal federal
programs to provide affordable housing for low-income and
moderate-income people,'' Smith said.
   ``The most authoritative national survey of 47 of our largest
cities shows that less than 7 percent of the homeless are so by
choice and most homeless are members of families who simply cannot
find affordable housing.''
   Edward Abrahams, associate director of the Coalition for the
Homeless in New York, agreed that Reagan had misrepresented the
homeless problem. Many of the homeless are families, he said; he
estimated there were 750,000 homeless children, and their average
age is 6.
   ``If Mr. Gorbachev was to visit this country, he wouldn't be
here long before he saw homeless people. He would see them at
Kennedy Airport, where he might arrive; he would see them living
across the street from the White House, where he would be
greeted,'' Abrahams said.

<HEAD>NBC President Warns Broadcast Rules Hampering Networks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government regulation is hobbling the three
major television broadcast networks in the face of unregulated
competition from the cable industry, the president of top-rated NBC
said Wednesday.
   ``Given the economics of the network business today, the
depressing fact is that you have to be the first-place network to
keep your head above water, because second- or third-place doesn't
do it for you anymore,'' Robert Wright said in a speech to
representatives of the cable and broadcast industries.
   ``And without some new sources of income, the future of the
networks, to put it charitably, is uncertain,'' he said.
   Wright said NBC, the prime-time leader, is in a better financial
position than CBS and ABC because of ``a few more hit shows than
the other guys have and a gentleman named Bill Cosby, who cannot be
expected to carry us over the top forever.'' The Cosby Show is one
of TV's top-rated shows.
   The NBC president said the networks are being hamstrung by
outdated federal regulations that bar the networks from having a
financial interest in programs produced by others and limit what
they can produce themselves. The government also prohibits the
networks from owning cable systems, syndicating programs
domestically and sharing in the profits of syndication of shows
produced by network-owned stations.
   Supplying cable programming and operating cable networks are two
of the few opportunities available to the networks to broaden their
business bases, he said.
   ``We can do in cable what we can't do in broadcasting,'' Wright
told reporters after his speech.
   NBC last month announced that it had agreed to buy the Tempo
Television cable channel from Tele-Communications Inc., and use it
to launch two new cable services. The services _ a
sports-programming network and a business-news service _ will rely
on the resources of NBC News and NBC Sports.
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. also has stepped into the cable arena,
with ownership of ESPN.
   ``The fresh breeze of deregulation hasn't blown much over the
networks. We've felt very little benefit,'' Wright said. ``The
network rules still stand like an aging colosseum. We're inside
looking over the walls at the young lions who have been set free to
enjoy an open marketplace.''

<HEAD>Hutton Investigator Says He Couldn't Find Guilt in Top Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell testified
Wednesday that his private investigation of check kiting at E.F.
Hutton didn't fault senior management because he couldn't find
evidence of wrongdoing at the top.
   Bell, sued for defamation for identifying a former Hutton branch
manager as a wrongdoer in a 1985 report, stoutly defended the
investigation his Atlanta law firm conducted after Hutton pleaded
guilty to 2,000 mail and wire fraud charges.
   ``I thought I could catch a high person, but I never could,''
Bell said.
   Though he was suspicious that top officials were aware of
illegal overdrafting practices, Bell said he found no evidence of
intentional wrongdoing by senior executives.
   ``I'm not going to put my name on something charging somebody
with wrongdoing if they ... did not have the intent to do something
wrong,'' Bell testified in the federal court trial of the case
brought by former Hutton branch manager John M. Pearce.
   Pearce, now a Sarasota, Fla., businessman, claims Bell
negligently ignored evidence that cash management practices that
led to Hutton's guilty plea were approved by top executives.
   Pearce, who ran Hutton branches in Bethesda, Md., and St. Louis,
alleges that Bell's report put false blame on him and the eight
other branch and regional officials who were identified as
initiating illegal overdrafting.
   But Bell testified that Pearce ``never told me that anybody
authorized him to do that.''
   ``I asked him about paying a penalty. He said he didn't think he
should have to pay a penalty because he was a manager and not an
account executive.''
   The former attorney general quoted Pearce as saying: ``Why don't
you take it out of my bonus.''
   Bell, a senior partner at the Atlanta law firm of King &
Spalding, was hired by Hutton to conduct the investigation after
the brokerage firm pleaded guilty to the charges on May 2, 1985.
His report was issued on Sept. 4, 1985.
   Hutton, now part of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., agreed to pay a
$2 million fine and reimburse banks for interest lost on checks
written for amounts greater than funds it kept in its checking
accounts.
   The company also agreed to stop certain cash management
practices that investigators said gained Hutton as much as $250
million a day in interest-free loans.
   Bell said that when he had trouble getting documents from the
company's law firm, he visited Hutton chairman Robert M. Fomon to
get the material for his investigation.
   ``I told him there was going to be an historical marker in front
of the Hutton building saying: `This is where the company was. They
lost the company because their lawyers were claiming
attorney-client privilege.''' Bell said.
   ``At that point I started getting documents,'' said Bell, a
former federal appellate judge who also served as President
Carter's first attorney general.
   Although Bell did not find wrongdoing by top managers, he
faulted senior executives for not properly monitoring the cash
management procedures being followed at lower levels in the company.
   ``They didn't have any controls at all,'' Bell testified. The
company was ``just letting people go wild, doing whatever they
wanted to do.''
   The report recommended that Thomas P. Morley, the ``money
mobilizer'' who devised aggressive cash management systems, be
relieved of any duties involving Hutton's banking activities.
   ``Everybody disowned Mr. Morley,'' Bell said. ``Nobody owned up
that they had anything to do with him.''
   Thomas P. Lynch, executive vice president, was identified in the
investigation as the company's chief financial officer and forced
to resign for failing to maintain proper controls.
   Bell said his investigation had trouble identifying which top
executive ultimately was responsible for the firm's financial
procedures because ``nobody wanted to be known as the chief
financial officer.''
   Many overdrafting procedures used by large companies, including
Hutton, are legal because the banks are aware of them, Bell said.
   But he conceded in questioning by Pearce's lawyer, Stephen
Milliken, that in the case of many Hutton accounts, ``most banks,
or many banks, did not know what was happening to them.''
   ``My best information was they did not tell the banks, except in
a few instances'' Bell said.

<HEAD>Rep. William Gray To Head Up Democratic Platform-Drafting
Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania has been named
chairman of the party's platform-drafting committee, Democratic
National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk announced Wednesday.
   Kirk said Gray, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, will
head up the 15-member panel that will draft the party's
presidential platform.
   ``Congressman Gray enjoys the respect of both the presidential
campaigns, all the members of Congress, and has proven ... to be a
man of commitment to principle,'' Kirk said.
   He said Jesse Jackson was told about the planned appointment of
Gray, who is black.
   ``I told him about my intentions, he expressed no opposition,''
Kirk said. ``I told him that _ with respect to this entire process
_ we wanted to make sure that there was fair representation of the
membership.''
   The platform-drafting panel, along with one non-voting
representative from the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns, will convene
June 9-12 on Mackinac Island, Michigan, to develop a working draft.
   Theodore C. Sorensen, former aide to President John F. Kennedy,
has been asked to assist the committee, Kirk said.
   The draft will be considered at a final meeting of the full
platform committee June 25 in Denver, and will be presented before
the party on July 19 during its national convention, Kirk said.
   Kirk said he hopes the committee will produce a platform that
will solidify voter confidence in the Democratic Party and steer
clear of a wish list for a variety of special interests.
   ``I hope it will be ... an open letter to the working people of
America, representing their views,'' Kirk said.

<HEAD>Army Makes Premature Finding Against Radio Wave Interference As
Crash Cause</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army appears to have ``prematurely'' ruled
out the possibility that radio wave interference can cause its new
UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter to crash, the Pentagon's inspector
general said Wednesday.
   The inspector general, in a long-awaited 25-page report, said
laboratory and field testing had established that high levels of
electro-magnetic energy _ such as radio or radar transmissions _
can affect the flight control systems of the Blackhawk.
   The question, the Pentagon's independent auditor continued, is
whether such radio interference can become severe enough to cause
one of the choppers to crash.
   The Army ``has determined that electro-magnetic interference is
not a safety of flight issue,'' the inspector general noted. ``But
the Army Safety Center seems to have taken a different position.
   ``It stated that while electro-magnetic interference has not
been demonstrated to be a safety of flight issue, it has not been
definitively ruled out ... We agree with the position of the Army
Safety Center that test data available to date are not sufficiently
conclusive ...
   ``A negative safety of flight determination ... has been made
prematurely.''
   The audit report also went on to criticize the Army's handling
of the problem, disclosing:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Army investigators have never identified electro-magnetic
interference ``as a cause of, or even a contributing factor in, any
accident in the aircraft reviewed.''
   _The Army has been slow in addressing the Blackhawk's problems
with radio interference and is now pursuing a questionable approach
to solving the matter.
   Most of the testing to date has involved only simulated
conditions, and the Army appears to be planning assembly line
improvements that would address only those problems that have
cropped up to date.
   ``Thus, the Army appears to be concentrating on the symptom and
ignoring the illness,'' the auditors wrote. ``Testing has not been
sufficient or timely.''
   _The Army could have obtained detailed technical and cost
information on what it takes to harden the Blackhawk's systems
against radio interference from the Navy two years ago _ but failed
to do so.
   The Navy, which uses a variant known as the SH-60 Seahawk, has
specified a level of protection against interference that is 10
times greater than the Army's, the auditors said.
   The release of the inspector general's report comes just a week
after the Army announced it was accelerating plans to shield one
key control system of the Blackhawk against interference.
   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, said the service intended to
study the new report closely but he disputed some of the report's
conclusions.
   ``The report implies that we have been suppressing
recommendations from the safety center,'' Soucy said.
   ``Our approach to this has been anything but cavalier. The
director of the safety center has supported our approach and we
have moved as expeditiously as the evidence allowed. And any
suggestion the Army is placing dollars in front of safety is a
gross error.''
   The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that is
replacing the aging UH-1 Huey copters of the Vietnam era as the
Army's primary air assault and air cavalry craft.
   Last November, Knight-Ridder Newspapers reported investigators
were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk
accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen. The Army and the
aircraft's maker, the Sikorsky Aircraft unit of the United
Technologies Corp., denied that report.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted 377-5 on Wednesday for a bill
that would authorize money for juvenile delinquency, runaway youth
and missing children.
   The legislation, which went to the Senate, is an authorization
bill that does not include actual appropriations.
   The bill would establish a new program to finance prevention and
treatment programs for youth gangs. Grants would be issued to local
groups and agencies in an effort to prevent youngsters from taking
part in gang activities.
   The legislation also would increase the minimum grant for state
juvenile justice programs from the current $225,000 to $325,000.
   An amendment added on the House floor would require any
applicant for money to assure it has a policy of a drug-free
workplace.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would cost
$25 million in fiscal 1989, $84 million in 1990, and $118 million
in 1991.

<HEAD>Dukakis Salutes Jackson But Says He'll Get No Special VP
Consideration</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis publicly saluted Jesse Jackson on Wednesday for
``great gifts and great strengths'' but said his Democratic
presidential rival is not entitled to special consideration when it
comes time to pick a running mate. Vice President George Bush
reaffirmed his opposition to tax hikes.
   Dukakis also said in a private meeting with fund-raisers that he
would consider ``geographical balance'' in deciding his vice
presidential running mate and would look for someone with a
``substantive background that supplements my own,'' according to
one person who attended the session.
   The Massachusetts governor has come under pressure from some
Democats to select a running mate from the West or the South to
provide geographical balance to the ticket. He frequently has been
advised to pick someone with greater experience in foreign policy
and defense matters than he has accumulated in 10 years in the
Boston Statehouse.
   Jackson, nearing the end of his remarkable, but losing, primary
campaign, walked along a garbage-strewn beach in New Jersey and
called on corporations and the federal government to take a more
active role in fighting pollution.
   Dukakis is expected to clinch the Democratic nomination next
week when the final primary elections of the Democratic campaign
are held in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   Both Dukakis and Bush worked Wednesday at unifying their parties
for what both sides predict will be a tense, tight fall election.
   The Massachusetts governor enlisted the support of nearly 30
Democratic National Convention delegates, many of whom earlier
supported dropout candidate Albert Gore Jr. Dukakis also met over
breakfast with fund-raisers for Gore and Rep. Richard Gephardt as
part of his campaign's effort to help raise $50 million for use by
the national and state parties in the fall campaign.
   Bush's campaign _ which sewed up the Republican nomination
several weeks ago _ showed off a little unity of its own when Sen.
Charles Grassley and Gov. Terry Branstad formally announced their
decision to head the GOP effort in Iowa.
   ``We know it won't be easy'' to carry the state, said Branstad.
``But it can be done.'' Bush finished third in the state's caucuses
in February, with Grassley backing the winner, Sen. Bob Dole, and
Branstad professing neutrality.
   As the long primary season was coming to a close, a candidate
from the past _ former Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota
_ announced his fourth try for the presidency. McCarthy, whose 1968
candidacy was a rallying point for Americans opposed to the Vietnam
War, said he was running on the Consumer Party ticket.
   McCarthy, speaking to reporters and about 100 tourists near
Independence Hall in Philadelphia, said he sees no real choice
between the Democratic and Republican candidates.
   Bush was at his oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he
has been meeting with economists and other outside advisers for the
past several days.
   The vice president looked on as Republican Rep. Bill Frenzel of
Minnesota, a supporter who is also a member of a bipartisan
deficit-reduction commission, expressed skepticism over Bush's
campaign pledge to reject any tax-raising proposal the group might
come up with.
   ``That's what I think an election is about,'' Bush said. ``The
commission can take an objective look and come up with whatever it
wants. I'd be much more persuaded by what the American people say.''
   Bush also took a swipe at Democrats, saying, ``All they want to
do is tax and spend. There is no change I can see or hear out of
that campaign that would lead you to believe anything other than
that on the Democratic side.''
   Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, who was among
the advisers meeting with Bush on Wednesday, took a slap at
Dukakis' fiscal policies. The economic boom in Dukakis' state is
frequently referred to by the governor as the ``Massachusetts
miracle.'' Darman called it the ``Massachusetts mirage.''
   Jackson spent much of his day in New Jersey before flying to
California for the final few days of his primary candidacy. He
stepped over broken glass, plastic bottles, fast-food containers
and other debris as he walked along a once-popular resort beach to
dramatize his call for environmental cleanup.
   ``If the Russians were poisoning our air, if they were dumping
sludge in the water, if they were killing fish, we would call that
chemical warfare and we would negotiate tough,'' he said.
   But campaign rhetoric aside, the final days of the Democratic
primary campaign were taking on the appearance of an elaborate
public and private negotiation between Dukakis and Jackson over the
party's vice presidential candidate and national convention.
   Jackson said Tuesday that he had earned consideration for the
vice presidential nomination, and Dukakis said emphatically on
Wednesday that he agreed.
   ``He's somebody who's done a remarkable job, has great gifts and
great strengths,'' Dukakis said. ``I respect and admire him a lot.''
   But asked if Jackson deserves special consideration to be on the
ticket, he said, ``No.''
   Dukakis spent most of his day in Boston, where he called for the
creation of a new national student loan program that would ensure
repayment through payroll deductions.
   ``We need a president who will end the annual assault on Pell
Grants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students,'' he said.
   In other developments:
   _ The Dukakis campaign said Dukakis' wife, Kitty, will undergo
tests at a Boston hospital to determine the cause of pain and
numbness she has been experiencing. A preliminary diagnosis
indicated two herniated disks in the neck area.
   _ Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said Rep.
William Gray of Pennsylvania has been named chairman of the party's
platform-drafting committee. Gray is chairman of the House Budget
Committee.

<HEAD>Document Alleges Mexican Officials Received Bribes From Drug
Trafficker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of dollars in bribes were paid to
Mexico's defense minister and other officials, and U.S. Customs
agents let loads of marijuana pass through a border station,
according to an affidavit in a drug-smuggling case.
   The affidavit was filed by the U.S. attorney's office in U.S.
District Court in support of the government's seizure of more than
$10 million in assets belonging to Jaime Javier Figueroa-Soto and
nine others. They were arrested last week during raids involving
more than 100 officers in several cities.
   Drug Enforcement Administration agent Leonard Williams displayed
some of the assets Tuesday and said he expects more arrests and
asset seizures in coming weeks.
   The affidavit contains a charge by a DEA informer that Gen. Juan
Arevalo Gardoqui, Mexico's defense minister, received a $10 million
bribe in 1984 from an alleged partner of Figueroa-Soto's, Rafael
Caro Quintero, to assure protection of marijuana and poppy fields
in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.
   Arevalo Gardoqui has denied his family is involved in drug
trafficking, and the Mexican federal attorney general's office also
denied the allegations against Arevalo and other top law
enforcement officials, The Arizona Daily Star reported Saturday.
   The affidavit also alleged that in 1983 Figueroa-Soto, as head
of a marijuana growers' cooperative in Sonora, paid Dr. Samuel
Ocana-Garcia, who was then Sonora's governor, to ensure the safety
of fields. Sonora is the Mexican state that borders Arizona.
   Ocana-Garcia also has denied any tie to narcotics trafficking.
   Officials have described Figueroa-Soto, who was arrested at his
Scottsdale home last Thursday, as perhaps the largest Mexican
marijuana dealer and worth an estimated $150 million. He was
ordered held under $50 million bond last week.
   The affidavit, which was filed last week and first made public
by The Daily Star, also said DEA agents were told that INS
inspector Oscar Sainz allowed tons of marijuana to enter the United
States at Nogales in 1983.
   It also said Customs official Robert Huerta allowed trailer
loads of up to 15 tons of marijuana to pass his inspection station
at Nogales.
   Acting port director in Nogales Gary Rehbein would not say
whether Sainz or Huerta were under investigation, The Arizona
Republic reported Wednesday. He said Sainz resigned about four
years ago without disciplinary action and that Huerta was still
working at the port.
   The DEA's Williams said Tuesday that officers seized $6.7
million in cash and bank accounts in last week's raids in cities in
Texas, Arizona and California, along with an estimated $500,000 in
jewelry, seven homes valued at $1.7 million, 40 vehicles worth $1
million, two airplanes worth $115,000 and 90 pounds of marijuana.
   Williams predicted more arrests and cash seizures in coming
weeks.
   Judge G. Thomas Meehan of Pima County Superior Court on Tuesday
delayed preliminary hearings for Figueroa-Soto and several others
until at least June 9.

<HEAD>Family Honor At Heart of Bedouin Murder Conspiracy Trial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents of 3rd graf, `The Tarawnehs ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bedouin couple demanded the death
and mutilation of their unwanted son-in-law to avenge their honor,
prosecutors said Wednesday, but the defense accused authorities of
blowing up a tragic family problem into a murder conspiracy case.
   Suad and Ghada Tarawneh, now of Toledo, Ohio, are accused of
plotting to kill their daughter's husband and his family because in
1986 the 17-year-old girl spurned a marriage they arranged, and
instead married her Syrian cousin.
   The Tarawnehs asked a private detective, Ron Petrillo, to cut
off the son-in-law's finger and genitals and return them to the
couple, along with color photos of the bodies, Assistant State
Attorney William Dimitrouleas said in his opening arguments.
   The alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt, but the
parents were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to
commit murder. The Tarawnehs were arrested last February in Toledo
after Petrillo contacted authorities about the case.
   ```I'd like to keep the photos of the body as a souvenir,'''
Dimitrouleas quoted Tarawneh as saying on secretly recorded tapes.
```You're Italian, Petrillo, you understand family. You understand
honor. That's why we asked you to help us.'''
   Dimitrouleas quoted Tarawneh as telling the detective ``We are
Moslem, and when you are in the desert, honor is very important to
you.''
   The prosecutor took aim at defense contentions that the threats
against the son-in-law were only empty words. He noted that the
cautious Tarawneh had even called Petrillo to Toledo because he did
not want to use the word ``kill'' over the telephone.
   In his opening arguments, defense attorney Don Spadaro disputed
the prosecution version, saying the Tarawnehs were not killers, but
tragic victims wrapped up in the emotions of their family crisis
and the father's drinking.
   ``The first tragedy was the drinking problem, the second was the
loss of their daughter in 1986 and the third was the hiring of this
investigator,'' said Spadaro.
   Petrillo, he said, had been hired to find the daughter and
located her in nearby Tamarac. But when she refused to see her
parents, the detective turned their angry initial reaction into a
murder plot, Spadaro said.
   Tarawneh, 46, a gynecologist, and his wife, 44, a nurse, left
Jordan 18 years ago. When their daughter Raniah married her Syrian
cousin Mouataz Abdulsalam in 1986 over their objections, the
angered parents said their honor had been blackened and had to be
avenged. Abdulsalam is the son of Mrs. Tarawneh's sister.
   The daughter testified Wednesday that her father once sent her
uncle to kill her in Syria, and had tried to cut off her hand when
she first told him she wanted to marry her cousin. He also had her
jailed briefly on what she said were trumped-up charges of stealing
her mother's jewelry.
   ``He said I'd regret it, he'd kill me, he'd kill my husband,
that I would regret it for the rest of my life,'' she testified.
   But, she said, he also wrote her a card apologizing, saying ``I
never meant to hurt you _ you are my blood and flesh.'' She said
her father abused both alcohol and prescription drugs, and had lost
jobs at hospitals because of his habits.
   At first the Tarawnehs planned to kidnap their daughter and sell
her into a prostitution ring in Jordan, but that fell through and
they switched to the murder plot, according to investigator Mike
Breece of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
   The alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt, but the
parents were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to

<HEAD>Study: Lead Concentrations in School Water Violates EPA
Regulations</HEAD>

   The city shipped bottled water to half of its
elementary schools Wednesday after state health officials found
lead concentrations in drinking water exceeded federal limits.
   Officials also plan to test schools outside the city following a
report that drinking water in 40 Boston grade schools is unsafe and
that water in another 19 schools contained lead levels just below
Environmental Protection Agency limits, said Deborah
Prothrow-Stith, state public health commissioner.
   ``Obviously there is a problem and there's going to have to be
more testing to insure that the public health and welfare is
protected,'' said Paul G. Keough, EPA deputy regional
administrator. ``We are concerned because some of the levels were
very high.''
   Some parents gave their children bottles of water to take
Wednesday, and school officials said they were concerned about the
dangers of extended consumption of lead-tainted water for the
city's 30,000 students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.
   ``This is another situation where urban schools are left
behind,'' said William Ubinas, principal of the William Blackstone
School in the city's South End. ``Now we not only have to deal with
the drug problem and the traffic outside but the lead. When will we
be allowed to educate?''
   The state Department of Public Health sampled water at 79 public
and two private elementary schools over the Memorial Day weekend
after a television station reported high lead content at eight
schools.
   Water at 40 schools exceeded the EPA limit of 50 parts per
million of lead in drinking water. The tests revealed a level of
2,300 parts per million at the water supply source in one school
and 1,400 ppm at a water fountain in another.
   Keough said the EPA in July plans to recommend reducing the
unsafe lead content level to 20 ppm. The tests showed an additional
19 schools had lead concentrations of between 20 and 50 ppm.
   Lead poisoning attacks the brain, kidneys, nervous system and
red blood cells and can lead to brain damage and death, health
officials said. Lead occurs in food, air, soil, dust, paint and
water.
   Officials said poisoning is rarely caused by contaminated water
alone, but overexposure to lead can stunt physical and mental
development in children, causing nervous disorders, learning
disabilities and mental problems. Children under 8 are especially
vulnerable, they added.
   Ralph Timperi, director of the State Laboratory Institute in
Boston, which analyzed the water samples, said three likely sources
for the lead are lead pipes, lead solder used from 1980-86 and
electric cooling systems in water fountains. Some lead pipes in
Boston schools are more than 50 years old, he said.
   Schools are more susceptible to high lead levels because water
sits in pipes after school and on weekends, allowing greater lead
absorption.
   In a 1976 study, the EPA found that 25 percent of Boston-area
households exceeded federal lead safety limits.
   Keough said officials will attack the problem on a ``fountain by
fountain'' basis by repairing or replacing pipes, solder and
cooling systems.
   The Great Bear Spring Co. of Canton Wednesday delivered 680
five-gallon bottles of water, 136 coolers and 272,000 paper cups to
city schools, Great Bear sales manager Donna Pires-Donaghy said.

   Business boomed on Broadway during the 1987-88
season with a record $253 million worth of tickets sold to more
than 8.1 million theatergoers, the League of American Theaters and
Producers announced Wednesday.
   The figures solidified the upturn in ticket sales that began
during the previous season when grosses totaled $209 million and
some 7 million people saw a Broadway show, the league said.
   But while the grosses and attendance were up, production was
down, with only 32 shows opening on Broadway between June 1, 1987
and May 29, 1988, compared to 40 the previous season. Still, the
shows that managed to get to Broadway during the 1987-88 survived
longer.
   ``There's a lot of choice on Broadway which is probably why
there are so many people going,'' said George Wachtel, director of
research for the league. ``We sold almost 200,000 tickets in each
of the last three weeks. That's about as good as it ever gets.''
   Musicals, particularly ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' again
dominated the year, but several plays were also very strong at the
box office. ``Phantom,'' which had a record $19 million advance
sale, is expected to have as long a life in New York as such hardy
holdovers from other seasons as ``Les Miserables,'' ``Cats,''
``42nd Street'' and ``A Chorus Line.''
   There were 12 new musicals on Broadway during the 1987-88
season, compared to 11 the previous year. Although ``Phantom'' was
the season's biggest musical hit, several other musicals were
popular including ``Sarafina!,'' a South African musical;
``Chess,'' the Tim Rice-ABBA-Trevor Nunn extravaganza about
international chess matches, and ``Into the Woods,'' a fairy tale
musical written by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Of the
season's six revivals, the most successful was the Lincoln Center
revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes.''
   There were eight new plays on Broadway, down from 13 the
previous season, but of the eight, only one _ ``Serious Money'' _
was a quick flop. Five others are still running including the four
Tony nominees for best play _ ``A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee
Blessing, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' by August Wilson, ``M.
Butterfly'' by David Henry Hwang and ``Speed-the-Plow'' by David
Mamet.
   ``How many seasons have there been where a show like `Burn This'
would not be nominated for best play?'' Wachtel said, referring to
the season's fifth new play still running. ``In that sense, I think
it was a rich season.''
   If box office receipts were up, so were costs and ticket prices
as well as risks to producers. The $50 ticket for a musical is now
the norm rather than the exception. A $40 top ticket for a play on
weekend nights is also not unusual. The average paid admission,
according to the league, was $31.10, up from $29.86 for the
previous season.
   The flops were more costly too. ``Carrie,'' a musical based on
the Stephen King horror novel, lost a record $8 million and closed
after five performances, the most expensive failure in Broadway
history.
   Wachtel looks for the increase in ticket sales to continue.
   ``In terms of attendance, I think we will do very well because
the last three weeks have been extraordinary,'' he said. ``We have
the momentum to keep going. A lot of that may be from tourism and
the weakness of the dollar. The pick up we usually get from tourism
during the summer is happening earlier.''

<TEXT>
   A judge has struck down a congressional
provision that bars the Reagan administration from requiring
government workers to sign secrecy pledges during the first 10
months of this year.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled that the provision
contained in a spending resolution passed by Congress last December
unconstitutionally intruded on the president's power to protect
government secrets.
   ``With a tug of the purse strings section 630 (of the spending
resolution) establishes a precedent unrestrained by discernible
standards and intrudes dramatically upon presidential authority,''
Gasch said in a May 27 ruling made public this week.
   The judge made the decision in suits by seven members of
Congress and three federal employee organizations charging the
Reagan administration flouted the continuing resolution by
requiring employees with access to classified information to sign
security forms.
   SF189, already signed by more than 1.7 million federal
employees, is a pledge never to divulge classified or classifiable
information without permission. The other form, SF4193, requires
employees to seek ``prepublication review of contemplated
disclosures.''
   The forms are criticized by members of Congress who contend that
they stem the flow of information to Capitol Hill.
   Gasch found that ``the sensitive and complicated role cast for
the president as this nation's emissary in foreign relations
requires that congressional intrusion upon the president's
oversight of national security information be more severely limited
than might be required in matters of purely domestic concern.''
   Gasch said he found ``particularly offensive'' provisions of the
continuing resolution that barred the president from preventing
federal employees from communicating with Congress or interfering
with the legislative branch's ability to get secret information
from government employees.
   Another provision Gasch found objectionable bars any secrecy
agreement that is at odds with existing law.
   ``Read together, these provisions of section 630 permit the
president to ensure the secrecy of national security information
only by those means authorized by Congress,'' Gasch said.
   The suits were filed by the American Federation of Government
Employees, the American Foreign Service Association and the
National Federation of Federal Employees. They were joined by Sens.
David Pryor, D-Ark.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; and William
Proxmire, D-Wis.; as well as Reps. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Jack
Brooks, D-Texas; Patricia Schroeder, D-Col.; and Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn.
   Gasch dismissed all suits except several claims by AFGE that the
secrecy agreements violated employees' First and Fifth Amendment
rights.
   Patti Goldman, an attorney for Public Citizen Litigation Group,
which represented the foreign service officers, said the plaintiffs
planned to appeal what she called an unprecedented limit on the
power of Congress in this area.
   Usually courts defer to the president in the absence of any
action by Congress, she said. ``I don't know of any situation where
Congress acts and the president says `Nay, nay, I am not going to
do it.' This is a new twist.''

   Strong thunderstorms that brought flooding to north central
Texas redeveloped Wednesday, while other powerful storms rumbled
from the Plains to the Northeast, and hot weather clung to the Ohio
and Tennessee river valleys.
   North central Texas' storms brought wind gusts to 54 mph near
Haskill, but showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across
south central and southeast Texas.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered from central and
eastern parts of Nebraska and Kansas into north central and
northeast Oklahoma. Showers and thunderstorms were also devbeloping
across parts of central Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also scattered across parts of
the northern Plains, and from the eastern Great Lakes region
through New York state and north central Pennsylvania to the
central New England coast.
   Rainshowers also were scattered across the Pacific Northwest.
   The storms were being triggered by cooler air sagging southward
from Canada and the Northeast into a large area of very warm
temperatures.
   Temperatures reached the 90s Wednesday from the western Ohio
Valley through the middle Mississippi Valley and eastern Arkansas
to the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic Coast.
   Readings were in the 60s from northern New York into Maine, with
a few 50 degree temperatures across east central and southeast New
York.
   The low for the nation Wednesday was 23 at Gunnison, Colo.
Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47 degrees
at Missoula, Mont., to 97 degrees at Pope AFB near Fayetteville,
N.C., and the Naval Air station near Meridian, Miss.
   The national forecast for Thursday predicted rain likely across
the northern Pacific Coast, widespread across the Pacific Northwest
into northern California. Showers and thunderstorms will be
scattered from parts of northeast Texas through the lower Missouri
and middle Mississippi valleys, the upper Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley into the middle Atlantic states.
   High temperatures will be in the 70s or 80s across much of the
nation; in the 60s across much of the Pacific Northwest into the
central California coast, and from the eastern Great Lakes into
central New England; in the 50s across northern Maine and the New
England coast; the 90s in the Southern California valleys, the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas and much of the Southeast; and, between 100
and 110 across the desert Southwest.

   Johns Hopkins University capitalized on Soviet
errors to post a 15-2 victory Wednesday in the first U.S.-Soviet
baseball game ever played on Russian soil.
   Johns Hopkins struck immediately in the first inning, when
lead-off batter Tom Finegan doubled, then scored on two successive
wild wild pitches by the Soviets' Alexei Koshivoy. The Hopkins
squad put the game out of reach in the third when first baseman Dan
Durocher walked, advanced to second on a Koshivoy wild pitch and
scored on a single by second baseman Andy Bernstein.
   After two successive errors loaded the bases, third baseman John
Horner hit a drive that eluded center fielder Alexander
Krupenchenkov and Horner came all the way home to make the score
7-0.
   The Soviets scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings
on errant pickoff attempts.
   The Soviet team, from the D.I. Mendeleyev Institute of Chemical
Engineering, was outmatched from the start by the Americans'
pitching. As a result, the Soviets had trouble hitting the ball out
of the infield.
   But the matchup seemed to be less a sporting event and more an
exercise in good will, since the Johns Hopkins squad had offered
instruction to the Soviets earlier in the week and given the
Soviets souvenir T-shirts before the game.
   And the American team even provided excuses for their
opposition, noting that the Soviets were hampered because they
practice indoors and have to make do with old gloves made in Cuba
or gloves sewn by hand and field hockey balls and baseballs used
over and over again.
   Still, the crowd of about 300 people in the Lenin Komsomol
Automobile Factory stadium seemed to enjoy the game, cheering both
sides but also whistling in displeasure at the many errors by the
Soviets.
   Johns Hopkins alumnus Max Flaxman, a dealer in skins and hides
in Moscow, is responsible for arranging the game.
   President Reagan, busy elsewhere, was unable to throw out the
first pitch.
   The Soviets began their baseball program in 1987, with an eye on
the Olympics of 1992, when the game will be part of the
competition. A national Soviet squad played a team from Nicaragua
last summer, with disastrous results. The Soviets lost by scores of
22-0 and 30-2.
   But Johns Hopkins Coach Bob Babb said the Soviets are ``making
noticeable improvements each day ... each day they get a little
better.''
   Steven Holland, who is acting as the Johns Hopkins' trainer on
the trip, said that during the joint practice session on Monday,
``even guys who don't speak a word of Russian after a while were
saying ``Molodetz! Molodetz!'' (``Well done! Well done!'') after
the Russians made a good play.''
   Still, other members of the Hopkins squad said they were
surprised at the Russians' lack of basic baseball fundamentals,
such as catching and fielding, although they competed with the
intensity of a Pete Rose, now manager of the Cincinnati Reds, or
Kirk Gibson, an outfielder with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   ``They have a desire to play. They come out in the snow to
practice. They're really nuts about baseball,'' said Jim Timmerman,
the Johns Hopkins shortstop.
   Horner had said he was impressed by the toughness of the Soviet
players, most of whom are good athletes who play basketball,
volleyball, or compete in track.
   ``I saw one of their pitchers get hit in the back by a line
drive _ one of the hardest I've ever seen hit _ and he didn't even
flinch,'' he said before the game. ``They're not afraid of the
ball.''
   The Soviet media publicized the game and several newspapers ran
stories that caught the spirit of good will.
   A front-page article in Tuesday's editions of the newspaper
Sovietsky Sport carried the headline: ``When the score doesn't
count.''

<TEXT>
   A wholesale shift of Oklahoma delegates to
the camp of Michael Dukakis was announced Wednesday, moving the
Massachusetts governor ever closer to clinching the Democratic
nomination for president.
   The switch of 20 of the 26 delegates previously pledged to
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore was announced at a news conference at
the state Capitol by state Sen. Stratton Taylor, D-Oklahoma City,
chairman of Gore's Oklahoma campaign.
   Dukakis also picked up an endorsement from U.S. Sen. David
Boren, formerly a supporter of Gore.
   Boren, in a statement issued through his Washington, D.C.
office, called Dukakis a ``hard-working and capable governor.
   ``He has clearly emerged as the strong front-runner for the
nomination and is now entitled to have consensus support from the
party as we move toward the national convention in Atlanta,'' said
Boren.
   The changes announced Wednesday raised Dukakis' delegate
strength in Oklahoma from nine to 29. Dukakis finished third in
Oklahoma during the March 8 Super Tuesday primary behind Gore and
Rep. Richard Gephard of Missouri, who has since dropped out of the
race.

   Heavy thunderstorms dumped more than 10
inches of rain on this north-central Texas town, overflowing a
creek, obliterating an earthen dam and forcing the evacuation of
about 60 people early Wednesday, authorities said.
   The storm waters also damaged homes, businesses and bridges and
briefly shut down some highways elsewhere in the area late Tuesday
and early Wednesday.
   ``A wall of water came through here and these people barely got
out in time,'' said Gayle Godfrey as he stood amid torn furnishings
and soggy carpet drying on the shore of Lake Eans.
   The flood's apex came between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., and by 8:30
a.m., residents were allowed to return to their homes.
   All that remained of the former 100-acre private lake at
daylight were acres of mud, tons of debris and fallen trees.
   Maida Godfrey pointed to grass and mud stains 4{ feet high on
the white walls of her home, which she estimated sustained about
$30,000 in damage.
   ``We had to leave out the back door when the water came pouring
in,'' she said. ``We've lived here 22 years, and it's never gotten
this high before.''
   Mrs. Godfrey, 40, and her 18-year-old son, Sheridan, ran up a
hill to the home of a neighbor. From the top of the hill, she said
she heard a loud roar about 5 a.m. as water broke through the dam
that was built in the 1930s in a water reclamation project.
   Floodwaters also overflowed the banks of Indian Creek, tearing
through homes and businesses in Comanche and knocking chunks of
pavement from bridgets.
   ``I looked outside my trailer house to see how the rain was and
saw water flowing over my tires,'' said Terry Donald, who evacuated
his home about 4 a.m. ``My parents came over in a four-wheel drive
and got me. A fire truck came into the Indian Creek area later and
evacuated everybody else.
   ``At the trailer house across the street, they had to get a boat
to find that man. Water was chest-high in his house,'' Donald said.
   At Lake Comanche, about four miles southeast of this town of
12,600, a dam held but water spilled over its lip, said Duane Ogle,
a teacher at Comanche High School, where the evacuated residents
stayed until the floodwaters subsided.
   North along U.S. 377, the floodwaters blocked several
underpasses and bridges with logs and debris. The driver of an
18-wheeler reportedly swam to safety as floodwaters washed his
truck off the road.
   Streets in several other counties in the area also were flooded
by the storms, the National Weather Service reported.
   Comanche and 42 other Texas counties, most of them in the
north-central part of the state, remained under a severe
thunderstorm watch until late Wednesday night.

   The United States said Wednesday it
supports granting concessions to some of the world's poorest
nations to make it easier for them repay billions of dollars in
loans.
   Treasury Secretary James C. Baker told a news conference at the
annual meeting of the African Development Bank that lower interest
rates or more liberal terms of repayment could help ease the
pressure on those countries.
   Baker said members of the Paris Club _ a group of lenders
including the United States, Britain and France _ should be able to
negotiate their own terms of financing.
   ``It is important to realize that what we are talking about here
is a change in the policy of the Paris Club, which would permit
creditor governments to differentiate in the approach to
rescheduling,'' he said.
   Concessions would involve only ``official debt owed by the
poorest of the poor,'' he said.
   Most of the money owed by the poorest countries is ``official
debt'' _ funds lent by developed countries.
   Many African nations cannot repay foreign debts that now exceed
$200 billion for the continent and have urged Western nations to
write off part or all the obligation. Baker made clear he does not
propose that kind of relief.
   He said the U.S. proposal ``will continue to require that each
country be looked at on a case-by-case basis. It is therefore not a
call for a generalized debt relief proposal or a global approach,
if you will. But it does represent a change, it certainly does, as
far as official debt owed by the poorest of the poor.''
   In effect, this means the United States will not block efforts
by the other Paris Club member countries to draw up debt concession
agreements with certain countries.
   Asked if other members of the Club of Paris are likely to favor
his proposal, Baker said: ``I think it is a major step in the
direction of some suggestions that have been heretofore made by
some of our Paris Club partners. So I believe they will welcome
this.''
   ``Those governments that felt free, legally or from a policy
basis, to grant concessional or perhaps more concessional interest
rates would be free to do so, whereas other governments could
perhaps look at a broader range of maturities as a means of
contributing,'' Baker said.
   Baker said the U.S. administration does not have the authority
to write off debt.
   ``One of the difficulties ... the United States has with a
proposal to move to concessional interest rates on official debt is
that that constitutes to a degree debt forgiveness, which the
executive branch is not empowered, alone, to grant,'' he said.
   ``We are permitted to negotiate more liberal terms of repayment.
We have been doing that, and my remarks indicate a willingness on
our part to consider moving along that same path in the future,''
Baker said.

   Poor maintenance of the air conditioning system
and extensive construction in the vicinity were responsible for a
fatal outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at BBC headquarters,
investigators said Wednesday.
   Thirty-nine people contracted the disease in and around the
British Broadcasting Corp. offices from mid-April to early May and
two died, according to the Westminster Public Health Office.
   BBC executives and engineers who made up the investigating team
recommended improved maintenance procedures relating to its
water-cooled air conditioning system and examining links between
the disease and local construction and demolition projects.
   ``The outbreak appears to have been due to a combination of
internal and external factors,'' said chairman Charles Sandbank,
deputy director of engineering. ``The external factors included the
extensive demolition and building activity in the vicinity of
Broadcasting House.''
   ``Shortcomings were revealed in the ... procedures associated
with the applications of water treatment chemicals and biocides to
the cooling tower,'' he said.
   Legionnaires' disease was first diagnosed in 1976 when 221
people contracted it at an American Legion convention in
Philadelphia. It produces symptoms similar to pneumonia and often
caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning units.
   The BBC has said air systems in its buildings have been
disinfected.

   A major investor in the Seabrook nuclear
power plant said it would pull out of the troubled project
Wednesday, a setback that one opponent claimed could kill the
controversial plant.
   ``Our many successes have been hidden by the shadow of
Seabrook,'' said Gary L. Hunt, general manager of the Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., after its eight-member board of
directors voted to withdraw.
   MMWEC, with its 11.6 percent stake in the plant, is Seabrook's
fourth-largest investor. Its action ``will enable MMWEC to get on
with its business,'' Hunt added.
   The $5.4 billion Seabrook reactor is completed but lacks
approved evacuation plans required for commercial operation.
   In addition, its largest investor, Public Service Company of New
Hampshire, filed for U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection from
creditors on Jan. 28. PSNH owns 36 percent of the project.
   Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams said the action would have no
immediate effect, but he said the project's joint owners would meet
soon to discuss it.
   ``The rest of the owners remain committed, and the bottom line
remains the plant is very much needed for New England,'' he said.
``We will overcome this and the plant will be brought on line.''
   Bob Backus, a lawyer for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League,
which has fought the project since its inception, said MMWEC's
action could doom the project.
   ``I believe there's a major funding problem for the project and
it is so grossly uneconomic right now that this may be the end of
it,'' Backus said.
   The top three owners of the Seabrook project _ PSNH, United
Illuminating and Eastern Utilities Associates _ said Wednesday that
they wouldn't pick up MMWEC's 11.6 percent stake in the plant.
   The New Hampshire plant has been dogged by troubles since PSNH
announced its intention to build it 20 years ago. The company
shelved its original plans, and environmental impact hearings
delayed the project in the 1970s.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has opposed evacuation
planning for communities in his state near the plant in an effort
to prevent it from going into service.
   MMWEC's action comes less than one week after New York State
reached an agreement with Long Island Lighting Co. to abandon the
$5.3 billion Shoreham nuclear plant, which also has never generated
a watt of electricity.
   MMWEC, which supplies power to 34 municipalities across the
state, bought its shares in Seabrook on behalf of 28 utilities in
Massachusetts and eight in other Northeastern states.
   The company has sunk $875 million into the stalled plant so far.
   Hunt said several utilities have asked MMWEC to withdraw because
of the steady rise in electric rates required to meet Seabrook's
costs.
   The company pays about $90 million a year for its long-term
Seabrook debt and payments of about $15 million to $20 million
annually to support the idle plant.
   MMWEC's board voted to stop further payments for Seabrook but to
continue to service the debt.
   By pulling out of the project, MMWEC hopes the state will allow
it to issue tax-exempt bonds to refinance its Seabrook borrowings,
officials said. Previously, Dukakis has refused tax-exempt
financing for the project.
   Hunt declined to speculate on the effect the withdrawal would
have on the project, saying it was ``of secondary consideration.''
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., another Seabrook opponent, said
the decision ``reflects the bottom-line reality that Seabrook is a
teetering financial dinosaur about to become extinct.''
   Hunt's plan calls for MMWEC to ask other Seabrook owners to
assume its share of construction and maintenance costs or buy its
shares outright. He declined to say what might happen if they
refuse.
   Hunt estimated that MMWEC had three months' worth of payments in
an escrow account that the other investors would exhaust before
taking any action. The joint owners also usually grant a five-month
grace period before declaring another owner in default, he said.

   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
returned to the hospital for an hour Wednesday and underwent
follow-up tests for an ailment that put him in the the hospital
last week, a Marcos spokesman said.
   ``It was nothing more than a routine checkup,'' said Gemmo
Trinidad, who said he checked by telephone with Marcos' staff and
learned Marcos had gone to the hospital. ``It was just a followup
of whatever they did last week.''
   Marcos, 70, spent three days at St. Francis Medical Center last
week after complaining of chest pains.
   Trinidad said Marcos spent an hour at Queen's Medical Center and
returned to his hillside home Wednesday afternoon.
   Trinidad said Marcos was treated by his personal physician,
Azucena Ignacio, who last week said Marcos' chest pains were caused
by arthritic inflammation in the ribs, and would require follow-up
exams.
   Ignacio did not return repeated phone calls.

   British film-set designer Tessa Davies, who worked
on the movie ``The Killing Fields,'' was found dead in a pool of
blood and her companion unconscious in their home near London,
police said Wednesday night.
   Richard Furgerson, a TV set designer who owns the house, was
reported hospitalized in serious condition.
   Detective Superintendent John Childerley said there was no sign
of a struggle. He said the 47-year-old Miss Davies, found in a
downstairs room, was killed by heavy blows to her head with some
household object. Childerley said Furgerson, 51, was in a bedroom
upstairs.
   Police said they were not looking for a third party.
   Furgerson's ex-wife lives near the house and they have two sons
in their late 20s, Childerley said.
   Police said they broke into the house at Hurley near Maidenhead,
soon after dawn, after receiving an emergency telephone call from a
friend in London who was worried about the couple.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said Miss
Davies dressed the sets for David Puttnam's ``The Killing Fields''
in 1984, about the communist takeover of Cambodia, and was
nominated for an Academy Award. It said she was also nominated for
an Academy Award for her work with Barbra Streisand in ``Yentl.''
   Her latest film, which she had just completed on location in
Mexico, was ``The Old Gringo,'' starring Jane Fonda, the agency
reported.

<TEXT>
   Criticism of the Reagan
administration's national parks policy over alleged budget cuts is
based on a ``pernicious mythology,'' a top Interior Department
official said Wednesday.
   William Horn, assistant secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks,
told a conference of more than 300 park superintendents he was
tired of ``a continuing drumbeat of critics claiming the
administration is anti-park and committers of sins.''
   Horn said the National Park Service's 1980 operating budget was
$391 million compared with $734 million that the administration has
proposed for the next fiscal year begining July 1.
   ``That constitutes the largest operating budget in the history
of the National Park Service and represents 29 percent
post-inflation, real growth over the past seven years,'' Horn said.
   During the Carter administration, he said, the park service got
9 percent of the Interior Department's aggregate budget, compared
with the current 14 percent.
   Further, Horn said, the park service employees 16,414 people,
the highest level in its 72-year history.
   ``These numbers,'' he said, ``bespeak a commitment to a first
class national park system and they are at odds with the current
pernicious mythology.''
   Earlier, Horn challenged Rep. Bruce F. Vento's introduction of a
bill to reorganize the park service's hierarchy to make it
independent, saying it wasn't necessary because ``if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.''
   Vento, D-Minn., opened the four-day conference by telling the
park superintendents that they ``do the nearly impossible job day
after day (of) protecting the greatest treasures in the United
States _ the national park system.
   Vento, chairman of the national parks and public lands
subcommittee of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee,
has introduced a bill in Congress to take away the interior
secretary's power over the national park system. The bill would
give that power directly to the park service director and a
three-member oversight board that would report to Congress and the
president.
   Currently, National Park Service Director William Penn Mott
reports to Interior Secretary Donald Hodel through Horn.
   Mott addressed the parks superintendents earlier in the day,
saying the Park Service must become more effective in dealing with
outside threats to park resources because ``we cannot achieve our
goals if we continue to try and solve problems in a crisis
atmosphere.''
   ``If the last decade has taught us anything, it is that parks
are no longer islands,'' Mott said. ``I have often told you (park
superintendents) that I want you to be risk-takers. Then, even if
the risks are high, select the one that most benefits the resources
of the park.''
   Vento spoke in the same vein during his address. He said
increasing pressures on the park system due to diminishing natural
resources and a burgeoning population have led to ``pressures of
certain segments of society to take actions detrimental to (basic
laws) which protect the national park system.''
   Environmental and citizens' groups cite logging, oil drilling
and commercial and residential development near parks, as well as
man-made pollution, as just some of the threats to the 341 sites in
the national park system.
   ``The result of these conflicts has been a rapidly escalating
process whereby professional resource managers' decision-making has
been overshadowed by political decision-making,'' said Vento.
   He said such interference tempts park managers to make choices
based on short-term needs rather than long-term protection goals.
   At an informal news conference Wednesday prior to his speech to
the superintendents, Horn said Vento's bill to reorganize the park
service hierarchy is unnecessary.
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Horn. ``When you marry
up senior political management with senior career management,
that's the healthiest combination. To separate that good ...
marriage, I think, would be a mistake.''
   Vento said his proposal would protect park managers with ``some
degree of independence ... so (they) can freely and publicly voice
opposition to an action that might degrade park resources without
fear of being fired, demoted, or punished.''
   ``This would provide for a management framework that permits a
witness to testify before a congressional subcommittee and present
a professional viewpoint rather than a political one imposed by
others with little professional knowledge or interest,'' said Vento.
   Asked about Vento's statement that implied park service
personnel appearing before Congress are constrained from
disagreeing with park service management policies if they feel they
are detrimental to their park, Horn said, ``I reject that
categorically.''
   During the three years he and Mott have been in their respective
jobs, said Horn, the interior secretary has had ``a standing order
that if you are asked, you can relate'' personal views about park
policy, whether it agrees with the administration agenda or not.
   Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association, a non-profit citizens' group that focuses on the
national parks system, said: ``We are 100 percent behind
Congressman Vento's bill. We are completely committed to it.''
   T. Destry Jarvis, the association's vice president, described
the last seven years of the Reagan administration's management of
the Park Service as ``a constant tug of war between a citizenry
that is committed to the parks system, a Congress which is quite
protective of the parks system, and an administration which is
not.''

   Eli Lilly & Co. has dealt a serious setback to
the Reagan administration's anti-cocaine program by refusing to
allow use of a ``safe and effective herbicide'' against
coca-producing areas in South America, the State Department said
Wednesday.
   ``We think the short-term impact is serious,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, alluding to Lilly's decision
last week not to sell to the U.S. government the herbicide
tebuthiuron in a coca eradication campaign focused mainly in Peru's
Huallaga Valley.
   She said the firm, which is the sole manufacturer of the
chemical, should reconsider its decision in light of the serious
cocaine problem in the United States. On Capitol Hill, Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla., expressed outrage over Lilly's decision.
   The Indianapolis-based company gave no reason for its decision
in making the announcement last week, citing only ``a number of
practical and policy considerations.'' Edward West, manager of
corporate communcations at Lilly, said Wednesday the company had no
further comment.
   But Mrs. Oakley told reporters Lilly apparently was worried
about possible retaliatory measures by ``traffickers or
terrorists.'' The company also had come under pressure from
environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of
the herbicide.
   Mrs. Oakley said the State Department would have preferred to
have worked with the company on resolving its security concerns.
   She said the United States and Latin American governments have
been conducting field tests to identify a safe, effective herbicide
for use against coca for several years.
   Tebuthiuron, known informally as ``Spike,'' was considered to be
among the safest and most effective, but no final decision had been
made about which herbicide should be used, Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``According to our information the safety and effectiveness of
spike has been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company.
Numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance
with federal regulations,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for
international narcotics matters, said Lilly made the decision even
though the herbicide has been manufactured for more than 15 years,
has been proven safe by U.S. standards and is widely available in
this country for projects such as clearing brush for rights of way.
   The chemical is sold to other government agencies including the
Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, she said.
   Testifying before a House Government Operations subcommittee
assessing the war on drugs, Ms. Wrobleski said State Department
lawyers are researching whether to propose legislation that would
compel Lilly to sell the State Department the chemical ``in the
vital national interests of the United States government.''
   The safety of Lilly's employees must be weighed against public
concerns about ``the 5 million regular users of cocaine and our
desperate need for a chemical solution to widespread coca
cultivation in the Andes,'' she said.
   English, chairman of the subcommittee, said he was ``stunned and
outraged'' at Lilly and called the company a ``deserter'' in the
war on drugs. He insisted that company representatives appear
before his panel to explain their decision.
   ``We're going to go to any length possible to get our hands on''
the herbicide for use in spraying programs in Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia, Ms. Wrobleski said.
   She said coca crops currently are destroyed by chopping them
down, a slow process that eradicates less than 1 percent of the
total.
   ``Unless we push the chemical button, we cannot dent that
problem appreciably,'' Ms. Wrobleski said.

<TEXT>
   A British nobleman who managed a
billionaire's private game preserve testified Wednesday that he
knew hawks and other protected birds were being killed on the
estate but denied killing any himself.
   Sir Richard Musgrave, 66, the huntsman of the preserve, said he
never saw any hawks killed, but he knew his gamekeepers were doing
their jobs if they were killing the birds, which preyed on
pheasants raised for hunters.
   ``I've not killed a thing, sir,'' he said in U.S. District Court
here.
   Musgrave also testified that he never told the owners of the
850-acre Albemarle County property, businessman John Kluge and his
wife, Patricia, about the killings.
   Kluge, 73, is chief owner of Metromedia, a telecommunications
and technology holding company. Last fall, Forbes magazine listed
him as the second-richest man in America, putting his worth at $3
billion.
   He and his wife were not charged.
   Earlier Wednesday, gamekeeper David Amos, 20, admitted killing
as many as 25 hawks and owls on the preserve over the past two
years, saying he knew killing hawks was illegal but did not realize
the seriousness of the offense.
   Musgrave, Amos and fellow gamekeeper Paul Shardlow, 25, face
misdemeanor charges of conspiring to violate federal game laws. All
three defendants are British citizens.
   Musgrave owned a sporting consultant business and was hired to
manage the Albemarle County preserve. He carries the title ``Sir''
because he is a baronet, a holder of a hereditary title in British
nobility.
   Amos' testimony on the trial's fifth day paralleled that of
Shardlow, who told the court Tuesday that he killed about 25 hawks
and owls during his two years as gamekeeper.
   Under cross-examination by U.S. Attorney John Perry Alderman,
Shardlow denied being ordered to kill the birds. He also said the
Kluges knew nothing about the killings.
   Like Amos, Shardlow said he knew killing the birds was illegal
but thought it was ``equivalent to a speeding ticket.''
   Asked why he killed the birds, Shardlow replied, ``To keep my
job, sir.''
   If the predator birds had not been destroyed, pheasants and
ducks stocked at the preserve to be hunted by guests would not have
survived and and the preserve would have been closed, Shardlow said.
   The chief prosecution witness, former gamekeeper Brian Heath,
has said as many as 400 hawks were killed on the preserve during
the past two years.
   Amos and Shardlow testified that Heath's estimate was much too
high.
   If convicted, Musgrave faces a maximum sentence of 3{ years in
prison and a $35,000 fine. Shardlow could get 2{ years in prison at
a $25,000 fine. Amos could be sentenced to a year and fined $10,000.

<HEAD>Britain Loses ``Spycatcher'' Appeal in Australian High Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court of Australia on
Thursday rejected the British government's final appeal to stop
publication of the book ``Spycatcher'' in Australia.
   In a unanimous decision, the judges dismissed Britain's appeal
from a New South Wales court of appeal ruling, paving the way for
publication of the book in Australia.
   The British government was ordered to pay costs.
   Although 240,000 copies of the book by Peter Wright have been
sold in Australia, Britain wanted further copies of it banned and
to be awarded all profits from past sales here. Britain contended
that Wright was obligated not to write about his experiences as a
former British intelligence official.
   The High Court decision cleared the way for Thursday's scheduled
paperback launch of the book in Australia.
   In ``Spycatcher,'' Wright details his 20 years in Britain's MI-5
secret service tracking down traitors and accuses his former boss,
the late Sir Roger Hollis, of being a Soviet mole _ or deeply
concealed double agent.
   Wright, 73, lives in retirement in Tasmania, Australia's
southernmost state, where he breeds thoroughbred horses with his
wife Lois.
   Despite a ban on sales of the book in Britain and Hong Kong, the
work has sold an estimated 1.4 million copies worldwide, according
to publishers Heinemann Australia Pty Ltd.

   The acting chief executive on
Wednesday said that President Jose Napoleon Duarte has cancer and
called him ``a man on the verge of death.''
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, who became acting
president Tuesday when Duarte was flown to Washington for
treatment, made the comment to journalists at the presidential
residence after he met with U.S. Ambassador Edwin Corr.
   ``It has been confirmed that President Duarte has a cancerous
bleeding ulcer in the stomach. Today's (Wednesday's) examination of
his whole body _ the abdomen and thorax _ showed that the liver is
also affected by cancer.''
   He said an official prognosis would be issued Thursday by
doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where Duarte was
admitted to treatment.
   In what was interpreted as a call for compassionate treatment of
the subject in local news media, Castillo Claramount said: ``I ask
for a minimal expression of humanity, of charity. A fellow man's
pain cannot be toyed with. No one can doubt the word of a man on
the verge of death, who has had the courage to say it.''
   Just before that he read part of the 41st Psalm.
   He quoted the psalm as saying ``My enemies speak badly of me,
saying `When will he die?' Those who hate me murmur against me.''
   Castillo Claramount added: ``Unfortunately in the past days,
this kind of situation has come up in the country.''
   He said Duarte would decide what treatment to follow after being
informed by doctors.
   The acting president said that when it was believed the cancer
was limited to the stomach ``there was a tendency to operate. But
that may have changed with the results of the subsequent
examinations.''

   Three more people were arrested Wednesday on
charges that they were part of a scheme to mail cocaine to the
United States from a U.S. military post office in Panama, and
officials said more arrests were expected.
   The three Georgian women arrested Wednesday and two New York
City women arrested last week appeared before a federal magistrate.
A sixth suspect, the husband of one of the New York women, was in
custody in New York City.
   Authorities said the scheme came to light last week when a
former soldier, stopped for a traffic violation, admitted that he
was carrying cocaine and agreed to cooperate with police. His
information led to the arrests of the six.
   Colquitt County Sheriff Gene Beard said investigators seized two
packages of cocaine that were mailed to Moultrie, Ga., from the
military post office in Panama. The drugs were to be taken from
Moultrie to New York City, he said.
   It was the fifth case in recent months in which drug smuggling
from Panama has been linked in some way with the U.S. military
presence there. There are about 10,000 U.S. servicemen deployed in
Panama.
   In December, two civilian security guards who worked for the
U.S. Navy in Panama were arrested at Kennedy International Airport
in New York City after Customs agents allegedly found cocaine in
their suitcases.
   The other three cases, all in late January or early February,
involved cocaine found on military airplanes flying out of Panama
or someone with drugs attempting to board such a plane.
   In the most recent case, Beard said two packages of cocaine _ an
18-pound package seized from Jackie Lee Bigelow of Colquitt County
on May 24 and a 29-pound package seized Friday at the Moultrie post
office _ had been mailed to Moultrie from a military post office in
Panama.
   Army spokeswoman Paige Eversole in Washington said investigators
were in Georgia on Tuesday and planned to go from there to Panama
to investigate any military involvement in the cocaine shipments.
   ``The Army has investigations going on, and has had for some
time, into drug trafficking by service members and by people posing
as service members in Panama,'' she said. There was no evidence so
far that anyone on active duty was involved in the Georgia scheme,
she said.
   An FBI affidavit released Wednesday said Bigelow, an informant,
told investigators he had traveled to Panama twice this year to
meet with two members of the drug operation. He said he arranged
for cocaine packages to be mailed to the three Georgia women.
   FBI Agent David Parker of Macon said the drug operation appears
to have been going on for ``some time,'' and more arrests are
expected.
   ``We consider it a very significant investigation,'' he said.
``We're investigating importation into this country by two methods
_ hand-carrying and mailing it.''
   Parker said Bigelow, who was stationed in Panama while serving
in the Army, likely will face federal charges stemming from his
alleged involvement in the operation. The sheriff said he could
also face state drug charges.
   Taken before U.S. Magistrate Nathan Davis in Albany on Wednesday
were Maxine Williams, 24, Brenda McGee, 25, and Betty Howard, 31,
all residents of Colquitt County; and Regina Carmela Smith and
Julia Thom, both of New York City.
   They were charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent
to distribute, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Fowler.
   Davis scheduled a bond hearing for the defendants Thursday
afternoon. Ms. Fowler said the government plans to argue that they
should not be released.
   Ms. Smith's husband, Oscar Smith, was arrested in New York City
on the same charge and is being held there, said U.S. Attorney
Edgar W. Ennis Jr., who added that other warrants have been issued.
   After he was arrested in the traffic case and agreed to
cooperate with police, Bigelow called Smith to arrange for couriers
to pick up the cocaine in Georgia, the affidavit said. Ms. Smith
and Ms. Thom were arrested Friday after they arrived in Moultrie
and met Bigelow at a motel.
   Beard said it appeared that Moultrie was one of several U.S.
towns where cocaine was mailed from Panama. He said he didn't know
what measures would have been in effect at U.S. military post
offices in Panama to prevent unauthorized people from mailing
packages.
   Parker declined to say whether the two men named by Bigelow in
the affidavit, Ricardo Brown and Ferdson Allister Smith, were in
the military. Ferdson Smith, Oscar Smith's brother, has been
arrested in Panama on unrelated drug charges.
   ``It's bound to be a larger operation, but our man says he
doesn't know any of the other players,'' Beard said.

   Doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
conducted a battery of tests Wednesday on Salvadoran President Jose
Napolean Duarte who was flown to the United States suffering from
what he called an ulcer ``of a malignant nature.''
   Duarte, 62, was admitted to Walter Reed after arriving late
Tuesday night on a special flight from San Salvador.
   Hospital spokesman Pete Esker said Duarte rested comfortably
Tuesday night and that medical tests were started Wednesday morning.
   ``He is in good spirits and his condition is stable,'' Esker
said. He declined to give more detailed information on Duarte's
condition.
   Salvadoran Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, who
became acting president when Duarte was flown to Washington for
treatment, on Wednesday described Duarte as ``a man on the verge of
death.''
   ``It has been confirmed that President Duarte has a cancerous
bleeding ulcer in the stomach. Today's (Wednesday's) examination of
his whole body _ the abdomen and thorax _ showed that the liver is
also affected by cancer.''
   Castillo Claramount said that when it was believed the cancer
was limited to the stomach ``there was a tendency to operate. But
that may have changed with the results of the subsequent
examinations.''
   Duarte's illness has been described by those around him as both
an ``ulcer'' and as ``a tumor.''
   As he was preparing to leave El Salvador on Tuesday night,
Duarte told reporters at Illopango military airport, ``What I have
is a bleeding ulcer seven centimeters (2{ inches) long in the
stomach, of a malignant nature.''
   He said a prognosis will be determined by medical tests in the
United States.
   Media Communications Minister Roberto Viera, asked about the
president's statement, said Duarte has ``a large tumor'' in his
stomach. ``The doctors don't want to characterize it until they do
a biopsy,'' Viera said.

   When he departed for medical
treatment in Washington this week, President Jose Napoleon Duarte
left behind a country ravaged by war and a Christian Democratic
party torn by infighting.
   On Wednesday night, Rodolfo Castillo Claramount, the acting
chief executive, told journalists Duarte has cancer and was ``a man
on the verge of death.''
   But in his final year in office, Duarte already had become a man
devoid of much power and one whose absence was not expected to have
a profound effect on El Salvador's problems.
   The 62-year-old president, arguably Washington's staunchest ally
in the Western Hemisphere, is in Walter Reed Army Medical Center
for diagnosis and treatment. He told reporters before departing
Tuesday that he was suffering from ``a bleeding ulcer of a
malignant nature.''
   Vice President Castillo Claramount, who became acting president
Tuesday when Duarte was flown to Washington, told reporters at the
presidential residence in San Salvador late Wednesday, after
meeting with U.S. Ambassador Edwin Corr:
   ``It has been confirmed that President Duarte has a cancerous
bleeding ulcer in the stomach. Today's (Wednesday's) examination of
his whole body _ the abdomen and thorax _ showed that the liver is
also affected by cancer.''
   He said to the correspondents, ``I ask for a minimal expression
of humanity, of charity. A fellow man's pain cannot be toyed with.
No one can doubt the word of a man on the verge of death, who has
had the courage to say it.''
   The farewell ceremony Tuesday had the air of a funeral at which
the deceased was on hand to say goodbye. Many of Duarte's family
members were openly crying, and the president gave long embraces to
friends and associates.
   Duarte appeared lean and haggard and at times on the verge of
tears.
   Leftist guerrillas said in a broadcast by their clantestine
radio station: ``Duarte leaves the country with an incurable
political disease because of the failure of the counterinsurgency
plan. Duarte leaves, and the people remain to carry out the
revolution.''
   The rebels are waging an 8-year-old war against U.S.-backed
government forces.
   Whether the government's campaign against the revolutionaries
has failed remains to be determined. But almost all of the vows
Duarte made upon assuming the presidency in June 1984 remain
unfulfilled.
   The guerrillas still carry out attacks and sabotage throughout
the country and exercise a significant degree of political control
and open activity in two northern provinces.
   The economy is in a shambles. The average Salvadoran's real
income is almost 40 percent below what it was at the start of the
war. About 500,000 people _ 10 percent of the population _ has been
displaced to squalid shantytowns and refugee camps.
   Because of the lack of security, investment is virtually nil.
   Duarte's Christian Democrats suffered a scathing defeat in
municipal and legislative elections in March.
   The electorate, in what was seen as a massive popular rejection
of the incumbents' performance, gave control of the legislature to
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   A surging Arena appears in good shape to win the presidential
election next March. The Constitution prohibits Duarte from running
again in any event.
   The Christian Democrats are trying to keep their party from
splitting. Two former Cabinet ministers and party founders, Julio
Adolfo Rey Prendes and Fidel Chavez Mena, claim the party's
presidential candidacy.
   Duarte tried last month to avoid a split by calling on both to
back a unity candidate. They ignored his appeal.
   He left Castillo Claramount in charge of the executive branch.
Castillo Claramount delivered Duarte's state-of-the-republic
address Wednesday to the new legislature.
   He promised to pursue Duarte's project to meet with leaders of
other parties, unionists, businessmen and peasants to draft a
united proposal to the guerrillas for ending the war.
   But the proposal, if and when it is worked out, is expected to
be a new version of old calls to lay down arms and participate in
elections. The guerrillas have rejected such a call, claiming the
conditions for democracy do not exist.
   They demand a share of power, which the government refuses to
consider.
   The conservative daily Prensa Grafica said Wednesday of Duarte's
illness: ``The absence of the chief executive, for very worrisome
motives, makes for even more uncertainty as to what will happen
during the next year.''

<TEXT>
   Riot police broke up an anti-Olympic
protest and arrested about 100 radical students Thursday outside a
hotel where Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic
Committee president, was staying.
   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, said police had information some
of the protesters had plans to kidnap Samaranch. The report gave no
details.
   Hundreds of police quickly dispersed the peaceful demonstration
and dragged away shouting students who tried to block a road
outside the Shilla Hotel.
   Protesters denounced Samaranch for saying that communist North
Korea cannot act as co-host for the 1988 Olympics, set to begin
Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   ``Stage united Olympics!,'' students yelled before police
overpowered them.
   Hundreds of police remained on guard around the hotel after the
incident.
   Radical students have demanded that North Korea be allowed to
act as Olympics co-host to help promote reunification of the
divided Korean peninsula.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter enemies who have
clashed repeatedly over the years. In the 1950-53 Korean War, the
United States and other nations fought under the United Nations
flag on the side of South Korea and China intervened on the
northern side.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Games if it is not
co-host. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have
said this is impossible because the Games are awarded to a single
city.
   Samaranch, in Seoul to inspect facilities for the Games, said
this week North Korea could not be co-host. He repeated his
committee's offer to let the north stage up to five events if it
drops its demand and takes part in the Seoul Games.
   South Korea and the United States accused North Korea of blowing
up a South Korean airliner Nov. 29 with the loss of all 115 people
aboard as part of efforts to disrupt the Olympics. The north says
it had nothing to do with the incident.

   President Reagan, to the surprise of some
refuseniks, said Wednesday that emigration barriers preventing
people from leaving the Soviet Union may be the result of
bureacratic snags rather than deliberate Kremlin policy.
   In a summit-finale news conference, Reagan also said that it was
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev who changed his view of the
Kremlin as an ``evil empire.'' He said Gorbachev, his partner at
four summit meetings, was ``different than previous Soviet leaders
have been.''
   The president said he hoped to conclude a U.S.-Soviet treaty to
cut strategic nuclear arsenals by half before leaving office, but
said it was more important to get a good agreement than to meet a
January deadline.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute to
President Reagan on Wednesday for retracting his characterization
of the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' but he blamed the
American side for the failure to make more tangible progress at the
fourth superpower summit in 30 months.
   In the first nationally televised Moscow news conference by a
Kremlin leader, Gorbachev hailed the continuing U.S.-Soviet
dialogue and said ``it is vitally necessary'' that his meetings
resume after Reagan's successor takes office in January.
   In a good-natured, wide-ranging session with Soviet and foreign
reporters, the Communist Party chief held forth for nearly two
hours, alternately praising the tone of U.S.-Soviet dialogue while
criticizing specific U.S. positions.

pretense of a hand-holding friendship Wednesday in a feisty
competition for the spotlight that Mrs. Reagan called a ``Mexican

   President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev
traded generous comments as their fourth summit drew to a close,
but their wives managed to erase within minutes the image of a warm
relationship they'd tried to portray earlier in the week.
   Although the two women maintained the appearance of cordiality
during a tour of an icon storage vault, their contest for the
spotlight was the toughest of any of their get-togethers since they

   President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev reported progress Wednesday over two obstacles to a
strategic arms deal, but ended their fourth summit divided over the
main impediment, the U.S. Star Wars program.
   ``I would hope that before the year is out that we could
eliminate the differences that still exist,'' Reagan said. But
there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.
   After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered their
negotiators to return to Geneva on July 12 to work on a proposed
treaty to cut superpower nclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50
percent.

   By muting his criticism of Soviet human rights
abuses, President Reagan may be trying to speed up negotiations
that would substantially cut Red Army forces in Eastern Europe.
   Reagan, who built a political career bashing Reds and in his
first term called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' confounded
observers on Tuesday and Wednesday by attributing Kremlin human
rights abuses to bureaucratic inertia and praising Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for trying to reform it.
   Reagan and his aides attributed the softening of the president's
rhetoric to Gorbachev's efforts to reform the system.

   The government said Wednesday its chief
economic forecasting gauge rose a modest 0.2 percent in April, an
increase analysts said signaled continued healthy economic growth
for the rest of this presidential election year.
   It marked the third consecutive monthly increase in the Commerce
Department's Index of Leading Indicators, following an identical
0.2 percent rise in March and a giant 1.5 percent February surge,
which had been the largest gain in more than two years.
   In other good news for the economy, the government reported that
orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods shot up 1.2 percent
in April to a seasonally adjusted $218.7 billion following an even
bigger 1.6 percent March increase, indicating that industrial
production will be increasing during the months ahead.

   The AIDS virus probably did not jump from
monkeys to humans but could have infected the common ancestors of
humans and monkeys millions of years ago, researchers say.
   That conclusion comes from Japanese biologists who have
determined the entire genetic code of the AIDS virus that infects
African green monkeys. Some researchers have suggested that these
monkeys may have been the source of the human AIDS virus.
   The Japanese team found that the African green monkey AIDS virus
differed from the two known human AIDS viruses in several important
respects. If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent
times, the viruses would be identical or nearly so.

<HEAD>`Televangelism' Author Says Minister-Politician Prospects Unproved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writing a book about television evangelists is
as risky as writing about politics. Yesterday's conclusions have a
way of becoming quickly outdated.
   Jeffrey Hadden, a University of Virginia sociologist who has
established himself as one of the country's leading students of
electronic religions, took both risks in ``Televangelism: Power and
Politics in God's Country,'' written with Anson Shupe, of Indiana
University.
   In their book, Hadden and Shupe make the case that Pat Robertson
could win the Republican Party nomination for president. By the
time Hadden came to New York to promote the book, he was trying to
explain how Robertson lost.
   Robertson's candidacy was dead after he finished third in South
Carolina, a state he had once boasted of winning, and buried after
he came up empty in the Super Tuesday primaries in the South.
   Robertson failed to mount a serious challenge to George Bush,
even though he beat the vice president in the Iowa caucuses, and
Hadden believes it is an open question whether the Christian right
is capable of electing a candidate.
   Hadden and Shupe argue that a candidate from the Christian right
stands to benefit from these factors:
   _President Reagan has legitimized religious conservatism.
   _The religious right overhwelmingly dominates religious
broadcasting.
   _Ministries such as Robertson's ``700 Club'' have developed
impressive fund-raising skills.
   _There is evidence of a conservative shift in the electorate.
   The reality, though, was that Pat Robertson couldn't win this
year.
   Robertson's failure, Hadden said in a recent interview, was a
combination of mistakes and a miscalculation of his base of support.
   ``He got so tangled up in his own words, and his own gaffes,
that once he had attention there was never a moment to say, `This
is why I have a better vision for America.'
   ``He also erred very badly,'' Hadden said, ``in not addressing
the religion issue head-on very early... (John F.) Kennedy was able
to wait until he had the nomination before he felt he had to do
that; Pat should have done it very early.''
   Robertson also overestimated the size of his base, Hadden said.
   ``He had measured the size of the evangelical Christian vote,
and mistook it for his core constituency, which is charismatic,''
he said.
   ``Even the charismatics, upon seeing the way he was performing _
in New Hampshire basically, but between Iowa and South Carolina _
began to shake their heads and say, `This does not look like a man
who is presidential.' So he didn't get the turnouts.''
   That suggests, Hadden said, that there is no monolithic
``Christian right'' bloc.
   ``There is a huge conservative-evangelical-Christian sentiment
out there, there is no doubt in my mind about that, but it is
itself divided,'' he said. ``They are not warring in quite the way
they warred in earlier times, they are loyal around particular
clusters and leaders.
   ``It is not a matter of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell vying
for the leadership of the Christian right. They are, respectively,
leaders of the charismatic and fundamentalist contingents, neither
of which has a whole lot of influence over the Southern Baptists,
who in turn are split into at least two very significant camps, nor
the people who are roughly aligned with the National Association of
Evangelicals, which is yet another sector.
   ``Politically, if you can do what Bush was successful in doing,
getting significant figures lined up to support you, then you help
keep them polarized.''
   It may be, he said, that someone like President Reagan, who is
not identified with any particular denomination, will have more
success in courting that vote.
   ``I think there is a very important lesson there,'' Hadden said.
``He speaks their language without being one of them.''

blacks to its priesthood. While its missionaries have achieved
remarkable success in Africa and elsewhere abroad, at home they
labor to dispel the bitter legacy of 130 years of racial exclusion.

   Mormon elder Joseph Freeman today guides
his white brethren through sacred temple rituals that just a decade
ago were denied him because of his black skin.
   ``I think I have been greatly blessed. I feel my life has been
very much fulfilled,'' said Freeman, who twice monthly performs
rites in the church's Denver Temple.
   ``I may never be a rich man, but I don't care to be. The riches
I have are to have a good family, to teach my children the gospel.''
   The ban ended June 9, 1978, when the late church President
Spencer W. Kimball announced he'd received a revelation from God
opening the priesthood, held by all worthy Mormon males older than
11, to black members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.
   But despite the church's startling success among blacks since
then, particularly in Africa, it still labors at home to overcome
the ban's legacy: a lingering perception that Mormonism is a faith
for whites.
   The church numbers 8,500 members in Nigeria and 5,000 in Ghana
and is growing by about 2,000 converts a year in each country. New
missions have opened recently in Zaire, Liberia, Zimbabwe and
Sierra Leone.
   In predominantly black Haiti, the church reaps more than 70
converts monthly.
   Blacks in the American South hold leadership positions once open
only to whites.
   ``I started out being exotic and ended up being generic,'' said
Alan Cherry, one of the few American blacks baptized before 1978.
   Nor does the legacy of the ban appear to have slowed the
church's overall growth. Since 1978, the church says its membership
has nearly doubled from 3.8 million to 6.5 million worldwide.
   Black members say deliberate racism is extremely rare among
white Mormons. Rather, they say, blacks and whites struggle with
cultural and economic barriers that can undermine the most sincere
fellowships.
   ``The first question I get is, `Where did you play ball?''' said
Van Williams, a black employed in the church's public
communications department. ``When I say I didn't, then in their
minds I'm either a pimp or a drug dealer. I'm still struggling with
people who won't accept me for who I am, but I won't let that
affect my beliefs.''
   Like many black Mormons, Williams is skeptical of the church's
claim of a divine origin for the doctrine. ``I choose to look at it
as something that man placed and God removed,'' he said, echoing a
view shared by independent Mormon scholars and at least one
high-ranking church official.
   The late Hugh B. Brown, a member of the Council of the Twelve
and a counselor to former church President David O. McKay, never
accepted the ban as doctrine and nearly engineered its reversal,
said Brown's grandson, Edwin B. Firmage.
   Ten members of the Twelve, which assists the governing First
Presidency, voted to lift the ban in 1969. Firmage said the vote
was nullified when the council's senior active member, Harold B.
Lee, returned to town.
   Little evidence indicates the policy originated with church
founder Joseph Smith; it was not among the dozens of written
revelations he left before his 1844 assassination in Illinois. As
articulated by Smith's successor, Brigham Young, the ban was rooted
in the belief that black Africans were descendants of the biblical
Cain, cursed by God for murdering his brother, Abel.
   Church leaders in 1969 reiterated the policy was divine doctrine
taught by Smith and every succeeding Mormon prophet, but by 1978,
months before the ban's demise, they were saying that only God knew
the reason why.
   A decade later, that apparently remains the official view. Elder
Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Twelve, said in an interview that
theological arguments trying to buttress the doctrine were largely
speculative. God doesn't give reasons for his revelations, he said.
   ``We can put reason to revelation. We can put reasons to
commandments. When we do, we're on our own. Some people put reasons
to the one we're talking about here and they turned out to be
spectacularly wrong,'' Oaks said.
   Mormons define priesthood as the authority to act in the name of
God, and membership is a prerequisite to any appointment in the
church's lay leadership or to performing such rites as baptism,
temple marriage and healing the sick.
   Freeman, for instance, was not permitted to bless his infant
sons before Kimball's revelation. A white member of the priesthood
gave the blessings instead.
   ``There were restrictions which, in a worldly sense, were hard
to accept,'' said Freeman, who two days after the ban was lifted
became the first black ordained to the faith's priesthood since the
faith's infancy, when at least two blacks held priesthood offices.
   Among Africans, the restriction appears to have made less
difference. ``They don't seem to take it the way I think I would if
I had been involved,'' said Reed Clegg, a missionary in Ghana and
Nigeria in the early 1980s.
   As early as 1946 the church was receiving inquiries from
Nigerians who had read church missionary tracts or articles. The
Nigerian government, however, refused to admit missionaries until
the policy was dropped.
   The appeal of Mormonism also spread to Ghana. When missionaries
arrived in the two countries, they were greeted by thousands eager
for baptism.
   Among American blacks, memories of the ban haunt missionary
efforts. But black and white Mormons alike say economic and social
barriers are more divisive than church doctrine.
   ``I would say that where you have black middle-class converts
coming into middle-class congregations, the prognosis is good,''
said Armand Mauss, a Washington State University sociologist who
has monitored the progress of black Mormons. ``Where you have
lower-class blacks being converted to middle-class congregations,
that's not good.''
   Mauss cited surveys taken from 1972 to 1985 by the National
Opinion Research Corp. that suggested white Mormons were slightly
more tolerant of blacks than non-Mormon whites. But when racial
tensions flare, they take their toll of fledgling black converts
alreay sensitive to the church's image among non-Mormon friends and
relatives.
   In Greensboro, N.C., black baptisms averaged six to 12 a month
in the early 1980s, but a majority fell away after racial
incidents, said John McCoy, a black who sits on the high council of
the Greensboro Stake, or diocese.
   Among those who left the church was McCoy's wife, taunted with
epithets by 11-year-olds she was teaching in Primary, the church's
organization for children.
   ``A very few whites, two or three, were still prejudiced and
they let the blacks know it. It made the rest of the whites feel
bad because the blacks were judging the church by them,'' said
McCoy, a member of eight years.
   Worried at the erosion among black converts, local leaders
offered them a choice, to continue attending mixed congregations or
form their own with black leaders. They unanimously picked the
latter.
   Since then, the number of active black participants has risen
from about 50 to more than 200.

   As promised as long as a decade ago, the
deregulation of the ``financial services'' industry has given
savers and investors many new ways to go about the business of
managing their money.
   If you want a traditional bank product like a certificate of
deposit, for example, you may well find it these days at a
securities brokerage firm.
   Conversely, when you shop for an investment vehicle like a
mutual fund, you might end up buying it through a bank.
   The benefits in convenience seem clear. And the enhanced
competition, in theory at least, should work to the investor's
benefit.
   But observers of the financial scene say the new entrants in a
given field don't always offer a better deal than their old-line
counterparts. As the choices have multiplied, they say, so have the
number of variables to be considered, and questions to be asked,
before you commit your money.
   Consider CDs sold by brokers _ an idea that raises some
intriguing possibilities. A large brokerage firm can comb the
country for certificates with attractive yields, and then make them
available to customers in any of its branches.
   Wherever it goes, the CD carries with it Federal Deposit
Insurance covering up to $100,000 per account. Since the bank pays
the brokerage firm for its services, you normally don't have to pay
any commission to buy a CD from the broker.
   Now suppose you run into circumstances that make it desirable,
or necessary, for you to cash in the CD before it matures. If you
go directly to the issuing bank, you will have to pay the legendary
``substantial penalty for early withdrawal.''
   But the broker may be able to circumvent that problem by selling
the CD for you to some other customer.
   The emphasis in that last sentence, however, should be placed on
the ``may be able.'' Some, but not all, brokers handling CDs offer
this option.
   Even if you can unload the CD this way, you may have to sell it
at a loss from your purchase price if interest rates have risen in
the interim. That loss may be increased by fees or markdowns
charged by the broker in handling the transaction.
   It also bears remembering that the broker is only an
intermediary. If the issuer of the CD gets into financial
difficulty, it will be left to you to deal with the bank or federal
regulators.
   When you buy through a broker this way, furthermore, you open an
account that makes you part of the firm's ``customer base.''
   Says the newsletter 100 Highest Yields, ``If you open your
account at a full-service brokerage house, there's a good chance
you'll be getting occasional sales calls from your brokerage firm.''
   On the other side of the coin, what about buying mutual funds
through a bank? Technically, banks are still legally barred from
selling securities products like these, but many have found ways to
do so by forging links with mutual fund sponsors.
   A bank may offer a handy way to do your mutual fund investing.
It may sweeten the pot by counting your fund balance as an offset
to fees it might otherwise charge you for services such as checking.
   But does a given bank's selection include all the best-run funds
that are available directly from fund sponsors? Are the bank's
funds new, lacking performance records to serve as a rough gauge of
how they might fare in the future?
   While there may be many good reasons to consider buying mutual
fund shares at a bank, says the newsletter Wiesenberger Mutual
Funds Investment Report, ``it is almost certain that funds offered
through joint ventures will have higher distribution expenses.''
   ``After all, there is another middleman who has to be paid for
taking your money.''
   Also, it adds, ``trying to resolve statement errors or
purchase-sell requests could be a big headache if bank personnel
are not well versed in the mechanics'' of handling fund accounts.

<HEAD>Jack Tanner Races for Democratic Presidential Nomination</HEAD>

   Going into the California primary, the
Democratic presidential candidates still running include Gov.
Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Jack Tanner.
   Jack who? You remember Jack Tanner, that up-and-coming dark
horse, the former congressman. The baby boomer candidate whose
slogan is ``For Real.''
   You won't find Tanner on the ballot, but he's listed in
newspaper television schedules: Tanner is running only on Home Box
Office.
   Michael Murphy stars in ``Tanner '88,'' an HBO series being
filmed on the campaign trail and occasionally mixing fiction with
reality. It is a collaboration between ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist
Garry Trudeau, who is writing it, and director Robert Altman
(``M-A-S-H,'' ``Nashville'').
   A new episode has premiered once a month since the series made
its debut the eve of the New Hampshire primary. HBO will run all
five episodes so far in a Tanner marathon this Saturday. HBO
viewers will be able to vote for Tanner or any of the real
candidates by calling an 800 number on Saturday. Linda Ellerbee
will anchor little ``news'' breaks giving updates on the poll.
   The first of two episodes shot in California will run on HBO on
Monday, the day before the California primary.
   A post-California primary show will premiere Monday, June 20.
   The first California show includes a candidates debate,
moderated by Ellerbee. Footage was taken from an earlier real-life
debate, and the other candidates cut out and Tanner edited in.
   ``You see me getting ready for it,'' said Murphy, who plays the
attractive if somewhat hapless candidate. ``You see me talking to
two people sitting on stage. The way they cut the tape together it
looks like the real thing. Then Linda Ellerbee comes backstage and
we play a scene together. It's so unbelievably well-shot that it
appears realistic.''
   Tanner, who is divorced, has a girlfriend who had been a secret
until it was discovered that she worked for the Dukakis campaign.
   ``We do get found out in California, so as the second episode
ends the press is madly on my tail because they think a scandal is
about to break,'' he said. ``I keep defending myself. I say I'm not
Gary Hart. I don't want to be compared with him. I say I'm going to
marry the girl. A wedding is planned but it looks like it might
fall through.''
   Murphy talked by telephone from Maine, where he had gone for a
few weeks' rest after filming the California episodes.
   ``We film two weeks and then take two weeks off,'' he said, ``so
it's not as brutal as working every day. It's set up very much like
a real campaign. We have advance men who go in and set things up.
Garry writes the scripts, although we do adapt things as we see
them. It's like found art.''
   Murphy describes Tanner as ``an idealistic, decent person who's
a kind of amiable goofus.'' He said, ``He's gotten stronger. He's
taken lessons from the same people who worked with Dole and
Babbitt. The one thing I safeguard is to see that Tanner stays a
decent guy.
   ``The drift of the show is that you see a guy being pushed and
pulled by his people and the media and other politicians. And how
he reacts to it.''
   He called it a ``dream job'' with ``absolutely no interference
from anyone.''
   Altman said on a recent visit to New York that he would like
Tanner to keep running even after the Democratic convention by
becoming an independent candidate.
   ``I don't know anything like it that has ever quite been done
before,'' he said of the series. ``I think we are breaking a little
ground. I know I'm having the most fun I've had in 20 years.''
   Murphy, who starred last year in the short-lived CBS series
``Hard Copy,'' appeared in many of Altman's early films. Most
recently the two teamed up for the CBS special ``The Caine Mutiny
Court-Martial'' in which Murphy played a judge.

<HEAD>Advertisers Target Asian-American Consumers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is off today.</NOTE>

   They are being bombarded with sales pitches
for everything from book-of-the-month clubs to cognac.
   Like blacks and Hispanics before them, Asians in the United
States have become a hot market for advertisers, triggering a media
blitz that aims to penetrate cultural differences within the group
and tap a wellspring of discretionary income.
   ``We've gone up 100 percent for the past five years in a row,''
said advertising executive Holmes Stoner, whose Artesa Media
Services specializes in Asian and Hispanic advertising.
   His firm's billings for advertising to Filipinos, Chinese,
Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese and other Asian-American groups range
between $350,000 and $400,000, up from $35,000 to $50,000 just five
years ago, Stoner said.
   Much of the advertising is for ethnic products, local merchants,
real estate agents and other businesses catering to U.S. Asians.
But more mainstream companies are testing campaigns in Korean,
Chinese, Japanese and other Asian languages.
   ``Companies that are driven by numbers say it is too small a
segment to contend with,'' said Paul Sladkus, a New York
advertising representative for 30 Asian print and broadcast media
nationwide. ``Other companies are looking at them very seriously as
new consumers.''
   General Motors, AT&T, New York Life, United Airlines and Remy
Martin cognac are among advertisers who have crossed over with
appeals geared to Asian-American consumers.
   The reason? Although Asian-Americans are a relatively small
piece of the U.S. population, their steep growth rate and favorable
demographics make them blue-chip consumers for many products.
   The advertising upswing has touched off sharp growth in
Asian-targeted media, especially in Los Angeles and Orange
counties, which topped the nation with 550,000 Asian-Americans as
of the 1980 census, when the national figure was 3.5 million.
   That was up from 1.4 million in 1970, according to an American
Management Association report that projected Asian-Americans will
total 6.5 million by 1990 and 10 million by 2000.
   ``We used to have two Chinese (newspaper) dailies'' in Los
Angeles, said Stoner. ``Now we have six, three full-bore Korean
dailies, three Japanese dailies and even a Vietnamese daily.''
   Though broadcasting has not developed as sharply, some radio
stations and Los Angeles television station KSCI broadcast programs
in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese and Cambodian.
   ``Cable (television) is the next step,'' said Stoner. ``And as
of 1989 there will be pay television in their languages in every
major (Asian-American) metropolitan area in the country: New York,
Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles and Seattle-Vancouver.''
   Jerry Walters, whose Los Angeles agency researches the
Asian-American market for major advertising campaigns, said about
75 percent of Asian-Americans were born outside the country,
``except for the Japanese, which are 20 percent first generation.''
   Newcomers are said to be more responsive to advertising about
what to buy and where to find it.
   With larger household sizes and more workers in the home, median
family income for almost all Asian-American groups is better than
average. They also have more education and better jobs than
national norms.
   But differences in language, culture, nationality and
assimilation level can make reaching and persuading Asian-Americans
a tough job for advertisers. Different languages mean they cannot
be targeted with just one appeal, as Hispanics are in Spanish.
   ``Many times the current copy just doesn't fly with the Asian
population,'' said Walters. ``The word `Chevy' was not recognized
by first-generation Koreans. So we translated it to `It's a
Chevrolet. America's finest line of cars.'''
   Other campaigns lose something in the translation or communicate
the wrong message. Walters said Playboy magazine ran a New Year's
greeting in Chinese that had the characters in the wrong order.
   Some overseas campaigns ran into even more trouble. Colonel
Sanders ``finger-lickin' good'' fried chicken slogan once was
translated ``something like `eat your fingers off''' and Pepsi
Cola's ``come alive'' generation became ``wakes your ancestors up
from the dead,'' Walters said.
   Some agencies have solved that problem by tailoring ads to suit
the peculiarities of different subgroups.
   And even while wooing new consumers, Madison Avenue still could
improve its image of Asians in mainstream advertising, said Doug
Alligood, BBDO's vice president for special markets in New York.
   ``Advertisers are approving a lot of ads that are in
questionable taste, the Japanese in particular,'' said Alligood.
``Japanese men with little round glasses and buck teeth. There's no
room for that.''

   It will be hard to top the color and drama of
his fourth U.S.-Soviet summit, but President Reagan's aides and
backers say he will have plenty to keep him busy until he leaves
office 7{ months from now.
   There's just a chance that his schedule might include a fifth
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign a treaty
reducing superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles.
   ``I think what we are seeing is that Ronald Reagan has not yet
reached the peak of his powers or his accomplishments,'' says
Martin Anderson, the president's former top domestic policy adviser
and author of a book about his administration.
   Reagan's agenda will include an economic summit meeting with
leaders of the industrialized Western democracies and Japan,
campaign trips on behalf of George Bush and other Republican
candidates and a brief appearance at the GOP convention in New
Orleans.
   He is also expected to squeeze in four more vacation trips to
California before he turns over the reins to his successor at noon
next Jan. 20.
   As they have for many months, the president and his aides also
say that efforts continue to secure the freedom of nine American
hostages held in Lebanon.
   Administration efforts to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power, which collapsed as Reagan was on his way to the summit, may
also be resumed.
   On the president's immediate schedule are a couple of speeches
in Washington in which he will report on his Moscow visit.
   Details of the speeches had not been announced as the president
prepared to leave Moscow.
   Still up in the air was the future of a proposed treaty reducing
intercontinental ballistic missile arsenals by 30 to 50 percent,
which both sides had originally said they hoped might be signed
during the meetings in the Kremlin.
   ``We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave
office,'' Reagan told students at Moscow State University. ``But I
assure you that if it isn't ... I will have impressed on my
successor that we must carry on until it is signed.''
   Anderson, interviewed by telephone at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University, where he is a senior fellow, said, ``I would
predict that he and General Secretary Gorbachev are going to be
working even harder to put together a reduction in the big
weapons.''
   ``They may not get to the full 50 percent but I wouldn't be
surprised if they did get some agreement,'' said Anderson, who in
his recent book, ``Revolution,'' depicted nuclear arms reduction as
Reagan's overriding concern during his presidency.
   Gorbachev and Reagan, who first met in Geneva in 1985 and
subsequently got together in Reykjavik, Iceland, and in Washington
before their session in Moscow, have indicated they would be
willing to meet again to sign such a treaty.
   With difficult negotiations still ahead, no concrete plans have
been made, but some sources have suggested Budapest, Hungary, as a
possible site.
   More immediately, Reagan will meet in Toronto June 19-21 with
heads of government from Canada, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
Italy and France for the 14th annual economic summit. With the
exception of Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he will
have been in office longer than any of them.
   ``There are no burning issues,'' said one administration
official. ``It's a `where we have been and where we are going' kind
of thing.''
   Reagan's speech at the Republican National Convention in New
Orleans Aug. 15-18 is expected to be a brief drop-in enroute to his
annual August vacation at his ranch north of Santa Barbara, Calif.
   He is also expected to visit the ranch in July and, as usual,
spend Thanksgiving there and round out the year at the home of old
friend Walter Annenberg in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
   The president is expected to make campaign appearances on Bush's
behalf after the vice president's expected nomination at the
convention.
   ``Nothing has been scheduled, but he will be doing campaigning
for the vice president and a lot of campaigning for Senate and
House candidates,'' Deputy White House Press Secretarty B.J. Cooper
said.
   It does not sound as dramatic as meeting with refuseniks in
Moscow, dueling with Gorbachev inside the Kremlin walls or
answering barbed questions from Soviet students.
   But, as Reagan said in a May 2 speech to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce reviewing his administration's accomplishments, ``We
aren't at the end yet.''

buying spree that pushed up the Dow Jones industrial average nearly
75 points.
   Analysts could not point to any specific developments to account

   The Dow industrials rose 74.68 points to close at 2,031.12. That

extremely light as dealers remain reluctant to make any significant
moves ahead of the OPEC meeting scheduled for June 8.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, the contract for
June delivery of West Texas Intermediate closed up 8 cents at
$17.51 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose 0.40 cent to 52.95 cents a gallon. Wholesale
heating oil rose 0.45 cent a gallon to 48.23 cents.
   ``You had a very boring day,'' said Jayne Ball, a trader in the
international energy futures department at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York. Asked why the market was so slow, she said,
``Would you put your money on a horse that hasn't run yet?''
   Traders said they were concerned about taking speculative
positions primarily because of the uncertain outcome of the planned
meeting among ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Vienna.
   OPEC's failure to decisively curb production excesses at an
inconclusive conference in April was blamed for a subsequent drop
in oil prices.

   Macmillan Inc.'s new billion-dollar
restructuring plan, designed to thwart a hostile takeover bid by
Texas investor Robert M. Bass, leaves the door open for higher bids
from Bass or other potential suitors, some analysts believe.
   The venerable publishing giant announced Tuesday that its board
of directors had adopted a plan to split the company's publishing
and non-publishing operations into two separate, publicly owned
corporations and to pay special dividends to shareholders.
   Macmillan valued the dividends and securities to be paid under
the restructuring plan at more than $64 a share, or over $1.66
billion. Some analysts who follow the company estimated the plan
would be worth $65 to $70 a share.
   Bass, who leads a group of Texas investors that launched a bid
for Macmillan in mid-May, offered $64 a share for Macmillan's
roughly 26 million outstanding shares. The bid by the Bass group _
which holds 9.1 percent of the company's shares _ was rejected as
inadequate by Macmillan's board.
   The investor group had no comment on Macmillan's restructuring
proposal, said Dee Kelly, an attorney at the law firm Kelly, Hart &
Hallman of Fort Worth, that is representing the group.
   The proposed restructuring still leaves room for Bass and other
potential suitors to bid for Macmillan, but makes the possibility
of an offer being supported by management more remote, said Bruce
Thorp, an analyst for Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   ``This really puts pressure on (potential suitors) for time,''
Thorp said.
   Other possible bidders cited by market watchers are competitors
Gulf & Western Inc., McGraw-Hill Inc. and British media tycoon
Robert Maxwell.
   Bass is keenly interested in Macmillan's information services
business, the company's fastest-growing and most profitable area,
according to analysts. The business, which publishes reference
books such as Who's Who and trade guides for lawyers, had sales of
$229 million in 1987 _ up from $146 million two years before.
   Under the restructuring plan, the two new companies would be
called Macmillan Publishing Co. and Macmillan Information Co.
Macmillan Information, now a subsidiary of the parent, would be
``spun off'' as a dividend to shareholders.
   For each share of existing Macmillan stock, shareholders would
receive a cash dividend of $52.35, a half-share of common stock in
the new Macmillan Information, and $4.50 principal amount of
Macmillan Information subordinated debentures.
   The cash dividend of $52.35 consists of $25.20 from Macmillan
Inc. and $27.15 from Macmillan Information.
   Macmillan stock dropped $2.25 a share Tuesday to close at $70.25
on the New York Stock Exchange. There had been rumors on Wall
Street that Macmillan's management might be planning to buy the
company from shareholders, speculation that had sent the stock up
$2.37{ a share on Friday.
   Macmillan said it had obtained commitments for all the financing
needed to pay the special dividends.
   The company said the restructuring plan had been under study for
a year, but analysts suggested the timing of the decision likely
meant it was taken to counter the Bass bid.
   ``I think the timing was a reaction to Bass,'' said Bert Boksen,
an analyst for Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
He called the restructuring ``a reasonable deal.''
   A takeover by Bass, Boksen suggested, would have boosted
Macmillan shares to $80 to $90 _ while the restructuring could lift
them to around $80.
   Macmillan Chairman Edward P. Evans told shareholders at the
annual meeting on May 18 that the company was not for sale. The
shareholders approved a proposal by management to authorize the
issuance of additional stock in Macmillan, as a defense against
hostile takeovers.
   Under the restructuring plan, Macmillan Information would
include the information services, textbook and retail businesses
currently owned by the parent. The operating managements of
Macmillan Publishing and Macmillan Information would remain the
same as in the current subsidiaries, and senior management would
continue in their positions.
   The company had revenue of $469.4 million from its publishing
operations and $486.4 million from its information businesses in
1987.

<HEAD>Analysts Scramble to Explain Reasons for Latest Stock Rally</HEAD>

   The stock market broke out of its May doldrums
with a buying spree that carried the Dow Jones industrial average
to its second biggest gain of the year.
   But analysts were hard-pressed to come up with an explanation
for Tuesday's surge, which came on the heaviest daily volume since
late January.
   ``Sometimes it's better just to enjoy and not analyze things
like this,'' said John L. Manley Jr., a portfolio strategist for
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``It's been a bad May.''
   Peter DaPuzzo, manager of retail equity trading for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said the warm weather over the Memorial Day
holiday may have brightened investors' outlooks and prompted them
to put some cash to work.
   ``You've got to start a summer rally sometime, and Memorial Day
is usually the threshold to the summer,'' he said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 74.68 on Tuesday
to 2,031.12, its highest level since it closed at 2,036.31 on May 4.
   It was the biggest one-day advance in the market's most
widely-followed index since a 76.42-point gain on Jan. 4, the first
trading day of the year, and the sixth biggest rise ever.
   The gain in the Dow Jones industrials was so strong that a
voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when
the Dow's rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading.
   But even after the so-called ``collar'' went into effect for the
rest of the day, the blue-chip average extended its gain. It was
the third time the collar had gone into effect since it was adopted
in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash in a bid to curb
market volatility.
   Gainers outpaced losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,211 up, 333 down
and 401 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 247.61 million shares,
up from 133.59 million in the previous session and the highest
since 275.25 million shares were traded there on Jan. 25. Two
utility stocks with dividend deadlines approaching accounted for
about 90 million shares of volume.
   Nonetheless, volume was up from the sluggish pace of recent
weeks that has prompted speculation that brokerage firms may resort
to a round of layoffs.
   Analysts had been saying that the slow pace of trading reflected
investors' uncertainty about the implications of continued strength
in the economy.
   While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits,
some investors worried that it could also reignite inflation and
prompt the Fdederal Reserve to choke it off by encouraging higher
interest rates.
   Even as stock prices and trading volume swelled on Tuesday, some
potential ingredients for a new surge in inflation were evident.
   Commodity futures prices surged, propelling a key inflation
indicator, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities,
to a three-year high.
   But that failed to dampen enthusiasm in the stock market.
   Analysts said stock traders were heartened by the dollar's
continuing stability and the bond market's resilience in the face
of rising commodity prices.
   Recent declines in bond prices have pushed their yields higher
and made them more competitive with stocks for investors' money.
   They also cited relief that the Fed failed to boost its discount
rate _ its interest charge on loans to financial institutions _ as
some feared it would after the markets closed last week.
   Eldon A. Grimm, a senior vice president at the brokerage Birr,
Wilson Securities Inc., said there is ``an enormous amount of cash
around out of the market'' due to wariness in the wake of last
October's crash.
   ``But every time we get a little rally going, people think they
will miss the boat and buy something,'' he said.

<HEAD>Attendants' Shortage Cancels USAir Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir said normal flight schedules would
resume today after numerous holiday weekend flights were canceled
when flight attendants refused to work end-of-the-month overtime to
protest an impasse in contract negotiations.
   The airline, based at National Airport in Arlington, Va.,
canceled about two dozen of its 1,600 flights Tuesday, said
spokesman Dave Shipley. The Washington, D.C.-based airline also
canceled one flight Saturday, 81 on Sunday and 61 on Memorial Day.
   ``It's a very, very small percentage of the total,'' Shipley
said. ``There's not chaos at the airports.''
   Shipley said flight attendants' overtime is governed by federal
regulations that limit them to 85 hours per month. He said flight
attendants may fly five extra hours per month as overtime at the
request of airlines, but they are not required to do so.
   Since today is the first day of the new month, the flight
attendants would revert to their normal work schedules.
   USAir has yet to complete an agreement for a new contract and
seniority list with its flight attendants and those employed by
Pacific Southwest Airlines, which USAir acquired last year and
merged into its system on April 9.
   ``Apparently there is (a protest), but it's not a
union-organized protest. I think it's a spontaneous protest. I was
as surprised as anyone else,'' said Juliette Lenoir, vice president
of the Washington, D.C.-based union and a USAir flight attendant.
   ``My best sense is that flight attendants are just very upset at
this whole issue of pay parity for the former PSA flight
attendants. That may have been the straw that broke the camel's
back,'' she said.
   Ms. Lenoir said USAir also has been asking attendants to do more
work, such as serving travelers before takeoff, without a raise in
pay since at least 1985.
   Shipley said most passengers booked on the canceled flights
switched to other USAir flights or to other airlines.
   USAir's central operating hub is Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport.

<HEAD>Report Says Traders Raked In Big Profits Despite Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Floor brokers on the New York Stock Exchange
posted their best year ever in 1987 despite the slashing of stock
prices during the October market crash, a published report said
today.
   Quoting confidential exchange records, The New York Times said
the 54 ``specialist'' firms collectively lost $166.7 million in
October but still managed to post profits of $369.3 million before
taxes for the year.
   Specialists are appointed by the exchange to make markets in
individual stocks. They are charged with making sure that market is
orderly, even if it means buying and selling equities from their
own accounts.
   They have been criticized for not doing more to smoothe out the
market during the crash, but specialist advocates have commended
their performance during the crisis.
   Financial data on specialists are kept secret and are not
reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission because they are
private enterprises, the paper said.
   The Times said it obtained the data from Congressional staff
sources who received the confidential records from the exchange as
part of a continuing investigation into the crash.
   According to figures provided to the Times, specialists earned
$1.85 billion before taxes from 1981 through 1987 while their
equity capital amounted to $923 million at the end of last year.
   The Times said that indicates they took out of their businesses
$1.38 billion, not including salaries and expenses.
   Specialists' returns have not dipped below 30 percent this
decade, the paper said.
   Meanwhile, exchange members who deal with the public and are not
specialists had capital of about $22.9 billion last year, but their
pre-tax return amounted to 4.8 percent, the paper reported.
   Richard Grasso, president-elect of the exchange, noted that
several new rules have been instituted to boost slightly the
capital specialists must have on hand.
   He told the Times the earnings figures should have been lower
because they did not take into account payments partners in the
specialist firms made to themselves as a return on their
investments.

<HEAD>Another Delay For Turbo Coupe by Maserati</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debut of the Turbo Coupe, a Chrysler-styled,
Maserati-built luxury sports car, has been hit with another delay
and probably won't show up in U.S. showrooms until late summer.
   The trade journal Automotive News reported this week that the
$30,000 coupe's launch was delayed for two more months because of
snags involved in a hard top as a no-cost option and by other
last-minute refinements.
   The car comes with no other options.
   ``We experienced a bit of difficulty with the hard top,''
Anthony Richards, director of Chrysler's Lamborghini and Maserati
programs, told the trade journal.
   The Maserati-Chrysler hybrid was scheduled for introduction in
mid-May on the West Coast but won't appear until the end of July _
well into the warm weather selling season for convertibles.
   The car, once planned for U.S. launch in early 1987, went into
production in low volume at Maserati's Innocenti plant in Milan,
Italy, earlier this month. The car will be sold and serviced by 300
Chrysler dealers in the United States and 30 in Canada.
   Chrysler plans to sell about 5,000 to 6,000 of the luxury sports
models a year, but the plant has the capacity to build as many as
8,000.
   The car first was shown in January 1986. Some of the many delays
in its introduction included different design ideas held by
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and Maserati Chairman Alejandro De
Tomaso, Automotive News reported.
   The car was styled primarily in Detroit and engineered and built
in Italy. It is the first fruit of a Chrysler-Maserati joint
development agreement on vehicles for the North American market.

   Jaguar Cars Ltd. plans to offer completely
mechanical air bags on all models in 1990 using a New Jersey
company's system that cuts the cost of the devices to as little as
$40 each, a trade journal reported.
   The mechanical bags, developed by Breed Automotive Corp. of
Boonton, N.J., include a single sensor, no wiring and no expensive
electronics, Automotive News reported in this week's edition.
   Instead, the bags, packaged in the steering wheel and the
passenger side dashboard, inflate when a ball inside each package
is jarred loose during impact.
   The Jaguar installation would be the first use of the system,
which was tested and approved by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration last year.
   Other air bag systems include sophisticated electronic sensors
that trigger a bag-inflating charge at the beginning of impact and
cost between $200 and $800 each.
   Tokai-Rika Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp.,
has been licensed by Breed to produce the mechanical air bag and
other Breed sensor technology, Automotive News reported.

<HEAD>Counseling Helps Workers Prepare for Life After Layoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Malone is urging soon-to-be-laid-off
General Motors Corp. workers to do as he says and as he did _ stop
using credit cards and pay off all the debts they can while they're
still working.
   Malone prepared for his layoff two years ago by paying off
$3,000 in bills in one month so he wouldn't end up ``hitting the
wall'' _ losing his home or other possessions after layoff benefits
run out.
   ``I knew it was easier to pay them off when I was working
11{-hour days than after I was laid off,'' said Malone, who was
recalled in May and is using his experience at the UAW-GM Crisis
Center.
   Malone counsels laid-off GM workers who already have hit the
wall. But GM, the UAW and local agencies including Oakland Family
Services and Credit Counseling Centers Inc. also are trying to
teach workers how to avoid it.
   About 8,500 Pontiac-area workers are on layoff or will be by
1990, a portion of more than 30,000 GM workers whose jobs will
disappear in closings of at least 16 plants nationwide.
   Among the advice they receive: Stop using credit cards and
prepare a realistic budget that takes into account lower income
while benefits are coming in and potentially drastic reductions in
income afterward.
   The lessons are hard for some workers to learn, Malone said.
   Losing a job ``is a loss just like the other losses we
acknowledge, like the loss of a loved one,'' said Barbara La Fonz,
employment projects coordinator for Oakland Family Services.
   Victims experience the same stages of grief _ denial, anger,
depression and finally acceptance _ as with other major losses, she
said. But with a job loss, ``people have a tendency not to reach
out for help available to them.
   ``There is a desire to hide from the situation. They might bring
in the mail, but they don't really open up the bills. Imagination
takes over and makes it seem a worse situation than it is,'' La
Fonz said.
   Laid-off workers have hit the wall if they are being threatened
with foreclosure, eviction, repossession or bankruptcy.
   Some give up, La Fonz said. But many are directed to Credit
Counseling Centers Inc., a non-profit counseling agency that
provides free assessments.
   Giving up can lead to bankruptcy filings, as many as 50 percent
of which are unnecessary, said Credit Counseling spokeswoman Nancy
Leahey, citing a recent study by Purdue University.
   The study showed half of 1,199 bankruptcy petitions surveyed had
no ability to repay debts; 20 percent could have paid all but
mortgage debts in three years, and 25 percent could have repaid 75
percent of their debts in three years, Leheay said.
   ``Once filed, a bankruptcy stays on the credit record for 10
years and indefinitely for life insurance policies and mortgage
credit requests,'' she said.

<HEAD>Help-Wanted Advertising Steady in April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Help-wanted advertising, an indication of the
demand for labor, held steady in April, the Conference Board
reported Tuesday.
   The Board's Help-Wanted index, unchanged from the previous
month, measures the volume of classified advertising in 51 major
newspapers nationwide.
   But trends in the labor market continue to confound experts.
   ``While help-wanted advertising volume has shown no significant
strength since last November, employment continues to rise,'' noted
Conference Board economist Kenneth Goldstein.
   The Labor Department reported April's unemployment rate was 5.4
percent, down from 5.6 percent in March.
   ``The best odds still favor a slowing of employment growth in
the coming months, rather than a spurt in want-ad volume,'' he said.
   Advertising volume rose in five of the nine geographic regions
measured, with the East South Central region posting the largest
gain of 5.5 percent. It was followed by the South Atlantic, where
help-wanted advertising rose 2.9 percent, and the West North
Central region, up 1.7 percent.
   The Middle Atlantic region registered the greatest decline of
5.8 percent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses continue to attract high
levels of foreign investment, in part because of the cheaper dollar
and favorable U.S. economic conditions, the government says.
   Foreigners spent $30.5 billion in 1987 to acquire or establish
businesses in the United States, the Commerce Department said
Tuesday. That was down 22 percent from the record $39.2 billion in
1986, but nearly four times greater than the 1983 level of $8.1
billion.
   The driving force behind the big jump in foreign investment has
been this country's huge trade deficit, which hit a record $171.2
billion last year.
   Foreigners have looked for ways to invest their dollars, earned
through sales to Americans. As a consequence, the United States has
moved from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest
debtor.
   The report identified four factors that made U.S. businesses
attractive to foreigners last year:
   _The continued depreciation of the dollar encouraged foreign
companies to shift operations to the United States so that their
expenses as well as sales were paid in dollars.
   _Moderate inflation and an expanding economy made prospects for
U.S. businesses look good.
   _Continuing takeover activity created opportunities for
purchases.
   _And, fear that Congress would enact legislation to restrict
imports likely motivated foreign companies to produce in, rather
than export to, this country.
   Analysts read little significance into the decline from 1986,
cautioning that tax law changes and other factors may have held
down the reported number for 1987.
   ``Everybody was trying to close deals in 1986 because of tax
considerations, so it's quite possible that 1986 just borrowed some
sales from 1987,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data
Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Ellen M. Herr, a Commerce Department analyst, said if past years
are any guide, the 1987 total will be revised upward by 10 percent
or more as additional deals are reported to the government.
   The 1986 figure had originally been reported at $31.5 billion,
nearly 20 percent less than the revised figure released Tuesday.
   Wyss said foreign investment would likely increase again in 1988
because of the continued fall of the dollar, which has lost about
half of its value since 1985 as measured against the Japanese yen.
   ``The U.S. right now looks like a very competitive place to
produce. U.S. companies, especially when you look at them in yen
terms, look very cheap and you're going to see continued strong
buying,'' he said.
   Foreigners also have been buying corporate bonds, Treasury
notes, stocks and other investments that do not show up in the
report released Tuesday. It tracks money spent to establish new
businesses or purchase a 10 percent or greater stake in existing
companies.
   U.S. businesses acquired or established by foreigners in 1987
employed 346,000 workers and owned 316,000 acres of land.
   The report showed that Great Britain was the largest purchaser
at $11.5 billion, up from $8.6 billion in 1986. It was followed by
Japan with $5.3 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year earlier; and
West Germany, $4.1 billion, up from $1.4 billion. Investment by all
European nations dropped to $19.5 billion from $21.1 billion.
   Canadian investment, which was $6.5 billion in 1986, was
reported at $849 million last year.
   Wyss cautioned that the figures for individual countries can
swing widely from year to year based on a single large deal or on
difficulties in collecting information.
   The largest investment, by industry group, was in manufacturing
_ particularly chemical and food companies _ at $16.3 billion, down
6 percent from 1986.
   Overseas investment in banking and finance dipped to $1.9
billion from $2.1 billion. In retail trade, purchases by foreigners
totaled $682 million, a big drop from $5.2 billion in 1986.
   Real estate investment was $2.9 billion in 1987, down from $5.2
billion.
   According to the report, much of the Japanese investment was
concentrated in real estate, particularly New York City office
buildings and hotels in Hawaii and the Southwest.

   Raw farm products in May brought prices 3.1
percent above the April average and 4.7 percent over those of the
same time last year, the Agriculture Department reports.
   Prices paid to farmers averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base used
for comparison, according to the preliminary figures released
Tuesday by the department's Agricultural Statistics Board. A year
ago the index was 128.
   ``Higher prices for hogs, oranges, soybeans and broilers were
partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes, onions, milk and
upland cotton,'' it said.
   Hog prices reached their highest levels since October while
cattle rose to their highest since May 1979. Soybeans shot up
sharply.
   Livestock and poultry prices were up 2.7 percent from both April
and May 1987, according to the preliminary figures, based mainly on
mid-month averages.
   ``Higher prices for hogs, broilers and beef cattle more than
offset lower prices for milk, eggs and calves,'' USDA said.
   Crop prices overall were up 4.5 percent from April and 7.4
percent above the levels of a year ago.
   For oil-bearing crops, primarily soybeans, the price index was
up 7.4 percent from the previous month and 26 percent above the May
1987 level.
   But there was a 12 percent drop in prices paid to commercial
vegetable producers from April's levels and 11 percent from last
year. USDA attributed most of the change to lower prices for
tomatoes, onions and sweet corn.
   The report also said:
   Cattle averaged $70 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up
from $69 in April and above the $63 reported for May 1987. Those
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   Hogs averaged $46.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $41.90 in
March and $54.40 a year earlier.
   Corn, at $1.89 a bushel, was up from $1.88 in April and well
over last year's mark of $1.66.
   Wheat prices at the farm, according to the preliminary figures,
averaged $2.83 a bushel, up from $2.79 last month and $2.66 a year
earlier.
   Rice averaged $8.27 per 100 pounds, down slightly from $8.33
last month but still far above the year-ago figure, which was $3.71.
   Soybeans were reported at $6.98 a bushel compared to $6.40 last
month and $5.20 in May 1987.
   Upland cotton averaged 56.4 cents a pounds, a decrease from 59.4
cents in April and 60 cents a year earlier.
   Eggs were 43.1 cents a dozen, down from 45.5 cents in April, and
49.3 cents in May 1987.
   Milk was reported at $11.75 per 100 pounds, an increase from
$11.72 last month but a decrease from $12.37 a year earlier.
   Broilers were 33.5 cents a pound, up from 28 cents last month
and 29.9 cents in May 1987.

   The Agriculture Department is indicating that
it is prepared to assist farmers by easing curbs on the use of land
idled under conservation programs.
   The department indicated Tuesday it is prepared to ease a ban on
hay production and cattle grazing on such land in counties found to
be suffering from a natural disaster that harms pasture and forage
crops.
   The statement reflected rising concern over a drought hitting
major portions of the midcontinent from South Texas to the Canadian
border and as far west as Idaho. Thus far, however, no disaster
counties have been declared.
   The statement from Milton Hertz, administrator of the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, mainly
outlined possibilities already open to USDA. It contained no new
programs.
   The 1985 Farm Act requires farmers to devote part of their land
to conservation uses if they are to be eligible for federal
payments. The acreage involved varies from one crop to another. For
example, it is 27.5 percent for wheat.
   Producers also receive payments for placing certain land in the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   Haying and grazing are banned on acreage devoted to conservation
programs, mainly because farmers already derive economic benefit
from the land in the form of government payments. But USDA may make
exceptions.
   In counties found to be suffering from a disaster, Hertz said,
``haying and grazing will be allowed for any consecutive five-month
period between April 1 and October 1.''
   He said determination of eligible counties will be made on a
case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Centel Dismisses Takeover Offer as Not Credible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centel Corp. officials dismissed a $2.8 billion
cash takeover bid from an investment group as not credible and as a
mere tactical device in a proxy fight.
   Reaction on Wall Street was also skeptical.
   Centel stock rose $4.87{ a share to close at $50 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Tuesday, but that was $15 below the price offered
by the investment group led by Asher B. Edelman and George L.
Lindemann.
   John P. Frazee Jr., Centel's chairman, said the offer was an
apparent attempt to aid efforts by Lindemann and Edelman to gain
three seats on Centel's 11-member board of directors.
   Edelman and Lindemann said in a letter to Centel management that
their investment group was willing to pay $65 a share for each of
Centel's approximately 43 million shares outstanding.
   But they conditioned the offer on Centel's canceling an
agreement to pay $763 million to buy United Telespectrum, the
cellular telephone subsidiary of United Telecommunications of
Kansas City, Mo. They said they would drop the bid to $60 a share
if Centel held to the deal, which was announced Friday.
   ``We believe the investment community overall reacted favorably
to our announcement regarding our proposed acquisition of United
Telespectrum,'' Frazee said in a statement. ``Our decision was part
of our strategic repositioning that follows closely our overall
business plan to emphasize three main lines of business _ cellular
communications, cable television and local exchange telephone
service.''
   That business plan in the long term would provide a far better
return for investors than any short-term gain under Lindemann and
Edelman's proposal to sell off company assets to boost stock value,
Frazee said in a telephone interview.
   Edelman is a financier who lives in New York. Lindemann is
chairman of Metro Mobile CTS Inc., a New York-based mobile-phone
business.
   Their group holds 5.5 percent of Centel's stock.
   Centel also announced plans Friday to sell its Centel Business
systems division, which executives had said could quiet dissident
shareholders who have called for a breakup of the company.
   In their letter, Edelman and Lindemann criticized Centel's plan
to acquire United Telespectrum and its $9.5 million debt.
   In light of that plan, they wrote, ``it is apparent to us that
management is not operating the company with shareholder values in
mind. This acquisition is overpriced and substantially reduces
shareholder values.''
   The letter said the takeover offer was designed ``to maximize
the values of the company,'' but Edelman and Lindemann also said
the offer was subject to financing being arranged and to regulatory
approval.
   They said said that if the offer were accepted, the group would
seek to dispose of Centel assets under the program they previously
urged.
   ``This is a friendly overture towards acquiring the company,''
Edelman said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It's very
friendly to the company. I'm not sure it would be friendly to the
management.''
   He would not comment on the group's next move if Centel offered
no response by the June 10 deadline set in the letter.
   In a statement, Frazee said, ``We feel the actions by Lindemann
and Edelman today should not distract attention from the basic
issue before the shareowners regarding Centel's future and the need
to re-elect directors who are committed to our strategic plan to
maximize shareowner values.''
   And in an interview, he said, ``We believe that our track record
of enhancing shareowner value in the past is very solid.''
   In an earlier statement, Centel said the acquisition of United
Telespectrum would increase Centel's presence in cellular phone
markets in the Southeast and give it a foothold in the Northeast,
including New York City and nearby areas of New Jersey.

<HEAD>Tate & Lyle Offer For Staley Expires; Merger Expected Within A
Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staley Continental Inc.
shareholders have tendered more than 90 percent of their stock to
Tate & Lyle PLC under a $1.5 billion takeover.
   About 31.5 million shares of Staley's common stock were tendered
by Tuesday's 5 p.m. EDT expiration of the $36.50 per share offer,
said Mary Conway, a Tate & Lyle spokeswoman.
   With those shares, plus the 1.5 million common shares that Tate
& Lyle already owned, the British company had more than 90.3
percent of Staley's outstanding common shares, Ms. Conway said.
   Staley has guaranteed Tate & Lyle delivery of all other
oustanding shares, she said.
   ``Tate & Lyle anticipates merging Staley Continental Inc. into
its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, RP Acqusition Corp., within
a week,'' Ms. Conway said.
   Tate & Lyle's complete offer for the corn-sweetener and
food-service company amounted to some $1.5 billion.
   Staley Continental, headquartered here in suburban Chicago, is a
leading maker of corn sweeteners and food-service supplies.
   Tate & Lyle, Britain's second-largest sugar refiner, is buying
the company mostly for its Decatur-based A.E. Staley Manufacturing
Co. subsidiary, the second-largest U.S. refiner of corn syrup.
   Tate & Lyle has said it plans to sell Staley's food-service
subsidiary, CFS Continental Inc., and move the corporate
headquarters back to Decatur, Ill.
   Staley Continental agreed to the takeover, which was announced
May 13.

<HEAD>Koppers Management Reportedly Favors Beazer Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co. Inc., which waged a three-month
war to avoid a takeover bid by British industrialist Brian Beazer,
now appears ready to accept a slightly improved offer to sell the
company to Beazer affiliate BNS Inc.
   Koppers officials reportedly favor a bid $1-per-share higher
than BNS's latest offer over an internal plan to restructure and
remain independent, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported today.
   Koppers President Glen Tenley refused to confirm an agreement
had been reached between the two companies, which battled publicly
for months via advertisements in major newspapers and trade
publications.
   ``We haven't decided what to do yet,'' Tenley said. ``We're
still reviewing our options. We're reviewing capitalization, our
litigation and any other options.''
   The companies would confirm only that ``serious negotiations''
aimed at reaching an agreement began in New York over the Memorial
Day holiday weekend.
   Before the negotiations began, BNS had twice raised its bid for
the Pittsburgh-based construction and chemical company, from an
original $45 per share to $60 per share. The weekend talks
reportedly produced a $61-per-share offer.
   ``Such negotiations are expected to continue although there can
be no assurance that such negotiations will result in a mutually
acceptable agreement,'' the companies said Tuesday in a one
paragraph statement.
   Koppers spokesman Robert O'Gara said Koppers' goal is still to
keep the outcome of the discussions in the best interests of
shareholders, employees and the Pittsburgh area.
   ``All I can say is that serious negotiations and talks are
continuing,'' he said.
   BNS had extended its $1.7 billion, or $60 per share, tender
offer through Wednesday, saying it either owns or has offers to buy
80 percent of Koppers' common shares. BNS is owned by Beazer PLC
and Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   As part of the deal, Beazer has agreed to compensate Koppers'
top officials and employees, a package reportedly worth from $70
million to $100 million over 12 months, the Post-Gazette reported.
   Earlier, Beazer said a federal appeals court in California had
lifted one of the legal roadblocks to BNS' takeover bid of Koppers.
   Beazer said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last
Friday that BNS may proceed with its attempt to acquire Koppers'
stock once a trustee is appointed to control Koppers' Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. subsidiary, a quarry and road materials supplier in
Irwindale, Calif.
   But O'Gara said the decision imposes further delays on the
takeover bid because it said the trustee cannot take over the
subsidiary until BNS acquires a controlling interest in Koppers.
   Also, O'Gara said, the order states that an injunction issued by
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles will
remain in force until the trustee is appointed.
   Roger Beidler, Koppers vice president for communications and
investor relations, said the firm is pleased with the ruling
because it recognized Real's authority to decide the anti-trust
issues raised in the case.
   Sully-Miller is a direct competitor of a company owned by Beazer
PLC, a British construction firm. Koppers had filed challenges
before Real alleging anti-trust violations.
   Real is scheduled to hold a hearing on the Koppers matter on
Wednesday.
   Another legal roadblock to Beazer exists in U.S. District Court
in Pittsburgh, where Judge Maurice B. Cohill halted the BNS bid
because of his concerns over financing. He has scheduled hearings
for Monday on the legality of the financing involved.

<HEAD>Arguments Set in Electrolux Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oral arguments are scheduled for next week
in a federal court lawsuit involving an attempt by AB Electrolux of
Sweden to take over Tennessee lawn mower and bicycle manufacturer
Murray Ohio.
   AB Electrolux, which has made a $52-per-share offer, filed suit
in U.S. District Court in Columbus last week against Murray Ohio
and its board of directors, including Chairman W.M. Hannon and
President J.L. Duncan, and various Ohio officials. Oral arguments
have been set for June 9.
   The suit asks the court to declare the Ohio Takeover Act and the
Ohio Foreign Business Acquisition Act unconstitutional and that
Ohio's Control Share Acquisition Act be declared inapplicable to
Electrolux's tender offer.
   It also seeks a court order to stop Murray Ohio from using any
of those acts to block the purchase of Murray stock.
   Parties in the suit agreed Tuesday to an expedited discovery
process and agreed to file motions by next week on whether the
court should abstain in the matter.
   Electrolux's offer of $52 per share to acquire Murray Ohio
amounts to $197.1 million.
   Also named as defendants in the suit are Ohio Division of
Securities Commissioner Mark Holderman, Ohio Department of Commerce
Director Linda Page, Ohio Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr.,
Ohio Department of Development Director David J. Baker and Ohio Tax
Commissioner Joanne Limbach.
   Electrolux also has sued in Tennessee to have the Tennessee
Investor Protection Act declared unconstitutional.
   The act requires a company trying to buy a publicly held company
based in the state to file with the Tennessee Department of
Commerce and Insurance before the offer can become effective.
   Murray Ohio, which was incorporated in Ohio in 1919 and operated
in Toledo until 1955, no longer has holdings in Ohio. It makes lawn
mowers and bicycles at its Lawrenceburg, Tenn., plant.
   AB Electrolux is an international appliance manufacturer with a
product line that includes chain saws and weed trimmers. The
company has no relation to the vacuum cleaner manufacturer
Electrolux Inc. of Marietta, Ga.

   U.S. officials have dismissed as inadequate a
new Japanese proposal in the dispute over admitting more American
beef to the Japanese market.
   ``We don't feel progress has been made,'' a U.S. spokeswoman
said Tuesday, as the two countries opened a new round in their
prolonged negotiations.
   Japanese Deputy Agriculture Minister Hidero Maki, who arrived
from Tokyo during the weekend, met for nearly three hours with
Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith. They agreed to
continue talks today, said Smith's spokeswoman, Kelly Winkler.
   Maki's new proposal involved raising tariffs on beef to protect
Japanese producers from the impact of removing import quotas as
demanded by the United States. Smith and his negotiators felt the
proposal ``was not adequate to address our concerns,'' Ms. Winkler
said, giving no other details.
   Maki also brought a new proposal to resolve a similar dispute
between the two countries over admitting more American oranges and
orange juice to the Japanese market. It is under study, the U.S.
spokeswoman said.
   The United States had agreed to beef and orange quotas under a
1984 accord that expired at the end of March. Meanwhile, two rounds
of negotiations have failed and the United States has requested
GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to declare the
Japanese quotas illegal under international trading rules.

   Campbell Soup Co. says it will make a $200
million tender offer to purchase the remaining shares of Freshbake
Foods Group PLC, in a move to gain strength in the European frozen
food market.
   Campbell already owns or has commitments for about 51 percent of
Freshbake's stock.
   The company said Tuesday it will offer 162 pence, or about $3,
for each of more than 67 million outstanding shares of Freshbake, a
public company based in Orpington, Kent, England.
   Camden-based Campbell will pay for the shares in cash, the
equivalent of interest-bearing notes, or any combination of both at
the option of the shareholder.
   Freshbake is believed to be the third largest frozen food
producer in the United Kingdom with annual sales of more than $300
million. It manufactures pastries and meats, and markets frozen
vegetables for private label sales.
   ``We see important benefits from combining Freshbake's growing
business, its experience and its successful management with
Campbell's global frozen food technology and brand strength,'' said
John W. Argabright, president of Campbell International.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Bunker Hunt _ once one of the wealthiest
men in the world _ is telling a federal court jury his version of
what led to the world silver market crash in 1980.
   In his first day of testimony Tuesday in a multimillion dollar
civil trial in federal court, Hunt essentially repeated assertions
made by defense lawyers in their opening statements last February.
   Lawyers for the other side in the lawsuit will get a crack at
trying to shake his story, possibly as soon as today.
   Hunt, 62, his brothers William Herbert Hunt, 59, and Lamar Hunt,
55, are being sued by a South American silver concern that claims
they manipulated the world silver market eight years ago.
   Minpeco S.A., a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian
government, claims the three brothers conspired to corner the world
silver market in 1979 and 1980.
   Lawyers for Minpeco claim the Hunts and several co-defendants
were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $9
an ounce to more than $50 an ounce between September 1979 and
January 1980.
   Minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused the company to
lose more than $100 million when the world silver market collapsed
in March 1980, with prices falling back to about $10 an ounce.
   But the elder Hunt brother claimed he began investing in silver
bullion and silver futures because of ``continuing inflation and
certain political events.''
   Hunt, who said he began investing in silver in 1973, said that
by the fall of 1979 he was still telling people that ``silver was
an overall good investment.''
   But 1979 was ``a very unsettling year, politically,'' Hunt said
in a low Texas drawl, noting the Iranian revolution that ousted the
shah and took American diplomats hostage in Teheran, a continuing
increase in oil prices, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the
seizure of the Grand Mosque at Mecca by Islamic radicals.
   Hunt, whose legendary father, H.L. Hunt, made the family fortune
in oil, said as oil prices began climbing _ to about $30 in late
1979 _ he bought more and more silver.
   But he claimed that new commodity exchange rules limiting the
number of futures contracts that could be held as well as
increasing the amount to be put down on margin accounts ``was a
difficult thing for the market.''

<HEAD>New Contract Signing Set For Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Chrysler Corp. and the United
Auto Workers will sign their new 66,000-worker, two-year contract
on Monday, the last flourish on a pact that has been in effect
since May 16.
   UAW President Owen Bieber, UAW Vice President Marc Stepp and
Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, along with the elected
10-member UAW bargaining committee, will sign the contract in a 4
p.m. ceremony at Chrysler's Highland Park headquarters, company and
union officials said.
   In ratification voting May 11, the contract was approved by a
slim 54 percent of those voting overall and rejected by Chrysler's
10,000 skilled trades workers.
   But the contract was ratified later that week by the UAW's
executive board following a skilled trades council meeting in
Chicago because the skilled trades objections were not based on
issues that applied solely to them.
   The contract has been in effect since May 16, replacing a
three-year pact that would have expired Sept. 14, St. John said.
   Like the General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. pacts on which
it is based, the contract guarantees a set number of jobs at each
plant, warehouse or office except in cases of cuts in production
volume because of slow sales.
   It also requires the corporation to recall or hire one worker
for every two who quit, retire or die. In turn, UAW leaders agreed
to end their resistance to plant-level agreements that organize
workers into teams.
   Chrysler has begun taking its initial snapshot of guaranteed
jobs at most locations; local union officials will be given lists
of workers' names for approval and discussion, St. John said.
   Unlike the Ford and GM pacts, the Chrysler contract also covers
salaried workers including engineers, office and clerical employees
and nurses.
   The two sides began early negotiations April 18 in an effort to
ease building tensions sparked by Chrysler's consideration of a $2
billion offer to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts
subsidiary and Chrysler's decision to close a 5,500-worker assembly
plant in Kenosha, Wis.
   Chrysler backed down from the sale and agreed to early talks in
March. Despite several disruptions that nearly prompted the UAW to
break off talks, Chrysler and the union reached a tentative
agreement May 4.
   The early settlement eliminated the chance of a strike in
September, which observers said would have been very likely because
of the accumulating anger among Chrysler workers.
   The new contract expires in 1990, making it the first Chrysler
contract in a decade to expire simultaneously with the Ford and GM
pacts.

   Lee Iacocca is back in print _ grumbling about
Japanese trade practices, volunteering to pay more taxes and
revealing that he once considered a takeover of General Motors.
   The new book, ``Talking Straight,'' arrived in bookstores today,
about four years after his autobiography conquered the best seller
lists.
   Its initial printing is 750,000; booksellers can only hope that
it measures up to ``Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' which has sold 2.6
million hardcover copies and 3.5 million paperbacks worldwide.
   ``Talking Straight'' picks up about where the autobiography left
off. Where the latter retold his firing from Ford Motor Co., the
new book starts with the Chrysler chief executive being canned as
head of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission.
   Over 324 pages, Iacocca also discusses the death of his first
wife, Mary, and his brief second marriage; Chrysler's indictment on
charges it sold cars that had been test driven by executives with
the odometers disconnected; and his decision not to run for
president.
   But most of the book is given over to Iacocca's musings on
America's problems, rendered in Iacocca's feisty, sometimes profane
style. Education, farm policy, the importance of family, the
failings of Ronald Reagan _ Uncle Lido has a whole lot of things he
wants to get off his chest.
   _``I'm willing to pay more taxes. I can afford it. But what I
cannot afford is to bury my kids under a dung heap of public debt
that will smother them and their kids, and their grandkids _
forever.''
   _American history consists of 20-year upheavals followed by
eight years of calm, and the current quietude is ending. ``I don't
know if all the banks are going to go out of business or if we're
going to start a shooting war, but something pretty bad is likely
to happen.''
   _Japan should be told to limit its trade surfeit with the United
States. ``The idea really constipates free-trade purists, of
course,'' he said.

quick gains. ``We've got to tell our kids to get away from this

with American Motors since the last book was written).
   And he writes that last spring, automobile dealer Victor
Potamkin and Allied-Signal chairman Ed Hennessy approached him
separately to suggest an unsolicited takeover of the industry
behemoth, General Motors.
   At first, Iacocca says, he dismissed the idea. But talks
continued, and Iacocca even met secretly with investment banker
Felix Rohatyn. He consulted a takeover lawyer and investigated
financing before dropping the proposal.
   ``I concluded that it might be easier to buy Greece,'' he said.

Sonny Kleinfield and published by Bantam Books. It is a main
selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and foreign rights have
been sold so far in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Norway,
Italy and Japan.
   It costs $21.95, but as with the first book, Iacocca has
promised to give all his profits to charity.
   ``Iacocca'' was one of the publishing phenomenons of the 1980s.
The book has been published in 18 languages, ``in countries where
they could not properly pronounce Iacocca's name,'' said Bantam
publicist Stuart Applebaum.
   ``Iacocca'' was on the New York Times best seller list for 80
weeks, 40 of them in the top position.

<HEAD>Rates On Short-Term Securities At Highest Level Since October
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities have risen to the highest level since the October stock
market crash.
   In Tuesday's auction, the Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion
in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.53 percent,
up from 6.34 percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.83 percent, up
from 6.71 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 19 when three-month bills
sold for 6.84 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.21 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.73 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,834.90 and 7.17 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,654.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages increased to 7.58
percent last week, up from 7.40 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Diamond-Star to Begin Building Pilot Cars Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The start of production at the new
Diamond-Star Motors Corp. factory will find robots and humans
working together on about 100 pilot cars.
   As the assembly line begins rolling slowly today, about 400 auto
workers will get their first taste of working side by side with
robots in the new $650 million plant, said Robin Skiles,
Diamond-Star spokeswoman.
   The state-of-the-art auto plant features high-technology
machinery and equipment including robotics on the final assembly
line. Plant supervisors and workers have received intense training
courses, including trips to Japan to study new methods and
management techniques.
   Diamond-Star is scheduled to begin full-scale production of
sporty coupes at the new plant the first week in September.
   Diamond-Star Motors is a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and
Mitsubishi Motors. It will build a two-door, front-wheel-drive
coupe for the 1989 model year. The car will be sold at prices
starting at less than $10,000.
   Ms. Skiles said robots will be tested on an individual basis and
programmed for their specific chores. After each is properly
performing its task, the robots will be choreographed to get the
exact sequence on the assembly line and to perfect their timing.
   ``The first pilot cars will not come off the assembly line until
mid-June,'' she added
   The pilot cars will be checked closely for design quality and
possible production flaws.
   ``The pilot cars will be used by distributors as show cars and
in other media activities,'' she said. ``They will not be for sale
to the public.''
   Chrysler will market the vehicle as the Plymouth Laser.
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which has 205 dealerships in the
United States, also will distribute the sports car, but its name
has not been announced.
   Ms. Skiles said Diamond-Star will have about 1,300 employees
when its first-shift of employees is on board and will produce
upwards of 80,000 in the first 12 months of operation.
   Eventually, the 2 million-square-foot assembly plant will
produce 240,000 cars annually and employ 2,900. Plans call for
Diamond-Star to build a compact sedan at its Normal plant beginning
in 1989. When it reaches full capacity, the plant will crank out
about 63 cars per hour.
   Chrysler and Mitsubishi have exchanged parts, engines and cars
for nearly 20 years, but the Diamond-Star project marks the first
production partnership.

<DATELINE>GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England's maple syrup industry is
threatened by an insect that usually chews on fruit trees but has
found sugar maples more to its liking this spring, a plant expert
says.
   ``If you've got a maple tree, you're in trouble,'' said Terry A.
Tattar, a plant pathologist at the University of Massachusetts'
Shade Tree Laboratory.
   Widespread defoliation blamed on the insect _ called a pear
thrips _ has been reported across New York and New England in the
past 10 days, he said Tuesday.
   ``It's everywhere from Litchfield, Conn., to eastern and western
New York, and the hills of Massachusetts, Vermont and New
Hampshire,'' Tattar said. ``And we just don't know very much about
it. We never had a population blowup of the insect similar to
this.''
   The pear thrips was introduced into California from Europe in
1904 and found its way from there into East Coast cherry, apple and
pear orchards, he said.
   ``I'm looking out of my window and I can see bare tops all over
the hills,'' said Richard Chandler, coordinator of the
Massachusetts Maple Producers Association. ``This certainly will
have an adverse effect on next season's production.''
   After four years of early thaws that cut short the sugaring
season and sent prices of syrup to nearly $40 a gallon, New England
maple sugar producers reported near-normal yields from their taps
this spring.
   Massachusetts annually produces about 50,000 gallons of syrup.
Vermont, the nation's largest maple sugar producer, averages about
500,000 gallons.

   Rising interest rates have come knocking on the
housing and construction industries, threatening to blow down five
straight years of solid gains in nationwide sales.
   But economists say the cyclical ``big bad wolf'' isn't likely to
cause too much damage in 1988, although the outlook for the next
couple of years remains in question.
   ``It will be a weaker year than it could have been because of
interest rates ... but we're still expecting a good year,'' said
John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors.
   Tuccillo estimated that sales of existing homes would total 3.3
million and new home sales would total 650,000 in 1988, down from
3.65 million and 690,000 respectively last year 1987, but still
among the strongest years this decade.
   A report released Tuesday by the Commerce and Housing and Urban
Development departments said that new-home sales climbed 4 percent
in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000 _ the
third consecutive rise and the fastest pace since new homes sold at
a rate of 728,000 in April 1987.
   In a report last week, the National Association of Realtors said
sales of existing homes rose 4.5 percent last month after increases
of 2.5 percent in both March and February.
   While economists said the reports show solid gains, they
cautioned that consumers rushed to do their buying then before
interest rates headed higher. They said May might not be as strong.
   ``People are trying to negotiate a settlement and get a mortgage
in the face of a fairly certain rise in interest rates,'' said
George A. Christie, chief economist with the F.W. Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co.
   Mortgage rates are actually slightly lower now than they were a
year ago _ averaging about 10.46 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate
conventional mortgage, vs. an average 10.60 percent in May 1987,
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie
Mac.
   But after falling sharply since the Oct. 19 stock market crash,
rates started to creep up again over the past several weeks on
fears that the economy may be overheating and inflation might be on
the rise. The 30-year mortgage rate, for instance, has risen more
than half a percentage point since February, when it averaged 9.89
percent, Freddie Mac said.
   Many economists predict mortgage rates will continue to rise
through the summer and top 11 percent by the end of the year. A
handful are forecasting rates in excess of 12 percent in 1989. At
the same time, experts are calling for moderate inflation of around
5 percent this year.
   Frank Nothaft, deputy chief economist for Freddie Mac, said the
rise in fixed-rate mortgages may cause some would-be homebuyers to
switch to adjustable rate mortgages. He said some savings and loan
associations also will become more accommodative, for instance, by
requiring smaller down payments or lowering closing costs to
encourage sales.
   Tuccillo also remains optimistic. He said that the ``Baby
Boomers,'' the large segment of the population born after World War
II, should remain interested in home buying as their families and
incomes expand.
   But David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities Inc.,
said, ``I think we're heading downhill in this industry, and
eventually the fate of the housing market ... will filter through
the rest of the economy as well.
   ``New homes need to be furnished with durable goods, like
refrigerators or washers and dryers,'' he said.
   The higher rates also threaten new construction contracts,
including residential and non-residential units, said Christie.
F.W. Dodge reported Tuesday that contracting for new projects
declined 6 percent in April from the previous month to an annual
rate of $226.97 billion, extending a downward slide that began last
fall.
   Bhristie said high vacancy rates in commercial properties,
particularly offices and apartments, were responsible for reversing
the industry's five-year upswing. But he said rising interest rates
will only aggravate the situation since they translate to higher
borrowing costs for contractors.
   ``The export boom which is pumping up the 1988 economy isn't
much help to the construction industry, and could even prove
troublesome,'' Christie said. ``As economic activity heats up,
rising interest rates imply still lower building later in the
year.''

   The stock market advanced broadly today,
following through on Tuesday's strong rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.13 to 2,033.25 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 769 up, 223
down and 421 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 35.90 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit
markets, reducing yields on long-term Treasury bonds to just above
the 9.2 percent level.
   Analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was
prompted in part by talk that the Federal Reserve was eager to
avoid raising its discount rate, despite its other moves of late to
tighten credit.
   Aside from that rationale, many Wall Streeters openly expressed
surprise at the market's sudden show of strength on Tuesday.
   Unexpected as it was, the rally raised hopes that stocks had
pulled out of the slump that had experienced for several weeks.
   Gainers among the blue chips this morning included International
Business Machines, up } at 113\; American Telephone & Telegraph, up
\ at 27]; Ford Motor, up { at 48|; American Express, up ] at 25|,
and Sears Roebuck, up | at 35].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.43 to 148.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.53 at 295.72.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 74.68 to
2,031.12, its highest level since it closed at 2,036.31 on May 4
and its biggest one-day advance since a 76.42-point gain on Jan. 4.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,211 up, 333 down and 401 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 247.61 million shares, up from 133.59 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Bail Continued for Guinness Accused</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magistrate Wednesday continued bail until July
11 for former Guinness PLC Chairman Ernest Saunders and five other
men facing charges relating to the British brewing giant's 1986
takeover of Distillers Co.
   Saunders' attorney said he planned to appeal to Britain's high
court over the magistrates court's refusal to grant the fired
executive legal aid.
   Wednesday's court date was set in April in order to speed up the
presentation of the evidence, after the defending lawyers
complained about delays in bringing the Guinness affair to trial.
   The six accused, free on bail equivalent to $915,000, were not
required to appear in court Wednesday, and only Saunders was
present.
   The other accused are former Henry Ansbacher and Co. Ltd.
director Lord Spens; stockbroker Anthony Parnes; Roger Seelig,
former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell and Co. Ltd.;
financier Sir Jack Lyons, and Gerald Ronson, chairman of Heron
International.
   All six are to appear in court on July 11 together with David
Mayhew, senior corporate finance partner at stockbrokers Cazenove
and Co., who has been released on bail separately.
   The prosecution said it has presented details of its evidence to
defense lawyers. But Saunders' attorney, Norman Turner, said the
substantial job of studying the evidence was blocked by Saunders'
inability to pay his defense costs.
   He said this could delay bringing the case to trial.
   Guinness has said its former management under Saunders arranged
for third parties to repurchase the company's stock, apparently to
boost its price illegally and make Guinness' cash-and-stock offer
for Distillers, a gin and whisky maker, more attractive than a
rival bid.
   The defendants face varying charges, including aiding and
abetting a share-support operation, theft and false accounting.

<HEAD>Dry Weather Cited for Commodity Price Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity futures prices have been rising, and analysts are
blaming the recent hot, dry weather in the Midwest.
   ``Weather's the story, that's the whole ball game,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   On Tuesday, advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans,
corn, oats, hogs, pork bellies and platinum propelled the Commodity
Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities to a 5.50-point gain to
248.39 _ the inflation indicator's highest mark since February 1985.
   Meantime, the Agriculture Department reported that prices
farmers got for raw products in May averaged 3.1 percent over April
levels and were 4.7 percent over their mark for the same month last
year.
   ``Higher prices for hogs, oranges, soybeans and broilers were
partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes, onions, milk and
upland cotton,'' the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said.
   May farm commodity prices averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base
used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures. A year
ago the index was 128.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
   But some analysts say if this spring's dry weather turns into a
drought, food-price inflation could go higher.
   Analysts said the buying surges in Tuesday's commodity trading
appeared to hit the markets in domino fashion, beginning with
grains and soybeans.
   Soybean futures opened and closed up the 30-cent-a-bushel limit
allowed for daily trading on the Chicago Board of Trade in response
to the Midwest's hot, dry weekend and predictions for more of the
same.
   The Agriculture Department reported soybean planting was about
74 percent finished as of Sunday. Traders fear a drier-than-normal
summer could lead to tight supplies next year, analysts said.
   Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of
little rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made
that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions.
   Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, for
delivery in July, to within easy striking range of $8 a bushel for
the first time since the spring of 1984.

<NOTE>Eds: Grafs 1-8 new with stocks rising this morning, new reports on
factory orders and construction spending, picks up 10th graf pvs,
It was... Deletes last two grafs to shorten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A rash of good news greeted investors today in the form of a
rejuvenated stock market, reports of steady growth in the economy
and a perception that interest rates may have stopped rising.
   On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average, which on
Tuesday shattered a prolonged post-crash lull by surging nearly 75
points, was up another 13 points by late morning. Broader market
indices also extended gains.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said in Washington that its
chief forecasting gauge of economic activity rose a moderate 0.2
percent in April, signaling solid growth but no danger of recession
this year.
   Economists said the performance of the Index of Leading
Indicators was consistent with their belief that the economy was
headed for its best year since 1984, as smokestack America benefits
from a boom in export sales.
   That strength also was reflected in another Commerce Department
report today that showed orders to U.S. factories rose a strong 1.2
percent in April, the second straight substantial monthly gain. The
strength came in electrical machinery, lumber and wood products and
in petroleum, chemicals and paper.
   A third Commerce Department report showed construction spending
rose 0.1 percent in April, the slowest pace since January. But the
figure masked a big rise in factory investment, which was offset by
a decline in public spending. Industrial construction is now 39.1
percent higher than a year ago.
   In recent weeks the financial markets have interpreted signs of
surging U.S. economic strength as a harbinger of inflation and
rising interest rates, eroding stock and bond prices. But after the
three-day Memorial Day weekend investors seemed to reject that view
and rushed back to buy stocks and bonds.
   The spree pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its
second-biggest gain of 1988. The closely watched blue-chip
barometer climbed 74.68 points Tuesday to 2,031.12 _ the highest
level since it closed at 2,036.31 on May 4.
   It was the biggest one-day advance in the Dow average since a
76.42 point gain on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year, and
the sixth-largest rise ever.
   The rally in the Dow was so strong that a voluntary limit on
computerized program trading was triggered when the average's rise
swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading. But even after
the so-called ``collar'' went into effect for the rest of the day,
the blue-chip average extended its gain.
   New confidence about the near-term outlook for inflation also
pushed interest rates lower and lifted bond prices. The Treasury's
bellwether 30-year bond closed about | point higher, or $6.25 for
every $1,000 in face value, while its yield dropped to 9.23 percent
from 9.31 percent late Friday.
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities, however, rose
in a government auction to the highest level since the October
stock market crash.
   In other economic developments Tuesday:
   =The Agriculture Department reported that prices farmers got for
raw products in May averaged 3.1 percent over April levels and were
4.7 percent over their mark for the same month last year.
   =Contracting for new construction projects declined 6 percent in
April from March, extending a downward slide that began last fall,
according to a survey by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co.
   =The government said foreign purchases of U.S. companies dropped
22 percent to $30.5 billion in 1987, the first dip since 1983 in
the rush by overseas investors to acquire U.S. assets.
   The government reported that new single-family homes sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000 last month, the fastest
pace since new homes sold at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987. It
was the third consecutive increase, coming atop a 1.2 percent rise
in March and an 11.4 percent jump in February.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures opened slightly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, then turned mixed in
early trading.
   Analysts said the opening losses were due to profit-taking after
Tuesday's sharp gains, which saw contracts for future delivery of
soybeans, soybean meal, corn and oats all advance the limit allowed
for daily trading.
   Dry planting conditions last month and fears of a summer drought
in the Midwest are behind the dramatic increase in grain and
soybean futures prices this year.
   The weather outlook for the remainder of the week offered some
straws of hope for farmers, analysts said.
   ``Some light rains are expected Thursday and Friday but they
sure don't look like anything substantial,'' said Dale Gustafson,
an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The Agriculture Department reported Tuesday that U.S. soybean

   The government said today its chief
forecasting gauge of economic activity rose a moderate 0.2 percent
in April in what amounted to a signal of steady economic growth
with no danger of a recession this year.
   The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading Indicators
rose for the third consecutive month, following a revised 0.2
percent March increase and a 1.5 percent February surge, the
biggest gain in more than two years.
   Economists said the performance of the leading index was
entirely consistent with their belief that the economy was headed
for its best year since 1984 as smokestack America benefits from a
boom in export sales.
   ``The rise in the leading indicators indicates the economy is
experiencing continuous expansion based primarily on improving
trade and greater capital investment,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.
   In other good economic news, the Commerce Department said that
orders to U.S. factories rose a strong 1.2 percent in April
following a 1.6 percent March increase.
   The department also reported today that construction spending
edged up 0.1 percent in April as a big jump in investment on new
factories offset a decline in spending on government projects.
   All of this should be good news to Vice President George Bush,
who hopes to benefit from a feeling among voters that the Reagan
administration is managing the economy well.
   The March increase had originally been reported as a much larger
0.8 percent rise. Analysts had expected both the big downward
revision to the March figure and the small increase in April.
   They said the gains reflected a return to more normal economic
activity following a roller-coaster period after the October stock
market crash.
   At one point, the leading index actually fell for three
consecutive months, the traditional signal of an impending
recession. Later revisions, however, showed the index posted big
declines in both November and January, but registered increases in
other months.
   Fears of a recession this year have largely evaporated as the
economy shook off the jolt from the market collapse to turn in
surprisingly strong growth for this advanced stage of a
five-year-old economic recovery.
   The government reported last week that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, raced ahead at an annual
rate of 3.9 percent for the first three months of the year.
   Based on this GNP performance, many economists are now
predicting the GNP will grow at an annual rate of around 3.5
percent for the whole year, which would be the fastest expansion
pace since 1984, also a presidential election year, when the GNP
rose 6.8 percent.
   The 0.2 percent April rise in the leading index reflected
increases in five separate business indicators and declines in four
others.
   The biggest source of strength was a rise in the length of the
average workweek.
   Other sources of strength came from gains in the money supply; a
drop in weekly unemployment claims; a rise in raw materials prices,
which is seen as a positive sign for future economic growth; and an
increase in plant and equipment orders.
   The biggest negative factor was a speed-up in delivery times for
business orders, seen as a sign of weaker demand. This was followed
by a decline in stock prices, a drop in building permits and a drop
in orders for consumer goods.
   The various changes left the index at 192.2 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said he has
boosted his GNP forecast to 3.7 percent for 1988, a far cry from
the recession he had expected in the wake of the stock market
collapse.
   ``A lot of people used to think the stock market was one of the
better indicators of the economy's performance, but it fell on its
face this time,'' he said.
   The administration's official forecast is for GNP growth of 2.9
percent this year, but Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief
economic adviser, said recently that the administration may boost
that assessment when it issues its midterm economic review in
August.
   While the economic strength has caused economists to put away
their recession scenarios for 1988, many analysts still believe
that a downturn is likely sometime in 1989.
   The National Association of Business Economists said last week
that its latest member survey found that 57 percent were looking
for a recession to begin in 1989.
   This pessimistic view is based on a belief that the economic
strength this year will ignite inflationary pressures, leading in
turn to higher interest rates that could topple the country into a
recession. The Federal Reserve already has tightened credit twice
in the past two months in an effort to dampen demand.
   But Michael Penzer, senior economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco, said that was too pessimistic an outlook.
   ``The key is whether the Fed can gradually tighten and slow the
economy down without sending it into a recession,'' he said. ``They
are walking a tightrope, but they may be successful in their
attempt at fine tuning.''

<HEAD>Airline Cuts Atlanta Flights, Restricts Hiring</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT loss figure to $182 million and
CLARIFY that today's cuts were previously announced.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, trying to avoid new layoffs, will
transfer workers and sharply limit hiring this summer, officials of
the financially pressed carrier say.
   The Miami-based airline today cut 29 flights from its southern
hub in Atlanta, cuts that were announced on April 29 as part of
ongoing efforts to reduce costs. Eastern lost $182 million last
year.
   Meanwhile, Eastern this week began stepped-up negotiations under
federal mediation with its largest union, the International
Association of Machinists, and a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association said that union is preparing contract proposals for
proposed talks on amending its contract.
   Over the past two years, Eastern's work force has been cut by
nearly 10,000 to 32,000, but company officials said the 50 airport
workers in Atlanta affected by today's curtailing of routes will be
moved to other jobs.
   ``June is normally a time when we'd be looking for vacation
replacements, so that was a factor,'' Eastern spokesman Robin
Matell said.
   Summer replacement hirings will be limited to nonunion positions
in the reservations or clerical fields, Eastern said.
   Spokeswoman Paula Musto said people laid off earlier may be
recalled to fill in during the summer season.
   The Machinists, representing 12,000 mechanics and other ground
workers, have resisted management calls for sharp cuts in the
salaries of non-mechanics. A federal mediator, who's had the
dispute since January, set two weeks of intense talks beginning
Tuesday.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes last year said the company needed
to cut labor costs by some 30 percent overall.
   Pilots' spokesman Ron Cole said his union, whose contract can be
amended on July 1, won't be offering major concessions.

   The stock market ran up a broad gain today,
following through on Tuesday's strong rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 74.68 points Tuesday
for its second biggest advance this year, rose 9.42 to 2,040.54 by
noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 962 up, 393 down and
448 unchanged.
   Interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit
markets, reducing yields on long-term Treasury bonds to just above
the 9.2 percent level.
   Analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was
prompted in part by talk that the Federal Reserve was eager to
avoid raising its discount rate, despite its other moves of late to
tighten credit.
   Aside from that rationale, many Wall Streeters openly expressed
surprise at the market's sudden show of strength on Tuesday.
   Unexpected as it was, the rally raised hopes that stocks had
pulled out of the slump that had experienced for several weeks.
   The government's report that the index of leading economic
indicators rose 0.2 percent in April was in line with expectations,
and brokers said it had little discernible effect on the market.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up ~ at 113]; American Telephone & Telegraph, up [ at

Paper, up { at 42~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.00 to 149.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.64 at 295.83.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 116.05 million shares at
noontime, against 157.37 million at the same point Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   At the Energy Pool bar in the heart of Tokyo's
business district, office workers worn out by the daily grind are
seeking a solution at the bottom of a bottle _ a tonic bottle.
   A fixture at drugstores and kiosks in commuter stations, tonics
are the kick that refreshes the hard-working Japanese, famous for
toiling long hours and shunning paid holidays.
   Taking a tonic here is not like popping open a cola for
breakfast or sneaking a nip at lunch in the United States. It's
more akin to taking your vitamins.
   But it's in fashion. And besides, some of the tonics are laced
with alcohol, caffeine or nicotine derivatives _ which makes them a
whole lot easier to swallow.
   Whether the drinks are regarded as soft, hard, or somewhere in
between, depends on the kind of punch they pack. Some do contain
vitamins, but none is seriously regarded as an antidote for what
ails you _ despite their advertising claims. And many contain
enough stimulants to worry doctors that the drinks could become
mildly addictive.
   So how do they taste? Well, they vary. Popular now are some
resembling non-sweetened cough syrup, or as one Westerner described
them, Dr. Pepper without the fizz.
   While the content of the drinks is regulated by the government,
few restrictions have been placed on their sale. The strongest
tonics are mostly sold in drugstores; drinks containing alcohol are
required to say so on their labels.
   The Energy Pool bar offers over 180 varieties, ranging in price
from 100 yen (80 cents) to 3,000 yen ($24) and containing such
exotic ingredients as cobra extract or essence of seal.
   Industry sources estimate the market nationwide has swelled to
nearly $1 billion, an increase of 13 percent from 1986. Over half
that figure came from sales of tonics in tiny bottles of 50
milliliters (1.5 fluid ounces) or less, according to Takanori
Fujimoto, spokesman for Takeda Chemical Industries, Japan's largest
drug maker.
   Alinamin V, a vitamin B1 tonic introduced by Takeda Chemical in
March 1987, sold 10 million bottles its first year, Fujimoto said.
``The response was much greater than we expected.''
   In developing Alinamin V, Takeda sought to imitate the success
of Coca Cola, originally a tonic derived from coca leaves, which
revolutionized the beverage industry worldwide.
   Tonic names often suggest medicinal qualities, while catchy
advertising phrases make the drinks out to be something fit for a
samurai warrior going into battle. ``Can you fight for 24 hours?''
asks a commercial for Regain, a drink introduced in April.
   Many workers may be asking themselves the same question. In
Japan, where workers averaged 2,150 work hours for 1986 _ compared
with 1,924 in the United States and 1,655 in West Germany _ six-day
work weeks are common.
   Over 80 percent of 400 Tokyo businessmen polled by the Fukoku
Life Insurance Co. in February were found to suffer work-related
fatigue. Though most said they battled the blahs with sleep, baths
or alcohol, vitamin and tonic drinks were mentioned by over 25
percent _ more than exercise, a healthy diet and sick leave
combined.
   Why tonics? Takeda Chemical's Fujimoto said the current boom in
tonic sales reflects a break with the past.
   ``People now buy the drinks before they get tired, as a kind of
preventative action,'' Fujimoto said. And, though men over the age
of 50 have traditionally made up the bulk of the market, ``Sales
are way up among young office workers, particularly women.''
   Miyako Nakanishi, pharmacist and manager of the Energy Pool,
said tonics claim to cure or alleviate a long list of white-collar
woes _ stomachaches and poor appetite caused by stress, minor colds
brought on by lack of exercise, or hangovers from bouts of
work-related socializing.
   But, according to Ms. Nakanishi, the immediate boost from tonics
is what brings in the customers.
   ``Most of our customers are after instant energy,'' she said.
   As sales grow, however, so do concerns that the drinks may not
be as healthy as their makers claim. Takashi Higuchi, a
physiologist at Fukui Medical College, said the tonics may be good
for their vitamin content, but he wouldn't recommend them highly to
sufferers of fatigue or anything else.
   Ms. Nakanishi admitted the drinks may be habit-forming, but
added, ``They're safe, if consumption is limited to one bottle a
day. Recently some customers have asked specifically for drinks
that don't contain alcohol or caffeine, but most aren't concerned
with long-term effects.''
   After all, most tonic drinkers are lured by the mystique, not
the ingredients.
   ``Businessmen work long hours; they're tired,'' said Hisako
Yoshizawa, a commentator often quoted by Japanese media. ``Often
they don't eat breakfast and they don't care, really, what the
drinks contain.''

<HEAD>Toyota Executive Says Decision On U.S. Firm Is Near</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Co. will decide soon whether to
build a truck plant in the United States, a move that would halt
Japanese truck exports to the American market, a Toyota executive
said.
   Negotiations have ``progressed to a rather considerable extent''
and a decision is expected soon, Tsutomu Oshima, executive vice
president of Toyota, said in an interview in today's Los Angeles
Times.
   Such a move would result in the end of Toyota's truck exports to
the United States, he said. Although he refused to disclose the
export value of Toyota trucks, he said the company sent 280,000
pickup trucks to the United States last year, with an average
retail value of $9,000.
   Sites under consideration for the plant, Oshima said, include
Fremont, Calif., where Toyota operates a joint venture producing
passenger cars with General Motors; Georgetown, Ky., where Toyota
just opened an independent passenger car production plant; or a new
location.
   Start-up costs could eliminate the possiblity of a new location,
Oshima said.
   ``Before the yen started appreciating in value, Japan developed
the (small) pickup market in the United States. Even with a 25
percent tariff, we could sell our trucks at inexpensive prices,''
he said.
   Toyota has been forced to raise its retail truck prices an
average of 26.7 percent since 1985 and the prices ``have become a
burden on the user,'' Oshima said.
   American sales of Toyota trucks totaled about 250,000 in 1987,
down 30,000 from 1986. This year, sales have continued to decline,
Oshima said.

<HEAD>London Shares Finish Up 21.3 Points</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: updates with close.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices jumped Wednesday as the market was
supported by gains on overseas equity markets.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index finished 21.3
points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 1,805.7. Volume was a moderate
440.3 million shares, compared with 367.8 million Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was 11.02 points higher at
2,042.14 when the London session drew to a close.
   Dealers said Wall Street's buoyant activity Tuesday, when the
Dow Jones average jumped 74.68 points, continued to support London
stocks.
   ``There isn't much of a story to the market,'' said Charles
Larkham, an analyst at James Capel and Co., adding that the gains
in London were ``entirely Wall Street's influence.''
   ``If Wall Street has a super bounce, London isn't about to
ignore it,'' Larkham said, explaining that ``it's even a bit
disappointing that the market hasn't gone higher.
   Advances in Tokyo earlier Wednesday also motivated the London
market, analysts said.
   Market watchers said they were anxious to see if the 100-stock
index would remain above the critical 1,800-point barrier over the
next few sessions. If so, a new direction might be established for
the market, several analysts said.

<HEAD>OECD Forecasts Interest Rate Rise for U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates could rise further in the United
States in the coming months, and there is little likelihood of any
easing of rates in West Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said
Wednesday.
   France is the only member of the ``Group of Seven''
industrialized countries where the cost of credit is expected to
decline, the OECD said in the latest issue of its publication
Financial Market Trends.
   The interest rate outlook for Britain is less clear because it
depends on how the government allows the pound to move in relation
to other currencies, the report said.
   The OECD's observation on U.S. rates was made before the U.S.
Federal Reserve tightened credit last week by pressuring up the
overnight rate charged among banks for overnight loans to meet
reserve requirements.
   The OECD said it based its forecast for U.S. rates on concerns
about a pickup of inflationary pressures, strong credit demand and
the country's large trade deficit.
   Total credit demand in the United States is expected to
strengthen over the coming months as the economy's expansion
continues, chiefly due to an anticipated steep rise in corporate
borrowing, the OECD said.
   Turning to Britain, the organization observed that Britain's
trade gap widened sharply in the first quarter. While stemming the
deficit ``would perhaps require bringing the pound to a more
competitive level, implying lower interest rates,'' such a move
would clash with the government's anti-inflation policy, the report
said.
   The OECD predicted all major segments of Japanese financial
markets would remain very active in the coming months, suggesting
that the growing financing needs of the economy ``should be met
without any particular strain on current credit conditions.''
   ``The scope for lower rates remains limited,'' because Japan's
money supply is already expanding at an unprecedented rate, and its
possible inflationary implications are giving rise to concern, the
report said.
   West German interest rates are also unlikely to come down
further because of the strength of overall loan demand and growth
in the money supply that is running ahead of the target rate, the
OECD said.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge set for June 20 a proxy vote
to decide who will control consumer products maker Allegheny
International Inc.
   District Judge Alan Bloch on Tuesday set the date for the
company's annual meeting, at which shareholders will choose between
slates of directors put forth by management and dissident
shareholders.
   The fight to gain control of Allegheny International is being
waged by two New York investment houses that are heavily invested
in AI's preferred stock.
   The investment houses, Spear Leeds & Kellogg and Bomar Holdings,
say the company's managers are trying to entrench themselves while
ignoring shareholder interests. They contend management plans to
appease creditors by giving them large amounts of company stock,
thus diluting the holdings of present stockholders.
   Management says Spear Leeds cannot be trusted to run Allegheny
International and that its candidates have no experience in running
a consumer products company.
   A judge supervising AI's bankruptcy delayed the May 20 proxy
vote. Bloch overruled the bankruptcy judge, but an appeals judge
delayed the meeting again until the full appeals court could
consider the matter.
   Ruling on a narrow legal issue, the appeals court last week
refused to further delay the meeting, but left room open for
further arguments.
   Unsecured creditors wanted to halt the proxy vote, claiming a
change of management would delay the company's emergence from
bankruptcy while the campaign would drain money from the
financially ailing company.
   In rescheduling the meeting, Bloch said the courts should not
``interfere in corporate democracy absent a compelling showing of
need.''
   Allegheny International's best-known products are Sunbeam and
Oster appliances.

   Wells Fargo & Co. said Wednesday it has
completed its purchase of Barclays Bank of California for $125.7
million.
   Wells Fargo reached a tentative agreement on Jan. 15 to buy
Barclays from Barclays Bank PLC in a move to continue its
aggressive retail franchise expansion across California.
   Barclays Bank, a subsidiary of the London-based Barclays group,
said the transaction was consistent with the company's increasing
focus on the corporate rather than retail market.
   Wells Fargo had assets of $44.2 billion at the end of 1987. Its
subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, is the ninth largest bank in the
nation.
   Barclays, which ranked 17th among California banks with $1.3
billion in assets at the end of 1987, said it will continue to
operate in its two corporate banking offices in San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
   Wells Fargo said it will close about 30 branch offices and lay
off 100 of Barclays' 1,100 employees. Most of the 100 Barclays
layoffs, effective on Wednesday, were in administrative positions.

   The stock market rolled up a strong gain today,
following through on Tuesday's sharp rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 74.68 points Tuesday
for its second biggest advance this year, rose 30.40 to 2,061.52 by
3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,114 up, 394
down and 438 unchanged.
   Interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit
markets, reducing yields on long-term Treasury bonds to the 9.1
percent to 9.2 percent level.
   Analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was
prompted in part by talk that the Federal Reserve was eager to
avoid raising its discount rate, despite its other moves of late to
tighten credit.
   Aside from that rationale, many Wall Streeters openly expressed
surprise at the market's sudden show of strength on Tuesday.
   Unexpected as it was, the rally raised hopes that stocks had
pulled out of the slump that had experienced for several weeks.
   The government's report that the index of leading economic
indicators rose 0.2 percent in April was in line with expectations,
and brokers said it had little discernible effect on the market.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1] at 113~; American Telephone & Telegraph, up { at
27|; Merck, up 2[ at 55{; Ford Motor, up ~ at 49, and General
Electric, up \ at 42\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.92 to 149.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 3.23 at 297.42.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 190.35 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Grain futures closed lower Wednesday amid steady
profit-taking on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans finished
mixed.
   Traders who had bought into Tuesday's limit gains turned sellers
as meteorologists predicted scattered light rain in the Grain Belt
over the next few days, analysts said.
   ``We picked up better chances for rain in the eastern Corn Belt,
but there's not a lot of moisture anticipated,'' said Jerry Gidel,
an analyst in Chicago with G.H. Miller & Co.
   The bullish interest in near-month soybean contracts remained
strong. The price for July delivery of soybeans surpassed $8 a
bushel, the highest price for a nearby soybean contract in more
than four years.
   Gidel said soybean contracts for 1988 delivery also got a boost
from reports that Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng had said he
would not authorize increased soybean acreage this year. The
Agriculture Department confirmed the reports.
   The USDA reported Tuesday U.S. soybean planting was about 74
percent complete as of Sunday. The USDA reported most of the corn
crop in good to fair condition and most of the maturing winter
wheat crop remained in fair shape.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.47{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 3\ cents lower with July at $2.21 a bushel; oats were 2} cents
to 3} cents lower with July at $1.78} a bushel; soybeans were 9{
cents lower to 4{ cents higher with July at $8.02{ a bushel.

   Oil prices edged higher in listless trading
Wednesday as traders mostly stayed on the sidelines, awaiting the
upcoming ministerial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Contracts for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, closed up 7 cents at $17.58 per 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among July contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded
gasoline rose 0.28 cent to 51.74 cents a gallon, while wholesale
heating oil rose 0.13 cent a gallon to 47.31 cents.
   ``It was another one of those dull, dull days,'' said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures
Inc.
   He said the market showed no reaction to reports that the start
of OPEC's regular summer meeting had been postponed by three days _
to June 11 _ because of an apparent scheduling conflict with
another event.
   Traders have been reluctant to commit themselves in the market
until they get some idea of how the meeting turns out, Beutel added.
   Representatives of the cartel's 13 members are expected to make
another attempt at negotiating a package of production cutbacks in
order to support prices.

<HEAD>Boston Edison Launches Energy Cooperative That Relies on Peer
Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kind of socialism is being tried by a group of
Boston Edison Co.'s biggest commercial customers that have agreed
to cooperate with each other to ease energy consumption.
   Under a year-long trial that began Wednesday, 10 Boston Edison
customers will work together to decide which should forfeit some
electrical power during peak demand periods. They might do this by,
for example, shutting off a bank of elevators or turning off the
hot water for a few hours.
   As a result the utility estimates it could save 10 megawatts, or
enough to meet a year's electrical needs in 5,000 homes.
   Boston Edison has 640,000 residential and business customers in
40 cities and towns within a 30-mile radius of Boston.
   In addition to cutting back their electricity bill, the members
of the Northeast Energy Cooperative, as the group is called, will
be paid as if they are electricity providers. That's not new,
however.
   What is different is that the arrangement combines peer pressure
and altruism to save money and energy. To reinforce the cooperative
spirit, each member of the group will be ``graded'' by the other
members.
   If successful, the experiment will generate long-term contracts
and more companies will be invited to join the cooperative.
   The cooperative will be headed for its first year by John
Phillips, a former engineer who heads the non-profit California
Energy Coalition, which runs eight such utility cooperatives.
   ``The era of building (power) plants is over and the time for
better utilization of resources is here,'' he said at a news
conference explaining the cooperative plan, which he said also is
being used on New York's Long Island.
   A self-described arch-conservative, Phillips said in an
interview later that he has explained the dea to visiting planners
from the Soviet Union and Sweden. He said they all found the notion
novel.
   ``What we have here is ... a democratic society in a more
socialist environment,'' he said. ``You can't force people to do
things.''
   Bernard Reznicek, president of Boston Edison, said the
experiment is an attempt to deal with changes in demand for power.
   ``We have been an industry in a supply side mentality. That
strategy has been a high-cost strategy,'' he said. ``Intelligent
people stop and take a look and say there has to be a better way.''

<HEAD>Fina Hopes To Fuel Distributors' Initiative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fina Oil and Chemical Co. has unveiled an
incentive plan in its 22-state gasoline distribution network that
will give independent distributors as much as $35,000 annually in
retirement benefits.
   Under the plan, which analysts say is unprecedented in the
industry, distributors who buy at least 2 million gallons of fuel
annually can receive retirement benefits of $10,000 per year. Those
who purchase 30 million gallons per year or more can be eligible to
receive up to $35,000 per year in benefits.
   The benefits accrue to the owners of the Fina distributorships
or to the employees they designate, officials said Tuesday.
   ``This will motivate our jobbers to do a better job for
themselves as well as for Fina,'' said Stuart Pearman, Fina's vice
president of marketing and developer of the plan.
   Analysts said the move also will help the company polish the
outdated image of some locations and upgrade a retail network that
includes gas stations in Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas in the Midwest
and in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona in the Southwest.
   ``I think it benefits the company and the dealers,'' Mary Anne
Sudol, investment analyst with Fitch Investors Service in New York,
told the Dallas Times Herald.
   She called the retirement plan an imaginative ``carrot-and-stick
approach'' that will require distributors to improve the quality of
their stations to take advantage of the retirement program.
   The retirement program, which began Wednesday and runs through
May 1993, is provided at no cost to the distributors, although they
must meet certain company-imposed requirements. Fina, a unit of
Dallas-based American Petrofina, has about 4,000 service stations
nationwide.
   To be eligible, distributors must buy at least 2 million gallons
of gasoline or other refined products annually from the parent
company and reinvest available building funds in accordance with
Fina's ongoing building program.
   Retirement fund participants also are required to increase their
fuel purchases by at least 5 percent through May 31, 1989. Similar
annual requirements must be met for distributors to continue in the
program until its expiration on May 31, 1993.
   All of Fina's 460 distributors who own or operate about 3,850
stations in 22 states are eligible for the program, Pearman said.
   Pearman said the program is being financed through several
insurance companies and other lenders and that Fina may decide to
continue the program after the initial five-year period.
   The retirement benefits are guaranteed for the qualified
participant for life and are payable starting June 1, 1998, but not
before the participant reaches 65.

   If you've been hearing for weeks about the
post-crash stock market's malaise, you're probably wondering what
has sent prices surging higher so suddenly. Welcome to the crowd.
   Seasoned market watchers expressed surprise at the buying spree
following the long Memorial Day weekend that sent the languishing
Dow Jones industrial average up more than 100 points in two days.
   It soared nearly 75 points Tuesday, the biggest one-day rise
since the beginning of the year, and tacked on 33 more on Wednesday.
   Many analysts said the rally once again proved the adage that
you cannot outguess the market. But some veteran economists warned
that they saw no development that should so radically improve Wall
Street's gloomy outlook for inflation and higher interest rates.
   Evidence of rising inflation persists, from the Chicago
commodity pits to the neighborhood grocery checkout. Strains on
America's productive abilities, coupled with fears of a profound
farm drought this summer, are intensifying upward pressure on
prices.
   ``There's only one way to start writing this story: `Once upon a
time ...,''' Robert Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York, said in response to the stock market's
abrupt surge. ``It's a bit of a fairy tale out there.''
   Explanations for the turnaround included speculation that the
Federal Reserve will not tighten credit further, a realization that
the economy is healthy, and a post-holiday tendency to buy stocks.
   Some economists said the market's reversal confirmed their view
that inflation is not a big problem.
   A few even suggested President Reagan's performance at the
Moscow summit injected a euphoric mood into the market that hasn't
been seen since last summer, well before the stunning collapse of
Oct. 19.
   But others said they simply did not know why the market had
reversed course.
   ``It's a very good question,'' said Robert Stovall, a New
York-based stock market forecaster. ``The serenity could be
short-lived. Everything that's happened has been given a positive
bias or ignored.''
   Some economists who scrutinize the links between markets were
disturbed by Wall Street's big gain, partly because it defied a
logical pattern that had developed between stocks, bonds and
commodity prices.
   In that relationship, when commodity prices rise, bonds fall
over the consequent fear of inflation and depress stocks as well.
But on Tuesday, commodity prices jumped _ while stocks and bonds
also rose.
   ``On balance, what's going on with the stock and bond markets
does not ring true,'' Brusca said. ``The trap door is going to open
up again and suck everybody down.''
   Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in
New York, speculated the Wall Street rally reflected growing
investor hopes of no further moves to tighten credit by the Federal
Reserve. He said rising commodity prices were based on fear of
drought, not a broad inflationary move.
   ``In that environment, inflation fears subside and the market
can do a bit better,'' Moran said.
   The Fed already has moved a few times this year to nudge
interest rates higher through its control of the amount of money in
the banking system. There had been speculation last week that the
Fed would take a more drastic step by announcing an increase in the
discount rate, the loan fee it charges financial institutions. The
rate has remained at 6 percent since Sept. 4.
   Some market watchers said it was pointless to speculate about
the short-term ups and downs of stock prices because meaningful
trends can only be detected over a long period.
   Robert Sobel, a Wall Street historian and professor who has
written several books on the market, said he would advise investors
to ignore most economists' predictions of stock behavior because
they are so unreliable.
   ``They'd be better off using Nancy Reagan's astrologist,'' Sobel
said. ``I think these people are vastly overpaid. They don't know
what they're doing most of the time.''

   Armtek Corp. has completed the sale of
its Armstrong Tire Co. and other assets to the Pirelli Group of
Italy for $197 million, said Armtek chairman Frank R. O'Keefe Jr.
   The sale gives the company the ability to focus on its other
businesses, O'Keefe said. They are Blackstone, a manufacturer of
heat exchange components; Copolymer Rubber and Chemical Corp., and
Dayco Products Inc., a maker of automotive belts and hoses.
   Pirelli plans to make a three-year investment of $100 million in
improving overall quality and creating new production capacity for
Pirelli passenger car tires in the United States, Daniel Cutrone,
director of marketing for Armstrong, said Tuesday.
   Capital expenditures are also planned for Armstrong products.
   The sale includes Armstrong Tire production facilities in Des
Moines, Iowa; Nashville, Tenn., and Hanford, Calif.; the Extruded
Products business in Little Rock, Ark., and the headquarters
building in New Haven..
   Armtek headquarters staff will remain in the New Haven building
at least temporarily, Cutrone said.
   Pirelli sought last year to acquire 80 percent of Armstrong
Tire, but the talks ended after the two companies could not agree
on the value of the proposed buyout.
   Pirelli recently lost out to Japan's Bridgestone Corp. in a bid
to purchase Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German fugitive accused of defrauding
Volkswagen of more than $280 million will be escorted home Friday
by federal German police, U.S. authorities said Wednesday.
   Hans Joachim Schmidt, 38, a former currency trader from
Frankfurt, has exhausted his extradition appeals, said Jim Sanders
of the U.S. Attorney's Office.
   In the warrant for Schmidt's arrest and the extradition request,
he is charged with forgery of documents and instigation of
embezzlement in a scheme in which employees of Volkswagenwerk AG
were persuaded to enter into foreign currency transactions as part
of a secret profit-sharing agreement.
   Schmidt was arrested on a fugitive warrant in November 1987 at
his Hollywood apartment, where he was living under an assumed name.
   A special team of West German federal police was created a year
ago to hunt for Schmidt, who fled in March 1987 after the discovery
of alleged fraudulent foreign exchange deals that cost Volkswagen
about $282.4 million.
   Volkswagen said it first discovered the fraud when the National
Bank of Hungary refused to honor a contract calling on it to buy
dollars from Volkswagen.
   While he was a fugitive, Schmidt traveled through Switzerland,
several southern European countries and the Caribbean, West German
police said.
   Prosecutors in the northern West German city of Braunschweig
have alleged that Schmidt and several former Volkswagen employees
defrauded the giant automaker by falsifying financial instruments
known as forward contracts.
   Such contracts are used by large international companies like
Volkswaggen to protect themselves from currency fluctuations.
   Schmidt is accused of putting profits from the currency exchange
deals into secret bank accounts in Switzerland and Lichtenstein.

   Mazda Motor Corp. has added a second
production shift as scheduled at its U.S. assembly plant in Flat
Rock, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
   The 1,300-worker second shift began work Tuesday, boosting
monthly production of Ford Probe and Mazda MX-6 coupes to 13,000
cars a month in June from 9,600 a month in May, spokesman Atsuo
Katada said.
   The $550 million plant employs 2,600 hourly workers and 550
salaried workers on two shifts. When it reaches full production in
August, it will be building 240,000 cars a year.
   The plant began production in September. More than 60 percent of
its production is devoted to the Probe, which is sold through Ford
dealers exclusively and has attracted so many dealer orders it is
sold out through October.
   Katada said Mazda has no plans to expand the factory or increase
its annual capacity beyond 240,000 vehicles despite Japanese
newspaper reports that it will build 300,000 cars a year there.

<TEXT>
   One of the largest investors in the
Seabrook nuclear power plant decided Wednesday to start withdrawing
from the troubled project by stopping payments.
   ``Our many successes have been hidden by the shadow of
Seabrook,'' said Gary L. Hunt, general manager of the Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., after the vote by the eight
directors.
   ``This is not a bailout of MMWEC or of individual towns,'' he
said. ``It will enable MMWEC to get on with its business.''
   The Massachusetts utility supplies power to 34 municipal
electric departments across the state. Its shares in Seabrook were
bought on behalf of 28 systems in Massachusetts and eight in other
Northeastern states, and the investors together owned an 11.6
percent share of Seabrook.
   The utility has sunk $875 million so far into the stalled plant.
The $5.4 billion reactor is completed, but lacks approved
evacuation plans required for commercial operation. The largest
investor in the project, Public Service Company of New Hampshire,
has filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy
laws.
   Hunt said the board approved his recommendation to withhold the
June 1 payment toward the construction and maintenance of the power
project, but will continue paying off the bonds issued for its
share in the nuclear power plant.

   Construction on a $31 million expansion
project at Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA is expected to get
under way in July, company officials said.
   The expansions are to provide for assembly of Sentra engines and
rear truck axles and production of plastic parts for bumpers,
according to a report published Wednesday in the Nashville Banner.
The project is not expected to create many new jobs, Nissan
officials said.
   ``The major part of the engine assembly will be in existing
space in the plant. Adjacent to that, we're adding 7,500 square
feet,'' said Emil Hassan, Nissan vice president and director of
plant and process engineering.
   Once the engine assembly line is complete next spring, plans
call for the line to start piecing together engines at a rate of
about 145,000 a year after a short break-in phase, he said.
   Initial production, testing and ``de-bugging'' of the assembly
line should take place about May 1989.
   Later plans call for adding a second passenger car line, which
would increase the plant's capacity from 265,000 vehicles per year
to 400,000. That expansion will require a larger work force,
officials said.
   Engines for Sentras are currently made by Nissan in Mexico and
Japan; axles in Japan; and the bumper parts by Decoma Plastics, a
subsidiary of Magna International in Canada.
   The Smyrna facility now makes small pickup trucks and Sentra
passenger cars.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission decided
Wednesday to give securities industry officials a month to press
their objections to a proposal aimed at protecting investors'
option to sue their brokers.
   The commission had been scheduled to vote to ask Congress to
pass a law barring brokerage firms from requiring customers to
agree in advance to submit disputes to stock exchange-sponsored
arbitration panels.
   But the vote was postponed after commissioners Charles Cox,
Edward Fleischman and Joseph Grundfest said the matter required
more deliberation. Commissioners agreed to decide the matter during
the first week of July, before one of the advocates of the change,
Aulana Peters, leaves the commission.
   Peters and SEC Chairman David Ruder argued it was unfair to
require investors to give up the right to sue before they have any
idea of the nature or size of a dispute that may later arise.
Peters and Ruder also said that providing an alternative to
arbitration will serve as an incentive to keeping the system fair.
   Cox said he was inclined to support Ruder and Peters but wanted
to give the brokerage firms a chance to argue their case.
   A survey by the SEC staff of 65 firms, handling 90 percent of
all customer accounts, showed that virtually all require customers
to arbitrate disputes, particularly customers who borrow money
through margin accounts or trade in stock options.
   The North American Securities Administrators Association, a
group of state regulators, has been pressing to do away with
mandatory arbitration clauses. Staff members of the finance
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are working
on an arbitration bill that would, among other things, forbid
forced arbitration.
   However, the Securities Industry Association, representing
brokerage firms, says it is unfair to dictate to brokers how they
must do business and that it makes little sense to force cases on
an overburdened and costly court system.

<HEAD>Silver Futures Soar On Labor Problems At Peruvian Mine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices soared to 4{-month highs Wednesday after a
Peruvian silver mine indicated it may not able to meet its delivery
schedule because of a miners' strike.
   On other markets, other precious metals advanced; frozen pork
bellies posted limit gains for the second consecutive day while
livestock futures were mixed; sugar, bond and stock-index futures
rose sharply; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and energy
futures were mixed.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose
1.46 points to 249.85 as 10 components gained, seven declined and
four ended mixed.
   Late Tuesday, one of Peru's larger silver mines said it could
not be held responsible for failure to fulfill its contractual
obligations for silver delivery because of a strike.
   The news gave the silver market the push it needed to overcome
technical resistance and begin catching up with the surging
platinumn market, analysts said.
   ``I think the market was primed for any kind of even mildly
bullish fundamental news and they got it last night,'' said Richard
Levine, vice president of Elders Futures Inc.'s precious metals and
foreign exchange group.
   Peru is a major silver-producing country but the effective
shutdown of a single mine hardly qualifies as a major disruption in
the pipeline, Levine said.
   Rather, he said, Wednesday's announcement ``instigated a
long-overdue rally so silver could catch up with platinum,'' which
has risen in recent weeks to its highest price since October.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver settled 21.3 to
21.8 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $6.865
a troy ounce; gold was $1.80 to $2.60 higher with August at $462.40
a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled
$4.20 to $13 higher with July at $622.90 a troy ounce.
   Pork belly futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange for the second day in a row due to technical factors and
expectations of a continuing seasonal decline in hog slaughters,
analysts said.
   ``Basically, the game in the bellies today was the fact they
couldn't press (prices) lower,'' said Dale Durchholz, an analyst
with AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill. ``Then the fresh
bellies took a nice pop, $1 to $2 (per hundredweight), and that
really fueled the strength in the belly pits late in the day.''
   The contract for March delivery gained 2 cents a pound, the
limit allowed for daily trading. Hog and cattle futures finished
mixed.
   Live cattle settled .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June
at 72.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .07 cent
higher with August at 76.22 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with June at 54.50 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .78 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 57.60 cents a
pound.
   World sugar futures rallied sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar
& Cocoa Exchange on reports of a large swap-type purchase by the
Soviet Union and indications the Soviets were seeking more,
analysts said.
   Sugar for July delivery settled .49 cent higher at 9.96 cents a
pound.
   Interest-rate futures surged on the Chicago Board of Trade,
indicating expectations of smaller yields on U.S. Treasury bonds.
   Frederick Sturm, senior economist with Chicago-based Kleinwort
Benson Government Securities Inc., said the rally could mean that
fears of higher interest rates have peaked.
   The contract for June delivery of the 20-year Treasury bond
settled 1 23-32 points higher at 87 17-32.
   Stock-index futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 3.90 points higher at 266.85.
   Grain futures settled lower amid steady profit-taking on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans finished mixed.
   Traders who had bought into Tuesday's limit gains turned sellers
as meteorologists predicted scattered light rain in the Grain Belt
over the next few days, analysts said.
   The bullish interest in near-month soybean contracts remained
strong. The price for July delivery of soybeans surpassed $8 a
bushel, the highest price for a nearby soybean contract in more
than four years.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 7 cents lower with July at $3.47} a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4} cents lower with July at $2.20} a
bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3\ cents lower with July at $1.79\ a
bushel; soybeans were 7{ cents lower to 3} cents higher with July
at $8.01} a bushel.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in listless trading ahead of an upcoming meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .11 cent lower to .07
cent higher with July at $17.58 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent
to .19 cent lower to .28 cent higher with July at 51.74 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>Combustion Engineering Agrees To Second Deal With Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Combustion Engineering Inc. announced in
Moscow Wednesday that it had reached an agreement to help build and
manage a multibillion-dollar petrochemical complex in two Western
Siberian cities.
   This is the Stamford-based company's second deal with the Soviet
Union in the last six months.
   In November, the company announced the first Soviet-American
joint venture established under the Soviet Union's new policy
allowing Western concerns to own a share of Soviet industries.
   Charles Hugel, president and chief executive officer of
Combustion Engineering, said engineering and site preparation in
the cities of Tobolsk and Surgut probably would begin later this
year.
   ``These two complexes will probably be the largest created in
the world,'' Hugel said.
   Analysts applauded Wednesday's announcement.
   ``I'm pleased, but it is too early to tell what the full impact
will be on Combustion Engineering's financial statements,'' said
Candice Eggerss, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. ``I
think it has the potential for being a very big market, but because
of the lack of a track record (in Soviet Union joint ventures),
it's hard to know now.
   ``They've put a very small amount of capital at risk for large
potential rewards in the future,'' she added.
   The plants will produce synthetic rubber and plastics for
consumer goods, he said. The Western Siberia site was chosen
because of its abundance of natural gas, he said.
   Hugel said he met with Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov last
week about the project, and ``Mr. Ryzhkov would like to see the
first plant completed by the end of 1991 or early 1992, and all of
it done by 1995. That's a very ambitious schedule but it's the
schedule we are committed to.''
   Ryzhkov's involvement in the project reflected the attention
that high-level officials are giving to improving the supply of
consumer goods as part of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
effort to restructure the Soviet economy.
   Gorbachev has promised that his reforms will lead to an
improvement in supplies of goods and services to consumers who
struggle with a system of shortages and shoddy quality.
   ``There appears to be unusual urgency to get this project under
way,'' Hugel said. ``In the last several months it obviously has
become much more important, and the need to get on with it has been
made clear by Soviet officials.''
   Hugel said the project is worth ``many billions of dollars,''
but he could not give exact figure. He said its much bigger than a
joint venture to build a pair of plastics factories in the Soviet
Ukraine announced April 13 by Occidential Petroleum Co. Occidental
estimated the value of its project at $200 million.
   Combustion Engineering will lead a consortium that also will
include McDermott International, the Japanese firms Mitsubishi and
Mitsui, and the USSR Ministry of Oil Refining and Petrochemical
Industries.
   Tobolsk is located about 1,100 miles east of Moscow. Surgut is
located about 270 miles to the northeast of Tobolsk.
   The Western companies will receive payments in convertible
currency for their design, engineering, and construction work, and
then will be invited to participate in a joint venture that
actually will manufacture the petrochemicals, Hugel said.
   The Soviet ruble is not convertible, making it difficult for
foreign companies to export profits. But the Soviet Union earns
much of its hard currency through sales of oil and natural gas and
certain ministries recently have been given the right to use hard
currency as an incentive to attract foreign companies into joint
ventures.
   The plastics will be made both for Soviet domestic use and for
export. Officials said the percentage to be exported has not been
determined, but that most of the plastics may go to the domestic
market if Gorbachev's effort to stimulate consumer products is
successful.
   Combustion Engineering provides equipment and services for the
power and process industries, such as paper mills and oil
refineries. The company reported sales in 1987 of about $3 billion.

   A post-holiday rally in the U.S. financial
markets sustained the dollar's strength in foreign exchange
Wednesday despite a slight dip in early Japanese trading.
   Gold prices also continued to climb. Republic National Bank said
gold bullion was bid at $457.50 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$454.30 late Tuesday. The price has moved up $6.50 over the past
two days.
   Currency traders said the dollar was benefiting from the
surprising rush of bullishness that has infected the American stock
and bond markets since investors returned from the long Memorial
Day weekend.
   Stocks and bonds moved up strongly again Wednesday for the
second consecutive day.
   Traders said investors appeared sanguine about the level of U.S.
interest rates and the pace of economic growth and were jumping
into equities and bonds to snap up bargains. The strength of the
U.S. currency mirrored the investors' new-found confidence in the
American markets.
   ``The sentiment has been so bearish for the dollar, most money
has been on the sidelines,'' observed Ronald Holzer, chief dealer
for Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago. ``I think we're seeing
the first realization of fresh money moving back into the U.S.''
   Holzer said currency traders were restructuring their positions
in light of the sudden shift of capital into American stocks and
bonds.
   But he cautioned, ``The longevity of this thing is uncertain.''
   The dollar weakened during morning trading in Tokyo, where the
business day begins, after Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
told reporters he thought a long-term rise in the dollar unlikely.
   But the dollar soon recovered, closing in Tokyo at 125.23
Japanese yen, up from 124.80 yen on Tuesday. In later trading, the
dollar traded at 125.25 yen in London and 125.425 yen in New York,
compared with 125.235 late Tuesday.
   The British pound continued to weaken against the dollar and
West German mark. In London, it cost $1.8220 to buy one pound,
compared with $1.8385 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound fetched
$1.81335, compared with $1.8353 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7308 West German marks, down from
1.73265; 1.44345 Swiss francs, down from 1.44525; 1.23035 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2333; 5.8425 French francs, up from 5.8300;
and 1,286.62 Italian lire, up from 1,284.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.7255 West German marks, down from 1.7292;
1.4390 Swiss francs, down from 1.4437; 5.8270 French francs, up
from 5.8215; 1.9330 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9333; 1,282.50
Italian lire, up from 1,279.95; and 1.2319 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2357.
   Gold, still riding the coattails of the recent strong move in
platinum, rose in London to a late bid price of $456.50 a troy
ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $454.80. Gold was higher in
Zurich as well, closing at a bid $457, compared with $455 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid $458.55, up from
$455.80.
   At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery was quoted at $457.60 a troy ounce, up from $455 a troy
ounce late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.79 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $6.65.
   On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at
$6.818 a troy ounce, up from $6.600 late Tuesday.
   Jeffrey Nichols of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc. said
that while the metals rally reflected some lingering inflation
fears in the commodities markets, it also was a sign of relief
among investors who had been expecting further interest rates hikes
by the Federal Reserve.

<TEXT>
   Having taken his potshots at the White House,
former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan is now zinging Merrill Lynch
& Co., the giant investment firm he headed during its rapid growth
in the 1970s.
   In the June 20 issue of Fortune magazine, Regan blasts the
current management at Merrill Lynch and suggests the company be
taken over.
   ``How long does it take to get your act together?'' Regan asked.
``You guys have had over three years.''
   The three-year period refers to William A. Schreyer's tenure as
chief executive of the firm. Schreyer added the job of Merrill
Lynch chairman to that of chief executive in June 1984, succeeding
Roger Birk, who had followed Regan in the top job.
   Merrill Lynch said Wednesday it was surprised and disappointed
by some of the statements attributed to Regan.
   ``Perhaps they reflect the fact that (Regan has) been away from
business for eight years _ a period marked by dramatic and complex
changes,'' Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager said. ``We believe
Merrill Lynch is well positioned for the near- and long-term
future.''
   Regan quit Merrill Lynch to take the Treasury post in 1980 and
became White House chief of staff in 1985. He left the Reagan
administration last year and recently published a book highly
critical of President Reagan and his wife, Nancy.
   Now head of Regdon & Associates, an investment firm based in
Alexandria, Va., Regan asserts in the Fortune article that Merrill
Lynch's costs went out of control under Birk.
   ``Some of the people under Roger got a little too headstrong and
a little fat and lazy,'' Regan said. ``Merrill was not exactly run
in a spartan manner. Eventually costs became a problem. They
(maagement) got too used to limousines and perks.''
   As for Merrill Lynch's direction under Schreyer, Regan takes
issue with management's approach of investing for the long term.
   ``You don't have the luxury of the long term,'' he said. ``It's
a cold, cruel world out there. After all, would Merrill recommend
to its customers that they buy the securities of a company whose
business isn't improving?''
   As with its Wall Street competitors, Merrill Lynch has been
buffeted by heightened competition in financial services and the
aftermath of the stock market crash. Its first quarter profit of
$68.3 million was off 37 percent from a year earlier, while its
1987 earnings of $390.6 million dropped 14 percent from 1986.
   Regan argued that Merrill Lynch should be taken over by a
commercial bank or some other big financial services company to
cope if deregulation ever allows banks to compete in the brokerage
business.
   ``It would give the firm a hell of a competitive edge in
servicing the full range of corporations' financial needs,'' he
asserted. ``Merrill is not smart enough to start lending money de
novo.''
   Regan cited Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and General Motors
Acceptance Corp., the automaker's financial arm, as prospective
buyers.
   ``Our strategy has been to build our capital base from within
through steady growth and selected acquisitions, and that remains
our strategy,'' Merrill Lynch's Yager said.

   R.C. Bigelow Inc., a maker of herbal
teas, said Wednesday it filed a lawsuit seeking to block Thomas J.
Lipton Inc.'s acquisition of Kraft Inc.'s herbal tea subsidiary on
grounds the merger would violate federal antitrust laws.
   In its complaint, filed last week in U.S. District Court in New
Haven, Norwalk-based Bigelow claimed Lipton's acquisition of
Kraft's Celestial Seasonings division would join the nation's two
largest sellers of herbal tea, leaving Lipton in control of about
82 percent of the U.S. herbal tea market.
   Bigelow also claimed Lipton agreed to pay a bonus price for
Celestial Seasonings in order to acquire a monopoly, said Paul
Windels Jr., a lawyer for Bigelow.
   U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes on Tuesday entered a
temporary restraining order delaying the acquisition until a
hearing on Bigelow's complaint could be held June 10.
   Bigelow was established in 1945 by Ruth C. Bigelow, who
developed the recipe for an herb-flavored tea known as Constant
Comment. The company is now owned by family members.
   Bigelow introduced its line of herbal teas, containing no tea
but herbs and spices, in 1979 and ranks third in the herbal tea
market with about a 13 percent share, the company said.
   A call to Lipton's legal department seeking comment on the
lawsuit was not returned Wednesday.
   A Kraft spokesman, Scott Horne, said, ``We remain optimistic
about the deal and we intend to close the transaction as soon as
possible.,''
   Lipton, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., is owned by the
Dutch-English company Unilever Group.
   It markets Lipton and Oriental Treasures herbal teas and is the
dominant company in traditional black teas with more than 50
percent of the U.S. market.
   Celestial Seasonings, purchased by Kraft in 1984, accounts for
more than half of U.S. herbal tea sales, according to Bigelow.
Kraft, based in Glenview, Ill., had sales of $9.9 billion in 1987,
Horne said.
   The proposed sale of Celestial Seasoings was announced in
December 1987. The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the
proposed sale, Horne said.

   A woman who died of lung cancer after
smoking for 40 years knew the risks but chose to smoke anyway, a
tobacco company lawyer said Wednesday as final arguments began in
the product liability trial of three cigarette manufacturers.
   The companies are charged with misleading the public about the
dangers of cigarettes and contributing to the 1984 death of Rose
Cipollone, 58.
   Defense summations came exactly four months after the case
opened in federal court with a lawyer for widower Antonio Cipollone
outlining the case against Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and
Philip Morris Co.
   The case rests on ``the simple proposition that if you believe
the testimony of Rose Cipollone and her family, that she smoked
cigarettes because she wanted to and because she liked to, even
though she knew the risks,'' then the jury ``should return a
verdict for Liggett and Myers,'' said Donald J. Cohn, an attorney
for Liggett.
   ``Mrs. Cipollone enjoyed smoking, and that was why she continued
to smoke, and she didn't want anyone to tell her not to do it,'' he
said.
   Cohn reviewed testimony by Mrs. Cipollone's relatives, including
her brother, Thomas DeFrancesco, who said their mother blamed their
father's death on smoking.
   ``The point is, before Mrs. Cipollone even started smoking, she
was hearing these kinds of stories from her mother,'' Cohn said.
   Shortly after Mrs. Cipollone met her husband-to-be, she told him
``she had a bad habit'' _ smoking, Cohn said of Cipollone's own
testimony on the stand.
   ``She knew what she was doing, she knew what she was saying. She
was an intelligent, strong-minded person,'' Cohn said, noting that
Mrs. Cipollone took a job over her husband's objections.
   Mrs. Cipollone knew that other family members had quit cold
turkey and that she was able to control her habit, not smoking in
the bedroom, at dinner or on the job, said Cohn. ``The point is,
she did not want to'' quit, he said.
   Cohn, in his 3{-hour summation, asserted that cigarettes are not
a proven cancer cause, and said controversy on the issue still
rages.
   ``It's a free country. People have a right to express their
opinion, based on the evidence,'' Cohn said. ``It's their First
Amendment right, and corporations have the right too.''
   Closing arguments for the other companies' attorneys were
scheduled for Thursday.
   Cipollone charges that the companies, through inadequate
research and a failure to publicize what they did know about the
dangers of smoking, should be held liable for damages in his wife's
death.
   About 150 spectators, including lawyers, financial analysts,
reporters and others packed the courtroom for final arguments.
   If the jury decides for Cipollone and awards him damages, it
would be the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay
liability claims brought by smokers and their families.
   The lawsuit, filed in 1983, is one of fewer than a dozen by
smokers or their relatives to reach a jury.
   A Cipollone victory could spur similar lawsuits, some lawyers
say. Their tobacco industry opponents argue that a defeat for
Cipollone could perhaps stifle for good such lawsuits because of
the effort, time and expense.
   Anti-smoking advocates and lawyers have already hailed the
Cipollone case as a victory of sorts because of the unprecedented
look into the inner workings of the industry through a wealth of
confidential documents introduced into evidence by Cipollone's
lawyers.
   Anti-tobacco litigators say these documents will help them in
future lawsuits. Health groups said the revelations have already
spurred members of Congress to step up legislative action limiting
the tobacco industry.
   For example, an industry trade group executive wrote in a 1972
memorandum that the defense against critics of smoking included
``creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying
it.'' Tobacco company lawyers have denied such a strategy.
   Through a series of pre-trial rulings and a major decision last
month by the trial judge, H. Lee Sarokin, most of Cipollone's
claims were cut from his lawsuit.
   Essentially, the jury in the civil case must decide two types of
claims against all three companies, and two specifically against
Liggett.
   They must determine whether each company intentionally
misrepresented claims about the health consequences of smoking and
whether each conspired to do so. As for Liggett, the jury will
consider claims under state liability laws _ whether the company
failed to warn the public about the risks of its products, and
whether Liggett violated its warranty duties.
   Mrs. Cipollone smoked Liggett's cigarettes before 1966, the year
warnings were put on cigarette packs, which the courts have said
pre-empted failure-to-warn claims after that year.
   Both sides presented two dozen witnesses, including top tobacco
company executives, company researchers, physicians, medical
experts, advertising and marketing experts and Cipollone family
members.
   Cipollone, 64, in his testimony, tearfully described the
progression of his wife's lung cancer and their final moments
together in the hospital where she died.
   The jury also heard pre-trial testimony from Mrs. Cipollone, who
spoke of her infatuation with cigarette-smoking movie stars and
desperate fear of illness caused by cigarettes.

   Burlington Northern Inc. suspended trading late
Wednesday on both the Midwestern and Pacific stock exchanges
pending what the company described as a significant announcement.
   Company spokesman Howard Kallio declined late Wednesday to
elaborate, saying company officials planned a statement Thursday
morning.
   However, Kallio did say the announcement would not specifically
involve Winona Bridge Railway Co., a tiny subsidiary that BN
planned to use to run trains from Minneapolis to Seattle. Railroad
unions have objected to the subsidiary's plan to use smaller train
crews.
   BN suspended trade on the two regional exchanges after the 4
p.m. EDT close of the New York Stock Exchange.
   BN's stock closed Wednesday on the New York exchange at $67.38 a
share, up $2.38.
   ``I wish I knew myself,'' said M. Craig Schwerdt, an analyst
with Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy & Gardner in Los Angeles.
   However, Schwerdt said the announcement could concern a

<HEAD>Ethanol Producers File Lawsuit Against Oil Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Seven ethanol producers filed a $2.1
billion antitrust lawsuit in District Court on Wednesday, alleging
that four major oil companies conspired to discourage the sale of
ethanol.
   The defendants are Shell Oil Co., Marathon Petroleum Co., Amoco
Oil Co., and Chevron U.S.A. Inc.
   Bob Wright of Lafayette, La., one of the attorneys who filed the
lawsuit, charged that the oil companies made inaccurate and
misleading statements against gasohol _ a blend of 10 percent
ethanol and 90 percent gasoline.
   ``The clearest evidence of what the oil companies have done is
labeling,'' Wright said at a news conference.
   He said signs at some of the oil companies' service stations
say: ``Our gasoline contains no alcohol or ethanol,'' or ``Our
gasoline is clean.''
   ``Those sorts of signs and labels would clearly infer ... there
is something wrong with alcohol or ethanol,'' Wright said.
   Spokespeople for the oil companies had no immediate comment.
   As a result of the oil companies' campaign, Wright said the
ethanol market has ``effectively dried up,'' with producers
suffering significant economic damages.
   The plaintiffs include Greater Rockford Energy and Technology
Corp. of Rockford, Ill.; Shepherd Oil Inc. of Jennings, La.;
Vidalia Ethanol Ltd. of Vidalia, La.; Alpebo Inc., of Jennings,
La.; Shreveport Ethanol Inc., of Shreveport, La.; Lakefield Ethanol
Inc. of Lakefield, Minn.; and A. E. Montana Inc. of Amsterdam, Mont.
   Ethanol is made from corn, and if the ethanol industry had been
allowed to grow, Wright said it would have had a ``tremendous
effect on agriculture.''
   Wright said ethanol also is good for the environment since it
can reduce harmful emissions from automobile exhausts.
   The lawsuit also said the defendants refused to accept
credit-card invoices from gasohol sales and terminated some
retailers or distributors who did accept credit-card invoices for
gasohol purchases.
   The companies also limited the availability of gasohol to
consumers and refused to communicate or deal directly with the
plaintiffs, the lawsuit contended.
   The ethanol manufacturers are asking for three times their
actual damages of $700 million and for an injunction to stop the
defendants from engaging in practices allegedly designed to hurt
the ethanol market.
   ``Where this industry be without oil companies negatively
advertising against our product would be speculation, but I believe
it would be a lot larger,'' said Steve Wentworth, first vice
president of the National Corn Growers Association. ``The bottom
line here is market-share. The major oil companies don't want to
give it up to independent blenders.''

<HEAD>Japan's Prime Minister Calls For Increased Mutual Trade</HEAD>

   Premier Noboru Takeshita of Japan said on
Wednesday it ``goes without saying'' that Japan must keep trying to
open its markets wider to the United States. He promptly added that
Japan will be trying to increase its own exports.
   He refused to say, however, what he thought the appropriate
exchange rate should be between the dollar and the yen, commenting
that ``God only knows'' the answer.
   Earlier Wednesday, the dollar weakened briefly in morning
trading in Tokyo after Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita told
reporters he thought a long-term rise in the dollar was unlikely.
   But the dollar soon recovered, closing in Tokyo on Wednesday at
125.23 yen, up from 124.80 yen on Tuesday.
   Takeshita held a news conference in New York after addressing
the U.N. General Assembly's special session on disarmament.
   Asked about the balance of trade between America and Japan,
Takeshita replied: ``It goes without saying that Japan must
continue with further efforts to open up the Japanese markets even
more. Having said that, I should also like to add that there will
be greater efforts to export Japan's goods.''
   He was less forthcoming about the outlook for exhange rates.
Takeshita will soon be meeting in Toronto with Japan's Western
allies for an economic summit, where the subject is likely to arise.
   He said that Japan considers the Louvre Accord, which deals with
policy coordination among the major countries on exchange rates,
``has been proceeding smoothly.''
   ``As for that other question, what level of the exchange rate we
think is most appropriate, I myself as well as our finance minister
make it the rule to say that `It is something that God only
knows,''' the prime minister remarked.
   Takeshita spoke in Japanese, aided by an interpreter.
   He declined to characterize progress on another thorny
U.S.-Japanese trade issue _ U.S. efforts to sell more beef and
citrus products in the highly protective Japanese market.
   Noting that bilateral talks on the issue were under way, he said
he did not want to prejudice the negotiations and would offer no
comment.
   Earlier Wednesday, Takeshita pledged increased efforts by Japan
in the cause of disarmament and world peace, including sending
Japanese technicians and advisers to Afghanistan to monitor
elections and to repair transportation, communication and medical
services.
   He congratulated President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev on achieving the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF)
treaty scrapping medium and shorter-range nuclear missles, which
took effect Wednesday.
   At the same time, he enunciated a Japanese policy of cautious
disarmament based on negotiation.
   Takeshita is scheduled to meet Reagan on Friday in London, where
the president will brief Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the
Moscow summit.
