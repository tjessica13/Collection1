   A month after the 60th Academy Awards, evidence
persists that the Oscar's golden touch doesn't always live up to
its reputation.
   Columbia Pictures had hoped that the sweep of nine Oscars by
``The Last Emperor'' would result in a box-office bonanza. But
despite doubling the number of theaters to more than 800 after the
awards, the Chinese epic has added only $10 million to theater
grosses.
   After 164 days in release, ``The Last Emperor'' had sold $36.6
million worth of tickets in the United States and Canada. By
comparison, the ghostly comedy ```Beetlejuice'' grossed $46.7
million in just 33 days.
   Still, James R. Spitz, president of Columbia's domestic
distribution, maintains ``The Last Emperor'' has had a very good
performance since the awards.
   ``Comparing `The Last Emperor' to `Beetlejuice' is like
comparing apples to oranges,'' he said. ```The Last Emperor' will
never have the teen-age audience that `Beetlejuice' has.''
   Spitz predicted the Bernardo Bertolucci film will continue doing
good business through Memorial Day and will remain in distribution
for a long time.
   ``Moonstruck,'' which collected acting awards for Cher and
Olympia Dukakis, has added $10 million since the Oscars, bringing
its total to $69 million. The figure is impressive, since the film
had been in wide release for more than two months.
   Much has been written about how winning Oscars can inflate
actors' salaries. With one exception, this year's winners seem
unlikely to boost their paychecks.
   Since ``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Fatal Attraction,'' Michael
Douglas has become one of the most in-demand stars in Hollywood.
His win for ``Wall Street'' will have little effect on Douglas, who
sometimes produces his own films (``The China Syndrome,'' ``Jewel
of the Nile'').
   Douglas' next film is for Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe, who
produced ``Fatal Attraction.'' In ``Black Rain,'' he will play an
American police officer trying to solve a murder by the Yakusa, the
Japanese Mafia.
   Having appeared in ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Suspect'' and
``Moonstruck'' in 1987, Cher can afford a rest. No new films have
been announced for her in the wake of the Oscar, but the scripts
must be piling up at her door. Meanwhile, she will collect a
fortune with her Las Vegas act.
   Sean Connery, winner as supporting actor in ``The
Untouchables,'' needs no help from Oscar or anyone else in his
career. He has been a top wage earner since his James Bond days.
He'll appear this summer in ``Presidio'' with Mark Harmon, and
works next as Harrison Ford's father in the third ``Indiana Jones''
movie.
   Olympia Dukakis seems to be the major recipient of Oscar's
beneficence. Although a distinguished stage actress, she was little
known before ``Moonstruck.'' Since her nomination, she has been
able to decline two offers for television series. She has accepted
a small role in Mike Nichols' ``Working Girls,'' which stars
Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver, but her
agents predict big things for her.
   The April 11 Oscar show drew generally poor notices but also the
best television rating in years.
   ``The ratings show that we didn't lose our audience, even during
a sweep (by `The Last Emperor'),'' said Samuel Goldwyn Jr. who
produced the show for the Academy. ``I tried to prevent that by
putting a heavy load of comedy (Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy)
toward the end. The audience stayed with us.''
   Goldwyn recognized the problems in moving to the Shrine
Auditorium with its poor acoustics, and the horendous traffic jam.
``But those problems can be solved. I think we benefited from
having 6,000 in the theater; it was a much warmer audience.'' The
Music Center, where the awards show previously was staged, held
only 2,000 people.
   Most critics lambasted the 3{-hour broadcast time, and Goldwyn
commented that the Academy will have to address that problem.
``There are certain things in the show that the Academy is
interested in but the public isn't,'' he said.
   Efforts to eliminate such awards as short subjects,
documentaries and animation from the show have so far failed to
achieve Board of Governors approval.
   Will Goldwyn be around next year to help deal with such problems?
   ``Not on your life,'' he said. ``Two years is enough.''

<DATELINE>CATONSVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago, the Berrigan brothers
and seven other Roman Catholic pacifists marched into a draft board
office here, grabbed files from the drawers, then took them out and
burned them with homemade napalm.
   The May 17, 1968, protest by the ``Catonsville 9'' inspired
similar protests elsewhere and marked the entry of radical
Catholics into the anti-war movement.
   Two decades later, most members of the Catonsville 9 have joined
other anti-war protesters in society's mainstream, although they
continue to espouse the ideals that prompted them to go to prison.
But three of the eight surviving members are still defying the U.S.
government in the cause of nuclear disarmament.
   This town of 48,000 west of Baltimore housed the draft board
offices for Baltimore County, the suburban area that surrounds the
city.
   On the day of the protest, the group, led by priests Daniel and
Philip Berrigan, walked into a second-floor office, yanked 600
files from the drawers, took them out to the parking lot and burned
them. They then joined hands and said the Lord's Prayer as they
waited to be arrested.
   ``We were tired of hearing the government trying to discredit
the peace movement as long-haired, hippy, fag kids. It was not just
a movement by people who were draft dodgers,'' said defendant
George Mische, now a 50-year-old labor organizer in St. Cloud, Minn.
   The symbolic burning, coming just five weeks after Martin Luther
King Jr. was shot and a month before Robert F. Kennedy would meet
an assassin's bullet, threw tinder on opposition to the Vietnam
conflict, and sparked similiar draft record burnings in Milwaukee,
Washington, Chicago and elsewhere.
   Thousands of people, many of them priests and nuns as well as
anti-war activists such as Tom Hayden and Abbie Hoffman, marched in
the streets of Baltimore during the week-long trial in October 1968.
   The nine defendants argued that the evil of the Vietnam War
required persons of conscience to fight it. But they were convicted
of destruction of federal property and spent anywhere from 9{
months to 3{ years in prison.
   Defendant Philip Berrigan spent the longest time in prison. Now
a former priest, married and the father of three, he said recently
that he has no intention of retiring from his career as a peaceful
violator of U.S. laws.
   ``We can't very well do that because of the state of the world,
'' he said. ``We're killing ourselves, and some of us are not
making a murmur about it.''
   Berrigan, 64, is incarcerated in a York County, Va., jail for
throwing blood on Tomahawk nuclear weapons aboard the USS Iowa in
Norfolk.
   His brother, the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, 66, lives in a Jesuit
community in New York. He is free on bond appealing a prison
sentence for damaging missile warheads at a General Electric Co.
plant in King of Prussia, Pa., in 1980. Philip Berrigan is
appealing the same conviction.
   Artist Tom Lewis, 48, of Worcester, Mass., is the only other
Catonsville 9 member still actively practicing civil disobedience.
   Last month, he was sentenced to 100 hours of community service
for hammering on military weapons during a demonstration on the
42nd anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima last August. He said
he has dedicated his life to living among the poor and to peace
work.
   The other surviving Catonsville defendants are living quieter
lives.
   Mary Moylan, 52, a nurse who went underground for nine years
before surrendering in 1979, now reportedly works again as a nurse
in the Baltimore area.
   Thomas Melville, now 57, a former Maryknoll priest, and his
wife, Marguarita, a former nun, said they joined the Catonsville
protest because they were concerned about U.S. actions in
Guatemala, where they had served before being expelled.
   Today, Mrs. Melville teaches at the University of
California-Berkeley, while her husband is writing a book. Both have
given speeches and demonstrated against U.S. intervention in
Central America, he said.
   Defendant John Hogan, a former Maryknoll brother, was expelled
from Guatemala with the Melvilles. He now lives in New Haven,
Conn., and works as a carpenter.
   Mische moved to St. Cloud in 1976, where he ran successfully for
the city council. The conservative Minnesota town eventually became
the first in the state to declare itself a nuclear free zone.
   The ninth defendant, David Darst, 26, a Christian Brother who
taught at a St. Louis high school, died in an automobile accident
while the case was on appeal.

   Fire swept through a Soviet passenger ship
docked in this western Japanese port early Wednesday, leaving nine
people dead, one missing and 35 injured, the fire bureau said.
   Toshio Yabuno of the Osaka City Fire Bureau said eight bodies
were recovered from a still smoldering section of a passenger
cabin. Earlier, a person was found dead of smoke inhalation.
   He said the victims' identities and nationalities were not known.
   White smoke billowed from the 4,870-ton Priamurye as fire squads
pumped water into the lower decks. Firefighters wearing oxygen
masks plunged through the smoke to search for the missing people.
   As of 12:00 a.m. (11 p.m. Tuesday EDT), nearly 10 hours after
the fire broke out, one person was still missing and believed
trapped inside, Yabuno said.
   Thirty-five people were injured in the predawn blaze, most from
smoke inhalation, according to Yabuno. He said 28 of the injured
were taken to hospitals in Osaka and seven others were treated at
the port area for minor burns or bruises.
   The cause of the fire was not known, said Yoshiaki Kataoka of
the Maritime Safety Agency's regional headquarters in Okobe. The
agency was informed of the blaze about 1:50 a.m. (12:50 p.m. EDT
Tuesday), he said.
   Kataoka said many of the passengers were Soviet students and
workers visiting Japan on a tour organized by the Communist Youth
League.
   The ship was carrying 295 passengers and 129 crew members when
it arrived Tuesday at Osaka, 255 miles west of Tokyo, Kataoka said.
   Firefighters temporarily stopped battling the blaze at one point
because water pumped into the lower decks had caused the ship to
list. The extra water was removed.
   Police cordoned off the area and ambulences sped to the dock.
   The Priamurye left Vladivostok on May 7 and made stops at Otaru,
on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and in Tokyo. On Thursday,
it was to have left for Hiroshima, the official said.
   Soviet consular officials took most passengers to a junior high
school gymnasium.
   The worst ship disaster in recent years involving a Soviet
cruise vessel occurred on Aug. 31, 1986, when the Admiral Nakhimov
sank in the Black Sea after colliding with the freighter Pyotr
Vasyev, with the loss of 398 lives.
   Both captains were sentenced to 15-year prison terms.
   On Feb. 16, 1986, the 20,000-ton Soviet cruise liner Mikhail
Lermonov slammed into rocks off New Zealand and sank. But although
the liner was carrying more than 700 passengers and crew, there was
only one fatality, a Soviet crew member.

   Is it ``le grand poot-on'' or an actual fact?
   Item: ``If diluted thinly enough, the juice of one lemon would
cover the entire state of Oregon.''
   Item: ``The food spilled from tacos in a single afternoon would
fill the shoes of everyone in Norway.''
   As it turns out, both items are ``actual facts'' Cully Abrell
and John Thompson have compiled in their new book, ``Moses May Have
Been An Apache and Other Actual Facts,'' a tongue-in-cheek tome
that just may be the next best thing to chopped liver this summer.
   The Main Street Press of Pittstown, N.J., has issued 50,000
copies of their new book, ``Moses May Have Been An Apache and Other
Actual Facts.'' The Waldenbooks chain bought 15,000.
   Each pair of hand-lettered ``facts'' in the book is accompanied
by drawings reminiscent of Robert Ripley's ``Believe It Or Not''
panels. Thompson produced the black ink artwork and wrote the text
with Abrell. They call the book ``le grand poot-on, not to be
confused with la petite crouton.''
   ``In England they would simply be called eccentrics,'' said
their publisher, Martin Grife. ``In America, they might be called
nut cases. I think they are far saner than we are, though they
definitely are characters.''
   Grife describes the book as ``humor for the intelligent reader.''
   ``You have to have some knowledge about the world to understand
what's funny about `Actual Facts,''' he said. ``And if you don't
think they're cleverly written, try dropping or changing a word or
two.''
   Abrell and Thompson aren't very forthcoming when asked to
explain the genesis of individual entries.
   ``Because of recent findings in a dig near Tucson,
archaeologists now believe Moses to have been an Apache,'' the book
says.
   ``They both wandered the desert, didn't they?'' Abrell said.
   ``If placed inside President Taft, President Wilson would have
stuck out a total of 18 inches,'' the book says.
   ``Statistics taken to their ultimate extreme,'' notes Thompson.
   The recurring themes in the book include musk oxen, snakes,
presidents, potatoes and Grosvenor, Utah.
   ``With a good actual fact, there's a certain irritant value,''
Abrell said, acknowledging people have divergent reactions. ``Some
fall on the floor laughing, and some sit as if you're speaking
Lithuanian.''
   Abrell, 60, lists 40 some occupations on his resume, ranging
from bartender to North Woods guide to lifeguard. He taught drama
at Wichita's Friends University for 19 years before retiring in
1982 when declining enrollment, money and facility problems forced
the elimination of his department.
   Thompson, 36, is a former student of Abrell's who sometimes
works as a free-lance artist.
   ``Unlike Mr. Abrell, however, Mr. Thompson has never really
gotten started at anything, and now seems pretty much to have given
up. He has a degree in art,'' his ``Actual Facts'' biography says.
   The two live in an old farmhouse on a 16-acre plot, much of
which was reclaimed from wheat fields. A huge barn is being
remodeled into new living quarters. Outbuildings bulge with the
fruits of frequent garage sale trips. About 60 chickens and five
confident roosters roam the grounds.
   The Abrell-Thompson phone is listed under a fake American Indian
name.
   During a recent interview, Abrell slipped frequently into an
Irish accent. He attributed the lapses to his ``mixed ancestry''
rather than the rum, apricot brandy and sangria he had been
consuming to soothe a sore throat. The reclusive Thompson spent
much of the interview looking at newspaper advertisements for lawn
mowers.
   Abrell said a sampler of ``Actual Facts'' was shipped off to
five publishers with a note: ``Is there a market for more of
these?''
   ``We got back one rejection slip. We got back another that said,
`We only deal through agents.' We haven't yet heard from the other
two,'' Abrell said.
   ``And Martin wrote us a letter that said: `Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes,''' Thompson said.
   The two balk at the idea of a book promotion tour, book-signing
parties or telephone interviews on radio talk shows. But Abrell
uses his best stage voice and draws on his carnival days when
talking up the tome.
   ``In this age of Trivial Pursuit, this is the archetypal,
ultimate _ not penultimate _ compendium of knowledge,'' he said.
``I don't think any household should be without one, particularly
if there is a child in school, or if one of the parents has ever
gone to school or if they've known anyone who can spell the word
`school.'''

   NBC's perennial sweeps favorite, Perry Mason,
topped the Nielsen ratings last week despite a lot of competition
from specials, movies and miniseries.
   ``Perry Mason: The Case of the Lady in the Lake'' was the No.
1-rated prime-time network show of the week with a rating of 22.6
and a 35 share. NBC said it was the network's best Sunday movie
rating all season.
   May is one of four months during the year when local stations'
ratings are measured for use in negotiating advertising rates, so
the networks put on a lot of special programming to draw viewers to
their affiliates.
   Other sweeps specials that landed in the top 10 were the
theatrical film ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and Barbara Walters' special,
both on ABC, and the concluding episodes of the two-parters
``Something Is Out There'' on NBC and ``The Bourne Identity'' on
ABC.
   CBS was shut out of the top 10, but came in 11th with the
season-ending cliffhanger of ``Knots Landing.'' Part one of its big
miniseries of the week, ``Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun,''
fared poorly against ``Perry Mason,'' though, and came in 43rd with
a rating of 10.4.
   The top 10-rated shows, as ranked by the A.C. Nielsen Co. were:
``Perry Mason'' NBC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC,
``Beverly Hills Cop'' ABC, ``Barbara Walters Special'' ABC, ``Night
Court'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Something Is Out There, Part
2'' NBC, ``The Bourne Identity, Part 2'' ABC and ``Who's the
Boss?'' ABC.
   NBC won the week ending May 15 with an average, prime-time
rating of 14.7 and a 26 share. ABC was second with a 12.8 and 22
share. CBS had an 11.4 average rating and 20 share. NBC's
season-to-date average is 15.8. ABC has 13.5 and CBS 13.3.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   Though it has been tops in prime time virtually the entire
season, NBC's ``Nightly News'' has spent most of the season in
third place since Nielsen installed its new people-meter rating
system last fall. For the week ending Friday the 13th, ABC's
``World News Tonight'' was first with a rating of 9.4 and a 20
share. The ``CBS Evening News'' was second with 9.1 and 20. ``NBC
Nightly News'' continued to trail with an 8.0 and 17 share.
   ABC, in first place for the third week in a row, said so far
this quarter, its ``World News'' has increased its share of the
audience by 11 percent compared to the second quarter of 1987.
Meanwhile, said ABC, CBS is down 9 percent in share, and NBC has
dropped 18 percent.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``I Married
Dora,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Uncommon Valor,'' ``West 57th,'' ``High
Mountain Rangers,'' ``48 Hours,'' ``Aaron's Way,'' ``Houston
Knights,'' ``Ohara'' and ``Supercarrier.''

   Donald Regan's ``kiss and tell'' book about
his days in the White House shows that the former presidential
chief of staff is a pygmy, and that now everyone knows it,
President Reagan's daughter says.
   ``Donald Regean is now, for the world to see, as small and
ungracious a man as most of us knew he was,'' Maureen Reagan said
Monday. ``There were a lot of us who wanted to get rid of Don
Regan.''
   Reagan commented while in the state for an appearance before a
Republican women's group.
   ``When you see the numbers of people who have served the
president, but very few of them who have been such pygmies as to
have to write nasty little tomes like this,'' she said.
   Regan's book said Nancy Reagan made decisions about the timing
of some major announcements after she consulted with an astrologer.

   Controversy over the cover of rock star
Prince's new album, ``Lovesexy,'' on which the singer appears nude
but with his legs strategically placed, doesn't appear to have hurt
sales.
   The album has sold at least 1.6 million copies since its May 10
release even though some record outlets are refusing to sell it,
Prince publicist Robyn Riggs said Monday.
   ``Obviously, it doesn't seem to be hurting,'' she said of the
controversy.
   The album sold 800,000 copies in the first week in the United
States and 800,000 in Great Britain in the first four days, she
said. Sales of the album's first single, ``Alphabet St.,'' were at
least 700,000 in the United States, she said.
   Prince, who lives in suburban Chanhassen, will begin a two-month
tour of Europe on July 8, with a concert in Paris, Ms. Riggs said.
He may follow with a U.S. tour in the fall, she said.

   ``Friday The 13th'' was a lucky day for the six
sequel in the blood-letting movie series as it earned $8.2 million
and first place at the box office last weekend.
   ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood,'' opened on Friday
the 13th on nearly 1,800 screens, making impressive earnings during
a normally lackluster time of year when students attend proms and
get ready for graduation.
   ``This is normally a very bad week,'' said John Krier of
Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But Jason still lives,'' he said,
referring to the much-resurrected hockey-masked killer of the
``Friday the 13th'' movies.
   Earnings fell sharply after the No.1 spot, and there were no
other new movies in the Top 10.
   ``Colors,'' the gang movie starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall,
fell to second place, earning $3.3 million, followed by the ghost
movie ``Beetlejuice,'' which sold $3 million in tickets.
   ``Shakedown,'' about an undercover cop exposing corrupt
colleagues, earned $2 million for fourth place, followed by the
dance-romance movie ``Salsa'' with $1.8 million.
   ``Biloxi Blues'' was in sixth place with $1.2 million and
``Above The Law'' was seventh with $1.1 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 was ``Moonstruck,'' $1.09 million; ``The
Last Emperor,'' $1.05 million; and ``Bloodsport,'' $911,000.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.
   1. ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood,'' Paramount, $8.2
million, 1,796 screens, $4,590 per screen, $8.2 million, one week,
n-a.
   2. ``Colors,'' Orion, $3.3 million, 1,387 screens, $2,439 per
screen, $30 million, five weeks, $12 million.

$1,994 per screen, $55.1 million, seven weeks, $20 million.
   4. ``Shakedown,'' Universal, $2 million, 1,522 screens, $1,330

   Peggy Charren said when she started Action for
Children's Television in 1968, she thought she'd have about a
two-year job tidying up the kiddie TV market.
   On Monday, she was joined by Garrison Keillor, Jay Leno, Jane
Pauley, Phylicia Rashad, Maurice Sendak and Shelley Duvall, plus
congressmen, heads of networks, Mickey Mouse and Mr. Rogers, to
celebrate ACT's 20th anniversary.
   ``When we started in 1968, our goal was really to put ourselves
out of business,'' said Charren. ``We thought we'd make children's
television so great, there would be no need for an advocacy group
for children's television. I actually thought we'd do it in two
years.''
   The Massachusetts-based advocacy group is still fighting against
commercialism and violence in children's programming. Its latest
foes are ``30-minute commercials,'' children's shows that revolve
around commercially available toys.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
Telecommunications Subcommittee and sponsor of legislation to limit
commercial time in children's programming, suggested that if
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis wins the presidential election,
Charren might have a bigger role.
   ``Michael Dukakis' chairman of the FCC (Federal Communications
Commission),'' he said, indicating Charren, ``so you better get to
know her well. She's been ringing doorbells since 1962 for him.''
   Leno, who served as emcee of the celebration at Tavern on the
Green, said he was appalled when he went to buy a toy for a nephew.
He was shown a teddy bear that plays a bedtime story, ``relieving
parents of this arduous task. Bad enough you had to give birth to
the kid,'' he said, ``now we have to miss `Jake and the Fatman' to
read it a story?''
   The program honored those who do read a story. The celebrities
presented ACT Hall of Fame awards to stations, institutions and
people who have contributed significantly to high-quality
children's TV.
   The stations awarded were KRON-TV of San Francisco, KING 5
Television in Seattle and WMAQ-TV of Chicago for local children's
programming.
   Keillor presented an award to The Disney Channel. Duvall
presented one to the cable channel Nickelodeon. Marlene Sanders
gave an award to PBS.
   Lee Salk presented the award to Family Communications. Fred
Rogers, its founder and president said, ``We try to help children
and their families feel as good as possible about who they are and
what they can become, so they can look at their neighbor and feel
the same way.'' He then asked the crowd to observe a minute of
silence to think about those who have been important in their
lives. ``You have filled this room with selfless love,'' he said.
   Rashad presented an award to Group W Television Stations.
Sendak, the artist and author, presented the award to Weston Woods,
a home video company that encourages children to read books. Pauley
presented the award to The Children's Television Workshop,
producers of ``Sesame Street.''
   ACT's ``super hero'' award went to Lloyd N. Morrisett, president
of The John and Mary R. Markle Foundation, for supporting
educational television for children.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf pvs to include Kerry comment</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

   Vice President George Bush suggested on
Tuesday that controversies swirling around the Reagan
administration are hurting him in presidential polls, but he said
he wasn't worried about it.
   On one of those matters, the Iran-Contra affair, Bush struck
back hard, accusing Democrats of leaking ``scurrilous allegations''
against him that aren't true.
   ``You've had endless investigations _ each one with a lot of
Democrats ...trying to find something wrong and they haven't,''
Bush told reporters in Fresno. ``The American people are fair. They
know when someone is telling the truth.''
   Bush singled out Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., saying Kerry's
subcommittee is the source of the latest allegation to link Bush
aides to a Contra arms network involving drug deals. Kerry denied
that he or his staff leaked any committee information.
   On another controversy, Bush refused to answer repeated
questions about a possible administration deal with Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, while admitting a Senate resolution
condemning a deal reflects public opinion.
   ``I think it expresses a lot of the strong feeling out there
across the country on that matter, very strong,'' Bush said.
   President Reagan, when asked about the reported deal that would
drop charges against Noriega if he steps down, told reporters at
the White House, ``We're negotiating right now, and therefore I
can't comment on negotiations that are under way. ... I have to say
that I think that much of what many of you have been dealing with
as a story is based on some kind of leaks or misinformation,
because there are no facts to sustain it.''
   Bush talked about agriculture Tuesday, touring an irrigation
center at California State University at Fresno, a fresh fruit
processing plant and an orchard.
   The vice president professed not to be concerned about a CBS
News-New York Times poll putting him 10 points behind likely
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``I don't worry about it. The election is 5{ months away,'' he
told reporters on the college campus.
   The poll put Bush at 39 percent and Dukakis at 49 percent in a
prospective fall matchup, numbers Bush admitted were not good news.
   ``No, they weren't,'' he said. ``I feel about like I did about
how (opinion polls) looked in New Hampshire 24 hours before the
polls opened. I was 8 points back and I won by 10. They were off by
18 points.
   ``So what you do when the polls don't look good, you work hard.''
   Bush's negative ratings were high in the poll. Thirty-three
percent said they had a favorable view of Bush and 35 percent said
they had an unfavorable view. While voters are less familiar with
Dukakis, his favorable rating stood at 38 percent and unfavorable
at 14 percent.
   Asked if the administration's recent problems _ particularly
with Noriega and the investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese
III _ have contributed to his high negatives, Bush agreed.
   ``You may have put your finger on something there,'' he said.
   Later in Los Angeles, Bush added: ``It could an accumulation of
current events, but I don't worry about it. I've learned not to
live on these polls.
   However, Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said that the
negative ratings can change quickly in a presidential campaign.
   Bush spokesman Pete Teeley added that Dukakis has some
advantages with a race still under way.
   ``Dukakis is in a very enviable position_ he is scoring a knock
every Tuesday, while we have no opponents...and we have suffered in
the polls,'' said Teeley.
   Bush argued that the general election battle has not been joined.
   ``The thing hasn't really started in terms of Democrats versus
Republicans and we haven't gotten any of that in focus and it won't
be until after the convention,'' Bush said.
   He said that his focus on Republican groups will change as the
fall race gets started.
   ``In a primary you go where the primary votes are,'' Bush said.
``I think we have to reach out the best we can to all voters. I
made that point clear to a group of Hispanic leaders. ... We'll
start doing more of that.''
   On agriculture, Bush said the outlook had improved for farmers.
   ``I know the 80s have been tough years for farmers, very tough
years for some,'' he told a gathering of supporters in Fresno.
``But there is strontg evidence now that the 85 farm bill is
working.''
   Bush said farmers had convinced him to talk to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service about the guest workers program that
allows Mexicans to come into the country to harvest crops.
   ``I recognize how important guest workers are not only to you
and harvesting crops, but to the country. And I support the
provision of the immigration reform bill that allows you an
adequate supply,'' he said.
   He also slammed Dukakis for calling for a greater federal role
in allocating water, ``the lifeblood of California agriculture.
   ``I was interest to see that Gov. Mike Dukakis assert a federal
interest in allocating water rights in the West. You want to see
the sagebrush rebellion start up all over again. Listen to that
kind of talk. It's the states that should have the major say and
the major control, not the federal government,'' Bush said.

   A bus carrying mentally handicapped people
careened down a hill and overturned near a creek Monday, killing
three people and injuring the other 20 aboard, state police said.
   The bus, owned by the California-based transportation company
Laidlaw Transit, was the only vehicle involved in the afternoon
accident 12 miles northeast of Poughkeepsie, said Trooper Gerard
Salmon.
   The bus was traveling down a steep hill when it failed to make a
sharp right turn, hit a utility pole, overturned and came to rest
on its side about 30 feet from the road and just a few feet from
Little Wappingers Creek, state police Sgt. Dennis Cody said.
   It was not immediately known what caused the accident, Cody said.
   Witnesses described the wreckage as looking like a crushed
yellow school bus. The safety of converted school buses is under
scrutiny this week after a fiery weekend crash in Kentucky killed
at least 27 people on a church outing. The passengers, who were
mentally handicapped, worked for Rehabilitation Programs Inc. in
the town of Poughkeepsie. They were being driven home from three
locations, Cody said.
   John Dalyrymple, 44, of Clinton Corners, and Patricia Russo, 23,
of Clinton Hollow, were dead at the scene, Cody said. Raymond
Phillips, 25, of Clinton Corners, was dead on arrival at Northern
Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck, Cody said.
   Bus driver, Lewis Taylor, 44, of Poughkeepsie, was in stable
condition with head injuries, abrasions and broken bones, said a
Northern Dutchess Hospital spokeswoman. She said two other
passengers were treated and released.
   A spokeswoman for Vassar Brothers Hospital said six passengers
were treated and released and two others were being held for
observation. A fireman was treated and released for heat
exhaustion, she said.
   St. Francis Hospital spokeswoman Carol Huber said nine people
were treated for injuries there.
   Huber said six people were in critical condition, including two
who were transferred to Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. One
person was in fair condition, one was in good condition and another
was treated and released, she said.

   Hundreds of people evacuated the state's
tallest building twice Monday after a smoking air compressor and a
small fire in a sub-basement sparked fears of a repeat of this
month's deadly blaze.
   A small fire that ignited in a basement section of the 62-story
First Interstate Bank tower was extinguished by the time
firefighters arrived late Monday afternoon and no damage or
injuries were reported, Assistant Fire Chief David Sloan said.
   Firefighters were called back to the building a third time late
in the afternoon because of a report of smoke. That turned out to
be a false alarm, said Fire Department spokesman Jim Williamson.
   Sloan said the three incidents were coincidence.
   A May 4 fire gutted four floors of the downtown bank tower,
killed a janitor who became trapped in a fiery elevator and injured
40 others, several of them firefighters overcome by smoke.
   The approximately 400 people evacuated Monday included crews
cleaning up from the earlier fire. Some workers had to walk down
dozens of flights of stairs, and one woman reportedly fainted and
had to be treated.
   ``My knees were telling me I'm an old man,'' said electrician
Dan Pullen, who went down from the 46th floor.
   Meanwhile, a special task force that examined the deadly blaze
urged Monday that sprinklers be required for all high-rise
buildings in the city within four years. The task force report,
released by Mayor Tom Bradley, also recommended enclosure of
elevator lobbies and air pressurization of stairwells.

<TEXT>
   A Civil Rights Commission hearing on AIDS
turned surreal when gay protesters in clown masks hummed ``America
the Beautiful,'' shouted insults at witnesses and commissioners and
held up wristwatches to denote that ``time is running out'' for
AIDS victims.
   Monday's hearing became so heated that one witness said he would
rather die ``in the street'' than in the hospice run by another,
and a third said gay pressure groups are thwarting public health
efforts.
   The hearing also featured feuding commission members denouncing
each other's remarks and tangling with witnesses over racism,
``sexual addiction'' and other issues with little direct relation
to the subject at hand _ AIDS and discrimination.
   At one point, the 65 gay protesters in clown masks turned their
backs on the proceedings to show their disdain for the commission
and its efforts.
   ``This is a waste of time,'' said Duncan Osborne, one of the
protesters. ``This is a waste of money.''
   Osborne said the money would be better spent testing new drugs
or educating people on how to avoid getting AIDS.
   The commission proposed its hearings, part of a larger study, in
a memo that discussed state sodomy laws in the same footnote as
Biblical denunciations of homosexuality.
   Osborne and others said the commission could play a legitimate
role investigating employment, housing, health care and insurance
discrimination against AIDS victims. But they said the panel has no
business reopening debate on how AIDS is transmitted or hearing
inflammatory testimony from witnesses who are not medical or public
health experts.
   Jim Johnson, executive director of a religious hospice in Long
Beach, Calif., called Beyond Rejection, said homosexual activists
had bombed his hospice and threatened him because he had left
behind ``the narcissism and contempt of my earlier life'' as a
homosexual.
   Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, noted the prevailing medical belief that a homosexual
orientation cannot be changed.
   ``If I had to make the choice between dying in the street and
dying in his hospice, I'd choose dying in the street,'' Levi said.
   Dr. David Pence, a University of Minnesota radiologist, Vietnam
war protester and civil rights worker, alleged that gay pressure
groups have thwarted public health efforts to stop the spread of
AIDS.
   ``Twenty-five years ago it was Southern bullies in jeans that we
had to fight. Now it's Northern smoothies in ties,'' Pence said.
   An outraged Levi demanded a retraction and an apology.
   ``He has just likened us ... to the Ku Klux Klan,'' Levi said.
``That is so deeply offensive that I question whether I can
continue to sit at the same table with him.''
   He said gay people oppose reporting techniques which identify
victims by name because they fear discrimination of all types, even
prosecution for violating sodomy laws, if anyone finds out they are
victims or carriers of AIDS.
   If there were federal laws barring discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation, Levi said, ``we wouldn't have to be here.''
He said the commission should recommend that type of law and
recommend extending to the private sector a law barring
discrimination against handicapped people who are not a public
health threat.
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said public health officials had not been
influenced by any lobbying groups in determining AIDS policy or
interpreting AIDS research.
   ``It is totally preposterous to even imagine that any scientist
I know ... would take a stand on how the virus is transmitted based
on pressure,'' he said. ``The evidence is overwhelming.''
   Teen-age pregnancy, babies with AIDS and incest in migrant
families were among the concerns discussed by commissioners and
witnesses. So was ``sexual addiction,'' a condition Pence described
as likely to lead to AIDS and defined as engaging in ``compulsive
coital behavior outside of marriage.''

<HEAD>Reputed Mafia Leader Sentenced to Six Years in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reputed leader of the Southern California
Mafia, who pleaded guilty to extortion, was sentenced to six years
in prison Monday as provided under a plea bargain arrangement.
   Seven other reputed mobsters also were sentenced by U.S.
District Court Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, who upheld the plea
bargain agreements for each.
   Peter John Milano, 62, of Westlake Village, pleaded guilty in
March to involvement in a criminal enterprise in which he committed
two acts of racketeering. In return, he was guaranteed a 6-year
sentence rather than a possible 20 years.
   Milano, who owns Rome Vending Co., also was assured that he
would have other federal charges against him dropped and that he
was ``not a subject or target'' of any other federal investigation.
   While Milano pleaded guility, he and others indicted have
maintained they do not belong to the Mafia.
   When the indictment against Milano and his associates was
announced last year, U.S. Attorney Robert C. Bonner said ``the main
body of La Cosa Nostra in Los Angeles has been severely gutted.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese called it ``the most significant
organized crime case on the West Coast in a decade.''
   Also sentenced were Milano's brother and reputed underboss,
Carmen Joseph Milano, 58, of the Los Angeles district of Tarzana,
to six months; Charles Caci, 51, an entertainer who uses the name
Bobby Milano, to one year, one day, and his brother, Vincent Caci,
52, both of Palm Springs, to one year and one day; Rocco Zangari,
54, of Palm Springs, to five years probation, and a $2,000 fine;
Stephen Cino, 51, of Las Vegas, to 1{ years; Albert Jesus Nunez,
57, to 10 years.
   All pleaded guilty to extortion and conspiracy. Nunez also
pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine, and Cino also
pleaded guilty to making false statements.
   Also sentenced was John DeMattia, 51 of Sherman Oaks. DeMattia,
who pleaded guilty to conspiracy, conspiracy to make a false
statement on a loan application, and wire fraud, was given 3 years,
3 days in prison.
   The indictment involved violations of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute. The Los Angeles case
was one of several RICO indictments nationwide that stemmed from a
1982 crackdown on organized crime.
   The indictment followed an FBI investigation during which Milano
allegedly ordered the killing of two suspected informants. The
murders never occurred because of tips from informants, the
indictment said.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is turning to
an outside public relations consultant to improve his image after
firing the Justice Department's chief spokesman, prompting
accusations by conservatives that he wants ``blind loyalty.''
   Despite the department's annual $1.7 million public affairs
budget, it is negotiating a contract with an employee of the public
relations firm Hill & Knowlton to help depict Meese as a tough
drug-buster.
   Word of the planned outside public relations contract surfaced
Monday along with the news that Meese had fired department
spokesman Terry Eastland.
   At a news conference, Eastland said that with Meese under
criminal investigation since May 1987, ``it would be difficult for
me to be as aggressive as he might like'' in defending the attorney
general.
   Meese said he simply thought it was time for ``new leadership''
and denied that Eastland's dismissal had anything to do with his
own legal problems.
   But department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Eastland was fired Friday for refusing to provide unconditional
support to Meese in the face of the criminal investigation.
   In a letter to Meese, Eastland said that ``you have expressed to
me your desire to have as director of public affairs someone
willing to aggressively defend you against, in effect, any and all
criticism. ... You have concluded that my efforts have not
sufficed.''
   As soon as Eastland's firing was disclosed, the head of Meese's
speech-writing unit, William Schambra, abruptly quit, saying he was
``perplexed and deeply disturbed by the attorney general's
decision.''
   The outside public relations contract is being negotiated with
Charles Crawford of Hill & Knowlton's Washington office.
   Hill & Knowlton chairman Bob Gray emphasized that the contract
is to be a 60-day arrangement with Crawford personally on drug
enforcement issues and that ``it's not a contract with me or the
firm.''
   However, he also said, ``I've always felt that whoever had''
Eastland's position ``had too much to do on a day-to-day basis to
spend much time on departmental problems.''
   Gray has close ties to the Reagan administration, but he denied
having anything to do with Eastland's dismissal, saying it was
``news to me.''
   Conservatives lamented the firing of Eastland, a staunch
conservative who helped craft many of Meese's most controversial
speeches on subjects ranging from civil rights policies to Supreme
Court rulings.
   ``I think it is a severe blow to the overall effort of the Meese
Justice Department to change the conventional intellectual
wisdom,'' said conservative scholar Bruce Fein, a former department
official. ``Terry was devoted to challenging the liberal nostrums
of the past.''
   Meese ``has fallen prey to bad advice from those who confuse
blind loyalty with good government,'' said Gary L. McDowell, a
political conservative and Meese's former chief speechwriter. He
called the firing ``the single greatest mistake Ed Meese has made
since becoming attorney general.''
   Meese told reporters that there ``are times when you need new
leadership in a particular division and that's what happened here.''
   He contradicted the statement in Eastland's letter about a
perceived lack of a sufficiently aggressive defense, saying the
dismissal ``had nothing to do with a defense of me.''
   Meese replaced Eastland with his No. 2 spokesman, Patrick
Korten, who told reporters he intends ``to be very aggressive about
every part of the job.''
   Meese's ``ethical conduct has been entirely aboveboard,'' said
Korten. ``I think he's a very ethical man. I think he's a very
moral man.''
   Independent counsel James McKay has been investigating the
attorney general's ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a $1
billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. Meese's longtime friend E.
Robert Wallach is under indictment in the Wedtech case.
   McKay also has subpoenaed records of the $40,000-a-year job held
by Meese's wife, Ursula. Her salary with a Washington charity is
being paid by a wealthy Washington family that leases offices to
the Justice Department.
   McKay is expected to issue a report shortly raising numerous
questions about Meese's ethical behavior, and Eastland said
``someone like me could not be indifferent to what might be
contained or flow from the independent counsel's report.''
   Education Secretary William Bennett, who once wrote a book with
Eastland, immediately offered him a job at the Department of
Education.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued a statement saying he was
concerned by the firing.
   Thurmond said ``Eastland has a fine reputation,'' and he added
that the committee will hold hearings after the independent
counsel's investigation of Meese is concluded.

<HEAD>Senate Racing Clock to Ratify US-Soviet Treaty</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: time of debate start uncertain</NOTE>

   The Senate is racing the clock in a bid to
ratify the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty in the dozen
days remaining before President Reagan meets with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   The last obstacles to beginning floor debate were swept away
Monday, ending a process of intense scrutiny that began soon after
the treaty was signed in early December.
   Three Senate committees told Senate majority leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., that last week's agreement in Geneva between
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze satisfactorily resolved disputes about how to
implement the treaty's on-site inspection provisions.
   Byrd then announced he would call up the treaty for debate
sometime today.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty, signed at
the White House on Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, would require
the elimination of all U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range of
between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.
   The decision to begin Senate floor action on the pact followed
testimony in which Shultz said that in the Geneva talks, ``we got
what we needed and wanted.''
   Shultz said that included both the on-site inspection and a
Soviet agreement that medium-range weapons using such futuristic
technology as particle beam generators are banned by the treaty.
   Both issues had delayed consideration of the treaty on the
Senate floor with Byrd vowing not to schedule action until they
were resolved.
   Byrd said Monday that he had been assured by the Senate Foreign
Relations, Intelligence and Armed Services committees that the
problems had in fact been resolved.
   ``I feel satisfied that we're justified in taking up the treaty
and I plan to do so,'' Byrd said.
   Byrd said he hoped the treaty could be ratified by the May 29
opening of the Moscow summit but could not guarantee it.
   Finishing the treaty by the time of the summit will depend on
the nature of the debate and the number of amendments that are
offered, he said.
   Byrd said he plans to call up the treaty and stay on it but
noted there may be some roadblocks.
   For example, he said that if President Reagan vetoes the trade
bill, an attempt to override that action would take precedence over
the treaty and would interrupt its consideration.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he may seek to make the Soviet
diplomatic note resolving the futuristic weapons issue a part of
the treaty itself.
   He said he would offer a reservation to the treaty of the kind
that requires agreement by the Soviet Union before the pact can go
into effect.
   Chief U.S. arms control negotiator Max Kampelman told Warner
that would send a potentially disruptive message to the Soviets
that they cannot be trusted.
   But Warner said the issue had taken five weeks to resolve and
should be nailed down.
   Testifying before the Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday,
Shultz reminded senators they shouldn't be alarmed at a rough spot
here and there as the two superpowers struggle to put the treaty
into action.
   ``We are breaking new ground with this treaty,'' Shultz said.
``On-site inspection is a major step forward in arms control
agreements. We shouldn't be surprised if this process isn't always
smooth.''
   But he said that as a result of the Geneva talks ``we and the
Soviets not only agree on the rights and obligations established in
this treaty, but also on procedures to carry them out.''
   ``The bottom line is that the verification provisions of this
treaty get the job done,'' he said.
   In another development, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., dismissing
allegations by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said there is no evidence
that a recent test of a Soviet sea-launched cruise missile from a
land-based launcher violated the treaty because it flew less than
the prohibited 300 miles.

<HEAD>River Beds Of Mars Good Candidate For Evidence Of Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ancient rivers that once flowed across an
Earthlike Mars may have harbored primitive forms of life that
flourished briefly before the red planet turned bitterly cold and
dry, scientists say.
   Steve Squyers, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, said
that most evidence now indicates that Mars and the Earth were very
similar shortly after their formation some 4.5 billion years ago
and that conditions that led to the formation of life on Earth may
also have existed on Mars.
   Squyers was among the scientists discussing planetary research
at a meeting Monday of the American Geophysical Union. In an
interview, he said the most likely place for finding proof of
Martian life is soil laid down billions of years ago when water is
thought to have flowed freely across the planet's surface.
   ``We know that life developed on Earth very early and we know
that conditions on Mars very early were, if not Earthlike, were
very much more Earthlike than they are at the present,'' Squyers
said.
   No evidence of life on Mars has been found so far in studies by
satellites and by robot craft that landed there. But Squyers and
others believe Mars holds out that possibility, and even if life
never evolved there, that finding also would be important.
   ``If you don't find life, you've found out that despite the fact
that you had really Earthlike conditions, they weren't Earthlike
enough to produce life,'' he said. ``That will provide more
information on the type of conditions you must have to enable life
to develop.''
   Susan Postawko of the University of Hawaii said most scientists
studying the planet now accept the idea that water once flowed on
Mars in massive rivers that cut channels across the surface. She
said that idea once was considered outrageous because of conditions
on Mars now.
   ``It's virtually impossible to have water flowing on Mars under
the current conditions,'' said Torrence Johnson, a Jet Propulsion
Laboratory scientist. The planet has only seven one-thousandths of
the atmospheric pressure of Earth and is very cold. Water would
either evaporate or freeze, said Johnson.
   But pictures taken in 1976 by the Voyager spacecraft clearly
showed river beds and this finally persuaded most experts that
water once covered part of Mars' surface.
   ``There is really no other way that the channels could have been
formed,'' said Postawko. ``At first it was thought they could be
lava channels, but the way they look is more like water channels.
There is no other abundant liquid that could have formed them.''
   The question now is, she said, how did Mars change so
dramatically from the time the rivers flowed?
   ``The most popular consensus is that Mars formed and outgassed a
lot of carbon dioxide forming a greenhouse effect,'' said Postawko.
This would keep the planet warm enough for water to flow.
Eventually, though, she said, the water would react with the carbon
dioxide, forming carbonates, a type of mineral. As the mineral is
formed, carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. Mars cooled
slowly and dried, and the Earthlike beginning was snuffed out, she
said.
   Postawko said this evolution could have occurred in cycles of
heating and cooling, with volcanic action changing the atmospheric
chemistry and allowing the cycle to restart, time after time.
   Squyers, Postawko and Johnson said few of the questions about
Mars and its history of water and, perhaps, life, will be answered
until explorers set foot there.
   Drill samples gathered from the flood plains of some river
channels sighted in Voyager pictures could determine the presence
of carbonates and, in theory, could reveal fossilized, primitive
life forms.
   Squyers said there may also be water still trapped in a
subsurface permafrost, and that core samples taken from high
latitudes on Mars could prove this concept. He said pictures
indicate that at the Martian poles there are frozen deposits of
ice, perhaps from water or carbon dioxide. Samples of this ice
could give a chemical history of the planet.
   Ordinary Martian soil, taken from anywhere on the surface, said
Squyers, could answer questions about the weather effects that have
scoured the red surface of Mars over billions of years, leaving it
barren while on its sister planet Earth, life bloomed, flourished
and grew.
   Squyers, Postawko and Johnson all made presentations Monday on
planetary research at the AGU meeting.

   Greece postponed a military exercise in
the Aegean Sea region in response to a Turkish request, the Defense
Ministry said.
   ``Following a request from the Turkish side and as a gesture of
good will due to the feast of Bairam, the Defense Ministry has
agreed to postpone the second stage of the exercise until after May
19,'' the ministry said Monday.
   The postponement came one week before two high-level Greek and
Turkish committees are to open talks on ways of improving bilateral
relations.
   Bairam, celebrated from May 17 to 19, is a Moslem religious
festival that follows the fast of Ramadan.
   A statement from the Defense Ministry noted that Turkey agreed
last March to postpone small-scale exercises in the Aegean
following a Greek request.
   Greece and Turkey have longstanding disputes over Aegean
airspace control, seabed mineral rights and the military status of
some Greek islands.

<HEAD>Motion For Separate Trials Shows McFarlane Unindicted
Co-Conspirator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense has revealed that former national
security adviser Robert C. McFarlane is named as an unindicted
co-conspirator in the case against Oliver L. North and three other
Iran-Contra defendants.
   McFarlane was named in that capacity in the charge that the
retired Marine lieutenant colonel and three co-defendants conspired
to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits illegally to the Nicaraguan
rebels, according to a defense brief filed Monday in the case.
   The names of McFarlane and other unindicted co-conspirators in
the case are contained in a version of the indictment that was
filed under seal in U.S. District Court.
   But lawyers for North revealed McFarlane's legal status in a
request that North be tried separately from former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   North's three co-defendants also filed motions for separate
trials.
   Fawn Hall, North's former secretary at the National Security
Council; Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl, North's aide at the NSC; and
Joe Fernandez, also known as Tomas Castillo, the CIA's former
station chief in Costa Rica, were also identified in the defense
brief as unindicted co-conspirators.
   Hall and Earl are cooperating with Walsh's investigation under
grants of immunity from prosecution.
   The conspiracy count against all four defendants charges they
conspired illegally to set up the clandestine arms-supply network
to the Contras through a series of foreign companies with secret
bank accounts in Switzerland.
   As part of the conspiracy, the indictment charges, North and
Poindexter made false statements to Congress and destroyed NSC
records to thwart an investigation when the Iran-Contra affair
became public in November 1986.
   McFarlane, who resigned as national security adviser in late
1985, has admitted to charges he gave Congress false assurances
that his staff _ specifically North _ was not involved in giving
covert aid to the Contras at a time when direct U.S. military aid
was prohibited.
   McFarlane traveled with North to Tehran in May 1986 on an
arms-for-hostages mission, carrying a Bible signed by President
Reagan and a cake baked in the shape of a key.
   McFarlane, who is also cooperating with Walsh's investigation,
could receive a prison sentence of up to four years and a $400,000
fine for his guilty plea to the misdemeanor charges.
   The defense motions were filed on a day that prosecutors made
another attempt to obtain nearly 3,000 pages of diaries that North
kept while he was a White House aide.
   Walsh, who tried unsuccessfully to subpoena the documents during
the investigation, sought them during a routine request for ``any
and all notebooks, journals or ledgers kept by the defendants.''
   The defendants said they needed to be tried separately in order
to use the congressional testimony of their co-defendants to prove
their innocence.
   The defense contended that a joint trial would unfairly
prejudice the cases against them because all the defendants _
except Secord _ testified before Congress under limited grants of
immunity from prosecution.
   The so-called use immunity grants prevent Walsh from using the
congressional testimony of individual defendants against them as
evidence. But a defendant can use the immunized congressional
testimony of a co-defendant to cross-examine that person during the
trial.
   The defense, quoting a memo by Walsh, said that the testimony
McFarlane gave after North's appearance was likely tainted because
it was given in direct response to North's statements to the
Iran-Contra committees.
   Neither McFarlane's lawyer, Leonard Garment, nor James Wieghart,
a spokesman for independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, would
comment on the defense revelation.
   Hakim and Secord, meanwhile, contended that they should be tried
separately because they are not accused of giving false testimony
to Congress or participating in a cover-up.

<HEAD>Soviet Media Finds Victory In Retreat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One name cq for Najib.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet news media found a diplomatic victory
in the retreat from Afghanistan, portraying the Soviet pullout as a
triumphant end to eight years of aid to a neighbor in need.
   The state-run press, while conceding that military victory
proved elusive, nevertheless put a positive spin on the withdrawal
that began Sunday.
   ``Homeward!'' the Communist Party daily Pravda declared on its
front page Monday, showing a smiling Afghan officer chatting with a
Soviet major just before the major's departure for home.
   ``We were heading for this for a long time and with
difficulty,'' Pravda wrote. ``But life, with its imperious hand,
moves aside the most sincere strivings and spoils the best-laid
plans.''
   Pravda depicted the withdrawal as a diplomatic triumph over
countries that supported the anti-communist guerrillas in their
battle against President Najib's Moscow-backed government.
   The party daily claimed that the April 14 Geneva accord that set
the timetable for withdrawal was the result of opposition forces
finally realizing that the war could not be won by military force
alone.
   ``We never laid claim to a military victory in Afghanistan,''
Pravda said, adding: ``If we speak of defeats and victories, then
there is a victory, too ... The return of our sons is a victory for
perestroika.''
   Perestroika refers to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reform program aimed at rebuilding society.
   Television news coverage, such as reports by the nightly news
program Vremya, have focused on the ceremonial send-offs given the
Soviet soldiers by the Afghan government.
   Afghan soldiers and citizens were lined up on the streets of
Jalalabad when the Soviets pulled out of their base there Sunday
and in Kabul, where about 1,300 troops marched out on Monday, the
first contingent to leave the country under the Geneva accord.
   But while he ceremonies took place, gunfire could be heard in
the distance, a reminder that the war continues. Guerrilla factions
have vowed to continue their fight to topple the Marxist government.
   The Jalalabad departure and a message from the Communist Party
leadership congratulating the troops topped Vremya newscast Sunday
night, but the ceremonies from Kabul were carried late in Monday's
broadcast.
   Soviet media also have looked at the human side of the war,
noting the relief felt by families of soldiers serving in
Afghanistan.
   Notably absent from the coverage, however, has been any
emotional display or questioning of the wisdom of having entered
the war in the first place.
   No interviews with anxious parents have taken place, and even
the departing soldiers depicted have been restrained in their
enthusiasm over leaving the civil war behind.
   The party message delivered to the soldiers on Sunday thanked
them for ``fulfilling their internationalist duty'' to the Afghan
government, whose power remains threatened by guerrilla groups
armed and trained by Pakistan and the United States.
   Soviet officers also have told Western reporters in Afghanistan
that they consider the Afghan army capable of defending itself now.
   The attention lavished on such comments has created the
impression that withdrawing the 115,000 Soviet troops is a logical
step in assisting Afghanistan toward military independence.
   A Tass news agency commentary on Monday contended the Soviet
departure could have been arranged much earlier if the other
parties to the Geneva agreement had acknowledged their errors
earlier.
   The agreement that called for the Soviet withdrawal to start
Sunday was signed by Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the United
States and the Soviet Union agreeing to act as guarantors.
   Half the Soviet troops are expected to be back on home ground by
Aug. 15. The withdrawal must be completed within nine months.
   The Kremlin sent in tanks and troops on Dec. 27, 1979, to back
the Soviet-allied government against widespread insurgence. The
uprising was touched off by the April 1978 revolution that brought
a Marxist leadership to power.

   Teamsters union executives met
behind closed doors to discuss an orderly transfer of power while
indicted president Jackie Presser undergoes cancer treatment, an
official said.
   Union leaders are supporting Presser, not vying for his job as
head of the 1.7 million-member union, Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L.
Mathis said Monday.
   ``You're talking about a very dear personal friend of mine,''
Mathis said of questions about possible successors to Presser if
his illness proved to be life-threatening. ``I don't know of any
power struggle.''
   Presser, 61, is hospitalized at the Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix, reportedly for treatment of brain cancer. He
previously underwent surgery for a malignant tumor on his lung.
   Institute spokeswoman Debra Gelbart confirmed that Presser was
being treated but said no other information would be released.
   Labor-movement specialist Nick Salvatore of Cornell University's
School of Industrial and Labor Relations said the nature of power
ensures contenders for Presser's job.
   ``I think he wants to run things from the hospital, but I don't
know how he's going to do it,'' Salvatore said. ``This is what
(former Teamsters president) Jimmy Hoffa was going to do from jail,
and Frank Fitzsimmons had other ideas.''
   ``If the incapacitation becomes permanent, the question seems to
be who will win the power struggle, who will take over,'' Salvatore
added. ``But those aren't the real issues. The real issue is that
the nation's largest union has no internal democratic structure.''
   Mathis discounted reports that Presser's illness and his May 4
start of a four-month leave of absence had sparked a power struggle.
   ``This meeting was called to report to the board on the
procedures to be followed in the absence of the general president,
to make sure we continue to operate in an orderly manner,'' he said.
   At least five members of the 18-member executive committee
failed to attend Monday's meeting here, but Mathis denied that they
were dissenting although some had wanted to meet in Washington.
Several were on vacation or ill and one excused himself because he
was placing his wife in a hospital, Mathis said.
   The committee is comprised of vice presidents, Presser and the
secretary-treasurer.
   Mathis said he had not been told how Presser was faring or given
details of his condition, which he described as ``lesions of the
brain.''
   ``I know that he left a Cleveland clinic and came out here for
an evaluation of whether the condition was operable,'' Mathis said.
   Mathis said he did not know whether Presser's leave of absence
would last longer than four months. But he added, ``I don't expect
him to be out longer than that.''
   Presser is scheduled to stand trial on July 12 in U.S. District
Court in Cleveland on embezzlement and racketeering charges.
   Presser's attorneys have said he does not want to postpone the
trial, but was too ill to attend a hearing this week by U.S.
District Judge George White to discuss Presser's health. The
hearing was rescheduled for June 3.
   Presser is accused, along with two other Teamsters officials, of
siphoning $700,000 in union funds to no-show employees from
Teamsters Local 507 in Cleveland. Presser remains
secretary-treasurer of Local 507, his hometown local.
   Presser, who has been Teamsters president since 1983, has
pleaded innocent. His attorneys say Presser was a government
informant and was authorized by the FBI to pay the so-called ghost
employees.

   President Reagan's doctor has taken former
White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan to task for alleging
that astrology might have played a part in the timing of the
president's 1985 operation for colon cancer.
   ``At no time was astrology consulted,'' presidential physician
Col. John Hutton said in a letter released Monday by the White
House.
   Hutton sent the letter to Time magazine, which printed excerpts
from Regan's book, ``For the Record.'' In the book, the former
presidential aide disclosed that Nancy Reagan consulted an
astrologer for help in determining the president's schedule.
   Although White House officials confirmed that the first lady had
an interest in astrology, they refused to point to specific
incidents in which it was used.
   A telephone call placed to the White House physician was not
immediately returned.
   Hutton said in the letter that the subject of astrology never
came up in the conversation he witnessed between the president and
first lady about the timing of the cancer surgery.
   Regan's book discusses a conversation he had with the first lady
before the president's July 1985 surgery in which she told Regan
the surgery might have to be delayed for a day and a half. Regan
said he was concerned by that comment.
   ``First, that President Reagan's condition was more serious than
his wife had been able to tell me over the phone, and second, that
the first lady was choosing a date for surgery in consultation with
her astrologer,'' Regan wrote.
   Hutton criticized Regan for making that allegation.
   ``Unfortunately, Mr. Regan chose the second alternative as the
most likely and on this false assumption provides the reader with
the first element of incorrect information concerning an event he
did not witness,'' Hutton said.
   The physician, an Army colonel, said that following an
examination of the president's colon on July 12, 1985, ``a large
suspicious mass or polyp'' was discovered, four sites were
biopsied, and ``a presumptive diagnosis of cancer was made.''
   The president's team of doctors recommended that the surgery be
scheduled for the next day and ``the first lady agreed that we
should proceed as soon as possible,'' Hutton wrote.

<HEAD>Ford Says Replacement Hoses May Account For Ambulance Fires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoses improperly installed by ambulance
operators may have caused coolant to leak and set fire to engines,
Ford Motor Co. said after regulators were asked to order a recall.
   A petition filed by a consumers group with the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration requested the recall of 16,000
1983-1987 Ford E-350 ambulances after reports of four engine fires
in March and April.
   ``In each case, the vehicle emitted an antifreeze odor, had a
recent service history involving coolant loss or was identified as
having a coolant line rupture after the fire,'' said the petition
by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often critical of
the auto industry and its regulators.
   Ford spokesman Chuck Snearly said Monday the automaker was
gathering information on the reports and will act accordingly.
   In most of the cases Ford had investigated, the hoses had been
replaced to reroute coolant to an auxiliary heater in the back of
the ambulance, Snearly said.
   ``The hoses that were used possibily weren't up to Ford
specifications, and in some cases might have been improperly
routed,'' Snearly said. ``Some of the hoses weren't properly
attached.''
   NHTSA said it would respond to the petition within 120 days but
would have no comment beforehand.
   The Ford E-350 ambulances were recalled last year for repair of
a fuel system problem that the center said caused 24 fires
resulting in 15 injuries. The four recent fires were in ambulances
that had been repaired under the 1987 recall.
   Snearly said there was no connection between the reported
coolant leaks and the earlier fuel-system problem.
   Two of the coolant-hose fires occurred in Missouri and one each
in Minnesota and Virginia, the center said. Missouri Attorney
General William L. Webster last month warned the state's ambulance
services of the possibility of engine fires.
   In other regulatory actions, NHTSA said Monday it had opened
preliminary evaluations of alleged safety problems with 150,000
1988-model Chevrolet Berettas made by General Motors Corp. and
400,000 1983-1987 GM S10 and S15 compact trucks.
   NHTSA said alleged failure of the left rear-wheel spindle in the
Berettas could result in the loss of a rear wheel. The agency had
unconfirmed reports of two accidents resulting in one injury.
   The S10s and S15s allegedly were liable to fracturing of the
rear axle, the agency said. NHTSA had unconfirmed reports of four
accidents, three of which resulted in one injury each.
   GM spokesman Bill Noack said the company was working on its
response. ``As in the past, we will cooperate fully with NHTSA, but
I would mention that just because there is a preliminary
evaluation, it does not necessarily mean there is a defect,'' Noack
said.
   NHTSA also upgraded to an engineering analysis, the next higher
category of investigation, its preliminary evaluations of alleged
electrical fires in the 1987 Ford Aerostar vans and of stalling in
Ford's 1986-1987 Taurus and Sable cars.

<HEAD>Clod-Buster Turns up on Reagan Disclosure Form</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan last year accepted from four
close friends ``a flat thing with a lot of little spikes'' valued
at $745, his spokesman says.
   Marlin Fitzwater offered that explanation Monday for a harrow
that turned up on Reagan's annual financial disclosure form. The
farm implement was a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Earle Jorgensen and Mr.
and Mrs. William Wilson, longtime California friends of the
president.
   Fitzwater described the harrow as ``a flat thing with a lot of
little spikes, just like that, and it breaks up clods. You pull it
behind a tractor.''
   Asked why the president accepted the harrow, Fitzwater replied,
``You never know where a clod might appear.''
   The farm implement was among several gifts that the president
and his wife Nancy accepted, including a $337 workbench that Reagan
got from another friend, Mrs. Henry Salvatori.
   The financial disclosure form masked the Reagans' true net
worth, since the value of their assets and holdings was reported
merely in ranges, such as from $15,000 to $50,000.
   For instance, Reagan's 688-acre Rancho del Cielo in the Santa
Ynez Mountains near Santa Barbara, Calif., purchased in 1974 for
$526,000 and with $127,000 in improvements eight years later, was
listed simply as being worth more than $250,000, the highest
category.
   It was impossible to determine the value of the blind trust that
holds the bulk of Reagan's investments. It, too, was listed as
being valued at over $250,000.
   Reagan holds four life insurance policies, the largest being
worth no more than $100,000 and the smallest worth up to $5,000,
the form said. Two other polices are valued at up to $15,000.
   The nearly $4,000 worth of gifts included an engraved crystal
bowl valued at $1,585 from the American Association of Neurological
Surgeons, and a wool shawl and leather gloves valued at $360 for
first lady Nancy Reagan from Bernard Arnault of Paris, the chairman
of the board of Christian Dior.
   Reagan received gold cuff links valued at $800 from Beverly
Hills jeweler Marvin Hime, who made an identical set for Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A silver and bronze statuette, valued at $150, was accepted from
Italian President Giovanni Spadolini.
   Fitzwater said ``these are gifts that they are keeping and
declaring'' under federal gift-receiving rules.
   Foreign gifts valued at over $180 have to be reported, and
domestic gifts worth $100 or more must be reported.
   The financial disclosure form also showed that Mrs. Reagan
inherited at least $170,000 in securities and trust assets from her
mother, Edith Luckett Davis, who died last year.
   It said Mrs. Reagan received $85,000 worth of Federal Farm
Credit Banks Funding Corp. securities and $50,000 in U.S. Treasury
notes last year. The assets were inherited by Mrs. Reagan from her
mother, said White House spokesman B.J. Cooper.
   In addition, the first lady received a 50 percent interest in a
trust fund that had been set up for her mother by her mother's
husband, the late Loyal Davis. The other half went to her brother,
Dr. Richard Davis.
   The trust fund was valued at between $70,000 and $165,000,
meaning that Mrs. Reagan's share was between $35,000 and $82,500.
   The form also showed that Mrs. Reagan purchased $15,000 worth of
debt-obligation bonds in an oil and gas enterprise, Tosco Corp.,
but it was unclear whether that was part of the first lady's
inheritance.
   Apart from her inheritance, Mrs. Reagan bought $50,000 in
California state general obligation bonds, rolling over the
proceeds from state bonds that had matured last year.

<HEAD>Farm Drivers Should Be Exempt From Commercial Vehicle Rules,
Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drivers of farm vehicles should be exempted
from regulations being considered to implement a 2-year-old federal
law regulating commercial vehicles, says an Agriculture Department
official.
   Martin F. ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the USDA's office of
transportation, said Monday that drivers of farm vehicles are not
commercial drivers and should be excluded from the Commercial Motor
Vehicle Act of 1986.
   ``Compared to non-farm drivers, they drive shorter distances,
fewer total miles and have a lower rate of involvement in fatal
accidents,'' he said. ``The minimal risk presented by these drivers
does not justify the burden that would be imposed on them or on
enforcement officials if all the provisions of the act were to be
enforced.''
   Fitzpatrick said the law requires that the drivers of commercial
vehicle with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds have a
single driver's license with a single driving record, be tested for
the type of vehicle driven, and be required to notify their
employer and home state of any traffic violations.
   Regulations to implement the law are currently under
consideration by the Transportation Department.
   Fitzpatrick said the law gives the secretary of transportation
authority to waive any class of drivers or vehicles from any or all
of the law's provisions.

<HEAD>Law Enforcement Agencies Glad Ruling's In The Bag</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling that allows police to
search discarded garbage without a warrant may encourage law
enforcement officials to expand use of the unusual investigatory
technique, a civil rights organization says.
   ``Now that the police know the way is clear, they may say, `Gee,
what a good idea,''' said Arthur Spitzer of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Law enforcement groups hailed the ruling.
   Jerald Vaughn, executive director of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, said, ``We're very pleased.''
   He said if the court had ruled the other way, ``It certainly
would have increased the difficulty of making investigations. It
certainly would not have made our job any easier.''
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices ruled Monday that the privacy rights
Americans enjoy do not extend to discarded garbage.
   ``It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at
the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals,
children, scavengers, snoops and other members of the public,''
said Justice Byron R. White for the court.
   ``The police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes
from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by
any member of the public,'' he said.
   The justices reinstated charges against a California man and a
female companion accused of possessing drugs for purpose of selling
them. Police discovered evidence of narcotics in garbage left at
the curb for collection outside the man's home in Laguna Beach.
   Monday's ruling, however, does not condone warrantless police
searches of garbage left on private property in close proximity to
the home.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which generally requires
police to get court search warrants, does not cover instances when
there is no legitimate expectation of privacy, White said.
   ``Even the refuse of prominent Americans has not been
invulnerable,'' he remarked. He pointed out that in 1975 a reporter
for the National Enquirer seized five bags of garbage from the
sidewalk outside the home of then-Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger in a fashionable Washington neighborhood.
   But Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said,
``Scrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted
notions of civilized behavior.
   ``I suspect, therefore, that members of our society will be
shocked to learn that the court, the ultimate guarantor of liberty,
deems unreasonable our expectation that the aspects of our private
lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become
public,'' Brennan said.
   He added: ``A search of trash, like a search of the bedroom, can
relate intimate details about sexual practices, health and personal
hygiene (as well as) financial and professional status, political
affiliations and inclinations, private thoughts, personal
relationships and romantic interests.''
   In other action, the court:
   _Let stand a ruling in a case from New Jersey that pregnant
prison inmates have the right to free abortions if they can not
afford them. A lower court's ruling in the case is binding on all
local, state and federal prisons in New Jersey, Delaware and
Pennsylvania.
   _Turned down the appeal of former Yale University professor
Vladimir Sokolov, who is fighting efforts to strip him of U.S.
citizenship. Government lawyers say he wrote ``vicious attacks on
Jews'' for a Russian-language newspaper controlled by the Nazis
during World War II.
   _Ruled unanimously that the Federal Communications Commission
has exclusive authority to regulate the technical quality of cable
television signals. The court refused to let state and local
officials impose more stringent requirements.

<HEAD>Study Disputes Bennett Claim On Teacher Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study commissioned by Education Secretary
William Bennett's own department disputes his frequent claim that
teacher unions are a major obstacle to school reform.
   Bennett had no comment Monday on the RAND Corp. study, which was
financed by his Office of Educational Research and Improvement.
   The report, ``Teacher Unions and Education Reform,'' said that
unions generally have accommodated reforms, even when they had
misgivings.
   But it also said rank-and-file teachers are unwilling to accept
reforms as a substitute for bread-and-butter improvements in their
basic working conditions.
   Eighty percent of America's nearly 2.3 million public school
teachers belong to unions, and 60 percent of them are covered by
collective bargaining contracts.
   The presidents of both the National Education Association and
the American Federation of Teachers expressed delight at the RAND
findings, which were based on a review of more than 150 teacher
contracts and an analysis of reform legislation in six states.
   AFT President Albert Shanker said the researchers found that at
the local level, union-initiated reforms can only succeed ``in
places where the union is strong enough to risk change.''
   ``That means that traditional bread-and-butter items, like
clean, safe classrooms and high quality teaching materials, have to
be secured,'' he said.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, the NEA president, said collective
bargaining and school reform are compatible. ``Teachers through
their organizations are trying to work with legislatures and with
school districts to bring about reform,'' she said.
   Bennett has charged repeatedly that obstructionist unions are
the major obstacle to improving America's schools. Last month, in
his own report, ``American Education: Making It Work,'' Bennett
said ``sound education reforms are threatened by the determined
opposition they elicit'' from those who claim that fixing the
schools ``will first require a fortune in new funding.''
   ``Almost without fail, wherever a worthwhile school proposal or
legislative initiative is under consideration, those with a vested
interest in the educational status quo will use political muscle to
block reform,'' Bennett said.
   The RAND researchers, Lorraine M. McDonnell and Anthony Pascal,
did not mention Bennett by name, but said: ``Despite charges to the
contrary, teacher unions have not been a major obstacle to
educational reform.''
   Instead, they have tried to accommodate demands for reform,
``even in those instances where a specific reform initiative has
run counter to their organizational interests or has been at odds
with the professional judgment of their members.''
   It said the unions' ``accommodation and acceptance was
critical'' to smooth implementation of school reforms. ``If teacher
unions had wanted to block reform policies, they could probably
have done so quite successfully in many local districts.''
   But ``in some cases, accommodation occurred by default because
state and local organizations lacked the resources to oppose reform
policies,'' the study said.
   The researchers at RAND, a Santa Monica, Calif., think-tank,
analyzed 151 teacher contracts reached between 1970 and 1985, and
studied the reforms enacted in six states: Arizona, California,
Florida, Georgia, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.
   ``In most of the states, the teacher organizations made a
conscious decision to mute their opposition and to accommodate the
policies espoused by others,'' the report said. ``They did not want
to be viewed as intransigent or `anti-reform.'''
   ``While the AFT quickly moved toward a position of leadership in
shaping new approaches to teacher professionalism, the NEA shifted
from initial opposition to some reform proposals, on to
accommodation and finally to a position where it now supports and
encourages local affiliates to experiment with new approaches to
professionalism,'' the report said.
   Efforts to ``professionalize'' teaching in Rochester, N.Y., Dade
County, Fla., Jefferson County, Ky., and elsewhere have included
such steps as giving classroom teachers a larger say in school
governance and curriculum decisions, as well as creation of a new
category of master teachers.

<HEAD>139 High School Seniors Named Presidential Scholars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 139 high school seniors chosen as 1988
Presidential Scholars will each receive a $1,000 award and will be
feted in Washington next month during a round of ceremonies
including a White House visit.
   The administration announced the winners Monday. They include at
least one boy and girl from each state, and were honored for
achievements in both academics and the arts.
   They have been invited to Washington June 13-17, when they will
receive their Presidential Scholar medallions at the White House.
   Of the winners, 121 were selected on the basis of academic
achievements, leadership qualities, character and ideals; 18 were
chosen for their accomplishments in the performing or creative
arts, as well as leadership and character.
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett said in a statement:
``These young men and women have worked hard and they have much to
show for it. We are proud to recognize them and thereby reaffirm
our national commitment to excellence in education.''
   The winners were chosen from a field of 1,500 seniors who scored
high on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American College Test
and who had top grades and extracurricular activities.
   That field was winnowed to 500 after the students submitted
essays, self-assessments, school recommendations and transcripts. A
Commission on Presidential Scholars subsequently made the final
selection.
   The program is in its 24th year. Each student has named his or
her most influential teacher, who will also be brought to
Washington and receive a certificate from the Department of
Education.
   The Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation of Morristown, N.J., provides
$1,000 awards to each scholar to pursue an ``educational dream.''
The General Motors Corp. provides financial support for the
scholars' recognition week in Washington.

   An Afghan government that includes
Marxists and Moslems is within reach even though the guerrillas
have vowed to seize the country when the Soviets leave, a United
Nations official said.
   Undersecretary-General Diego Cordovez, who mediated the April 14
agreement for the removal of Soviet troops, said he has begun
promoting contacts among disparate Afghan groups in an effort to
form a broad-based government.
   ``I think there is more communication now between the Afghans
themselves than you think,'' he said told a news conference on
Monday. ``The effects of the settlement and troop withdrawal are
beginning to sink in.''
   About 1,300 Soviet soldiers pulled out of the northeastern city
of Jalalabad on Sunday, the first contigent of troops to withdraw
under the international accord signed in Geneva.
   The Soviets intervened militarily in December 1979 to help the
Marxist government battle the predominately Moslem guerrillas who
have been backed by the United States and Pakistan.
   Under the Geneva accord, all of the 115,000 Soviet military
personnel in Afghanistan are to be withdrawn within nine months.
   The agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with guarantees
by the United States and Soviet Union, also calls for an end to
outside interference and repatriation of more than 5 million Afghan
refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
   ``The agreement also says the desirable government is a
broad-based government involving all segments of Afghan society now
living inside and outside the country,'' Cordovez said. ``That is
what I hope will be achieved.''
   Afghan guerrillas, who received support from the United States
and Pakistan, have rejected the accords and have vowed to continue
fighting. They did not participate in the Geneva negotiations.
   Cordovez declined to answer questions about allegations that
arms for the rebels are still being moved into Afghanistan, mainly
from Pakistan.
   He said if a formal complaint is lodged about such arms
shipments, ``My approach would be to discuss the problem with
whoever is involved on a case-by-case basis.''
   A U.N. peace mission in the country will have 50 unarmed
military officers headquartered in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and
Islamabad, Pakistan, where many of the guerrilla groups have
offices. The mission also will have a civilian support staff of 40
to 50 people.
   Cordovez confirmed the 50 military officers now are deployed,
and said 10 were in Jalalabad as Soviet troops began to leave
Sunday.
   Members of the U.N. mission are from Austria, Canada, Denmark,
Fiji, Finland, Ghana, Ireland, Nepal, Poland and Sweden.
   Cordovez said the top U.N. officer in the area, Maj. Gen. Rauli
Helminen of Finland, was assured by Afghanistan and Pakistan that
they would implement the Geneva accords.
   ``We have been given full assurances that we will observe this
(withdrawal) operation and ... on the day in which they (Soviet
troops) cross the border, there will be United Nations military
officers on the border between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union,''
he said.

   Bermuda's hotel workers called off a
strike they had planned to begin on Wednesday.
   The decision was reached Monday after the government offered to
establish a board of inquiry into the workers' 5-month-old
employment contract dispute.
   The offer won narrow acceptance in a secret ballot among the
members of the Bermuda Industrial Union, said the union's
president, Ottiwell Simmons.
   ``This strike is off for the moment,'' said Simmons, who
represents about 3,000 hotel workers in the British colony.
   Workers are demanding salary increases of at least 13 percent.
The hotels offered an 8 percent increase. Workers also want to
reduce work week from six days to five and a say in managing their
$12 million pension fund.

<HEAD>Bush Backs Away From Reagan Record On Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When George Bush talks about Republican
presidents who protected the environment, he praises Theodore
Roosevelt's accomplishments and mentions Richard Nixon. But the
vice president doesn't cite Ronald Reagan.
   The GOP nominee-apparent usually keeps himself well-aligned with
Reagan administration policies, but on Monday he began to put some
space between his campaign and Reagan's environmental record.
   `I don't think we've been doing enough to protect our
environment in recent years. We need to do more,'' he said.
   Bush was also blasting a published report that linked his
national security adviser, Donald Gregg, with a Contra arms-supply
operation that was bankrolled with drug money.
   Bush accused Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, who chairs a
Senate subcommittee that has been looking into the allegations, of
leaking ``slanderous'' information about the matter.
   ``I would challenge Sen. Kerry ... to show some evidence and
stop leaking out information that's not fair or true,'' he told
reporters in Seattle on Monday.
   Kerry could not be reached for comment Monday night, but The
Washington Post quoted him in today's editions as denying that he
or his staff was responsible. The most recent report about the
matter appeared in Newsweek magazine.
   ``Some magazine elects to reprint garbage,'' Bush said. ``I get
annoyed. Some insidious political game is going on.''
   On environmental issues, the vice president was distancing
himself from Reagan.
   ``A new administration is a time for change, a time for renewal.
I will put the very best people we can find to work on our
environmental agenda,'' Bush told the Greater Seattle Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``A Bush administration will enforce environmental laws
aggressively, putting the responsibility for the cleanup where it
belongs _ on those who caused the problem in the first place,'' he
said.
   The vice president met privately Monday with Washington state
backers of Pat Robertson, who halted his presidential campaign
Monday.
   Bruce Hawkins, Robertson's state organizer, said he was happy
with the meeting.
   ``I didn't have to pledge anything,'' Bush told reporters
afterward. He said Robertson wouldn't have enough delegates to
disrupt things at the convention in New Orleans anyway.
   He quickly added, ``I don't want to suggest they're going to go
there and be disruptive.''
   The vice president was asked by reporters in Seattle about
Attorney General Edwin Meese's firing of his chief spokesman, Terry
Eastland, but refused to comment. He also declined to say whether
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was the kind of
``drug kingpin'' Bush has proposed the death penalty for.
   Environmental issues have been the focus of Bush's weeklong
Western swing _ both in his speeches and in his actions, including
a raft trip down an Oregon river on Sunday.
   Today he shifts his focus to agriculture, with a tour of two
orchards near Fresno and a briefing on the state of the farm
economy.
   Both themes are aimed at bolstering the vice president in the
general election, Bush aides say, emphasizing the importance of the
Pacific Coast states in winning the White House in November. Bush
trails Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis in recent polls in
both California and Oregon.
   The vice president on Monday demonstrated some prowess with a
forklift, impressing a sawmill operator as he deftly lowered a pile
of logs into a lake for storage.
   ``How 'bout that,'' Bush said as they landed.
   Alex Cugini, Jr., president and manager of the family-operated
sawmill near Seattle, said Bush ``showed a lot of finesse,'' and
added: ``I'd definitely hire him.''

   A film debating the leadership of Josef V. Stalin
premiered on nationwide television after censors held it back for
eight months and the director was reprimanded for putting the
nation's history on public trial.
   ``The Process'' discusses the late dictator's repression of real
and imagined political opponents, mass deportation of people who
resisted the spread of Soviet rule in the Baltic and the Ukraine
and other topics.
   Most of the Soviets interviewed in the two-hour documentary
aired Monday night condemned Stalin's 29-year leadership. But there
were others who saw him as the force that transformed a peasant
nation ravaged by revolution and war into an industrial and
military power.
   ``Instead of wasting time and talking about how to catch up with
the highly developed countries, it was necessary to make people
work,'' an academician identified as Medovar stated in the film.
``How could it have been done? By persuasion? No, only in this
way.''
   Anna Bukharin-Larina, widow of Nikolai I. Bukharin, had harsh
words for Stalin. ``He was cunning, perfidious, artful,
vindictive,'' Ms. Larina said. ``I consider him a criminal.''
   Bukharin, an early member of the Communist Party Politburo, was
expelled in 1929 for disagreeing with Stalin and was executed in
1938 after a show trial.
   Excerpts of the heated condemnations of show-trial prosecutor
Andrei Vyshinsky followed a film clip in which Stalin raises a
rifle and takes aim.
   The juxtaposition apparently was director Igor Belyaev's way of
symbolically saying that Stalin was behind the deaths of Bukharin
and other revolutionary contemporaries of Soviet founder Vladimir
I. Lenin.
   Ms. Larina read a letter written by her husband when he knew
Stalin had targeted him. The letter appealed to a future leader to
clear Bukharin's name and expose Stalin's crimes against the Soviet
people.
   Ms. Larina said she memorized the letter and recited it to
herself each day when she was in a labor camp following Bukharin's
death. The letter was made public last November. Bukharin was fully
rehabilitated in February.
   The second half of the film opened with footage from the late
1920s showing zealots blowing up churches and driving wagons over
crops in the brutal collectivization campaign. The footage was
accompanied by historian Vladimir Tikhonov's claim that the drive
was carried out ``at a barbaric pace.''
   Veterans of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought the
Soviets to power told of bread rationing and hunger that followed
collectivization, but argued among themselves about the need for
the drive and about its success.
   In a discussion after scenes from an anti-Stalinist play,
``Dictatorship of Conscience,'' young people said that some were
confused by the rejection of their past.
   The review and rejection of Stalinism, carried in articles in
the Soviet press over the past year, is seen as part of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's perestroika campaign that aims to rebuild society and
root out stagnation.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda published an article on Saturday saying the
film, prepared in advance of last November's 70th anniversary of
the revolution, was held back by censors for eight months and that
director Belyaev was reprimanded for the heavy criticism in the
documentary.
   The newspaper concluded that the Soviet Union would not have
been ready for the film without first facing the facts about
Stalin's legacy in the smaller doses that have been administered
over the last year.
   ``There is no confidence that this will last,'' a young Soviet
worker said of Gorbachev's social reforms. ``We don't know what
will be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and nobody will tell
you what he really thinks.''

   Honduras' ambassador to Panama tried to smuggle
more than 25 pounds of cocaine into the United States by stashing
it in clothing in his suitcase, authorities said.
   A U.S. magistrate on Monday ordered Rigoberto Regalado Lara,
step-brother of Honduras' armed forces commander-in-chief, held
without bond on a charge of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute.
   Regalado, 49, was arrested Sunday after he arrived at Miami
International Airport from Tegucigalpa on TAN Airlines Flight 808,
according to court records.
   An affidavit said that during an examination of Regalado's
luggage, a U.S. Customs inspector ``discovered a white powdery
substance secreted inside 10 packages surrounded by coffee and
wrapped in plastic, concealed inside pants legs and other clothing
in his suitcase.'' Tests showed that the substance contained 25.85
pounds of cocaine, the affidavit said.
   A narcotics agent who spoke on the condition that he not be
identified said cocaine smugglers sometimes use coffee to block
detection by dogs.
   U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo scheduled a second hearing for
Thursday. Regalado was being held in the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center.
   The Honduran Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, announced Monday night
it suspended Regalado's diplomatic status, and that U.S.
authorities were free to prosecute.
   If convicted, Regalado would be liable for ``the corresponding
legal sanctions'' in Honduras and the United States, said Eugenio
Castrol, a spokesman for the Honduran Foreign Ministry in
Tegucigalpa.
   ``This once again is a demonstration that the government of
President Jose Azcona Hoyo is engaged in open combat against drug
trafficking ... without discrimination of any kind,'' said the
communique from Tegucigalpa.
   Regalado, a retired army colonel and Honduran ambassador to
Panama since 1986, is a step-brother of Gen. Humberto Regalado
Hernandez, the armed forces commander-in-chief of Honduras.
   In February, the Los Angeles Times reported that the general was
suspected of protecting Colombian traffickers who used Honduras as
a staging base for cocaine shipments to the United States. However,
the general, and the U.S. ambassador to Honduras, Everett Briggs,
denied the report.
   Leon Kellner, the U.S. attorney in Miami, called the case a
tragedy.
   ``It shows what drug-oriented money will do in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said Kellner, who also is prosecuting Panamanian
military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on drug trafficking
charges. ``No one is immune from the lure of drug-generated money _
not even an ambassador.''
   Honduras experienced an outbreak of anti-American sentiment
after April 5, when Juan Ramon Matta, 43, considered an
international cocaine kigpin, was arrested and whisked out of the
country.
   Matta was taken to the United States to face drug trafficking
charges and questioning in the 1986 torture-slaying in Mexico of
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   He is in a federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.

   Vice President Salvador Laurel today
called for a national referendum to decide whether American
military bases can remain in the Philippines after 1991.
   The United States and the Philippines are holding talks on the
1947 agreement under which the Americans maintain six installations
here, including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base.
   The outcome is expected to determine whether the Manila
government will allow the bases to remain after the agreement
expires in September 1991.
   In an interview with radio station DZRH, Laurel said today:
   ``It is to the long-range interest of both nations that we
should know the sentiments of the Filipino regarding the military
bases. We had been arguing and debating on this issue since 1947,
almost 41 years. We should end the debate once and for all through
a national referendum.''
   The Filipino constitution says any extension of the bases
agreement must be through a formal treaty subject to approval by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition is strong.
   The constitution gives Congress the option of referring the
issue to the electorate in a national referendum.
   On Monday, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said the Americans
should pay more for use of the bases and if they refuse ``they
should go.'' The Philippines receives about $180 million a year for
use of the bases. Manglapus is chief of the Philippine panel which
is negotiating on the bases.
   The chief American negotiator, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt,
has said that budget constraints may make it hard for Washington to
provide a substantial increase.
   U.S. officials say they are working with Japan, West Germany and
other American allies to put together a major new aid package for
the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino has said she does not want the new aid
linked to the future of the bases. She has pledged to honor the
bases agreement through 1991, but refuses to say if she will
support an extension.

   A crowded cable car heading down one of the
city's steepest hills in light rain rammed the rear of a truck at a
stop light near Fisherman's Wharf on Monday, injuring at least 31
people.
   ``I was sitting inside when the brakeman said, `Hold on, hold
on.' I held on, then we hit. We were going very fast down the
hill,'' said Esther Breckenridge, of St. Charles, Mo., favoring a
bruised leg.
   The accident occurred at the intersection of Hyde and Bay
streets, a few blocks from the popular tourist attractions on
Fisherman's Wharf.
   At least 29 people were taken to hospitals and two were treated
at the scene. Five people were admitted to the hospital with
fractures, but no one was seriously injured, said San Francisco
General Hospital spokeswoman Gloria Rodriguez.
   Witnesses told police the cable car, which normally moves at a
maximum 9 mph, seemed to accelerate as it moved down one of the
steepest hills on the 115-year-old system in a drizzle. It struck
the rear of a Kingston Contracting Co. ``cherry-picker'' repair
truck, hurling inside passengers forward and tossing those riding
outside to the pavement.
   On Dec. 3, 1967, at the same intersection, a cable car careened
into several automobiles, killing two people and injuring 43.
   ``I saw the trolley coming down the hill very fast and then it
stopped and people starting flying out,'' said a woman clerk at a
nearby dry cleaning shop, who declined to give her name.
   ``By the time we got to the bottom of the hill, we were going 30
or 40 miles per hour when we hit,'' said Jed Porter of Kansas City,
Mo., who was wrapped in a blanket.
   But Municipal Railway George Newkirk said all systems on the car
seemed to be operating properly.
   ``Everything that was supposed to work worked, but we weren't
able to stop,'' he said. ``That could be caused by the weather or
some other things that we are going to be checking for the next
couple of days to see exactly what happened, whether it was
mechanical failure or just a freak accident.''
   He also said it was unlikely that the car was traveling as fast
as witnesses reported.
   He said the cable car's gripman, Gerald Bolden, has been with
Muni since 1981 and has a clean record. But Oakland television
station KTVU reported Monday night that Bolden had been a cable car
gripman only two weeks and received a month of training for the
position.
   There was no answer at Kingston's San Francisco offices. The
truck driver declined to give his name or to comment, except to
say, ``I don't feel good.''
   At the scene, the front of cable car No. 13 was ripped from the
car and the rear of the truck was crushed.
   Cable cars, one of the city's greatest treasures and a hugely
popular tourist attraction, operate by using a mechanical grip to
grab a moving cable. The car is stopped by using a friction brake
in the cable slot. An emergency brake, consisting of a metal spike
jammed into the slot, was welded into the slot by the heat created
by the moving car. Although it had to be cut loose with a torch, it
failed to halt the car.
   The system, designed by Andrew S. Hallidie, was shut down for 20
months for a $58 million overhaul in 1982. In March, the Powell
Street line celebrated its 100th birthday.

<HEAD>Federal Worker Who Won Harassment Case Says Office Was `Sexual
Playground'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer
who says the office had so many affairs going on that it ``operated
as a brothel'' may soon be clinching her legal victory over the
agency after winning the first round in court.
   SEC Chairman David Ruder said Monday that SEC lawyers were
scheduled to meet today with counsel for Catherine Broderick, who
had asked Ruder to discuss a way to avert a lengthy battle in the
federal appeals court.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled Friday that Ms.
Broderick, who worked for five years in the SEC's Washington
regional office, suffered sexual harassment by being forced to work
in a hostile environment.
   Pratt found that female employees who had sexual or other social
relationships with managers of the regional office's enforcement
division received promotions, positive evaluations and cash bonuses.
   But Ms. Broderick received negative evaluations, threats of
dismissal and eventually a transfer when she complained about
having ``to work in a hostile work environment.''
   Ms. Broderick told reporters Monday she hopes her former
supervisors will be fired for using the office as a ``sexual
playground.''
   ``The office operated as a brothel,'' she said.
   ``The affairs were carried on at the office and flaunted in
front of other employees,'' Broderick told reporters. ``They went
out for three-hour lunches and used the office for rendezvous after
work and on weekends.''
   Ruder, meanwhile, said in a statement that he was ``concerned
about the implications of the Broderick decision.''
   Indications of a possible settlement are a marked departure from
the SEC's previous stance in the case. During the trial, which took
place before Ruder became chairman the SEC had branded Ms.
Broderick as ``paranoid.'' Pratt specifically rejected that
assertion.
   Pratt scheduled a May 26 hearing to determine what sanctions to
impose against the SEC, which is likely to include an order that
Ms. Broderick receive promotions. The judge ruled she was denied
promotions even though she met eligibility requirements.
   Although Ms. Broderick herself was the victim of only isolated
incidents of direct sexual overtures, ``conduct of a sexual nature
was so pervasive ... that it can reasonably be said that such
conduct created a hostile or offensive work environment which
affected the motivation and work performance of those who found
such conduct repugnant and offensive,'' Pratt said.
   Ms. Broderick and attorneys S. Beville May and Lawrence King
called on Ruder to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the
agency officials. The judge said the officials gave testimony that
was ``deserving of little credence.''
   Ruder's statement noted that ``a determination whether to appeal
would be made by the entire commission.''
   Pratt's ruling included a finding that former SEC Chairman John
Shad, now U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, and executive
director George Kundahl took no action after learning of Ms.
Broderick's complaints.

   The British Broadcasting Corp. sold the Hulton
Picture Library, one of Europe's largest commercial collections of
photographs, engravings and maps, to the chairman of a cable
television company.
   Michael Checkland, BBC director-general, announced the sale on
Monday but refused to say how much Brian Deutsch, chairman of City
Center Cable Ltd., had agreed to pay for the collection of more
than 10 million images.
   The sale attracted inquiries from around the world, and the
British domestic news agency, Press Association, said bids ranged
up to $5.6 million.
   The illustrations and engravings in the collection date back to
the 16th century. Some record the Indian mutiny against British
rule in 1857-58.
   The collection contains a photo of a London bus at the bottom of
a wartime bomb crater in 1940, a shot of King George V steering a
yacht in 1924, and cameraman Bert Hardy's classic picture of
Scottish slum children in 1948.
   Checkland earlier this year described the library as a national
asset, and the BBC insisted the collection must go to what it
called a good home, remain in Britain, stay open for general use
and not be broken up.
   ``We have ensured full access for BBC program makers to this
important historical collection,'' Checkland said.
   Deutsch said: ``The BBC need have no doubt that it has gone to a
good home and to an owner who cares about its future.''
   Deutsch has formed a board of directors to be responsible for
the library. They include Lord Quinton, chairman of the
state-funded British Library.
   The collection, owned by the BBC since 1958, earns more than
$400,000 a year through the reproduction of its images in
newspapers, journals, books, films, television and videos.
   The cash-conscious BBC, currently reorganizing its commercial
operations, said it wanted to sell because it lacked proper
resources and expertise to maintain and develop the library.

<HEAD>Court's Garbage Ruling Smells Just Fine to Arizona `Garbologist'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Scotus Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Rathje can breath a lot easier because
of a Supreme Court ruling, although the garbage will smell the same
as he rummages through the trash of Tucson.
   The University of Arizona professor is a 42-year-old
archaeologist who studies garbage for what it reveals about modern
civilization. He's a garbologist.
   Rathje's 30 students spend their class time sorting through
sacks brought in from selected tracts by city sanitation workers.
The contents are logged into 185 categories.
   The Supreme Court ruled Monday in a narcotics case that once
garbage is put out for curbside collection it is not entitled to
privacy. In other words, it's OK for someone else to rummage
through it.
   If the court had ruled the other way, said Rathje, ``that would
have made it impossible to sort garbage, period, without the
permission of each and every individual homeowner in the
community.''
   But Rathje says he and his students are not interested in
snooping on individual homeowners. ``We never have any tie directly
to any household,'' he said.
   What is learned from all this? For one thing, who contributes
what to the hazardous waste problem.
   ``Lower income neighborhoods tend to do a lot of home auto
repair, so they tend to dump a lot of used motor oil, spark plugs
and batteries,'' Rathje said in a telephone interview from Tucson.
   ``Middle income neighborhoods do a lot of home fixups, and there
are paints, stains and varnishes in the waste. Upper income
families spend a lot more time gardening. Therefore pesticides,
herbicides and fertilizers are thrown out in large quantities.''
   Rathje, who began this kind of research in 1973, said the first
bag he personally sorted contained a cooked T-Bone steak wrapped in
a paper towel. Another time a bag contained the entire contents of
a picnic: hot dog rolls, mustard, hot dogs _ all still in their
unopened packages.
   ``I just have an image of a family at home deciding to go out on
a picnic; George takes the garbage out in a brown paper bag and
Martha takes the picnic out to the car. They get there and find
they brought the garbage.''
   Those people probably had enough to eat anyway, he conjectures,
because Americans waste about 15 percent of the food they buy.
   ``In Tucson, garbage amounts to 9,500 tons a year,'' he said.
``The General Accounting Office in 1977, using our data, calculated
that in the United States we throw out enough food to feed all of
Canada, if they would take our leftovers.''
   Even though his research has gone on for 14 years, Rathje still
is at the classifying site to oversee sorting the garbage.
   ``You can't send your men out where you fear to tread,'' he
said. ``If you don't have a feel for the data, you're finished.''

<HEAD>`Carrie' Closes On Broadway At A Record Loss Of $8 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto NY6</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Carrie'' didn't captivate the critics or
audiences, but the $8 million musical about a troubled teen-ager
with telekinetic powers set one kind of record.
   It closed Sunday after a brief run, the most expensive flop in
Broadway history.
   ``The reviews were not very good,'' said spokesman Jim
Baldassare, ``and it wasn't just The New York Times.''
   ``Most of `Carrie' is just a typical musical-theater botch,''
wrote Frank Rich, the Times' chief drama critic, and a majority of
his colleagues agreed.
   The show, which played five performances and 16 previews at the
Virginia Theater, was budgeted at $7 million but an extra $1
million was spent when the opening date was postponed to allow for
more rehearsals.
   The show did not have a big advance sale, according to
Baldassare, and lost some $500,000 worth of theater party business
that was canceled after the reviews came out.
   An $8 million price tag for a big Broadway musical is not
unusual today. ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Starlight
Express,'' both of which are still running, cost that much.
   Until ``Carrie's'' fast exit, the most expensive flops on
Broadway have lost between $5 million and $6 million. Among the
shows in that category were the 1986 musical ``Rags''; the 1986 Bob
Fosse musical ``Big Deal''; ``Grind,'' a burlesque musical that had
a short run in 1985 and ``Singin' in the Rain,'' a Broadway version
of the popular movie.
   ``Carrie'' was based on the Stephen King horror novel about a
girl who has the power to move and destroy objects. She is
tormented by her mother, a religious fanatic who refuses to allow
her daughter to go the prom.
   The show starred Betty Buckley as the mother and 17-year-old
Linzi Hateley in the title role. Miss Buckley, who portrayed
Carrie's sympathetic teacher in the movie ``Carrie,'' came into the
show after its pre-Broadway tryout in England. She replaced Barbara
Cook who left last March after its run at Stratford-upon-Avon.
   ``Carrie'' was produced by Friedrich Kurz, a West German
businessman, and the Royal Shakespeare Company, one of Britain's
leading theater troupes. The RSC's involvement was criticized
heavily in the British press. According to Variety, the company put
up some $600,000 and was to receive 1 percent of the weekly gross.
   The musical, Variety said, broke even at $284,000 a week, and
during its last full week of previews at the Virginia grossed only
$123,575.
   Creatively, ``Carrie'' was a joint Angelo-American effort. The
show had music and lyrics by Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford, the
team responsible for the music for the movie version of ``Fame,''
and was directed by Terry Hands, artistic head of the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
   Its cast, which included pop singer Darlene Love and dancer
Charlotte d'Amboise, was a mixture of American and British
performers. They were allowed to appear in England and New York
under a special agreement from actors' unions in both countries.
   ``Carrie'' had more success as a film. The movie, directed by
Brian DePalma, starred Sissy Spacek as the gawky, unpopular Carrie
White who is taunted and tormented by other high school students
before getting her revenge on prom night.

<HEAD>Washington Times Calls For Meese Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Times, a politically
conservative newspaper, says Attorney General Edwin Meese III
should resign because he has ``destroyed'' the Justice Department
while trying to defend his reputation.
   The editorial today calling for Meese's resignation is unusual
because the newspaper has strongly supported the Reagan
administration. It said Meese should concentrate on ``the cult of
character assassination that finally broke his spirit and weakened
his judgment.''
   The newspaper said Meese's firing of Justice Department director
of public affairs, Terry Eastland, ``makes it clear that the
embattled attorney general has decided to defend his reputation at
all costs.''
   Meese reportedly fired Eastland because he wasn't defending him
strongly enough against criticisms rising from an investigation of
Meese by independent counselor James McKay.
   The newspaper said it was calling for Meese's resignation
because ``Edwin Meese's attempts to vindicate himself have
destroyed his department.''
   The newspaper portrayed Eastland as a Meese loyalist who shared
the attorney general's constitutional agenda. It added that
Eastland ``had steadfastly battled against the sleazy insinuations
that make up the bulk of the political case against Edwin Meese.''

   A soldier whose wife and two children were
among the 27 people killed in a fiery bus crash was in shock, but
asked his fellow soldiers to pray for the survivors.
   ``As a professional soldier, he was trained to die, but not to
have his family die,'' Chaplain Michael Tilus said Monday,
referring to Army 1st Sgt. Lee Williams, 38, a Vietnam veteran.
   ``He's in the initial stages of shock. He's walking around for
20 minutes looking for his glasses when they are on his face,''
Tilus said. ``He's pacing his house at 2 in the morning.''
   ``A lot of the guys know he is a true Christian,'' Army Spec.
Thaddeus Fura said of Williams, ``but now everyone does because he
left a phone message with our Charge of Quarters asking people who
felt like it to pray for the other survivors.''
   Williams' wife, Joy, and daughters, Kristen, 14, and Robin, 10,
were aboard the church bus that crashed late Saturday as it
returned a First Assembly of God youth group and adult chaperones
from an amusement park north of Cincinnati.
   A pickup truck being driven in the wrong direction on Interstate
71 plowed head-on into the bus, causing its fuel tank to rupture
and setting the bus ablaze. Twenty-seven were killed and 42 were
injured.
   ``He has no one else,'' said Jean Grimes, Joy Williams'
identical twin. ``Joy and the kids were all he had.''
   Radcliff abuts Fort Knox and most of the families represented on
the bus had ties to the Army post.
   Seventeen of the 27 victims were spouses or children of Army
personnel and five were dependents of Fort Knox civilian employees,
said Maj. John Eagles, Fort Knox press officer.
   The Radcliff area on Monday was replete with reminders of the
tragedy. Flags were at half staff in the town of 20,000 residents
and at Fort Knox. Marquees and display signs of businesses along
Radcliff's main street contained expressions of sympathy for the
victims' families.
   At Radcliff Middle School, which lost 16 pupils in the accident,
the staff was ``just trying to use good common sense and trying to
make it an hour at a time,'' Principal Charlie Jones said Monday.
   At nearby North Hardin High School, which lost three students,
counselors and chaplains were standing by and teachers were
encouraged to talk about the accident with any students who felt
the need, Principal Ray Story said.
   One of the survivors, sophomore Allen Tennison, 15, could have
stayed home Monday but was back in class.
   ``The only way I know how to deal with it is to talk about it,''
said Tennison, son of the church's pastor, the Rev. W. Don
Tennison. ``There's times when I'm home and I look at pictures of
my friends and it hits me. But I've been numb all weekend.''
   Erica Jefferson said her 14-year-old son, Mike, hospitalized in
serious condition at Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, has
been told that his friends were killed.
   ``Oh yes, and does he blame himself that he was trying to get
out and couldn't help the others,'' Mrs. Jefferson said. ``He says
he hates to go back to sleep because all the time he sees that
blaze in his sleep.
   ``And I can tell, when he is on the monitor, that his heart was
pounding and he doesn't want to talk. But we make him talk.''

<HEAD>Reagan Backing New Offer to Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan personally approved a new
offer that could allow Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega to remain in
power while dropping drug charges against him for at least a year,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Noriega is expected to decide in a day or two whether to accept
the proposal, the newspaper reported in today's editions, citing
unidentified Reagan administration sources.
   Under the plan, Noriega would resign as commander of the
Panamanian Defense Forces in mid-August and leave the Central
American country for at least a year. Prosecutors would agree to
drop drug-trafficking charges pending in Florida and would not
refile them while Noriega was out of Panama, the newspaper said.
   The Panamanian legislature would be asked to pass a measure
limiting the military chief to a single five-year term, the Times
said.
   But apparently, Noriega's favorites would remain in control of
the country.
   President Manuel Solis Palma, Noriega's hand-picked successor to
Eric Delvalle, would be allowed to retain office, although the U.S.
would continue to recognize Devalle as rightful holder of the post,
the newspaper said. Delvalle was ousted by Noriega in February.
   The Times' sources said Reagan personally approved the offer,
which would be the latest in a series of repeatedly softened
proposals Noriega has ridiculed and rejected.
   Efforts to complete the negotiations are headed by Charles J.
Cooper, an assistant attorney general, and Elliott Abrams,
assistant secretary of state for Latin America, the sources said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government plans to make federal
transit subsidies contingent on local drug testing programs for
city transit bus and subway operators.
   Alfred Dellibovi, head of the Urban Mass Transit Administration,
said Monday that new regulations would require operators to submit
to a broad range of drug tests, including random sampling.
   The federal regulations will call on transit officials to test
for illegal use of drugs before employment, after an accident, for
reasonable cause and under a random selection process, according to
DelliBovi.
   Operators of buses and subway trains as well as others in
``sensitive'' jobs such as train dispatchers would be subject to
the testing, he said.
   UMTA provides federal financial assistance to transit systems,
although a testing program would have to be imposed and
administered by the local transit authorities.

   Cutbacks brought on by budget cuts have
lowered the price tag on the major weapons programs central to
President Reagan's military build-up by $61.8 billion.
   The Pentagon said Monday that at the close of the quarter on
Dec. 31, the 95 key programs carried a combined price tag of
$757.25 billion, down 7.5 percent from the adjusted Sept. 30, 1987,
total of $819.05 billion.
   The Pentagon attributed the quarterly decline to seven programs
that were either cancelled or ``significantly cut back'' in order
to comply with fiscal 1988 spending limits adopted last fall in a
compromise deficit-reduction package.
   Among the seven were production of Copperhead artillery rounds;
development and production of surveillance drone aircraft; and
development of a jam-proof high frequency radio system. Those cuts,
respectively, saved $423.3 million, $1.3 billion and $4.4 billion.
   Also killed were the ground-launched cruise missile program and
the satellite-killing ASAT rocket.

libraries established by the archivist of the United States.
   The nine-member advisory committee announced Monday will form a
closer alliance with the National Archives on joint public programs

support for the presidential library system, said John Fawcett,
head of presidential libraries.
   David Eisenhower, who recently wrote ``Eisenhower at War'' about
his grandfather, Dwight D. Eisenhower, is one member. Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, daughter of John F. Kennedy is another.
   They and the others will serve three-year terms. The National

   Pittsburgh Zoo officials have a new
attraction: Little Cousin, a Japanese macaque monkey who has become
something of a primate pole-vaulter.
   But zoo keepers aren't worried when Little Cousin leaps over the
20-foot wall surrounding the monkey island compound. Unlike Alphie,
another meandering monkey, he always comes home.
   The monkey business began recently when Little Cousin learned to
hop over the wall after a dozen failed attempts. Now, he makes a
break almost daily, said zoo Director Charles Wikenhauser.
   On Sunday, Little Cousin roamed the zoo grounds for hours and
then returned, evading traps set up for him.
   Wikenhauser said Little Cousin rarely leaves the zoo's 75 acres
and, when he does, he only goes as far as some nearby woods in
Highland Park.
   ``He just found he has a new skill and he's using it,'' said zoo
Curator Dennis Maxim.
   Last July, Alphie jumped the same wall and wandered about 65
miles through Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio before he was
captured in January near Bridgeport, Ohio. Since his return, Alphie
has been given his own exhibit in the zoo's children's section.

   The ``chocolate wars'' have heated up
again, but not enough to melt a 2,800 pound morsel of chocolate,
the centerpiece at this year's Chocolate Festival.
   Instead, it took three jackhammers to break up the hunk of sweet
stuff into bite-size portions.
   Organizers said Hershey Foods' fight to keep Burlington from
calling itself ``Chocolate City'' helped make this year's Chocolate
Festival a bigger success than ever.
   About 30,000 chocolate lovers, 50 percent more than attended
last year's first Chocolate Festival, packed Echo Park and the
streets of Burlington for last weekend's event.
   ``Much of the success is attributed to newspapers picking up on
`chocolate wars,''' said Norris ``Jack'' Berry, festival
coordinator. ``People heard about it and wanted to find out what
was happening in Burlington.''
   ``We'd like to thank Hershey Company for calling attention to
the greatest little city in the United States _ Chocolate City.''
   Burlington is home to a candy making plant for Nestle. Hershey,
of Hershey, Pa., is disputing the Wisconsin city's right to call
itself ``Chocolate City.''
   On Sunday, the chocolate dessert tent was buzzing to the sounds
of three jackhammers used to chisel the slope of the roughly
2,800-pound chocolate morsel into individual two- and four-pound
bags.
   The Kiwanis Club provided the manpower to break up 4,000 pounds
of semi-sweet chocolate from two huge morsels made for the occasion
by Nestle Foods employees.

   While Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev
hunker down at this month's summit in Moscow, the mayors of Dixon,
Ill., and Dickson, Siberia, may be having a caucus of their own.
   Thanks to a bureaucratic snag, the Dickson delegation from
Siberia will delay its visit to the hometown of President Reagan
until at least the end of May.
   The Soviets had planned to arrive this week and the mayor of
Dickson, Nikolai Kardamyshev, was to have thrown out the first
pitch at Saturday's Sandy Koufax league opener.
   But the Soviet Embassy Information Services Department in
Washington, D.C., notified Dixon Mayor James Dixon on Monday: ``The
Soviet delegation will leave Moscow not earlier than the end of
May. They will give the correct date when they receive their visas.
They don't have their visas yet.''
   The embassy confirmed that three people will be arriving. The
others are Kardamyshev Nikolai Vicknevskii, an interpreter; and
Boris Ivanov, a journalist.
   Dixon said he believes the delay was because at least some of
the visas were not applied for early enough. He said the process
takes 30 days.
   The mayor invited the delegation after New Year's greetings were
sent to the Illinois town in 1987.

<HEAD>Canadian Researcher Finds Evidence of North Polar Ozone Hole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian researcher says an ozone hole may be
developing in the stratosphere near the North Pole each winter just
as a similar hole is created over the South Pole.
   W.F.J. Evans, a scientist with the Department of Environment in
Canada, said Monday that instruments carried aloft by balloons
indicate a vast crater of depleted ozone forms near the North Pole
during the winter months and could act as a ``sink'' for ozone
throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
   Evans said the ozone hole is shaped like a crater, with high
sides and a deep center. The hole was discovered by releasing
research balloons from a base at Alert, a Canadian town near the
North Pole, during the first four months of each year, starting in
1986.
   Evans _ who gave a paper on his findings at the spring meeting
here of the American Geophysical Union _ said the antarctic ozone
hole may be causing a decrease in the level of ozone protecting the
whole Southern Hemisphere.
   ``If there is a similar hole in the Arctic, it could influence
the ozone in the Northern Hemisphere in the same way,'' said Evans.
He said if chemistry is playing role in the Arctic ozone depletion,
``we may start seeing five years from now an Arctic hole becoming
more and more evident.''
   The basic question, he said, is ``do we have a crack in the
north end of the bathtub as well as the south end'' that is
``draining'' or depleting the ozone.
   Atmospheric ozone forms a natural barrier against the
ultraviolet rays of the sun. Overexposure to this type of radiation
is associated with skin cancer. Satellite and aircraft studies have
found an ozone hole that develops during cold months over the South
Pole. The loss of atmospheric ozone has been blamed on chemical
reactions initiated by chlorofluorocarbons, a type of chemical used
a refrigerants and to make plastic foam.
   Evans said that due to a difference in weather patterns, there
is normally about 15 percent more ozone in the atmosphere over the
Arctic than over the Antarctic. The Arctic ozone loss, he said, is
much smaller.
   ``Even if the effect (on ozone depletion) is smaller in the
Northern Hemisphere, the effect is more important because that is
where most of the people are,'' he said. The Northern latitudes
contain most of the land mass and the human population.
   R.R. Stolarski, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space
Center, said Evans findings are important, but more study needs to
be done to make sure that the ozone hole he has found is not just a
``cold weather phenomenon.''

   For more than a decade, a friendly face and
message painted on the side of Joe and Gertrude Carpenter's white
barn has graced the quiet Wood County landscape and greeted
travelers.
   It has served as a landmark and way station, of sorts, for
motorists seeking directions or shelter from driving snowstorms.
   The barn needs painting now, said Carpenter, a 75-year-old
retired farmer. But when the new coat's on this summer, he's going
to have the smiling face, the friendly ``Hi!'' and the words Joe
and Gertie repainted on the side of the barn.
   After all, the message is a sign of love for his wife, who died
last year after a long illness.
   ``Everytime I look at it, I think of the old memories and the
people who stopped and admired it,'' he said.
   ``We were married 51 years. It's a loss. We did everything and
went everyplace together,'' Carpenter said. ``I miss her every
day.''
   The 18-foot-wide smiling face is visible from Interstate 75 and
Ohio 582, which runs from Haskins to Woodville in northwestern
Ohio. Carpenter's place is about 20 miles south of Toledo.
   The face on the barn was his wife's idea. Mrs. Carpenter, known
as Gertie, decided the face would be a fun gift to give her husband
to celebrate their 41st wedding anniversary in 1976. A year later,
a sign painter added the names Joe and Gertie.
   ``People laughed when they first saw it. But it has become a
local landmark,'' he said.
   The barnyard greeting has often been photographed and has become
a point of reference when local folks give directions. Curious
motorists often visit the Carpenter farm to hear the story of the
anniversary gift.
   ``People stop and say they want to meet Joe and Gertie. They ask
about the face. They say looking at it makes their day. We've
gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it over the years,'' Carpenter
said. ``People tell me, `Don't ever take that face off the barn.' ''
   He said his wife was a trusting person who opened the house to
stranded motorists.
   During a 1978 blizzard, he said, 14 people spent the night in
the Carpenter home.
   ``I remember that like it was yesterday. All these people
couldn't go any place because the highway was closed. It was either
spend the night here or in their cars,'' he said. ``Then she got up
in the morning and cooked breakfast for everybody.''
   She also had a keen sense of humor.
   For some years, two mannequins sat on the front porch of the
Carpenter home. Sometimes, the mannequins sat there like a young
couple courting. Mrs. Carpenter, he said, changed their clothing
with the seasons.
   Motorists did double takes as they passed the porch. But when
Gertie sold one of the mannequins, the courtship was over.
   These days, Carpenter spends most of his time making wooden
clocks and ornaments. Two of his three children live nearby.
   A few years ago, the couple designed their headstone _ a
detailed scene of the Carpenter farm with the house, mailbox and
barn with the smiling face. It also has the friendly ``Hi!'' from
Joe and Gertie etched in stone.
   ``She knew what it would look like, but she died before she saw
it,'' he said.

   Stock prices reached a new high Tuesday following
the overnight advance on Wall Street, while the dollar rose
slightly against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 27,819.98, up 60.11 points, or 0.21
percent, from its previous high reached the previous day, when it
gained a sharp 291.56 points.
   ``The stock market was boosted by overnight gains on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average went over the
2,000-dollar level,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities.
   But investors wary of the market's rapid rise later sold shares
to cash in their recent gains, pulling stock prices back moderately
at the end of the morning session, Yoneyama added.
   The Nikkei Index had risen 197.17 points in the first 15 minutes
of trading.
   Stock prices also rose on expectations that U.S. trade figures
for March, scheduled to be announced in Washington later Tuesday,
would show a moderate narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit, traders
said.
   The dollar closed the day at 124.82, up 0.09 yen from Monday's
finish. It had opened the day higher at 124.89 and remained little
changed, hovering around 124.75-124.93 yen level.
   Michiko Kawai of the Bank of Tokyo said, ``The dollar was higher
in Tokyo following the overnight rise against the yen in New York.''
   But trading was scattered as participants stayed on the
sidelines in anticipation of the U.S. trade report.

   Foreign reporters, once lauded for
their role in the ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos, have gone
from heroes to heels for alleged unflattering coverage of Corazon
Aquino's Philippines.
   In recent weeks, Philippine columnists and government officials
have accused the foreign press of scaring off foreign investors,
depicting Manila as a decadent, crime-ridden slum and even paying
communist rebels to stage ambushes.
   The foreign ``press-bashing'' is a far cry from the adulation
heaped on the international press for its coverage of the
anti-Marcos movement.
   Many Filipinos believed the presence of so many foreign
reporters was responsible for Marcos' tame response to the February
1986 uprising which brought his downfall.
   A year after Marcos' ouster, a private group with government
backing even awarded certificates to foreign reporters who covered
the 1986 uprising, identifying them as ``heroes of the revolution.''
   Philippine media have themselves been sharply critical of Mrs.
Aquino's stewardship as the country grapples with such problems as
the communist insurgency, widespread poverty, inefficient
bureaucracy, deteriorating roads and bridges and a burgeoning
population.
   But the renewed sense of national pride that followed the Marcos
downfall also has shortened the patience of many Filipinos for
criticism by foreigners.
   A former communist rebel, Gemma Magallona, was quoted as saying
unidentified foreign reporters paid her group to stage an ambush in
southeastern Luzon and even provided weapons and ammunition.
   The report, published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer last
week, drew little response until Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos
said in a television interview Thursday that the military had
evidence the journalists were from a European television network.
   Later, the military identified the crew as from the British
Broadcasting Corp. The BBC in London denied the allegation and said
it had no crew in the country at the time of the ambush.
   It appeared the charge may have been raised to frighten foreign
reporters from contacts with the rebels and from visiting their
camps.
   The military has offered no evidence beyond the woman's
allegation. But opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense
minister, claimed the military had extensive files proving that
foreign reporters often paid rebels to stage attacks in exchange
for scoops.
   ``These foreign journalists go to the enemies of the government
and ask them to ambush soldiers so they can show to the world that
the country is in a state of turmoil,'' Enrile claimed.
   Sen. Ernesto Herrera called for curbs on the foreign press if
the former rebel's allegation was true.
   The immigration chief today said foreign journalists who pay
communist rebels to stage ambushes against government forces can be
deported.
   ``If there is sufficent evidence against the aliens, and the
reports can be verified, then, that would constitute a deportable
offense under the immigration act,'' Immigration Commissioner
Miriam Defensor-Santiago told reporters.
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman Teodoro Benigno, a former bureau chief
of the French news agency Agence France-Presse, said the government
would look into the allegation about the BBC.
   But when pressed for comment, Benigno told Filipino reporters:
``You are journalists yourselves. Do you believe that thing really
happened?''
   The Foreign Correspondent's Association of the Philippines has
so far issued no statement on the charge, only the latest in a
series of allegations against the international media.
   Last week, Benigno's office claimed foreign reporters had
painted a distorted picture of Manila as a crime-ridden city by
reports on killings by communist rebels.
   The presidential press office released figures which showed
Manila with a lower crime rate than Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York.
   Filipino critics claim foreign press reports, which often focus
on the communist insurgency, coup attempts and political turmoil,
have distorted the image of the country and frightened off foreign
investors.
   ``The cumulative effect of such garbage that has lately been
featured in some sectors of the U.S. press could not be lost on the
American reader, who knows less and less of the real Philippines
and her people and more of the seamy side as viewed from the
gutter,'' wrote columnist Hernando Abaya in The Manila Chronicle.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson was still seeking support in today's Oregon primary _ even
as voters were going to the polls.
   Jackson also made a primary-eve swing through the state, telling
an enthusiastic waterfront rally of about 1,000 people here that
they must fight to change the Reagan administration's economic
policies.
   Jackson noted that today's primary comes on the 34th anniversary
of Brown vs. Board of Education, the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court
decision that legally ended racial segregation in schools.
   Jackson said that back then, Democrats were working to ``end
racial violence by law.'' Now, he said, that has turned to a
struggle to ``end economic violence by law.''
   ``We, the people, must come together to fight for economic
justice in this country,'' Jackson said.
   At a late-evening rally of 2,500 people at Portland State
University, Jackson said neither Republican nominee-apparent George
Bush nor Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis have offered plans
to back up their campaign promises.
   ``Let Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis state their case,'' Jackson said.
``If they have a better plan, let them come forward.''
   He urged voters to go to the polls by telling them, ``Oregon
determines the course of our party, of our nation, of our world.''
   Jackson also said plans are being made for meetings after the
primary season, and before the party's national convention, with
constituent groups, including Jewish leaders in New York City.
   The meetings were among the items Jackson discussed with New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo while the two were on the West Coast late
last week, Jackson said.
   Earlier Monday, at his first stop in Oregon, he spoke of
environmental matters that are of concern here.
   At an airport rally that drew about 300 people in Eugene,
Jackson said the nation needs a timber industry that will ``nurture
the forests, not cut old-growth.''
   ``The greedy amongst us are attacking the environment,'' he
said. ``We the people live in one world community. We must clean up
the world.''
   Jackson, wearing a red-checked lumberman's jacket and wide red
suspenders, was looking ahead to the weeks remaining in the primary
season.
   ``I want to win in Oregon on tomorrow and take that momentum to
California,'' he said.
   He planned an airport rally today in Klamath Falls before
leaving for San Diego.
   On Monday, Jackson reiterated his appeal for what he called
fairness from the Democratic Party. He said he deserved credit for
``registering more Democrats than anybody else in history.''
   ``We're not discussing generosity. We're discussing
reciprocity,'' Jackson said as he campaigned in New Jersey.
   The Democratic presidential contender criticized party rules,
saying it is unfair that his delegate total is not in line with his
share of the popular vote.

<TEXT>
   The fuel tank of a bus that burst into a
fireball when a pickup truck slammed into it head-on didn't meet
federal safety requirements, investigators said after the truck's
driver was charged with 27 counts of murder.
   At the time of the accident, one of the nation's deadliest bus
crashes, truck driver Larry Mahoney's blood-alcohol level was
nearly 2{ times the legal definition of drunkenness, authorities
said Monday.
   John Ackman, Carroll County commonwealth's attorney, said he
planned to seek the death penalty against Mahoney, 34, who was in
serious condition at Humana Hospital-University of Illinois.
   Mahoney's northbound truck was traveling in the wrong direction
on Interstate 71 when it struck the church bus filled with
teen-agers and adult chaperones returning from an amusement park
near Cincinnati.
   Twenty-seven people were killed and 42 injured. The victims died
from smoke inhalation as they tried to scramble out of the burning
bus, said state medical examiner Dr. George Nichols. Seventeen
people remain hospitalized, most in critical or serious condition.
   The former school bus used by the First Assembly of God Church
in Radcliff did not meet post-1977 safety requirements for a caged
fuel tank, said Joseph Nall, a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator.
   The tank had a 3-inch gash and was pushed back 26 inches by the
crash's impact, Nall said Monday night.
   Asked if a caged tank might have prevented the fire, Nall said,
``That's the ultimate question we'd like to answer, but now it
would be premature.''
   The 1977 Superior bus with a Ford chassis, which the
manufacturer said was equipped to carry 66 passengers and a driver
_ the number aboard the night of the crash _ did not appear to be
overloaded, according to Nall.
   Some survivors said the seats that were supposed to hold three
people were too small, resulting in some people hanging in the
aisle.
   ``There were too many people on that bus,'' said Conrad Garcia.
He said he had to sit on a girl's lap in the back row because the
bench wasn't wide enough.
   NTSB investigators will remain in Kentucky for several more
days, and it could take up to 10 months before a final report is
released, Nall said.
   Investigators on Monday examined the accident site, about 45
miles northeast of Louisville, and noted some braking by both
drivers before the accident, Nall said.
   Only two survivors were interviewed as of Monday night, but more
interviews of witnesses were planned, Nall said.
   Federal investigators attempted to interview Mahoney on Monday,
but ``he would not talk to investigators for reasons of his own,''
Nall said.
   Mahoney, who was served with warrants in his hospital room, will
be arraigned once he is released. District Judge Stanley
Billingsley denied bond.
   Tests on Mahoney, of Worthville, found a 0.24 blood alcohol
level, said state police Capt. Neal Brittain. State law defines
intoxication at 0.1.
   Mahoney had a drunken driving arrest in 1984, for which he paid
a fine, and pleaded guilty twice to disorderly conduct, court
records show.
   He was twice divorced and has been living with his first wife.
He has two children.
   A friend, Dennis Mefford, said he was with Mahoney until 8:30
p.m. Saturday, about 2{ hours before the accident. Mahoney was very
tired, he said.
   Mahoney, a chemical operator at M&T Chemical Co. in Carrollton,
had worked 12-hour shifts for three consecutive days before getting
off at 7 a.m. the day of the accident, Nall said.
   ``I can't remember seeing him drive in that bad a shape,''
Mefford said.
   Friends described Mahoney as a quiet man who likes to hunt and
shoot pool.
   ``He was just an easy-going, good ol' country boy,'' said
Mefford's wife, Linda. ``He was a little backward _ shy and
quiet-spoken. But people should know that he wasn't some kind of
wild maniac.''
   Flags were at half-staff Monday in Radcliff and sympathies were
spelled out on marquees and display signs at businesses and
restaurants in the main business district.
   Among those killed were Army 1st Sgt. Lee Williams' wife, Joy,
and two daughters.
   ``He has no one else,'' said Jean Grimes, Joy Williams'
identical twin. ``Joy and the kids were all he had.''

   Tokyo's key stock market indicator reached a new
record high today for the second consecutive trading day, while the
U.S. dollar finished slightly higher against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
added 60.11 points, or 0.21 percent, to close the day at 27,819,98.
The index's prvious high was reached Monday, when it closed at
27,759.87, gaining a sharp 291.56 points.
   ``Apprehension over the market rising too quicky prompted
profit-taking, holding share prices back,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama
of Nikko Securities.
   During the first 15 minutes of trading, the Nikkei Index rose
almost across the board, surging 197.17 points, or 0.71 percent, to
27,957.04, mirroring the overnight advance on Wall Street, traders
said.
   Shimoyama said share prices picked up again just before the end
of trading, boosted in part on expectations that the U.S. trade
figures for March, due to be announced later today in Washington,
will show a moderate narrowing in the deficit.
   Popular issues included non-ferrous issues and oils.
Transportations, trading houses, automobiles were also higher.
Among the losers were constructions and housings.
   Trading was moderately active with volume on the first section
estimated at 1 billion shares, up from 850 million shares changed
hands on Monday.
   On the foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 124.82
yen, up 0.09 yen from its finish on Monday. It had opened the day
at 124.89 yen and traded in a range of 124.75 yen to 124.93 yen.
   ``Trading was scattered throughout the day without any
directions to move the market,'' said a dealer at a major
commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Participants stayed away from making moves, waiting for the U.S.
trade figures for March, he said.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Georgia congressman reportedly plans to
challenge ex-Gov. Evan Mecham's credentials as a delegate to the
Republican national convention.
   The Arizona GOP convention on Saturday elected Mecham, who was
impeached and removed from office, as one of the state's 33
delegates to the convention in New Orleans in August. Mecham came
in 17th in the secret balloting for 18 at-large seats.
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 when the state Senate
convicted him of two impeachment charges. He still faces trial in
criminal court on unrelated felony charges.
   The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson reported Monday that three
sources said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., decided even before
Saturday to challenge Mecham's convention credentials if he became
a delegate.
   Neither Gingrich nor his spokeswoman in Washington returned a
telephone call seeking comment Monday.
   Mecham said he didn't believe Gingrich was familiar with the
situation in Arizona. ``We've got enough problems here in Arizona,
what with Republicans tearing apart Republicans,'' Mecham told the
Star on Sunday.

<HEAD>Jackson Campaign Questions W.Va. Primary Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's campaign is questioning what
it says are more than 1,000 supporters missing from voter
registration lists in Logan County, W. Va.
   At the same time, the presidential candidate's campaign is
considering challenging the state's system of ignoring the popular
vote when it comes to convention delegate selection.
   Lewis Carter, a Jackson field aide, said Monday that voters who
registered during Jackson-inspired registration drives since 1986
were missing from Logan County voter registration lists.
   Carter said he has asked Jackson state campaign coordinators to
review the presidential candidate's vote totals in the southern
coalfield county.
   Secretary of State Ken Hechler said he did not think there was
anything to support Carter's allegations.
   Carter also said he thinks the state's system of selecting
Democratic convention delegates is unfair, a charge Jackson has
made of several states. Results from the presidential primary in
West Virginia have no effect on the selection of delegates, who are
voted on separately.
   Jackson captured 14 percent of the popular vote, but won no
delegates here.

<HEAD>Democrats Land the Aquarians While More Libras Lean to GOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aquarians tend to consider themselves Democrats
and Libras are more likely than others to lean toward the
Republican Party _ but don't tell the plurality of Americans who
reject astrology.
   The latest entry in the political debate over the influence of
the stars comes courtesy of Public Opinion magazine, a bimonthly
publication of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
Research in Washington.
   Picking up on the discussion fomented by allegations that
astrology has played a role in President Reagan's schedule, Public
Opinion compiled data from past polls including these tidbits:
   _Democrats drew 47 percent of Aquarians but just 32 percent of
Libras in surveys done from 1985-87 by the National Opinion
Research Center.
   _Another 32 percent of Libras considered themselves Republicans,
but only 28 percent of Aquarians and just 25 percent of
Sagittarians backed the GOP.
   _Their sign aside, 47 percent of adults polled by the Roper
Organization in 1985 said they did not believe in astrology. Thirty
percent weren't sure, while 23 percent believed in the influence of
the stars.
   Public Opinion figured the breakdown of party identification
according to astrological sign by separating the Democrats,
Republicans and independents by birth date.
   Graham Hueber, assistant editor of Public Opinion, said the
survey was done ``because we never miss an opportunity to get
Public Opinion magazine's name in the press.''

<HEAD>Hazing At Philippine Military Academy Sends 26 Cadets To Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities ordered an investigation
into reports that at least 26 new cadets of the elite Philippine
Military Academy were hospitalized for injuries caused by hazing,
news reports said today.
   Independent television station Channel 13 said the hazing
incidents occurred last week at the academy compound at Camp
Servillano Aquino in Tarlac province, 65 miles north of Manila.
   It said six cadet were being treated for serious injuries at the
armed forces hospital in the capital and 20 others were at the
camp's infirmary.
   The extent of the injuries could not be determined as the cadets
refused to talk about the incidents or confirm whether the injuries
were related to hazing rituals, the Philippine Daily Globe reported.
   The Globe quoted a nurse at the military hospital as saying one
cadet was being treated for impaired vision and another complained
of chest pains.
   Channel 13 said Brig. Gen. Honesto Isleta, armed forces deputy
chief of staff for civil-military operations, had ordered the
investigation.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial
on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan must begin
Thursday as scheduled, an appellate court has ruled.
   The intermediate level Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 decision
Monday, rejected a defense bid to have the charges against Mecham
and his brother, Willard, dismissed or returned to the state grand
jury.
   ``To be honest with you, I expected it just the way it came
out,'' said Mecham, who sat in the front row during oral arguments.
   His lawyer, Michael Scott, said he will appeal to the state
Supreme Court, but probably not before jury selection begins in
Maricopa County Superior Court.
   Evan and Willard Mecham, his 1986 campaign treasurer, were
indicted by the grand jury Jan. 8 on charges of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents.
   They were accused of failing to report the $350,000 loan on
either Mecham's personal or campaign finance reports as required.
Mecham faces six counts and his brother faces three.
   The Court of Appeals ruled that the defendants ``were not denied
any substantial procedural rights in the grand jury proceedings.''
Mecham said he does not expect the state Supreme Court to reverse
the decision.
   ``I don't know of any possibility or probability'' of a
last-minute plea agreement, Mecham said. ``I have broken no laws
that I am aware of.''
   Mecham, 64, was removed from office April 4 when the Senate
convicted him on impeachment charges of trying to thwart a death
threat investigation and misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $350,000
campaign loan from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson, but the Senate
decided not to consider that charge for fear of prejudicing
Mecham's criminal trial.
   The Mechams' attorneys asked the appeals court to either dismiss
the charges or return them to the grand jury for a new
determination of probable cause.
   ``The 24th grand jury was well-greased and the indictment was an
inevitability,'' Scott told the court. ``They were given erroneous
advice ... The prosecutor manipulated that grand jury.''
   Scott contended the grand jurors were discouraged from calling
witnesses or from reading transcripts of testimony on the Mecham
case given to a previous grand jury. Also, he said it was unfair to
exclude from the grand jury everyone who had signed a pro- or
anti-Mecham recall petition.
   Willard Mecham's attorney, Joe Keilp, accused the state attorney
general's office of ``taking an inexperienced grand jury and
molding them to the will of the prosecutors. ... They (jurors) were
discouraged from reading the testimony. They were discouraged in
our view from calling witnesses.''
   However, William Schafer III, of the attorney general's criminal
division, contended there was no misconduct and that the grand jury
was not misled on its power to call witnesses or review testimony.
   ``There was every effort made ... to ensure that this was going
to be a fair and impartial grand jury,'' Schafer said.
   In announcing the court's decision, Judge Melvyn Shelley said
other claims made by the defense in an effort to void the charges
may be addressed only as an appeal if Mecham is convicted.
   Mecham has insisted that the $350,000 loan was properly reported
when it was lumped with other funds into a $465,000 amount listed
as a contribution from himself.
   The then-governor amended his financial reports on Nov. 16, to
include the loan, saying the failure to report it earlier was an
``honest mistake'' by his brother and that there was no intent to
break the law.

<HEAD>PTL Issues `Final Plea'; Maps Out Plan To Sell Off Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL said it has issued a final plea for
supporters to save the ministry from liquidation under a bankruptcy
plan its fallen founder Jim Bakker called a ``literal giveaway.''
   PTL, in a revised reorganization plan filed Monday, outlined
plans to sell Heritage USA in Fort Mill and then lease the property
required to carry on its church and network television ministries.
   ``Because of past scandals and credibility problems, PTL and
other television ministries are facing extinction,'' said the
document signed by PTL trustee David Clark.
   Although the plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia
provides for the sale of all PTL assets to pay creditors, it leaves
an opening for PTL supporters to ``save the ministry'' by
increasing contributions to forestall a complete liquidation.
   ``If the ministry does not receive such support, it is possible
that it will be lost forever,'' the plan said.
   Bakker, who founded PTL in 1974, developed the Christian retreat
and cable television network and then lost it in March 1987 after a
sex scandal, reacted with disdain to the developments.
   ``I am deeply saddened that PTL trustee, former CBN executive
David Clark, would attempt a literal giveaway of PTL and Heritage
USA to a secular organization,'' Bakker said Monday in a recorded
message on the answering machine at his Palm Springs, Calif., home.
   Several potential buyers have expressed interest in the retreat.
One is George Shinn, a sports entrepreneur from Charlotte, N.C.,
who wants to build a minor league baseball stadium and a training
center for his fledgling National Basketball Association team.
   PTL, located about 10 miles south of Charlotte, has an estimated
$130 million in assets, some of which is contested. PTL has been
under protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code for
11 months.
   On April 21, the Internal Revenue Service revoked its tax-exempt
status because of an audit that concluded Bakker and his aides
profited excessively from donations to the ministry and because
much of PTL's operations are commercial rather than ministerial.
   Also last month, Clark told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds
that PTL would not be able to pay the $5.7 million initial
installment on its debt by May 2 as required in the original
bankruptcy plan filed in December.
   Reynolds then ordered PTL to come up with a liquidation plan to
pay creditors.
   In the revised plan, PTL blamed unspecified scandals and
unforeseen attacks on television ministries for the inability to
raise enough money to pay its debts.
   ``Due to various scandals and concerns over the use of
contributions, donations dropped drastically,'' the document said.
   Under the revised plan, Reynolds would appoint a board of three
businessmen to preside over PTL as a self-liquidating trust, said
David West, PTL director of public relations.
   The amended plan establishes a priority for the sale of $160
million in assets in a 60-month period and will authorize leasing
of ministry assets to a separate, non-profit corporation called
Heritage Ministries Inc., West said.
   The priorities for sale, in order, are the 1,700 acres of
undeveloped property, the Heritage Grand Hotel and Tower, the water
park, a campground, an apartment complex, a prayer center, a
Victorian-style home, an amphitheater, the TV network and Heritage
Village Church.
   ``We would only liquidate what is required to meet the debt,''
West said.
   Whatever money or property was left after debts were paid would
go back to Heritage Ministries, which would lease the church, the
amphitheater, a prayer center and equipment required to run the
television network, West said.
   The next major step for PTL will come June 16 when Reynolds
hears objections to the amended plan.

<HEAD>Fishermen Dump Ton of Fish to Protest Oakland Dredging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ton of fish heads was dumped here by
fishermen to protest the unloading of Oakland estuary mud in the
ocean off the San Mateo County coast.
   ``They're dumping on us, so we figured it wouldn't hurt to dump
on them,'' said Don Pemberton, owner of Pemberton's Fish Co. near
Half Moon Bay.
   The fish heads were dumped at a Port of Oakland marine terminal
on Monday, the day a San Mateo County judge halted a dredging
project the fishermen say will destroy rich fishing grounds.
   Workers spent several hours cleaning up a 4-foot-high
``pyramid'' of fish heads.
   Pemberton said he and another fisherman, Marcellino Costilino,
39, loaded the 2,000 pounds of fish on his flat bed truck near Half
Moon Bay.
   The Superior Court restraining order was in response to a
lawsuit filed Friday by San Mateo County against the port and the
California Coastal Commission. County officials alleged the
commission should have reviewed the dump site 12 miles west of Half
Moon Bay to make sure it conformed with the state's coastal use
plan.
   The judge's order blocks dumping until the case can be argued at
a hearing May 27.
   ``We have been given a chance to live,'' fishermen Steve Fitz
said of the judge's order.
   Fitz is the co-owner of the boat Ronny, one of 18 trawlers that
attempted without success to block the first barge full of material
from being dumped last Friday.
   Port of Oakland officials want to deepen the estuary to make way
for huge container ships by eventually hauling away 500,000 cubic
yards of sediment.
   ``What you're talking about is the whole viability of the Port
of Oakland,'' said port Executive Director Walter A. Abernathy.
``We are surrounded by competing ports in Southern California and
the Pacific Northwest that have deeper channels and can accommodate
these larger new ships.''

<HEAD>Improved Test Able To Detect AIDS Infection When Existing Test
Cannot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new test reveals if people are infected by
the AIDS virus before they develop antibodies, and may reduce the
spread of the disease by sexual contact and tainted blood
transfusions, a scientist says.
   The test, which could be on the market within two years, ``may
allow more expeditious detection of the virus in a person, and
therefore that person could be counseled in the danger of spreading
the virus through sexual contact,'' said molecular geneticist John
J. Rossi.
   If the test gains widespread use in blood banks, it could
``abolish the possibility of tainted blood being given to
recipients,'' said Rossi, who works at the City of Hope National
Medical Center, which announced development of the test Monday.
   By directly detecting how much genetic information from the AIDS
virus is present in a person's blood or body tissues, the test also
should help scientists study the effectiveness of experimental
drugs in attacking the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, Rossi said.
   The test is similar, but more sensitive and accurate, than one
developed by scientists at Cetus Corp. of Emeryville, and the
national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said Rossi, who
led a team that developed the new test.
   Using a process patented by Cetus, which announced its test in
January in the journal Science, both tests amplify, or increase, by
a billionfold the amount of genetic information from AIDS virus in
a blood or tissue sample.
   That allows the presence of 100 molecules of AIDS virus to be
detected in an infected person, even if that person hasn't
developed antibodies against the virus. The existing test, called
ELISA, detects those antibodies, which often don't develop until
months after a person has been infected.
   Some infected people who haven't developed antibodies aren't
identified by the existing test, allowing them to unknowingly
transmit the virus during sex or by donating their tainted blood.
CDC researchers say that means about one in 40,000 tested blood
transfusions contains AIDS virus.
   Rossi said the new tests can detect the presence of the virus
within a few days after infection.
   The Cetus test amplifies and detects deoxyribonucleic acid, or
DNA, from the AIDS virus. DNA is the hereditary blueprint that
orders construction of proteins in all cells. Rossi said his is
more sensitive because it amplifies and detects the AIDS virus'
more plentiful ribonucleic acid. RNA transcribes the inherited
information from DNA to help make proteins.
   Rossi said the test also contains built-in controls, lacking in
the Cetus test, to make it 99.9 percent accurate in determining if
a person is or isn't infected.
   Rossi said the cost of the new tests would be comparable to the
existing one, but any company that manufactures and sells such
tests may have to pay royalties to Cetus.
   The new test eventually should replace the existing one once its
accuracy is established, Rossi said.
   Rossi said scientists are trying to apply the amplification
method used in the Cetus and City of Hope AIDS tests for use in
detecting herpes simplex viruses, a form of leukemia and
cytomegalovirus, a major killer of AIDS patients and cause of birth
defects.
   Development of the new test was reported in this month's issue
of the journal DNA by Rossi, his City of Hope colleagues and George
Murakawa, Rossi's student at the University of California, Los
Angeles.

   Syria and Iran agreed today to renew
diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting between Shiite Moslem
factions in Beirut's southern slums, where Western hostages are
believed to be held.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
pro-Syrian Amal militia continued to battle with mortars and
machine guns during the night, defying a new cease-fire called by
Iran and Syria.
   Police said 12 people were killed and 40 wounded since the
latest truce was called at 11 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT) on Monday. It was
the seventh cease-fire called since fighting broke out May 6 in the
16-square-mile enclave.
   The latest clash brought the casualty toll to 237 killed and 746
wounded.
   In other developments, unconfirmed reports said the Iranians and
Syrians were working on a deal under which the Syrian army would
not try to free the hostages if its soldiers moved into the area.
The United States indicated it would be willing to talk with the
captors of the hostages in the slums.
   Shell blasts and gunfire echoed across Beirut today. Police said
Amal, which has lost most of the territory it held in the region,
mounted a counterattack to regain the sprawling Shiyah district.
   ``Amal is pushing hard and Hezbollah is retreating in Shiyah for
a second day,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be named under
standing rules. ``But the fundamentalists remain in control of 90
percent of the slums. Only the Syrians can crush them.''
   The Syrians massed thousands of troops around the embattled
enclave in the last two days, poising for a push to stop the
fighting.
   ``We're ready to go in, but zero hour has not been set yet,''
said a Syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airport
facing Hezbollah's strongholds.
   The agreement to revive political efforts to end the battle was
reached in meetings held by Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali
Mohammed Besharati, government leaders and army officers in
Damascus and Beirut on Monday.
   ``The door is still open for political efforts,'' Syria's
military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan,
said after a one-hour meeting with Besharati.
   But Kenaan stopped short of saying whether Syria would rescind
its decision to send troops into the slums with shoot-to-kill
orders to separate and disarm the combatants.
   ``That decision has been taken after all peaceful methods were
exhausted,'' Kenaan told reporters. ``But if there is a new hope to
stop the bloodbath with political efforts, we'll give it a try.''
   Besharati told reporters the talks with Kenaan were
``positive.'' He did not elaborate beyond saying: ``I came to
bandage the bleeding wounds of the suburbs.''
   Christian-controlled radio stations said Besharati's talks were
focusing on a three-point deal:
   _A pledge that the Syrians would not seek to free the 18 foreign
hostages believed held by Hezbollah-affilated extremists in the
slums. Nine Americans are believed to be among the hostages.
   _Safety and freedom for an estimated 500 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards fighting alongside Hezbollah before the Syrians move in.
   _Hezbollah as well as Amal would lay down arms provided they be
allowed to function as unarmed political parties.
   The report could not be independently verified. Besharati and
the Iranian Embassy refused to comment. Christian radio stations
have rarely been accurate on Moslem affairs.
   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, head of the Supreme Shiite
Council, the sect's highest religious body, reiterated today that
Syrian forces should move in. ``Every other method is just a waste
of time'' he said in a statement broadcast by Beirut radio stations.
   The United States indicated on Monday it would be willing to
talk with the captors of the hostages believed held in the slums.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked about reports
that the hostages had been moved from the slums, said: ``I don't
have anything to say about their whereabouts.''
   He said Washington was pleased by a call from the spiritual
guide of Hezbollah, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, for talks
about the hostages.

   All shops and offices in this South
Pacific capital were shuttered today after a march by 2,000
villagers over a land dispute turned into a riot. One person was
killed and several were injured.
   Shops were looted and office windows smashed in Monday's
disturbances, the official Radio Vanuatu said. Police arrested 30
people, it said.
   The radio said many residents spent the night outside the
capital. It said security forces today fired shots at a boat in
Port Vila harbor and arrested a man who failed to stop. No further
details were reported.
   Police said the capital was calm today. Prime Minister Walter
Lini's government, meanwhile, met in emergency session.
   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, is an island
group 930 miles northeast of Australia. It achieved independence in
1980 and has a population of 130,000, including 15,000 in Port Vila.
   In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he sent a military
Hercules plane to Vanuatu loaded with gas masks, tear gas canisters
and launchers to help the government with riot control.
   Hawke told the Parliament in Canberra, the federal capital, that
the decision to send the equipment followed a direct request from
Lini.
   ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is clear
that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale,'' Hawke
said.
   New Zealand sent similar supplies. Russell Marshall, New
Zealand's foreign minister, told a news conference in Wellington
today that there was no thought of sending military units to quell
the disturbance.
   ``There has been no request ... for military units,'' he said.
``If the situation deteriorated, we'd have to look at it very
seriously.''
   About 2,000 people from tribes in three villages marched on
Monday through Port Vila, Radio Vanuatu said. The protest followed
the closure last week of the Vila Urban Land Corporation, a
government agency that administered leased tribal land in the
capital, it said.
   Protesters began rioting and police fired tear gas to disperse
the crowd, the radio said. A police vehicle ran over a man during
the rioting, killing him. The radio said Lini, an Anglican priest,
was not in Port Vila at the time.

   One of eight guards taken hostage in a
2{-day prison siege says his heart ``skipped a beat'' when inmates
pressed a knife to his throat, and he may not go back to work
because of the ordeal.
   ``I made it through Vietnam, and I almost got killed in my own
hometown,'' said Corrections officer Ron Scott, who was released as
the insurrection ended Monday morning. ``I'm just glad I'm alive.
I'm going to try to live one day at a time.''
   Prison officials today investigated the riot and assessed damage
at the medium-security Mack Alford Correctional Center. Authorities
said it could cost as much as $5 million to replace a 160-bed
dormitory burned down during the riot.
   State lawmakers, who said the inmates should live with the
problem they created, vowed to take their time in rebuilding. Nine
inmates believed to be directly involved in the hostage-taking were
moved to the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center in Lexington.
   Scott, 36, and Sgt. Harold Yoder were held the longest of eight
guards who were taken captive by knife-wielding inmates late Friday.
   Scott said he was attending a briefing before taking his
position in a guard tower when the riot began.
   One guard was taken hostage as authorities attempted to round up
three inmates for discipline following a fight over a theft earlier
in the day.
   ``They wanted us to go out there and see what could be done
about it,'' Scott said.
   When inmates went on a rampage, Scott and six other officers
barricaded themselves inside the dormitory by putting a filing
cabinet against a metal door while inmates outside pushed against
it. Inmates got in through a side door.
   ``Before I knew it, several inmates came in with knives,'' Scott
said.
   The captive guards were moved in a line to another building.
Scott said he saw the first captured guard sitting with his hands
tied behind him and wearing inmate clothing.
   During the next several hours all but three of the guards were
released, but the inmates threatened Scott's life to persuade
negotiators to provide them with food.
   ``They had me down on my knees and they had the knife at my
throat,'' Scott said. ``At those times, my heart kind of skipped a
beat. My hands got a little sweaty.''
   A knife was held to his throat on two other occasions, once when
inmates feared that snipers waited on an adjacent building.
   Scott, a Choctaw Indian, said he feared for himself and fellow
captive Capt. Lewis McGee, a black man who was released about 10
p.m. Sunday. Inmates had displayed ``White Power'' signs from the
building they held. Yoder is white.
   ``If there was anybody who was going to get killed, it was going
to be us two,'' Scott said.
   Scott said his captors generally treated him well, offering him
food and providing fans to ward off heat and humidity. Temperatures
were in the 90s.
   Scott said he has not decided whether to return to his job at
the prison.
   ``I'll just have to sit and think about it a couple of days _
take a week off,'' he said.

<HEAD>Voters to Decide Fate of Proposed Denver Airport, Oregon Helmet
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in suburban Denver will decide today whether the city can
build a new airport to replace crowded Stapleton International. In
Portland, Ore., Mayor Bud Clark was favored in his bid for a second
term, while voters statewide considered a mandatory motorcycle
helmet law.
   Backers have outspent opponents heavily in the campaign for a $3
billion replacement for Stapleton.
   Officials say that if Adams County voters approve the ballot
question _ whether to allow Denver to annex an unincorporated
45-square-mile site in their county _ it will virtually ensure that
the airport can be built.
   In Portland, Clark, the city's colorful barkeeper-turned-mayor,
has weathered the storms of his first term so well that he is given
a chance of winning a second term outright in the non-partisan
election and avoiding a November runoff. He has 10 challengers on
the ballot.
   His campaign focused on getting more than 50 percent today. A
poll published Sunday gave him 51 percent, with a 4.9 point margin
of error.
   Clark shocked the city four years ago when he stepped out of his
popular Goose Hollow Inn and mounted a grass-roots campaign to
unseat incumbent Frank Ivancie.
   In his first two years in office, however, Clark faced a series
of crises, mostly involving the city Police Bureau. Two police
chiefs resigned and Clark fired a third.
   Oregonians also voted on a proposal for a mandatory motorcycle
helmet law for adults. The current law applies only to those under
age 18.
   The measure would require drivers and passengers of motorcycles
and mopeds to wear protective headgear or face a $100 fine.
   Oregon congressional primaries are also being held. Four of the
five incumbents face no primary opposition. The fifth, Democratic
Rep. Ron Wyden, faces only a nominal challenge.
   The airport at Denver is the first major one planned in the
United States since Dallas-Fort Worth opened in 1974.
   Opponents contend jet noise generated by the airport would be
unbearable for homeowners, and say closing Stapleton would waste
money. Proponents, including Gov. Roy Romer, point to a study that
predicts a new airport would generate 54,000 jobs by 2010.

<HEAD>Inmates Awarded $1.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 400 inmates who had to use buckets as
toilets in cells at the county jail in Lawrence will split $1.2
million in a settlement of their class action suit.
   Inmates originally sued in 1981, claiming the lack of plumbing
violated their rights.
   Two years later, Superior Court Judge Paul G. Garrity ruled that
the conditions, which he said were disgusting and shocking, needed
to be remedied. He gave Essex County six months to replace lidded
pots with toilets and sinks.
   Essex County Sheriff Charles Reardon said Monday the $1.2 milion
will be divided among 397 inmates forced to use plastic ``night
soil pots'' in their cells after the 9 p.m. lockdown between 1981
and June 1, 1984, when toilets and hot and cold water were
installed.
   The 153-year-old jail has 126 cells.
   The state Department of Correction will pay half the settlement
this year, and Essex County will pay the rest in three installments
during the next three years.
   Reardon said he is concerned the settlement may set precedent
for similar lawsuits, including one against the county's
170-year-old jail in Salem that has no toilets in cells.
   He said the setlement was sensible in that the Lawrence inmates
had sought $25 million.
   ``But on the opposite side of the coin, it's a tough pill to
swallow to have to give this money to people who have gone to jail
for (violating the rights) of other people,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet, U.S. Scientists To Investigate Hole In Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and American aircraft will make a series of
flights through a large hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer
next year so scientists can study whether there are harmful changes
in the world's climate.
   The two nations announced Monday that they have agreed to
coordinate the experimental flights over the Arctic in January and
February.
   S.G. Tilford, director of NASA's Earth science and application
division, told reporters the Soviets and Americans probably will
use separate aircraft for the experiment. But the two groups of
scientists and pilots will share information and coordinate flight
schedules.
   The mission was announced at a Moscow news conference by
American scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and Soviet representatives from this country's
Academy of Sciences.
   Tilford said he hopes 10 to 20 flights can be made through the
ozone layer to collect data.
   Tilford said the aircraft have an altitude limit of 12{ miles,
but scientists estimate that the hole in the ozone layer extends to
31 miles.
   He said the U.S. scientists and pilots hope to be based
somewhere in Norway. It was undecided where the Soviets will be
based, he said, but ``we'll be in close touch, coordinating
schedules and flights.''
   Ozone in the atmosphere filters out the sun's ultraviolent rays,
making life on Earth possible.
   A NASA report in March said the ozone layer over the United
States has shrunk by about 2.3 percent since 1969. The report put
the blame on chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used to power some
aerosol sprays.
   They were banned as aerosol propellants in the United States in
1978. But they continue to be used to clean computer chips and
other electronic parts, as refrigeration fluids and for making
plastic foams.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1
percent thinning of the Earth's ozone shield means a 5 percent to 6
percent increase in skin cancer. If chlorofluorocarbon use
continued increasing at 2.5 percent per year, EPA said, 20 percent
of the ozone barrier could be gone in the next century.
   The Soviet Union has several chlorofluorocarbon plants under
construction and has won several temporary exemptions to a
31-nation treaty cutting emissions that damage the ozone layer.
   Academy of Sciences spokesman K. Kondratyev said scientists
differ on the effects of ozone depletion, but generally believe it
causes an increase in the Earth's temperature, leading to
deforestation in tropical areas, reduction in atmospheric moisture
and, eventually, deterioration of the Earth's soil.

<HEAD>South Africa Says Cuban Troop Movement Threatening Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan
said that reported Cuban troop deployment in southern Angola is a
threat to further negotiations on regional peace.
   Angola's Marxist government is supported by an estimated 40,000
Cuban troops in its 13-year fight against UNITA _ the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola. South Africa and the
United States back UNITA.
   In remarks before Parliament on Monday, Malan cautioned against
a quick solution to the Angolan conflict.
   ``I am not optimistic that negotiations will be easy or that
they will succeed soon,'' Malan said.
   Malan was part of the South African delegation that met with
Angolan officials in Brazzaville, Congo, Friday to discuss ways of
ending Angola's civil war.
   He said that up to 9,000 Cuban troops recently have been
deployed in southern Angola near the border of South-West Africa,
the territory administered by South Africa.
   ``The Cubans are exceeding their mandate in Angola,'' Malan
said. ``They were not brought there, invited or sent there to form
a shield for SWAPO,'' the guerrilla group seeking independence in
South-West Africa.
   SWAPO, or South-West African People's Organization, has bases in
southern Angola from which it launches attacks into South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia. South Africa says it will not grant
Namibia independence until Cuban troops leave Angola.
   Malan said if the Cuban troops assist SWAPO ``this could be the
spark that starts the fire.''
   South Africa and Angola have said they plan to arrange a new
round of talks shortly. However, Malan and other leading South
African officials repeatedly have stated that no major
breakthroughs appear imminent.
   In Portugal, a U.S. Embassy official said on Monday that top
U.S. and Soviet negotiators on southern Africa will meet in Lisbon
this week to discuss the civil war in Angola and South Africa's
control of Namibia.
   Chester Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, and Anatoly Adamishin, a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, will open the talks Wednesday, embassy spokeswoman Susan
Clyde said. She said only Soviet and U.S. officials are expected to
take part in the talks.
   Crocker and Adamishin have met several times recently to discuss
ways of ending the conflicts in southern Africa.
   Also Monday, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said
Angola accepted the principle of a gradual withdrawal of the Cuban
military personnel from his country.
   In an interview with the official Angolan news agency ANGOP, dos
Santos said the United States is refusing to recognize Angola
diplomatically until the Cubans have left. He said that position
was ``absurd'' and ``without any logical explanation.''
   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon, quoted dos Santos as
saying Namibian independence and the end of the Angolan war would
be decisive steps toward peace in southern Africa and the abolition
of racial segregation in South Africa.

<HEAD>Brakes Worked in Cable Car Accident, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brakes of a cable car that careened out
of control down one of the city's steepest streets were not
defective, officials said, leaving them puzzled about the cause of
the accident that injured 31 people.
   ``Everything worked the way it was supposed to,'' said George
Newkirk, spokesman for the San Francisco Municipal Railway,
operators of the historic open-air, cable-pulled trolleys.
   The cable car was jammed with tourists Monday morning when
witnesses said it barreled down rain-slick tracks on Hyde Street, a
hill with a 21-degree angle, and slammed into the rear of a large
repair truck.
   ``If the truck had not been there in the intersection, we would
not have had the accident. The truck was on the tracks. The cable
car was going 9 mph. There just wasn't time to stop it,'' Newkirk
said.
   One man, whose name was not available, was pinned under the
wheels of car No. 13, and other victims were strewn across the
intersection at Hyde and Bay streets, just above Fisherman's Wharf.
   The front of the car was ripped off and the rear of the truck
was crushed.
   Police and witnesses said the truck was stopped for a red light
when hit by the six-ton cable car, which normally travels at 9 mph.
   ``By the time we got to the bottom of the hill, we were going 30
or 40 miles per hour when we hit,'' said tourist Jed Porter of
Kansas City, Mo., who was wrapped in a blanket after the crash.
   ``I was sitting inside when the brakeman said, `Hold on, hold
on.' I held on, then we hit. We were going very fast down the
hill,'' said Esther Breckenridge, St. Charles, Mo., who was
favoring a bruised leg.
   Gripman Gerald Bolden has been with Muni since 1981 and has a
clean record, Newkirk said.
   However, Oakland television station KTVU reported Monday night
that Bolden had been a cable car gripman for just two weeks, after
receiving a month of training for the position.
   Twenty-nine people were taken to 10 hospitals, and two people
were treated at the scene. Injuries ranged from cuts and bruises to
fractures. Five people were admitted to hospitals with fractures,
but no one was seriously injured, said San Francisco General
Hospital spokeswoman Gloria Rodriguez.
   A spokeswoman for Kingston Contracting Co., located in
Burlingame 30 miles south of San Francisco, said the company would
not comment on the accident, which involved one of its so-called
``cherry-pickers.''
   The truck driver, whose hand was injured, declined to give his
name or to talk at the scene, except to say, ``I don't feel good. I
was told not to say anything.''
   Newkirk disputed accounts by witnesses who said the car's
braking system appeared not to work and that the car accelerated
before plowing into the truck.
   ``It may have appeared that way to people on the car, but from
the evidence on the scene the track brake was working ...'' he said.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether the brake was
applied too late to stop the crash, he said.
   ``We are trying to determine at what point it was applied. It
may have been just before the impact with the truck,'' Newkirk said.
   Rain-slicked tracks also could have caused the car to slide,
rather than to stop abruptly, he said.
   The same intersection was the scene of the worst accident in
cable car history, when an out-of-control cable car slammed into
several cars, killing two people and injuring 43 on Dec. 3, 1967.
   Each cable car has four separate braking systems. As a last
resort, the gripman can pull a red ``hot-line'' lever, which rams
an 18-inch-long steel blade into the cable slot. That brake was
activated in the latest case and, although it failed to halt the
car, it welded itself to the steel slot and had to be cut out with
a torch.

   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from South Carolina to
New England today after strong storms in Dixie killed two men,
flattened buildings and knocked out power to thousands of people.
   Temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s in the upper
Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes this morning, and a
frost advisory was issued for northern Wisconsin.
   However, on Monday high-temperature records up to 95 years old
were broken in nine cities and tied in three, mostly in the West.
   The showers and thunderstorms which wreaked havoc in the South
on Monday afternoon and evening were abating today. Widely
scattered showers and thundershowers also lingered from the
southern High Plains to California.
   Fair weather prevailed across the central third of the country,
but brisk winds prevailed in the northern Plains.
   During Monday's storms, lightning struck a flag held by a
19-year-old University of Georgia freshman playing golf on the
Athens campus, killing him, officials said.
   Just east of Atlanta, a construction worker was killed and his
injured brother had to be rescued when high winds flattened the
two-story apartment building where they were working, authorities
said. Three others walked out of the demolished structure unharmed.
   The five men had moved into the building's breezeway for shelter
when they saw the storm heading their way, said DeKalb County Fire
Chief Thomas Brown. ``The building came down in what we call
pancake fashion, straight down on them,'' Brown said.
   In South Carolina, the storm produced winds reaching 63 mph that
flipped a mobile home in Santee, blew down a garage near
Chesterfield and downed large trees and power lines.
   In North Carolina, the storm knocked out power to nearly 4,000
people, utility officials said, and downed trees.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell in the Carolinas.
   In the West, a thunderstorm in northwestern Montana spawned a
tornado near Shelby. No injuries or damage were reported. A cold
front moving through eastern Oregon generated gusts up to 65 mph.
   Temperature records set Monday included a reading of 91 degrees
in Helena, Mont., where the old mark of 87 degrees was set in 1893.
Records in the high 80s or 90s were also set in Denver, the Montana
cities of Billings, Havre and Great Falls and Casper and Lander,
Wyo.
   It was a record 93 degrees in Fort Smith, Ark. Records were tied
in New Orleans, Scottsbluff, Neb.; and Worland, Wyo.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from New
York and New England to the middle and south Atlantic states and
Mississippi, and in parts of the northern and central Rockies, with
a few showers in the Pacific Northwest and windy conditions
prevailing from Idaho to the northern Rockies and the northern and
central Plains.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 70s or 80s over
most of the nation; 90 degrees in parts of South Carolina and
coastal sections of Alabama and Mississippi; 90s to around 100
degrees from southwest Texas to the desert Southwest; 50s or 60s
from the northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest and northern and
coastal sections of California and from northern Minnesota to the
Great Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and much of New England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Sawyer Air Force Base in Marquette, Mich., to 86 degrees
at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Reinstates Libel Suit Against Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Time magazine article about a company once
co-owned by Labor Secretary Ray Donovan was unfair and slanted, a
federal appeals court said as it reinstated a libel suit filed by
the company.
   But the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday also
classifed the company and its chairman as public figures, meaning
they must meet the difficult test of proving Time showed ``actual
malice'' before collecting damages.
   The suit, filed by Schiavone Construction Co. of Secaucus, N.J.,
and chairman Ronald Schiavone, centers on an Aug. 23, 1982, article
about a special federal prosecutor reopening an investigation into
Donovan's activities while he was labor secretary.
   The magazine cited a memo from William Webster, then FBI
director, saying the name Schiavone appeared several times in the
agency's reports on the 1975 disappearance of former Teamster boss
Jimmy Hoffa.
   The company charged that the article unfairly failed to mention
that the memo also said the reports linked the company and director
to no criminal acts.
   In November 1986, U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin threw out
the suit, saying the reputations of Schiavone and his company were
so poor they were ``libel proof'' and could not be damaged further
by the article.
   The appeals court noted Schiavone's lawyers argued the ``sting''
of the article did not rest with references to Mafia connections
but in references to Schiavone and the Hoffa disappearance.
   ``If the jury were to find the sting to be the association with
Hoffa's disappearance, then it might find that Schiavone and SCC
had suffered actual or presumed damages,'' the court said.
   The court also affirmed an earlier ruling by Sarokin that Time
was not immune to the libel suit under New Jersey's ``fair report
privilege.'' Under the law, reporters are shielded from libel suits
while quoting official reports, even if the reports later prove
inaccurate.
   The appellate court ruled that Time forfeited the privilege
because the reporter intentionally left out a portion of the FBI
memo.
   ``We believe that Time's omission presents a clear example of an
unfair report that does not deserve the qualified privilege to
reproduce a libel,'' Circuit Judge Edward R. Becker wrote for the
three-judge panel.
   ``The last paragraph in Time's article combines selective
quoting and innuendo to provide a very different message than the
article would have conveyed had it included the exculpatory
material,'' Becker wrote.
   The Time story questioned why the FBI, during its routine
investigation of Donovan before his Senate confirmation, withheld
information from a special prosecutor.

   More than 100 communist rebels, some
shooting flaming arrows, raided a government outpost in the
northern Philippines in a clash that left 13 people dead, the
military said today.
   In the Bicol peninsula on the southern tip of Luzon island,
soldiers killed five guerrillas and wounded two in two separate
military offensives late Monday and early today, a military report
said.
   The reported deaths brought to at least 27 the number of people
killed in clashes with rebels during the last five days.
   The military said the rebel attack took place in the Mountain
Province town of Paracelis, 190 miles north of Manila.
   Col. Enrique Pilapil, regional constabulary commander, said
outnumbered soldiers at the outpost repulsed the attack on Sunday
by about 150 communist New People's Army rebels, killing eight
guerrillas during a six-hour gunbattle.
   Pilapil said five defenders were killed and five were wounded.
He added that the rebels fired flaming arrows at the detachment
before retreating.
   In another clash, troops backed by anti-communist vigilantes
repelled an attack by communist rebels Saturday, killing five
insurgents and wounding 12 in Makilala in North Cotabato, 600 miles
south of Manila on Mindanao island.
   On Panay island, 40 rebels ambushed a government patrol Friday
in the town of Leon, 285 miles southeast of Manila, killing four
militiamen. The military report did not say whether there were
casualties on the rebel side.

<TEXT>
   Syria and Iran agreed today to renew
diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting between Shiite Moslem
factions in Beirut's southern slums, where Western hostages are
believed to be held.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
pro-Syrian Amal militia continued to battle with mortars and
machine guns during the night, defying a new cease-fire called by
Iran and Syria.
   Police said 12 people were killed and 40 wounded since the
latest truce was called at 11 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT) on Monday. It was
the seventh cease-fire called since fighting broke out May 6 in the
16-square-mile enclave.
   The latest clash brought the casualty toll to 237 killed and 746
wounded.
   In other developments, unconfirmed reports said the Iranians and
Syrians were working on a deal under which the Syrian army would
not try to free the hostages if its soldiers moved into the area.
The United States indicated it would be willing to talk with the
captors of the hostages in the slums.
   Shell blasts and gunfire echoed across Beirut today. Police said
Amal, which has lost most of the territory it held in the region,
mounted a counterattack to regain the sprawling Shiyah district.
   ``Amal is pushing hard and Hezbollah is retreating in Shiyah for
a second day,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be named under
standing rules. ``But the fundamentalists remain in control of 90
percent of the slums. Only the Syrians can crush them.''
   The Syrians massed thousands of troops around the embattled
enclave in the last two days, poising for a push to stop the
fighting.
   ``We're ready to go in, but zero hour has not been set yet,''
said a Syrian colonel commanding the main highway to the airport
facing Hezbollah's strongholds.
   The agreement to revive political efforts to end the battle was
reached in meetings held Monday and today by Iran's acting foreign
minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, government leaders and army
officers in Damascus and Beirut.
   ``The door is still open for political efforts,'' Syria's
military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan,
said after a one-hour meeting with Besharati.
   But Kenaan stopped short of saying whether Syria would rescind
its decision to send troops into the slums with shoot-to-kill
orders to separate and disarm the combatants.
   ``That decision has been taken after all peaceful methods were
exhausted,'' Kenaan told reporters. ``But if there is a new hope to
stop the bloodbath with political efforts, we'll give it a try.''
   Besharati told reporters the talks with Kenaan were
``positive.'' He did not elaborate beyond saying: ``I came to
bandage the bleeding wounds of the suburbs.''
   Christian-controlled radio stations said Besharati's talks were
focusing on a three-point deal:
   _A pledge that the Syrians would not seek to free the 18 foreign
hostages believed held by Hezbollah-affilated extremists in the
slums. Nine Americans are believed to be among the hostages.
   _Safety and freedom for an estimated 500 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards fighting alongside Hezbollah before the Syrians move in.
   _Hezbollah as well as Amal would lay down arms provided they be
allowed to function as unarmed political parties.
   The report could not be independently verified. Besharati and
the Iranian Embassy refused to comment. Christian radio stations
have rarely been accurate on Moslem affairs.
   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, head of the Supreme Shiite
Council, the sect's highest religious body, reiterated today that
Syrian forces should move in. ``Every other method is just a waste
of time'' he said in a statement broadcast by Beirut radio stations.
   The United States indicated on Monday it would be willing to
talk with the captors of the hostages believed held in the slums.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, asked about reports
that the hostages had been moved from the slums, said: ``I don't
have anything to say about their whereabouts.''
   He said Washington was pleased by a call from the spiritual
guide of Hezbollah, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, for talks
about the hostages.

   Thousands of radical students yelling
anti-government and anti-American slogans battled police with rocks
and firebombs in six cities today to mark a 1980 uprising.
   Waves of students hurling firebombs, rocks and bricks fought
riot police around college campuses in Seoul and the provincial
cities of Kwangju, Taejon, Chongju, Pusan and Chonju.
   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, reported that 22,000 students at
58 colleges took part in confrontations and peaceful protests, but
did not give a breakdown. News reports estimated 9,000 students
participated in the unrest that started Monday in Seoul and other
cities.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship,'' ``Yankee go home'' and
``Down with the murder regime,'' the students shouted in the
running clashes.
   Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues, black metal
helmets and gas masks fired volleys of choking tear gas to drive
protesters back. Armored vans with multiple tear gas launchers
fired salvos of tear gas bombs as martial arts squads charged
protesters.
   At least two students were injured in fighting at seven college
campuses in Seoul, but police declined to give any overall figures.
Several police officers were hit by firebombs.
   The clashes occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the May
18, 1980 anti-government uprising in Kwangju, where at least 191
people died in a suppression led by the military.
   Radical students and dissidents contend the death toll was in
the hundreds and demand that President Roh Tae-woo and other top
leaders, who were military commanders at the time, be punished for
suppressing the rebellion.
   About 4,000 students held a large rally today at Chonnam
University in Kwangju and then fought with riot police when the
students attempted to march off campus. Student leaders vowed to
hold daily protests for a week in Kwangju, 165 miles southwest of
Seoul.
   ``Punish culprit Roh Tae-woo,'' the students shouted.
   National police were on general alert because of the protests.
Security was increased in Seoul with riot police detachments
guarding key buildings and college campuses.
   Protesters chanted anti-American slogans because of their claims
the United States has supported military rule in South Korea. An
estimated 40,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a
defense pact.
   Students burned effigies of Roh and the United States at Seoul
National University in Seoul. Protesters in Kwangju marched with a
large sign showing a broken American flag.
   ``Go home Yankees who supported the chief culprits in the
Kwangju massacre,'' students chanted.
   Roh, who took power Feb. 25 after winning election in December,
has promised to introduce full democracy and has ended many of the
authoritarian polices of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   But many Koreans are distrustful of the former general. Radical
students and dissidents still mount protests against the government
and demand a full accounting of the Kwangju revolt.
   Students and residents seized control of Kwangju in 1980 during
anti-government demonstrations shortly after Chun and the military
seized power. The military moved in combat units and crushed the
revolt, leaving a legacy that traumatized Korean society.
   In another development today, the trial of a former police
officer charged with sexually torturing a female dissident in 1986
was interrupted at least 20 times in 90 minutes.
   About 150 people repeatedly disrupted the trial in Inchon, a
port city west of Seoul, of Moon Kwi-dong. They threw eggs and
shouted insults and anti-government slogans. A pair of scissors was
seized from a woman who said she wanted to attack Moon.

   Police used tear gas and
birdshot to disperse black squatters who have been protesting a
decision to charge them rent for their shacks, authorities said
today.
   Officers used tear gas against a group of black protesters who
gathered Monday at the Weiler's Farm Shantytown, then later used
birdshot to disperse blacks who threw stones at buses and taxis,
police said.
   The Sowetan, a black-oriented newspaper, said thousands of
Weiler's Farm residents stayed away from work Monday to protest the
imposition of a $17 monthly rent. Many of them earn less than $50
per month.
   The Sowetan said a female protester was arrested and a man was
hospitalized after he was bitten by a police dog.
   Weiler's Farm is designated as an temporary squatter camp.
Whites in the area, 25 miles south of Johannesburg, have complained
about the settlement, and its estimated 7,000 residents are
scheduled to be moved later this year.
   Authorities decided in March to begin charging rent. Community
leaders say a lower rent might be acceptable, but the Transvaal
Province Administration contends that it must charge the $17
monthly to cover the cost of services.
   In an unrelated clash Monday, at least five black workers were
injured when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at strikers
trying to stop delivery trucks from leaving a Coca Cola bottling
plant in Durban, union officials said. Police reported six injuries
and said strikers had thrown chairs at the trucks.
   The Food and Allied Workers Union says 2,500 workers are
striking against Amalgamated Beverage Industries at five plants to
protest alleged unfair labor practices. The stoppage began in
Durban two weeks ago. No other details were available.
   In another incident, police said three black men were stabbed to
death by black youths on Monday in Natal province.
   This followed five killings in the area Sunday, and indicated a
possible escalation of feuding between militant anti-apartheid
factions and the more moderate Inkatha, the Natal-based political
organization of Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Buthelezi,
although critical of apartheid, is considered too conservative by
many activists.
   More than 500 people have died in the Natal conflict in the past
18 months. Among those killed on Sunday was the son of Abdul
Awetha, a prominent Inkatha leader who is accused in court papers
of involvement in attacks on militants.

   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Angola invited Pope John Paul II to visit his country.
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, a papal envoy, announced the
invitation Monday after an audience with the president in the
Angolan capital of Luanda, the official news agency ANGOP said in a
report monitored in Lisbon.
   The report did not say if the pope accepted the invitation to
travel to the south African nation, which has been beset by civil
war for 13 years.
   Guerrillas of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, supported by South Africa and the United States, have been
fighting to topple the Cuban- and Soviet-backed Marxist government
since 1975.
   Roman Catholicism was introduced to Angola by the Portuguese,
the country's colonial rulers until 1975, and remains the principal
religion.
   The pope has never visited Angola. He will travel to Mozambique,
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland in September.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Senate Judiciary Committee
today renewed his call for Attorney General Edwin Meese III to
resign, saying he is ``an embarrassment to the country.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, made his comments one day after
Meese fired the department's chief spokesman, Terry Eastland, for
allegedly not defending the attorney general aggressively enough.
The firing prompted the head of Meese's speech-writing unit,
William Schambra, to quit.
   ``It just appears that Ed Meese wants to fire anybody who
disagrees with him or if he doesn't fire them they seem to be
resigning on their own,'' Metzenbaum said on CBS's ``This Morning''
show.
   ``I think it's time for Ed Meese to clean house and start at the
top and it's time for Ed Meese to resign. I think he's an
embarrassment to the administration. Frankly, I think he's an
embarrassment to the country,'' the senator said.
   Metzenbaum, noting an editorial in the politically-conservative
Washington Times today that urges the attorney general to resign,
said: ``I think the conservative backers across the board are
walking away from Ed Meese.''
   ``I think they recognize that he's bad news as far as being able
to stand up for conservative principles, to speak out for them and
I think they recognize that the sooner he gets off the ship the
better it will be for the Reagan administration,'' he said.
   Metzenbaum intially called for Meese's resignation in late March
after Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal division
chief William Weld quit out of concern that Meese's continued
tenure as attorney general in the face of a criminal probe was
hurting the Justice Department's operations.

   A military court scolded two soldiers today for
firing live ammunition in an Arab village where a teen-ager was
killed. Troops shot and seriously wounded a Palestinian who tried
to wrest a gun from a soldier.
   An army spokesman said the shooting today occurred in the
Kalandia refugee camp north of Jerusalem after soldiers tried to
stop an Arab man from violating a curfew.
   The man got out of his car and tried to take a gun from one of
the soldiers, and the troops opened fire, wounding the Palestinian
in the abdomen, the army said.
   A doctor at Ramallah Hospital identified the man as Ali Asnan
Youssef, 31, and said he also had bruises on the abdomen indicating
he was beaten before the shooting.
   Kalandia was one of four refugee camps and towns under curfew in
the occupied territories on the second day of the three-day holiday
that ends Ramadan, the Moslem holy month of fasting.
   Underground leaders of a five-month-old uprising have urged
Palestinians to make the holiday one of ``national mourning'' for
the 190 Arabs killed in the rebellion.
   In clashes Monday, troops killed two Palestinians in Gaza and
the village of Azmut in the West Bank and 13 people were wounded.
   The army said an officer was ``severely scolded'' and another
soldier given a suspended jail sentence of 35 days for the shooting
incident in Azmut.
   Officers were still investigating whether the 15-year-old
teen-ager reported killed in the confrontation was shot by soldiers.
   An army spokesman said the soldier involved, who was not
identified by name, fired against regulations and his officer did
not stop him.
   The army, meanwhile, lifted a four-day curfew from the West
Bank's largest city of Nablus and from the Shati refugee camp in
Gaza, but later declared the camp a closed military area, barring
residents from leaving and reporters from entering.
   Also today, the army said a military court had extended by 18
days the detention of an Arab woman from the village of Beita who
could be tried for murder or attempted murder for the death of a
Jewish teen-age girl there last month.
   The woman, Muneira Salah Daoud, is suspected of stoning a Jewish
guard, prompting him to fire his weapon, the army said.
   An army investigation determined that the teen-ager, Tirza
Porat, died of a bullet fired from the guard's weapon.
   Israeli news reports said Ms. Daoud attacked the guard only
after he shot and killed her brother during the melee.
   Israeli officials have warned, meanwhile, that the Palestinian
uprising was severely straining Israel's budget.
   On Monday, Economics Minister Gad Ya'acobi told Army radio that
the government would ``not be able to absorb for long, sums of
hundreds of millions of shekels without this badly damaging the
readiness of those two forces.''
   Ya'acobi gave no figure for the cost but Israeli news reports
have put it at 800 million shekels or about $530 million.
   U.S. folk singer Joan Baez on Monday accused Israel army radio
of censoring her because she insisted on singing a protest song the
station had banned.
   The station canceled a live broadcast of a performance by Ms.
Baez after she announced she would sing the song, entitled
``Shooting and Crying.''
   The song, written by singer Si Hi-man two months after the Arab
uprising began, criticizes the army's use of violence, including
beatings, to quell the disturbances.

<TEXT>
   Flour, sugar and other staples are
in short supply in the Yugoslav capital because residents are
stocking up in anticipation of huge price increases later this
month, newspapers reported today.
   Coffee disappeared first from Belgrade shops. City authorities
said they would dip into emergency reserves to supply 250 tons of
coffee to consumers, the Vecernje Novosti daily reported.
   Local media reported about 80 percent of the country's
manufacturers have announced they will boost prices when the
government lifts a price freeze later this month. New prices are
expected to be about 50 to 70 percent higher than the current ones.
   The government has announced a 3 percent increase in the price
of coffee, effective immediately. One kilogram of coffee now costs
$13.
   Belgrade authorities said the sale of detergents jumped by 100
percent, cooking oil by 70 percent, flour by 50 percent and sugar
by 45 percent compared to the week before.
   ``Shelves storing these items are virtually empty,'' said
Vecernje Novosti.
   City officials called on Yugoslavs not to stockpile goods,
saying the practice could create even worse shortages.
   The price freeze was to end May 15, but was postponed until
later this month after the government announced it had failed to
secure about $300 million in emergency credits from the West.
   The government said the funds were a condition for Yugoslavia to
receive an expected $1.4 billion in new loans from the
International Monetary Fund, Western governments and banks, to
finance the country's $20 billion foreign debt.
   Failure to secure the initial funds led the government to delay
the lifting of the wage and price freeze until an agreement on the
loans is reached.
   The lifting of the six-month price freeze will also coincide
with a package of economic measures intended to reduce Yugoslavia's
170 percent inflation rate, Europe's highest, and help the country
repay its foreign debt.
   The economic package includes ceilings on wage increases,
measures against the further decline of Yugoslavia's currency, the
dinar, the lifting of import barriers and the gradual closing down
of industries which show losses.
   The austerity program is likely to contribute to a further drop
in Yugoslavia's living standards, which have already fallen by
one-third since 1980. Labor unrest, which in 1987 produced over
1,500 strikes, is also expected to grow.

<HEAD>Three Trading Executives Charged With Illegal Exports To China</HEAD>

   Police charged three trading company executives
today with exporting high-technology equipment to China in
violation of rules governing the sale of Western technology to
communist nations.
   The Metropolitan Police Department said it arrested Yoshikazu
Ono, 44, and Teruko Takeuchi, 43, of the Kyokuto Shokai company;
and Yasuhiko Kusabe, 51, of Shinsei Koeki.
   Police said Kyokuto Shokai and Shinsei Koeki exported electronic
equipment to China between June 1985 and November 1986 without
government permission.
   Ono was in charge of all exports by Kyokuto Shokai while
Takeuchi was in charge of the company's exports to China. Kusabe
was in charge of exports by Shinsei Koeki.
   The three were charged with violating two Japanese laws, the
Foreign Exchange and Trade Control Law and the Customs Law.
   Exporting such equipment to communist nations is banned by the
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, a
Paris-based watchdog body on trade with Commuist bloc nations.
   Police also filed charges under the same laws against the two
companies and Iwatsu Electric Co., which manufactured the exported
products. Police said Iwatsu is suspected of supplying digital
equipment to Kyokuto with the knowledge that it would be exported
to China.
   The United States demanded Japan enforce its export controls
after the Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidiary of the electronics
giant Toshiba Corp., was charged last year with illegally exporting
sophisticated technology to the Soviet Union.
   Police raided the three companies charged today on April 5 in
response to a Ministry of International Trade and Industry request.
A ministry official said it had investigated the case independently
based on tips given by a U.S. government official, whom it declined
to identify.
   ``China is coming to be treated differently from the rest of the
Soviet bloc countries in terms of export controls,'' said Ichiro
Takahara, deputy director of export section of the trade ministry.
``But there is no excuse on these cases because it evaded the
responsibility of applying for (ministry) permission.''
   Takahara said permission would not have been granted because of
restrictions on the export of the equipment.
   Police said Kyokuto Shokai illegally exported 30 digital memory
devices, signal analyzers and sampling oscilloscopes worth about
$500,000 to China between June 9, 1985, and June 3, 1986.
Authorities allege the equipment was taken to China in hand-carried
luggage when company employees visited there.
   Shinsei Koeki allegedly exported four sets of digital memory
devices worth $136,000 to China between July 1986 and November 1986
after its export application was rejected, police said.
   Defense analysts said the products have limited military
applications.
   Penalties for the men could vary. Two Toshiba employees were
sentenced to two years in prison and fined $80,000 for the same
offense.

   The dollar skyrocketed in Europe today after the
U.S. government reported that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit
improved sharply in March.
   The pound plunged after British commercial banks cut their base
lending rate by half a percentage point to 7.5 percent, heeding a
signal from the Bank of England.
   The combination of the two developments pushed the dollar up
more than three cents against the British pound.
   The Commerce Department reported that the merchandise trade
deficit shrank to $9.7 billion in March from $13.8 billion in
February.
   The figure was dramatically better than the markets had been
expecting. The consensus had been for a deficit of between $12
billion and $13 billion.
   The markets were surprised by today's cut in British interest
rates, engineered earlier by the central bank apparently to stem
the recent rise in the pound.
   In London, it cost $1.8540 to buy one pound after the cut and
trade report, cheaper than $1.8855 in the morning, and sharply
lower than the $1.8915 of late Monday.
   The dollar was quoted at 125.85 yen in London after the report,
compared with 124.95 yen before.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 124.82 yen, up from 124.73 yen late Monday.
   Other dollar rates after the report, with midmorning rates in
parentheses and compared with late Monday's rates, were: 1.7050
(1.6875) West German marks, up from 1.6860; 1.4155 (1.4025) Swiss
francs, up from 1.4013; 5.7639 (5.7205) French francs, up from
5.7170; 1.9065 (1.8917) Dutch guilders, up from 1.8890; 1,262.00
(1,254.75) Italian lire, up from 1,253.45; 1.2375 (1.2328) Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2322
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $452.60 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $453.15. Both were down from late Monday's bid
of $455.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $453, down from $454 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 57 cents to close at a bid
$454.67.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.58 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $6.70.

   The Foreign Office today identified a fifth Briton
killed in terrorist attacks in Sudan and warned British citizens
against traveling to Khartoum, the capital city.
   Police in Khartoum arrested three foreigners armed with
automatic pistols and submachine guns in connection with the
attacks on the Acropol Hotel and the nearby Sudan Club.
   The attacks occurred Sunday night. First, two bombs went off
near the dining room of the Acropol and then gunmen raided the
Sudan Club.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Sally Rockett, a 32-year-old
British teacher, was killed in the Acropol.
   Earlier, officials said a British family of four and two
Sudanese had died in the Acropol attack.
   The Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
said 26 people were injured in the hotel attack but only four
needed hospital treatment.
   In the attack on the Sudan Club, frequented by Britons and
members of the British Commonwealth, the Foreign Office said a
Sudanese was badly injured but no one was killed.
   Police in Khartoum earlier had said one man died in the Sudan
Club raid but today it appeared that no one had died at the club.
   The Foreign Office issued a warning against travel to Khartoum
but stressed this applied only to the capital, not to the entire
country.
   ``Anyone who has imminent business in Khartoum should consider
whether it is urgent. If not urgent, then defer for a few days
until the situation becomes clearer,'' the Foreign Office said.
   The other Britons killed at the Acropol Hotel were Chris Rolfe,
35, his wife, Clare, 37, and their children Thomas, 3, and Louise,
1. The couple had been working for the Ockenden Venture, a private
British relief charity.
   The dead Sudanese were identified as a brigadier in the Sudanese
army and a waiter.

   Several hundred rush-hour commuters were evacuated
from two of London's busiest subway stations this morning after
smoke from an electrical fire filled tunnels and spread onto the
platforms.
   ``As far as we know there were no injuries,'' said a spokesman
for the London Fire Brigade, who by custom was not identified.
   Police and firefighters, using loudspeakers, cleared choking
commuters from Embankment Station, where the fire started, and
Waterloo Station just across the River Thames, where smoke spread
through underground tunnels, the spokesman said.
   Acting police inspector Peter Bird said smoke was spotted
shortly after 7 a.m. in a cable duct under the southbound Bakerloo
Line at Embankment Station. ``It was not a serious fire,'' he said.
   But the Fire Brigade spokesman said the smoke ``caused
considerable distress to passengers.''
   ``We had 25 firefighters at Embankment and another six at
Waterloo leading passengers away and checking that stations were
clear,'' he said.
   Richard Peace, divisional fire officer, said firefighters
discovered the source of the blaze by using special thermal imaging
cameras that pick up heat. He said the fire had been put out and
the spread of smoke had been contained before the rush hour reached
its peak.
   Trains were stopped on either side of Embankment station during
the fire.
   London Transport, which operates the subway system, said both
stations were reopened at 10 a.m. after damaged cable had been
replaced at Embankment.
   A subway fire Nov. 18 at the King's Cross station, London's
busiest, killed 31 people and injured about 80. A pre-World War II
escalator at King's Cross caught fire and flames leaped upward,
engulfing the ticket hall and sending clouds of smoke into tunnels
and platforms.

a Calumet River bridge, allowing river passage for first time in 10
days, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.
   About 50 tons of wreckage were still on the ship Monday when it
was towed from the scene of the mishap and docked at a nearby
landing, said Michael Snyder, attorney for the ship's owner,
Folkstone Maritime Ltd.
   ``It looks like an ocean-going vessel with a crown of thorns on
the top of its bridge,'' said Tom Hogan, an attorney for CSX Corp.,
the bridge's owner.
   A tangled mass of the bridge and the freighter had blocked
traffic on the river, which connects an industrial district with
Lake Michigan, since May 6. Factories along the river received
materials over land, but the blockage caused inventories to run low.
   Officials of CSX, owner of the Baltimore and Ohio River Bridge,
said the freighter Pontokratis rammed the bridge. But the vessel's
crew said the drawbridge was lowered onto the cargo ship.
   None of the 27 crew members of the ship were hurt, but the
ship's damage totaled about $3 million, Snyder said Monday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard are
conducting independent investigations of what caused the bridge and
freighter to become entangled. But neither has issued any findings
of cause or blame for the wreck, Fred Maldonado of the Coast Guard
Marine Safety Office in Chicago said Monday.

   About 90 Indian commandos pushed into the
Golden Temple complex today to try to dislodge Sikh militants from
two towers overlooking the golden-domed shrine, police said.
   It was the first major probe into the complex, Sikhism's holiest
shrine, since a police siege of the shrine began May 9.
   The advance came after Sikh extremists, in an apparent effort to
divert attention from the besieged temple complex, killed 44 people
Monday and early today in the highest 24-hour toll in their
6-year-old campaign to form an independent nation in Punjab.
   Punjab Police Chief K.P.S. Gill told a news conference tha
anti-terrorist Black Cat commandos had taken over the upper
basement of a building, which is attached to the temple's dining
hall, east of the pool surrounding the temple.
   Militants have been using the building's two towers to fire down
on security forces surrounding the shrine's perimeter.
   About six Sikh extremists were believed trapped in a lower
basement, Gill said.
   The building is not considered the temple's inner sanctum.
   Any attempt to storm the inner sanctum would be viewed by devout
Sikhs as the gravest desecration.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards
on Oct. 31, 1984, four months after she ordered the army into the
Golden Temple to uproot armed Sikh militants. More than 1,200
people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in that assault.
   Today, security forces fired scores of incendiary shells and
machine gun rounds at the 120-foot towers to force the militants to
retreat to the basements.
   Small groups of commandos had gone to the rooftop and upper
stories of the dining hall starting Sunday.
   Meanwhile, 18 people were shot to death when militants opened
fire with AK-47 automatic rifles in the market of the village of
Samana in Patiala District, Indian newspapers reported.
   At least 18 others were injured in Samana, 140 miles southeast
of Amritsar near Punjab's border with Haryana state, news reports
said.
   Details were not immediately available on the remaining dead.
   In the previous highest one-day toll, 37 people were killed by
Sikh extremists on April 1. The latest figures raise to at least
1,008 the number of deaths blamed on Sikh extremists in Punjab this
year. About 1,030 deaths were attributed to the militants in all of
1987.
   Earlier today, the 2,800 security troops surrounding the Golden
Temple complex called a cease-fire and urged the estimated 40 to 50
Sikh extremists inside the shrine to surrender.
   Instead, the militants used the lull in the security forces'
firing to try to replenish their supplies.
   An Associated Press reporter, watching from a nearby rooftop,
saw two Sikhs run out of the temple with their hands in the air as
if to surrender. The inner sanctum of the temple is where most of
the gunmen are believed to have taken refuge in recent days.
   The two men darted into a nearby building and then moved several
sacks to the temple's walkway.
   Police said they believed the sacks contained food and
ammunition and opened fire to prevent the two men from returning to
the temple. The men retreated to the storage building and it could
not be determined if they had been hit.
   Three other Sikhs were seen using pails to pull water from the
pool around the temple during the cease-fire.
   Chaman Lal, inspector-general of Punjab police, made the call
for surrender. He was joined by six people, all relatives of those
still inside the shrine, who were among 146 who surrendered to
police on Sunday. Similar appeals were made during two cease-fires
Monday.
   Although a majority in Punjab, Sikhs form only 2 percent of
India's population of 800 million. The militants say they are
discriminated against by the Hindus, who are 82 percent of the
population.
   Eight hundred people, most of them pilgrims or temple workers,
were brought out of the temple May 10.
   The siege began after Sikh gunmen inside the temple opened fire
on a party of police commanders who had gone to nearby roofs to
inspect what appeared to be a new bunker outside the temple walls.
   At least 35 people, mostly Sikh militants, have died since the
siege began.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, in one of his
sternest lectures to a head of state, told President Alfredo
Stroessner that the granting of human rights ``is not a question of
political convenience.''
   In an address Monday night to Stroessner, top government aides
and foreign diplomats at the presidential palace, the pope said
``respect for human rights ... stems from the dignity of the person
by virtue of his condition as a creature of God.''
   Stroessner, 75, has ruled Paraguay since a coup in 1954.
   The pope also defended the church's role in social causes,
saying, ``You can't corner the church in its temples.''
   Today, the pope met for an hour with 1,000 priests, nuns and
seminarians, then left by car for a Mass with peasant farmers in
Villarrica, a regional agricultural center of 50,000 people 100
miles southeast of the capital.
   In his meeting in the National Cathedral, the pontiff told the
clergy they must give preference in their ministries to the poor
``who in Paraguay, as in so many parts of Latin America, suffer
every kind of privation.''
   ``So many peasants, laborers and workers without employment or
being exploited lack their badly needed bread,'' John Paul said.
   John Paul flew from Peru to Paraguay, the last stop on his
four-nation South American tour, and met privately with Stroessner
for 30 minutes before delivering his speech.
   Stroessner responded by declaring his government was
democratically elected and saying, ``Here we don't suffer the
scourge of terrorism, hunger or drugs.'' He described Paraguay as a
country ``without social or political crises, tumult, street
violence, polticial prisoners or hate.''
   Relations between the Stroessner government and the Vatican were
strained last week when Paraguayan authorities canceled a meeting
between the pope and a Church-sponsored civic group that includes
opposition figures. After talks with the Church, the government
lifted the ban, but members of Stroessner's governing Colorado
Party were expected to boycott the meeting today.
   The pontiff arrived in Paraguay on Monday afternoon. Minutes
later, police picked up a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Donald
Bahlinger of Baton Rouge, La., and three Paraguayan labor and
peasant activitists as they left a downtown church in Asuncion, the
capital. People had gathered in the church for a fast and prayer
service protesting Stroessner's authoritarian rule.
   Radio Caritas, Asuncion's Catholic-run station, later said
Bahlinger had been released but there was no word on the
whereabouts of the Paraguayans.
   In his speech at the presidential palace, the pontiff said:
   ``It is the duty and obligation of political power to create and
make posssible those social conditions that favor the real and
complete good of the person ... respecting the legitimate freedom
of individuals, families and intermediate groups.''
   ``We live in democracy in Paraguay,'' Stroessner responded. He
said the last presidential election in February occurred ``in an
atmosphere of order and civic maturity, without spilling a drop of
blood.''
   Stroessner was elected to an eighth consecutive term with 88.6
percent of the vote. Opposition leaders claimed the balloting was
rigged.
   Stroessner referred to Paraguay's Catholic roots but made no
direct mention of present church-state relations. His government
has denounced some Catholic priests, calling them communists and
subversives because of their involvement in social and labor issues.
   Bahlinger is a Jesuit priest who has worked with Paraguayan
peasants for eight years at a mission 120 miles south of Asuncion
near the Argentine border. In an interview at the church shortly
before he was detained, he said the rural poor in this nation of 3
million are severely repressed.
   ``You can taste the fear in the countryside. It's diabolical,''
he said.
   Paraguay is the last stop on the 12-day papal tour that included
Uruguay, Bolvia and Peru. The pope leaves on Wednesday, his 68th
birthday, for Rome.

<HEAD>Farm Family Leaves Quietly Before Eviction Deadline</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with family leaving before
eviction deadline; picks up 9th graf, `On hand ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Members of an embattled farm family enjoyed a
ceremonial ``last meal'' with about 200 friends and relatives, then
packed up and left before a sheriff arrived today to evict them
from their home of four decades.
   Shortly before the eviction deadline of 7 a.m., Kenneth
Leffelman left his empty farm in his pickup truck, and his wife
Marguerite drove off in a school bus, which she drives every
morning.
   ``I don't know where we are going to go,'' Mrs. Leffelman, 57,
said. ``We might have to pitch a tent; the bank took all our
money.''
   The Leffelmans' younger son, Terry, stood in a pasture looking
at the farm.
   ``In the long run I think our family won,'' he said. ``It drew
us a lot closer together.''
   Lee County Ciruit Judge Martin Hill had ordered the Leffelmans
to leave the 440-acre farm where they've lived for 39 years by 7
a.m. today or face trespassing charges. In addition, Leffelman's
son, Edward, and his wife, Susan, were ordered to vacate a house on
the property.
   Lee County Sheriff Tim Bivins said the two houses on the
property were empty and the Leffelmans were gone when authorities
arrived to carry out the eviction.
   ``They fought long and hard for their farm,'' Bivins said. ``I
respect that and appreciate their cooperation.''
   Leffelman, 59, spent two months in the Bureau County Jail last
winter after refusing to disclose the location of assets sought by
the First Bank of Princeton.
   The eviction stems from the bank's attempt to settle a debt that
once stood at $782,259.
   In a telephone interview Monday night, Mrs. Leffelman said about
200 people turned out for the ``last-meal'' pot-luck dinner that
included such offerings as ham, meat loaf, chicken and roast beef.
   On hand, she said, were ``family, friends from the southern part
of Illinois to the northern part. I think there were some people
from Iowa here, too.''
   ``It was great to see how many friends were out there,'' she
said.
   ``We have no place to go,'' Mrs. Leffelman said, but added that
they could stay with family or friends for a week or two.
   The dinner, held in a farm machine shed, was sponsored by the
Farm Support Group of Sterling.
   ``We want to be there to share together, meet together and pray
together,'' said the Rev. Clark Moushon, pastor of the Broadway
United Methodist Church in Sterling, which coordinated the dinner.
   The Leffelmans recently were denied their request for Chapter 12
bankruptcy, a special section of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code developed
for farmers.
   After the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Rockford ruled that the
Leffelmans didn't qualify under Chapter 12, the First Bank of
Princeton asked the judge to order the eviction to satisfy the
remaining $600,000 debt. It already has received cash and 220 acres
of farmland toward a related debt in Bureau County.
   The case attracted attention last fall when farmers held
demonstrations.
   The bank sold livestock and took title to 680 acres of land,
three homes and machinery, although the property has remained in
Leffelman's hands.
   Leffelman was jailed on a contempt charge Oct. 19 by Bureau
County Circuit Judge James Wimbiscus after Leffelman refused to
comply with a court order to pay $75,000 toward a $95,591 debt to
the bank and disclose the location of assets sought by the bank.
   Leffelman maintained he did not have $75,000 and did not own the
assets in question because they had been placed in the Lazy ``L''
Farm Preservation Trust, of which Leffelman's daughters-in-law,
Susan and Nancy Leffelman, and family adviser Donald Tangwall were
trustees.
   Leffelman was released after complying with the court's order.

<HEAD>Communist Party to Consider Limiting Term Of General Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national Communist Party conference next month
will consider limiting the term of the general secretary in what
would be a major departure from the usual Soviet practice of
lifelong tenure, a top official said.
   Dmitri A. Lisovolik, a deputy to party Central Committee
secretary Anatoly F. Dobrynin, told a group of American business
leaders that proposals have been introduced to limit the party
leader to two or three terms of eight years each.
   General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev raised the idea of
creating a mechanism to replace aging officials in top party jobs
at a January 1987 meeting of the Central Committee, but it
apparently met with opposition then because the meeting's final
documents only made passing reference to it.
   The Soviet leader has said more freqent turnover would make
officials more accountable to the people.
   Many letters have appeared in recent weeks in the Soviet press
proposing fixed terms and age limits for the country's leaders, an
indication the idea is being brought back under consideration.
   Lisovolik, speaking at a reception Monday night to several
members of the Young Presidents Organization as well as a reporter,
did not mention the proposals for age limits. He said he could not
predict whether the proposals for fixed terms would be adopted, but
indicated support has been growing for this.
   The Young Presidents Organization is a group of American and
some foreign business leaders. A delegation of the group arrived in
Moscow on Saturday.
   Lisovolik, 50, has been chief of the U.S. section of the
International Department of the Central Committee since December
1984. He served briefly in the Soviet Embassy in Washington under
Dobrynin, who was ambassador from 1962 to 1986. Dobrynin is now
Central Committee secretary in charge of foreign affairs.
   The Washington Post today quoted Georgi A. Arbatov, another
member of the Central Committee, as saying in an interview that
there is a ``good chance'' the group will introduce proposals at
the June 28 party conference limiting the general secretary's term.
   Arbatov said the changes would not indicate any setback for
Gorbachev, who has been general secretary since March 1985.
   Communist Party general secretaries commonly serve life terms.
An exception was Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was forced from office
in 1964.

<HEAD>Israel Prepares For Locust Attack Amid Heat Wave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel set up an emergency unit today to
prepare for a possible invasion of locusts from Africa, in what
would be the first time the Biblical plague has struck the country
in almost 30 years.
   Shmuel Elhanan, director of the unit, said the Agriculture
Ministry fears that unusually high temperatures in the country
could attract swarms of the yellow desert insects, which are
already devouring crops in parts of Africa.
   A small number of the insects have been sighted in Egypt's Sinai
Desert, just south of Israel. But officials warned of a possible
larger invasion from the south.
   ``Once this locust has swarmed, it flies in groups of millions
and even billions, so that even if each one eats only part of an
ounce, the damage is impossible to estimate, just as described in
the Bible,'' said Elhanan.
   The locust threat came as the worst heat wave to strike Israel
in 18 years entered a fourth day today. Temperatures reached 113
degrees Monday in the West Bank city of Jericho.
   The heat has caused forest fires that destroyed more than 1,350
acres of trees and pastures. An Austrian tourist died of heat
stroke while hiking in the desert over the weekend.
   Elhanan told Israel radio that he had set aside light aircraft
and jeeps to spray insecticides at the locusts if they arrived.
   Some crops are destroyed by the flying swarm, but most of the
destruction occurs after the insects lay eggs at night. The larvae,
which hatch in 15 to 20 days, devour all green vegetation.
   Emergency telephone hotlines have been set up so that anyone who
spotted locusts could inform the government.
   Israel's last invasion of locusts in 1959 destroyed thousands of
crops before they were harvested.
   According to the Old Testament, a locust invasion was one of 10
plagues visited upon the ancient Egytians by the God of the
Israelites.
   ``They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured
all that was left after the hail ... nothing green remained on tree
or plant in all the land of Egypt.''(Exodus, 10:15)

<HEAD>Bill Approved Banning Most Lie Detector Tests for Private
Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators unanimously
approved a compromise bill today that would ban most lie detector
tests for private employees and job applicants, clearing the way
for swift final passage by Congress.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, ranking Republican on the Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said he would urge President Reagan to
sign the bill, which he said is endorsed by Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin and supported by the business community.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., predicted early House approval of
the bipartisan measure, which he said would ``stop the explosion,
the epidemic of lie detector tests used against employees and
prospective employees.''
   Williams and other House negotiators accepted without dissent a
Senate amendment that would allow private employers to administer
carefully controlled lie detector tests as part of a theft
investigation within a company.
   The conditions for such tests are that the employee had access
to the stolen property, that the employer had a ``reasonable
suspicion'' that the worker was involved and that the employer
details the incident and the reasons for his suspicions in a
written statement.
   Senate negotiators accepted a House provision allowing employers
to give polygraph tests to security guards and employees handling
certain controlled drugs, as long as strict standards are met and
the results are not the sole basis for adverse action against an
employee.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human
Resources panel, said the bill would effectively prohibit as much
as 85 percent of lie detector tests currently administered by
private employers.
   The bill would not cover federal, state or local government
employees or private contractors involved in government
intelligence or national security work.
   According to a summary of the bill, it is intended to
``eliminate the denial of employment opportunities by prohibiting
the least accurate yet most widely used lie detector tests _
pre-employment and random examinations _ and providing standards
for a safeguards from abuse during tests not prohibited.''
   Williams said the House, which approved its original bill last
Nov. 4, was expected to pass the compromise soon, followed by the
Senate, which had approved its version of the measure on March 3.
   ``I think we have produced a bill which will offer long-overdue
protections for millions of employees and job applicants,
long-overdue standards for those tests not prohibited by the
legislation and, hopefully, a bill which the president will sign
into law as soon as Congress sends it to him,'' Kennedy said.
   Hatch said business executives, who initially opposed the bill,
eventually supported it when they ``realized that these quickie
polygraph tests are ... unfair and very detrimental to their
employees.''

   Pat Robertson said today the failure
of his Republican presidential bid hadn't shaken his certainty that
God had called him to make the race.
   Robertson, who rejoined the Christian Broadcasting Network
today, said on the network's ``700 Club:''
   ``Obviously the question is, If he called you, why didn't you
win? Well, there's no doubt in my mind, absolutely none whatsoever,
that the Lord led me to do this. I mean, if I had any leading
whatsoever in starting CBN, I had a stronger leading to get
involved in this race for the presidency. No question.''
   Robertson said his first television venture ``fell flat on its
face.''
   ``I'm used to one start, then the next one and the next one,''
he said. ``Sometimes the Lord perfects us and encourages us through
experience and trials.
   ``Was the calling there? Yes. Was I overly optimistic? I thought
we were going to see wonderful things happen. In Iowa, I thought it
was happening.''
   Robertson finished second to Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and ahead
of Vice President George Bush in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8.
However, he finished fifth the next week in New Hampshire and
quickly became an also-ran in the Republican race that Bush has now
sewn up.
   The former television evangelist said that later in the week he
would show videotapes and make further comments on several
controversies that marked his campaign, including his allegations
that his network uncovered information about U.S. hostages in the
Middle East.
   He said he would show a videotape of a deposition by former Rep.
Paul McCloskey, R-Calif., concerning McCloskey's allegation that
Robertson used his father's influence to avoid combat in the Korean
War. Robertson sued McCloskey over that allegation but dropped the
suit in March, saying it was unfair to have to go to trial while
trying to win the nomination.
   Robertson returns to the network he founded nearly 30 years ago
as it is facing a financial crisis. Last year, 645 employees were
laid off because of plummeting donations.
   At the same time Robertson was preparing to announce the
suspension of his campaign Monday, more CBN employees were being
let go.
   When asked what would be done to halt the slide, Robertson said
the operation would become leaner.
   ``After today, I hope we nevr again have to lay off people,'' he
said.
   Robertson refused to say how many employees were laid off, and
CBN officials would not comment on the layoffs.
   Robertson left the ``700 Club'' _ the network's most popular
program in terms of viewership and fundraising _ in 1986 to begin
preparatory work on his campaign.
   Donations began to fall then; the dramatic drop came last year
with the scandals involving other television evangelists and
Robertson's official announcement of his candidacy.
   He resigned as chief executive officer in October when he gave
up his Southern Baptist ordination and became an official
candidate. His son Tim was elevated to the post.
   ``I assumed that I had built a very competent staff,'' Robertson
said in an earlier interview. ``And that they would be able to run
CBN in my absence. I did not realize that my personal presence on
the `700 Club' is as important as it is to the audience.''
   In announcing the suspension of his presidential campaign that
spent $22 million to gain 46 delegates to the national convention,
Robertson said he planned to remain active in the party.
   ``I suspend my candidacy... but I do not now, nor will I ever
suspend, my advocacy of conservative and moral principles,'' he
said.
   Robertson used the occasion to announce the formation of a new
political action committee, Americans for the Republic, to fund and
train conservative Christian political candidates.
   ``I will work for the election of conservative Republicans to
city councils, school boards, legislatures, the House of
Representatives, and the Senate,'' he said.

   A Spanish supertanker, hit by an Iraqi
raid last week, exploded today and shipping executives said at
least nine crewman from a nearby tugboat were missing.
   Meanwhile, the Iranian tanker Bisoton was identified as the
latest victim of stepped-up raids by Iraq on its foe's oil shipping
lanes.
   The blasts today partially sunk the 235,000-ton Barcelona and
scuttled a Norwegian-flag salvage tugboat that was alongside,
according to shipping executives, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Nine crewmen from the tug, the Scan Partner, were missing and
feared dead after the explosions, the executives said.
   The sources said bodies were washing up on the rocks and Iranian
army personnel were trying to recover them. They did not know
whether the bodies were those of the tugboat crew, or of others
missing in Saturday's raid on Iran's Larak island terminal in the
Strait of Hormuz.
   An estimated 22 seamen were killed or remain unaccounted for in
the attack in which five ships were hit by Iraqi jets, according to
salvage executives.
   In additon to the 235,000-ton Barcelona, the ships hit were the
564,739-ton Liberian-flag Seawise Giant; the 457,841-ton
British-flag Burmah Endeavour; the 152,004-ton Cypriot-flag Argosy;
and the 231,712-ton, Iran-owned Khark.
   International tankers call at Larak to pick up oil cargoes
brought down the Persian Gulf by Iran's fleet of shuttle tankers.
   In the latest raid, Lloyd's said the 112,445-ton Bisoton was
attacked by Iraqi warplanes Monday off the Iranian coast. It said a
fire broke out in the engine room but was quickly extinguished.
   Lloyd's did not say whether there were casualties aboard the
Bisoton, but it had referred earlier to information that 10 seamen
were killed in an Iraqi raid on a tanker Monday.
   It did not link these casualties with the Bisoton but there were
no other attacks reported Monday.
   The Baghdad High Command reported Monday that Iraqi jet fighters
raided ``a large maritime target'' off the Iranian coast, its usual
terminology for an Iranian tanker.
   Baghdad's avowed aim is to throttle Iran's oil exports, the
backbone of Tehran's economy, and force Iran to accept a negotiated
settlement in the 7{-year-old war.
   Iran has responded to Iraq's attacks by raiding neutral
commercial shipping.
   Also today, the U.S. Navy said it planned to drop a wreath in
the waters of the central gulf to mark the first anniversary of the
Iraqi air attack on the frigate Stark, in which 37 Americans were
killed.
   Navy officials said the ceremony would be conducted by a
chaplain, aboard either a U.S. warship or a helicopter. There was
no word on what time it would take place.
   The Stark was hit by two French-made Exocet missiles fired by an
Iraqi warplane on the night of May 17, 1987, as it conducted what
the Navy said was a routine patrol mission.
   Iraq later apologized for what it called a mistaken attack,
saying its F1 Mirage fighter-bomber was aiming for an Iranian
vessel. The United States officially accepted Baghdad's explanation
but demands for compensation for the ship and families of the dead
crewmen have yet to be settled.

   The Senate, trying to pass a Pentagon budget
bill that has become a vehicle for anti-drug efforts, today
overwhemingly voted to urge changes in U.S. policy toward Panama
and its indicted leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   First, the chamber voted 95-0 for a proposal by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., providing that no U.S. aid be sent to Panama until
Noriega leaves power and until President Reagan certifies that no
Soviet or Cuban troops are in the Central American nation.
   The amendment was aimed at Noriega, who has been indicted on
U.S. drug trafficking charges. The Reagan administration is
negotiating with him to drop the charges if he agrees to leave
power, a plan that has drawn intense criticism in Congress.
   The Senate later passed on a vote of 86-10 a resolution, offered
by Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, that put the Senate
on record in opposition to any deal in which U.S. drug trafficking
charges would be dropped.
   The decisions on the Panama-related measures were scheduled as
part of the Senate's effort to finally approve the huge bill.
   ``We should not dismiss these indictments ... we'd be making a
mistake,'' Dole said today. His amendment is a non-binding, ``sense
of the Senate'' resolution. He said the White House opposes it.
   He said dropping the charges against Noriega would ``send the
wrong signal in the war on drugs.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said dropping the indictments ``is a
very dangerous signal to send ... a deal that would allow this man
to escape justice is a deal that stinks.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said the U.S. efforts to remove
Noriega ``was not merely ineffective. I believe they work against
the return of democracy to Panam. The indictments should be left in
place.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said ``the administration has painted itself and our nation on the
corner on this matter.''
   Also unresolved was a separate proposal by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., which would let courts impose the death penalty on drug
dealers convicted of killing people.
   ``The American people are entitled to this protection,'' said
D'Amato. ``I think we have to find a clearer message for those who
deal in drugs. ... The death-dealing drug lords fear no one.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said D'Amato's proposal had nothing
specifically to do with the Pentagon budget and should be
considered in another forum. Senate rules do not require that
amendments be germane.
   Levin also opposed the amendment because he said studies have
shown that people sometimes are wrongly convicted of crimes.
   ``The main reason I'm opposed to capital punishment is that you
cannot correct your mistakes,'' Levin said. ``Time and time again,
we've found that we've convicted the wrong man.''
   The overall bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion
in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Senate passage would send it to a House-Senate conference
committee to be reconciled with the House version of the Pentagon
budget. Although both measures propose $299.5 billion, there are a
number of major differences.
   One conflict is over the military's role in the anti-drug war.
   The House bill orders Reagan to have the military essentially
seal off U.S. borders against drug traffickers.
   The Senate measure is not as far-reaching in the anti-drug
field, but senators approved a plan last week to give the military
broad new powers to help fight the drug war. The most controversial
provision of the Senate anti-drug package authorizes the Navy to
arrest suspected drug traffickers who are picked up on the high
seas outside U.S. territorial waters.

<HEAD>Hodel Designated `Pumpkin Papers' Farm a National Historic
Landmark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel today
designated as a national historic landmark the Maryland farm where
the ``pumpkin papers'' that led to the conviction of Alger Hiss
were hidden.
   Whittaker Chambers, the late owner of the farm and the man who
hid the stolen State Department documents in a hollowed-out
pumpkin, was ``an historical figure of transcendent importance in
the nation's history,'' Hodel said.
   In a speech at the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank promoting
conservative causes, Hodel noted that the Avdisory Board of the
National Park Service on April 26 had opposed landmark status on
the grounds that 50 years had not passed since the significant
events in question, the discovery of the papers in 1948 by a young
congressman named Richard Nixon.
   ``I appreciate that the board disagrees but I do not choose to
follow its advice in this instance,'' said Hodel, who nominated as
a landmark the 220-acre farm at Westminster, Md., some 30 miles
northwest of Baltimore, now owned and worked by Chambers' son, John.
   The service generally prefers the passage of 50 years to permit
an assessment of the signifance of a property without the pressure
of judgments made at the time.
   John Chambers, deputy staff director of the congressional Joint
Committee on Printing, said when informed of Hodel's action, ``We
are deeply honored by this designation and very pleased by the
secretary's action.''
   Hodel noted that National Park Service Director William Mott had
written him on April 28 that the staff of the service concluded
``that Whittaker Chambers was exceptionally significant and that
the farm represents that significance with the requisuite degree of
historical integrity.''
   Both the Maryland state historic presevation officer and a
professional review committee for the landmarks program, including
historians outside the National Park Service, had supported
landmark designation for the farm, Hodel said.
   Chambers, then an editor of Time magazine, accused Hiss, a
former State Department official then serving as president of a New
York foundation, of being a fellow member of a communist spy ring
in the late 1930s.
   In testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee,
Hiss denied the allegation and sued Chambers for libel. Chambers
then produced from the pumpkin copies of 1937 State Department
documents he said Hiss had given him.
   The government won a perjury conviction against Hiss for lying
to Congress in his denial that he had been a spy. The pumpkin
papers were key evidence _ prosecutors proved they had been typed
on a typewriter owned by Hiss.
   Hiss, who lives in New York, served 44 months. He dropped his
libel case against Chambers, who died in 1961. Hiss maintains his
innocence to this day, and has declined comment about the landmark
designation.
   Designation as a national landmark brings the owner a plaque and
no obligation except to maintain the historical integrity of the
property. The National Park Service may take back the plaque if it
is not so maintained. Some 1,800 properties have been awarded
plaques.

   Prisoners watching a ``most wanted''
television show spotted one of their own jailmates _ a six-time
escapee _ serving a minor sentence under an alias.
   They promptly told jail officials who arranged to put the inmate
in a more secure facility. But, on the way, the inmate made his
seventh escape.
   In the end, however, justice prevailed.
   An off-duty sheriff's deputy spotted the new escapee at a nearby
mall the next day and recaptured him.
   Inmates were watching ``America's Most Wanted'' Saturday when
they recognized Mark Austin Goodman, a career criminal wanted for
10 bank robberies in Oklahoma among other charges, and informed
corrections officers, said sheriff's spokesman Bob Ferrell.
   Authorities decided to transfer Goodman Sunday night to more
secure quarters at the county jail while they tried to determine
his true identity. But Goodman, who has a deformed right arm,
slipped out of his handcuffs on the way to the van and scaled an
eight-foot fence topped with barbed wire.
   Monday afternoon, however, he was spotted by the off-duty
officer at a mall and arrested, said Ferrell.
   Goodman, a six-time escapee, was serving a 75-day sentence under
the alias James Ron Eide for a burglary charge and was due to be
released May 21 from the Palm Beach County Stockade.
   Goodman was turned over to the U.S. Marshal's Service and taken
to a federal correctional center in Miami, where he'll be held
pending extradition to Oklahoma.
   Goodman escaped Oct. 30 from the Federal Correctional
Institution in El Reno, Okla., where he was awaiting trial on
charges of robbing 10 Oklahoma City-area banks last year.
   He escaped Feb. 29 from the Pinellas County Jail in Clearwater,
where he was held on 11 charges, including grand theft and burglary.
   Goodman, 27, of Missoula, Mont., has prior convictions dating
back to 1979 in Washington, Oregon and Nevada for felony
hit-and-run, burglary, auto theft and escape.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has decided not to
make salaried workers take a hike if they don't drive GM cars.
   Supervisors issued a stern memo last week ordering salaried
employees at the Indland parts division who drive something other
than a GM car to park it with the hourly workers _ on the other
side of the plant.
   But the order was reversed without explanation Monday.
   The memo said the sight of non-GM cars ``does not convey a
positive image to other salary employees or guests who visit the
plant, and it has a negative impact on our share of the car
market.''
   Offending cars, the memo said, would be towed away at owners'
expense.
   At Ford Motor Co., there is no restriction on vehicles employees
can park in company lots. Chrysler Corp. reserves special lots for
non-Chrysler products, and the special lots tend to be farther from
Chrysler buildings than other lots, a spokesperson said.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said
today he and Secretary of State George Shultz agreed that the
Soviet Union is now willing to join the stalled Mideast peace
process.
   Peres, emerging from an hour-long meeting with Shultz prior to a
call on President Reagan, said U.S. officials told him the Soviets
had increased to 1,400 the monthly exit permits given to Jews
wishing to emigrate.
   ``There is no doubt'' that one can learn from that about
``increased Soviet liberalism'' toward the U.S.-orchestrated peace
plan for Arab-Israeli talks, Peres told reporters.
   The Soviet role in the peace plan will be a topic at the
superpower summit in Moscow later this month, Peres said, adding
that he and Shultz had devoted their entire talk to the Kremlin's
position.
   Peres said he had told the Soviets at meetings last week in
Spain and in Hungary that ``they have to do more and in a more
determined fashion'' to boost the flagging peace initiative.
   ``I told them that their fear of the Arab reaction is
exaggerated because the Arabs need peace talks no less than we
do,'' he said. The Soviets have expressed concern privately that
their radical Arab allies might be angry if they joined the peace
process.
   Syria, a close ally of Moscow's, rejects the Shultz plan but the
more moderate Jordan has said it welcomes Soviet participation.
   Peres said he had been told in his talks here that the Soviets
have expressed concern about the proliferation of
surface-to-surface missiles in the Mideast in the wake of
revelations that Saudi Arabia had bought such rockets from China.
The United States and Israel have criticized the clandestine Saudi
purchase of the intermediate-range CSS-2 missiles.
   Reagan is expected to try and infuse the Shultz plan with new
life after the mid-April deadline for its implementation passed
with neither Israel nor Jordan making up their minds whether to
reject or accept it.
   Reagan, who has warned Israel and Jordan against rejecting the
peace plan, is expected to stress his view that the U.S. blueprint
is the only solution to the five-month rebellion in which 180
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops.
   But neither side held out much hope that Reagan would be able to
budge the plan initiated earlier this year by Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   ``There are several new ideas, but they're minor and we don't
expect great progress,'' said a senior Israeli official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. He declined to discuss the ideas, saying
they were not meaningful in the short run ``but incremental in the
big plan.''
   Peres explored these ideas with Shultz at a meeting Monday and
was to continue discussions with him at two sessions today. Shultz
will bring Peres' ideas to Jordan and Egypt when he visits the
region on his fourth peace shuttle of the year starting June 3.
   Peres supports the Shultz plan, which calls for Arab-Israeli
peace talks to be held under the auspices of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Soviet
Union, China, England and France.
   But his rival in Israel's fractious governing coalition, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has rejected the formula out of concern
that the five powers would pressure Israel into relinquishing lands
it captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.
   General elections scheduled in Israel for November are expected
to serve as a referendum on the plan.
   Underscoring support for his stand, leading administration
officials attended a luncheon in Peres' honor hosted by Israeli
Ambassador Moshe Arad. The guest list included Shultz _ who toasted
Peres' ``creativity'' in searching for peace formulas _ as well as
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, White House chief of staff Howard
Baker and Senate leaders.

<HEAD>School Board Chief Says Members Will Give Up Chauffeurs For
Teacher Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School board leaders have promised that two
members will quit using chauffeurs within 30 days in return for the
state's agreement to sell $30 million in short-term notes to cover
teachers' paychecks.
   ``It has been agreed the Detroit Board of Education will be in
compliance within the next 30 days,'' board President Gloria C.
Cobbin said Monday.
   The school board, which is $60 million in debt, faced a possible
payless payday later this month for the district's 18,000 employees
without the $30 million short-term bonds from the state.
   ``The board is going to have to be accountable to the community.
Our children have to be first,'' Cobbin said.
   State Treasurer Robert Bowman said he would authorize the $30
million note sale, which probably will take place next week.
   ``If they're not in compliance, the notes issued would be in
jeopardy,'' Bowman said. ``It would damage the district in terms of
credibility for probably a dozen years.''
   Bowman postponed the sale of the notes because two board members
continue to use the chauffeurs despite an agreement last November
that the chauffeur service would be dropped.
   Rose Mary Osborne, one of the members who continue to use
chauffeurs, had told the Detroit Free Press on Sunday that if she
could not have her driver she would refuse to attend all evening
board meetings for the 2{ years remaining in her term.

   The Soviet Union that President Reagan will visit later this
month has undergone tremendous changed since Mikhail S. Gorbachev
assumed power. `Glasnost' has brought a new openness to Soviet
society, but the better life promised under Gorbachev's economic
reforms _ ``perestroika'' _ has not materialized.
   AP correspondents in Moscow set out across the Soviet Union to
explore what life is like in the Soviet Union _ from the vice in
Odessa to a factory in Dushanbe, a farm in Kanevskaya, a home in
Tynda and a store in Moscow.

   Democrats Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson battled it out today
in the Oregon primary, while Pat Robertson returned to the
Christian Broadcasting Network saying his failed Republican
candidacy didn't shake his faith that God had called him to make
the race.
   Dukakis in Springfield, Mass., called for defense cuts to help
pay for elderly care, saying, ``These are the choices we've got to
make, and we haven't been making them.'' He also strongly endorsed
the Social Security system, declaring that for many elderly people
``it's the difference between dignity and poverty.''
   Robertson, rejoining the network he left to run for president,
said today, ``Obviously the question is, If he called you, why
didn't you win? Well, there's no doubt in my mind, absolutely none
whatsoever, that the Lord led me to do this.''
   Republican nominee-to-be George Bush was on the West Coast,
where, one day earlier, he took angry exception to the most recent
published report linking his staff to a drugs-and-arms network
involving Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Bush hinted it would take
expletives to express his feelings on the matter, and accused Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts of leaking ``information that's not
fair or true.''
   Dukakis, the far-and-away Democratic front-runner, was favored
to win today's contest in Oregon, which offered a prize of 45
delegates. But Jackson, who campaigned persistently and
passionately in the state, was making a final appeal for votes
today.
   Oregon's secretary of state, Barbara Roberts, predicted a low
turnout _ about 50 percent of the state's registered voters _ for
today's primary. Only a few statewide items were on the ballot.
   A poll taken last month gave Dukakis a wide lead in Oregon, but
Jackson has spent much more time in the state.
   ``I want to win in Oregon ... and take that momentum to
California,'' Jackson said on a primary-eve stop in Eugene, Ore.
California's contest, three weeks from today, is the granddaddy of
all primaries, with 314 delegates.
   Bush, who was campaigning today in California, told a rally at
California State University at Fresno on Monday night that he
couldn't wait to take on the Democratic nominee in November.
   But a poll published today suggested Bush trailed Dukakis in a
hypothetical matchup. According to the CBS-New York Times survey of
1,382 adults, taken by telephone from May 9-12, Dukakis was backed
by 49 percent and Bush by 39 percent, with 10 percent undecided.
The margin of error was 3 percentage points, CBS said Monday night.
   That was in line with a poll by Louis Harris & Associates,
released Monday, which gave Dukakis a 7-point lead. The poll, of
2,138 voters, put the hypothetical race at 50 percent for Dukakis,
43 percent for Bush and 8 percent undecided, also with a 3-point
margin of error.
   Bush, who won praise from Robertson as the latter left the
presidential race, in turn wooed Robertson supporters in Washington
state, where Robertson won a Super Tuesday straw poll.
   The vice president said after Monday's ``unity meeting'' with
Robertson backers: ``I didn't have to pledge anything.'' But he
praised Robertson's ``family and faith'' agenda.
   Bush, campaigning in Washington state on Monday, was asked about
a Newsweek report suggesting his national security adviser, Donald
Gregg, had links to an arms and drugs network involving the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   ``It's just pure unadulterated... I've got to watch my
language,'' he said. Later, he termed the report ``slanderous.''
   ``I would challenge Sen. Kerry ... to show some evidence and
stop leaking out information that's not fair or true,'' Bush said
in Seattle.
   Kerry, who chairs a Senate subcommittee that is looking into the
allegations, could not be reached for comment Monday night, but he
was quoted in today's editions of The Washington Post as saying
neither he nor his staff leaked the information.
   Bush was also fending off questions about embattled Attorney
General Edwin Meese and Panama's military strongman, Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The vice president, who has advocated the death penalty for some
drug crimes, was asked by reporters in Seattle on Monday whether
that should apply to Noriega, who is under federal indictment on
drug charges. He declined to comment.
   The administration's dealings with Noriega have been raised as a
campaign issue by the Democrats.
   The vice president, also asked by reporters in Seattle about
Meese's firing of his chief spokesman Terry Eastland, again
declined to comment. Eastland said the attorney general, who is
under criminal investigation, felt his spokesman had not been
aggressive enough in defending him.
   ``Meese has abandoned justice,'' Jackson said as he campaigned
in Oregon.
   Dukakis was at the Statehouse in Boston again today, but has
been sounding themes of importance to the West. At a Boston news
conference on Monday, he came out for limits on offshore oil
drilling.
   Dukakis also brushed aside complaints from Jackson, who
maintains that the backing of ``super delegates'' to the Democratic
National Convention should reflect popular vote totals.
   The super delegates, who vote at the convention by virtue of
their elective or party offices, are not bound by primary results
in their home states.
   ``Fairness is a reasonable expectation,'' Jackson said Monday.
Dukakis retorted: ``We all knew what the rules were.''
   By the latest AP delegate count, Dukakis has 1,610 to Jackson's
956, with 2,081 needed to nominate. Dukakis aides say they hope to
clinch the nomination in the final primaries.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Reconsider Sign Order for Convicted Child
Molester</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman must return from California to wear a
sign identifying her as a child molester, a King County Superior
Court judge has ruled.
   Julie Guptill-Gilbert, formerly a Montessori teacher, pleaded
guilty in March to two counts of communicating with minors for
immoral purposes, both involving 4-year-old girls. She originally
had been charged with statutory rape in one case and indecent
liberties in the other.
   Judge Warren Chan gave her a choice of 30 days in jail or 60
days wearing the sign, and she chose the latter.
   Therefore, the 19-year-old woman must return from California,
where officials said they would be unable to supervise her, and
wear the sign in the Seattle area, Chan said Monday.
   The sign must say something like ``I am a child molester,'' he
said.
   Chan agreed to delay the date of his order until Sept. 1, a few
weeks after Ms. Guptill-Gilbert is to give birth, but he refused to
lift the order outright.
   Michael Frost, her attorney, asked that the sentence be changed
to 60 days of ``house arrest.''
   ``If the purpose was for Ms. Gilbert to suffer some humiliation
when she went in public, I would submit she has suffered that a
hundred times over with the publicity,'' Frost said.
   Chan said the purpose of the sign was to protect the public.
   In neighboring Oregon, District Judge Dorothy M. Baker last year
ordered Richard J. Bateman, 47, of Portland to post signs on his
house and car saying, ``Dangerous Sex Offender, No Children
Allowed.'' The signs were a requirement of his probation. He had
pleaded no contest to molesting two children.
   When a probation officer reported the sign on Bateman's house
was obscured, the judge scheduled a probation revocation hearing.
Bateman failed to show up. Three weeks later, a tip led to his
arrest and the judge resentenced Bateman on Feb. 10 to the maximum
10 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation.

<HEAD>White House Spokesman Says TV `Distorts Information'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today
refused to allow television coverage of a pre-summit White House
briefing, saying television ``distorts information.''
   Fitzwater was responding to a request to admit television
cameras to an on-the-record briefing being given by Rozanne
Ridgeway, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs.
   The briefing is one of a series being held in advance of
President Reagan's May 29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in Moscow. Most have been held under ``background''
rules, which do not permit the briefers to be identified.
   Afer turning down the request for television coverage, Fitzwater
said he would be willing to take the request up with Ms. Ridegway
and that he would consider a request to permit radio coverage.
   The spokesman was also asked why he does not routinely permit
television camers in his own on-the-record briefings, as spokesmen
for the State Department do.
   ``They have more courage than we do,'' he replied. ``It is too
high a risk for me. You can't talk on camera; you can't discuss
issues; you end up with a very stilted kind of conversation, and
also I don't think press spokesmen ought to become television
personalities.''
   ``You open yourselves up to all sorts of problems unique to the
power of television,'' he said. ``It distorts information and
portrays information that is different than real substance.''
   After several television reporters protested his decision,
Fitzwater turned to his staff and said, ``We should have gone to
background, like we did all the rest.''

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis called today for cuts in defense spending to pay
for elderly care, saying ``these are the choices we've got to
make.''
   The Massachusetts governor, favored to win today's Democratic
primary in Oregon against Jesse Jackson, addressed more than 1,000
senior citizens before returning to the Statehouse.
   Dukakis also scheduled a late afternoon meeting with California
Rep. Mel Levine, a House Foreign Affairs Committee member and
authority on U.S.-Israel relations, another in a series of
consultations with leading congressional Democrats.
   Dukakis told the conference on aging that in order to assist the
elderly with affordable housing, long-term health care and public
transportation, he would reduce or eliminate an array of military
programs, including the ``Star Wars'' missile defense, more
supercarrier task forces, the Midgetman missile and a proposed
``space plane'' that could fly from Washington to Tokyo in three
hours.
   ``These are the choices we've got to make, and we haven't been
making them,'' Dukakis said.
   He also said he would not try to balance the federal budget by
denying cost-of-living increases in Social Security.
   ``Nobody's going to tell me Social Security is a middle-class
entitlement. It's the difference between dignity and poverty,''
Dukakis said.
   Later, talking to reporters, Dukakis said he believed that
wealthy senior citizens should have to pay taxes on their Social
Security benefits.
   On Monday, Dukakis brushed off polls that said he would fare
well in a November battle with George Bush and said ``I've got to
win this nomination first.''
   Although Dukakis spent little time in Oregon compared with
Jackson, he said he wasn't taking anything for granted. ``This is
going to be a long, tough and contested race,'' he told reporters
on Monday.
   Dukakis has won eight of the last nine primaries, and is far
ahead of Jackson in the delegate race.
   A CBS-New York Times poll published today suggested Dukakis had
a comfortable lead over Bush, the apparent Republican nominee, in a
hypothetical matchup. A Louis Harris & Associates poll released a
day earlier showed similar results.
   Forty-nine percent of the 1,382 adults interviewed by telephone
May 9-12 in the CBS-Times poll favored Dukakis, 39 percent favored
Bush and 10 percent were undecided, CBS reported Monday night. The
margin of error was 3 percentage points.
   In the Democratic race, Jackson has been complaining that the
proportion of ``super delegates'' backing him has not been in line
with the percentage of the popular vote he has received.
   Dukakis also has won the majority of endorsements by ``super
delegates'' _ Democratic Party leaders and elected officials who
are convention delegates but not bound by primary results in their
home states.
   ``Fairness is a reasonabale expectation,'' Jackson said Monday
in New Jersey, which, like California, holds its primary June 7.
   ``I don't agree with him,'' Dukakis said when told of Jackson's
objections. ``We all knew what the rules were. This is a campaign
for delegates as well as votes.''
   The Massachusetts governor was brushing off questions about his
budget problems at home, contending revenue shortfalls are a
national problem.
   Figures released Monday indicated the state has a $243 million
shortfall for the fiscal year ending June 30, $166 million more
than had been projected a month ago.
   The governor, who has made his fiscal competence a campaign
selling point, said Massachusetts would trim planned program
expansions and tap cash reserves that were to go to capital
improvements and other projects to balance the current budget. He
said he would have to substantially trim his proposed budget for
next year.

<HEAD>Jackson Makes Final Bid in California as Dukakis, Bush Look Beyond</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Jesse Jackson, California offers a
last hope of blunting Michael Dukakis' momentum. But for Dukakis
and Vice President George Bush, the state's June 7 primary is a
trial run for the fall race for the White House.
   Jackson is throwing nearly all of his remaining resources, both
time and money, into his campaign for the 314 Democratic delegates
at stake in California.
   He plans to outspend Dukakis by as much as 3-1 on television
advertising in the state during the next three weeks, and he is to
spend at least 15 days, about twice as much time as the
Massachusetts governor, in his final push for California votes.
   Still, the most recent Gallup Poll reported Dukakis leading
Jackson among California Democrats by 67 percent to 26 percent.
   Dukakis' Western states political director, Richard Ybarra,
predicts that California's election night returns will put Dukakis
over the total needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. New
Jersey, New Mexico and Montana also have primaries June 7.
   ``We believe we can clinch it here that night. ... I'm talking
about going over 2,081,'' says Ybarra, a longtime California
political activist and the son-in-law of farm labor leader Cesar
Chavez.
   On the Republican side, Bush is campaigning as intensely as if
he still had active primary opponents and needed California's 175
GOP delegates. But Bush is clearly aimed at the fall campaign, in
which California's 47 electoral votes could be pivotal.
   California has ended up in the Republican column in eight of the
last nine presidential elections, and Republicans have cut the
Democratic registration lead in half in the past decade. However,
Bush trailed Dukakis by 10 percentage points in the most recent
poll of California voters.
   Neither Bush nor Dukakis has any political roots or strong ties
to California, and pollsters say the support for both in the Golden
State is soft and still tentative. That has led both men to plan
intense primary campaigns in California.
   Jackson, meanwhile, isn't conceding California or the Democratic
nomination to Dukakis, despite the long odds.
   ``Why do I run against the odds? I've faced odds all my life,''
Jackson told supporters at rallies in a California trip last
weekend. ``You must not surrender. We really can win.''
   Sounding the same, don't-give-up theme, Jackson's California
co-chairman, state Assemblyman Tom Bates, told other supporters,
``We can dream the impossible dream and make it happen in
California.''
   But pollster Mervin Field, who has been surveying and analyzing
California voters for over 40 years, said last week that a Jackson
victory in California ``would be a monumental upset ... ranking as
one of the biggest political happenings since the country was
founded.''
   Still, a number of factors give encouragement to Jackson's hopes
for a California upset, not the least of which is the demonstrated
willingness of California Democrats to vote for black candidates.
   Although blacks constitute only 8 percent of California's total
population, a black man, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, has won the
Democratic nomination for governor the past two elections, and
other blacks have been elected in recent years as lieutenant
governor and state schools chief.
   The lack of other major issues on the June 7 ballot also could
help Jackson if his strongly motivated supporters turn out in
greater percentages than other voters.
   California Democrats also have shown no inclination in recent
years to join a front-runner's bandwagon. In the past three
presidential campaigns, the Democratic nomination was clinched
before California's last-in-the-nation primary, and in all three
cases a majority of California went for the already-vanquished
underdog candidate.
   But other strong forces are against Jackson's chances in
California.
   The state's strong economy, with unemployment near a 20-year
low, blunts the impact of Jackson's appeal to the economically
disadvantaged. And the Spanish-speaking Dukakis has hopes of a
strong showing among Hispanics, who by far are California's largest
minority.
   Finally, pollster Field suggests that Jackson's greatest
strength, his charismatic oratorical skills, may be less of an
advantage in California than elsewhere, because Californians have
had more experience with charismatic leaders and have greater
reservations about them.
   ``California voters had their fascination with Ronald Reagan as
a detached governor and detached president. They had their fling,
their love-hate relationship with Jerry Brown, who intrigued them
and promised a lot (as governor) but delivered very little,'' Field
said.
   ``But I sense the mood of the state today is one where there's
less toleration for that, and they want demonstrated competence.
... Dukakis, I would say, fits the mood of today's California
voters.''

   A 14th century Ming dynasty Chinese vase sold
at auction Tuesday for nearly $2.2 million, a record price for a
porcelain piece, an auction house said.
   The winning bid of $2,185,897 for the 13-inch-tall, pear-shaped
red decorated vase was made by an anonymous buyer, according to
officials from Sotheby's, which conducted the auction at a local
hotel.
   The vase was part of a 118-piece private collection of porcelain
from the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911) that fetched more than
$8.7 million Tuesday, Sotheby's said.
   The bid for the vase ``is the world record for any piece of
porcelain sold,'' said Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's
International. ``It went for a lot more than expected.''
   Thompson said the record was set a year ago when a piece of
Chinese porcelain sold for about $1.4 million. ``Since then the
market (has become) substantially stronger,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A counterattack by Amal fighters gained
ground against the rival Hezbollah militia Tuesday in the 12th day
of their war for control of south Beirut's Shiite Moslem slums.
   The battle raged in violation of another cease-fire sponsored by
Syria and Iran. Syria supports the mainstream Amal and Iran backs
the radical Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God.
   Police said 15 people were killed and 51 wounded on Tuesday.
They put the number of total casualties at 240 dead and 757 wounded
since fighting began May 6 in the 16 square miles of slums, where
groups affiliated with Hezbollah are believed to hold most of the
nine Americans and nine other foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Sounds of exploding artillery shells, mortar rounds and
rocket-propelled grenades carried throughout Beirut, which has been
battered by 13 years of civil war.
   The latest truce, the seventh since fighting began, was called
for 11 p.m. Monday after Syria massed 7,500 soldiers and 500 tanks
and armored vehicles on the edges of the enclave next to the
airport. The Syrians have about 25,000 soldiers in north and
Lebanon and 7,500 in Moslem west Beirut.
   Syria agreed to give political efforts a chance after Iran's
acting foreign minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, held several
meetings Monday with government and military leaders in Beirut and
Damascus, capital of Syria.
   A meeting he called for Tuesday between representatives of Amal
and Hezbollah to discuss a political settlement did not take place,
however, because Amal refused to attend.
   Hezbollah had driven Amal to the fringes of the slums, but a
police spokesman said the counterattack Tuesday regained most of
Shiyah, one of the slum neighborhoods.
   ``Amal militiamen inched across Shiyah and regained most of the
district in fierce house-to-house clashes, but ... Hezbollah
remains in control of 90 percent of south Beirut,'' said the
spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping with regulations.
   An Amal official said the militia, commanded by Justice Minister
Nabih Berri, refused to send a representative to the
Besharati-sponsored meeting at the Iranian Embassy in Moslem west
Beirut.
   ``We told them that we do not accept a meeting at the Iranian
Embassy,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
affairs of the Shiite community should only be discussed at the
(Lebanese) Supreme Shiite Council.''
   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin heads the council. He reiterated
that Syrian forces should move into south Beirut and disarm the
warring militias.
   In a statement broadcast by Beirut radio stations, he said:
``The plight of the population is my main worry. This suffering
will end only when the Syrians move in. Every other method is just
a waste of time, helping only to prolong the plight of the
population.''
   Interior Minister Abdulla Rassi also urged the Syrians to take
over the slums.
   ``Political solutions have failed to end the fighting,'' he
said. ``These clashes will only come to an end when the regular
(Syrian) force moves in to enforce law and order.''
   The Amal official said Berri and senior aides would meet in
Damascus with President Hafez Assad of Syria, who has become
Lebanon's main power broker.
   Assad supports Iran in its war with Iraq but has grown concerned
recently about the Iranian challenge to his influence among the 1.2
million Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest sect.
   About 20,000 Shiites demonstrated in the southern port of Tyre.
They waved posters of Assad and Berri, calling on the Syrians to
occupy south Beirut.
   ``We don't want Iranians! We don't want Hezbollah!'' marchers
chanted.
   One banner said: ``We call on the Syrian command to save our
children in south Beirut.''
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, chief of Syria's military intelligence
in Lebanon, met with Besharati at the Iranian Embassy in Beirut and
told reporters without elaboration:
   ``We are searching for solutions and means to apply these
solutions. We shall exert efforts and take all the appropriate
measures. We are seriously searching for solutions to overcome this
crisis.''
   Besharati said: ``In light of these meetings I do not believe
there is a need for the deployment of Syrian forces in south
Beirut. The cease-fire will be respected, after which we will work
to withdraw the gunmen.
   ``We are working with the Syrians to prevent the recurrence of
such differences in the future.''
   Asked whether they discussed the hostages and their possible
release, Besharati said: ``All issues could be raised in these
these meetings. We hope this crisis will be over.'' He did not
elaborate.

   Human rights activists on
Tuesday urged South Africans to speak out against capital
punishment to reduce a record-high rate of hangings.
   Last year, 164 people were hanged, the most in South African
history, and 59 people have been hanged so far this year. Of those
prisoners, 10 were white and 213 were black or mixed-race.
   Law professor John Dugard and defense attorney Jules Browde
joined Sheena Duncan of the Black Sash civil rights group at a
protest meeting Tuesday in calling for greater public pressure
against executions.
   The activists said the issue was urgent because of the large
number of people _ 274 _ on Death Row.
   Of the condemned, 53 were sentenced in killings arising from
political unrest, according to the Center for Applied Legal Studies
at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand. These include
the ``Sharpeville Six'' _ five men and a woman whose deaths
sentences in a 1984 mob killing have provoked an international
outcry.
   According to official statistics, more people are executed in
South Africa than any other nation. Amnesty International has said
the actual number of executions in some countries, such as Iran,
could be much higher.

   The former president of a credit clinic has
agreed to stop claiming that he can improve people's credit
ratings, the Federal Trade Commission announced Tuesday.
   Jeffrey Roberts, former head of Credit-Rite Inc. of Palmyra,
N.J., signed a consent order promising not to misrepresent his
ability to improve credit ratings and agreeing to honor refund
promises.
   The agreement settles charged that Roberts and the company made
false and misleading claims that they could substantially improve
the credit standing of individuals.
   Credit-Rite operated 29 credit repair franchises in 13 states
and the District of Columbia until it ceased operations in 1987,
the FTC said. The company charged individuals $500 to $700 for its
services.
   Under terms of the agreement, Roberts must give any future
credit repair clients a written notice that they have no legal
right to have accurate information removed from their credit files,
and telling them how long such information can be kept on file.
   Currently, credit bureaus can report negative information, as
long as it is correct, for seven years and bankruptcies for 10
years. Any individual can request to have inaccurate information
removed from their file.
   Credit-Rite had offices in Delaware, the District of Columbia,
Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia,
the FTC said.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met with
President Reagan today and said he believed the Soviets will join
the stalled Middle East peace process during the forthcoming Moscow
summit meeting.
   Asked whether he expected the president to take a direct hand in
such a development, Peres told reporters, ``Yes. I think the
occasion will really be in the summit meeting to have the Russians
adopt the needs of the Middle East and not the Middle East
sbumitting to ideas that were born in Moscow.''
   ``I expect to have a sort of an international opening that will
not necessarily impose a solution or control the sitaution but will
really permit the people of the Middle East to negotiate freely,''
he said.
   ``I expect it to be raised,'' he said. ``I don't know if it can
be solved in one jump, but I am convinced it will be continued.''
   Peres also said that in meetings with Soviet officials in
Europe, ``The Soviets went the longest possible way to convince us
that they are serious in their support of peace, that they are not
enemies of Israel, that they are looking for an occasion to improve
the relations.''
   Earlier, emerging from an hour-long meeting with Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, Peres said U.S. officials told him the
Soviets had increased to 1,400 the monthly exit permits given to
Jews wishing to emigrate.
   Peres said he had told the Soviets at meetings last week in
Spain and in Hungary that ``they have to do more and in a more
determined fashion'' to boost the flagging peace initiative.
   ``I told them that their fear of the Arab reaction is
exaggerated because the Arabs need peace talks no less than we
do,'' he said. The Soviets have expressed concern privately that
their radical Arab allies might be angry if they joined the peace
process.
   Syria, a close ally of Moscow's, rejects the Shultz plan but the
more moderate Jordan has said it welcomes Soviet participation.
   Peres said he had been told in his talks here that the Soviets
have expressed concern about the proliferation of
surface-to-surface missiles in the Mideast in the wake of
revelations that Saudi Arabia had bought such rockets from China.
The United States and Israel have criticized the clandestine Saudi
purchase of the intermediate-range CSS-2 missiles.
   Reagan has warned Israel and Jordan against rejecting the peace
plan.
   Neither side held out much hope that Reagan would be able to
budge the plan initiated earlier this year by Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   ``There are several new ideas, but they're minor and we don't
expect great progress,'' said a senior Israeli official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. He declined to discuss the ideas, saying
they were not meaningful in the short run ``but incremental in the
big plan.''
   Peres explored these ideas with Shultz at a meeting Monday and
was to continue discussions with him at two sessions today. Shultz
will bring Peres' ideas to Jordan and Egypt when he visits the
region on his fourth peace shuttle of the year starting June 3.
   Peres supports the Shultz plan, which calls for Arab-Israeli
peace talks to be held under the auspices of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Soviet
Union, China, England and France.
   But his rival in Israel's fractious governing coalition, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has rejected the formula out of concern
that the five powers would pressure Israel into relinquishing lands
it captured from the Arabs in the 1967 Mideast war.
   General elections scheduled in Israel for November are expected
to serve as a referendum on the plan.

Tuesday that military spending should be deeply cut to pay for
services for the elderly.
   ``The next president is going to inherit an awful fiscal mess,
and hard choices are going to have to be made,'' Dukakis told more
than 1,000 people gathered for the sixth annual Governor's
Conference on Aging.
   ``Are we going to spend $6 billion on Star Wars and MX missiles
on railroad cars, or are we going to build affordable housing for
families of low- and moderate-income and the elderly?'' he asked.
   ``Are we going to spend $36 billion for new supercarrier task
forces that we don't need and can't afford, or are we going to
begin to do something about long-term care for elders and the
disabled in this country?''
   Later, Dukakis was returning to the Massachusetts Statehouse in
Boston to meet with Rep. Mel Levine. The California Democrat, a
member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and an expert on
U.S.-Israeli relations, is the latest in a string of visitors to
Dukakis' office.
   Last week, Dukakis met privately at the Statehouse with Sen.
Bill Bradley, D-N.J., to discuss the Soviet Union.
   Dukakis, who was favored to win Tuesday's Democratic primary in
Oregon over Jesse Jackson, again shrugged off Jackson's criticism
of the party's delegate selection process, saying all the
candidates knew the rules when they entered the race. If changes
are needed, Dukakis said, they should be made after this fall's
election.
   Asked about recent polls indicating that Dukakis holds a lead
over Republican Vice President George Bush in a hypothetical
general election, Dukakis offered a rare comment on poll results:
``All I can say is I think there's something cooking out there.''
   He quickly added that he thinks poll results ``mean very
little.''
   In his speech, Dukakis also suggested he would cut funding for
the Midgetman missile and a proposed ``space plane,'' using the
money instead for improved public transportation and human services.
   ``These are the choices we've got to make, and we haven't been
making them,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor also expressed strong support for
Social Security, but said wealthy recipients should continue to pay
taxes on their benefits.
   He said he recalled being asked by a reporter in Iowa whether he
favored continuing federal support for ``middle-class
entitlements.''
   The governor said he was puzzled by the question because
``two-thirds of Social Security recipients live on that check and
that check alone.''
   ``Nobody's going to tell me Social Security is a middle-class
entitlement. It's the difference between dignity and poverty,''
Dukakis said, to applause.
   Afterward, talking to reporters, Dukakis said he believed that
better-off senior citizens should continue to pay taxes on their
Social Security benefits, but he argued against trying to balance
the federal budget by denying cost-of-living increases to Social
Security recipients.
   In the speech, Dukakis endorsed legislation filed by Rep. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla., intended to expand health and other services to
elderly patients in their homes.
   Dukakis said he was proud that Massachusetts is one of the few
states sing state money to support ``home care'' for elders and
said the time had come to expand the approach nationwide.
   ``I think it's about time we reached out to millions of seniors
across this country,'' he said, arguing that home care provides
many elderly citizens with needed services while allowing them to
remain independent in familiar surroundings.
   ``In the long run, it's a money-saver as well,'' Dukakis said.
But, he added, ``None of this, unfortunately, is going to come on
the cheap.''

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
battled Jesse Jackson in the Oregon presidential primary on
Tuesday, a West Coast warm-up for their final election showdown
early next month in California.
   Dukakis was heavily favored to defeat his sole remaining rival
and win the majority of the 45 delegates at stake, just as he has
won every primary but one over the past seven weeks to assume
unquestioned control of the Democratic race.
   Dukakis also looked to Oregon to help him inch toward the 2,081
delegates needed to gain the Democratic nomination. He has 1,613
delegates to 956 for Jackson, and his aides express confidence that
he will control a nominating majority by the time the primaries end
next month.
   Vice President George Bush, who already owns a delegate majority
on the Republican side, looked to add Oregon to his column in the
GOP primary. His final active opponent, once and future television
evangelist Pat Robertson, suspended his campaign on Monday.
   Dukakis was so confident of his success in Oregon that he
decided against airing television advertisements and limited his
personal campaigning in the state to parts of two days.
   Jackson devoted more time than that to Oregon, and seemed to
needle Dukakis when he said, ``I earn my votes every day.'' But he
posted no predictions of victory, has won only the District of
Columbia's primary since March 8, and more often than not has been
buried by Dukakis landslides in recent weeks.
   Oregon seemed little more than a sidelight to neighboring
California and its huge cache of 314 delegates.
   Both Jackson and Dukakis turned the state into something of a
stopover point in and out of California, which is one of four
states holding Democratic primaries on the final day of the primary
season June 7.
   Jackson plans to invest heavily there in hopes of defeating
Dukakis, although public opinion polls indicate the Massachusetts
governor holds a strong lead.
   Dukakis also is making a major effort in California, in part to
hold off Jackson's challenge but also to lay the groundwork for his
expected fall campaign against Bush.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of students hurled rocks and
firebombs in a clash with riot police Tuesday to mark the eighth
anniversary of a bloody civil uprising in the southern city of
Kwangju.
   The current wave of protests, which began Monday, continued to
spread as dissidents and radical students prepared to mark the
protests on May 18, 1980, in which 200 people died in the city of
Kwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul.
   On Tuesday, about 22,000 college students in Seoul and the
provincial cities of Kwangju, Taejon, Chongju, Pusan and Chonju
took part in anti-government and anti-U.S. protests, according to
the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   About 2,000 students fought with police on 17 campuses in Seoul.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Yankee go home!''
the students shouted as they clashed with riot police. About 40,000
U.S. troops are based in South Korea, whose government the United
States has supported.
   Armored police vans fired salvos of tear gas bombs into the
crowds, while martial arts squads charged the protesters. At least
two students were injured in the fighting and several police
officers were hit by firebombs.
   The nation's 130,000-member police force was on full alert, with
security squads deployed around government buildings and foreign
diploamtic missions in Seoul.
   About 4,000 students also hurled rocks and firebombs at police
in Kwangju. The protesters marched with a large sign showing a
broken American flag.
   ``Go home Yankees who supported the chief culprits in the
Kwangju massacre!'' the students chanted.
   They also burned effigies of President Roh Tae-woo, who took
power Feb. 25 after winning the elections in December. He has
promised to introduce democracy and has ended many of the
authoritarian polices of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Many Koreans are distrustful of Roh, a former general, and they
demand a full accounting of the Kwangju revolt.
   Radical students and dissidents hold him and other top leaders
who were military commanders at the time responsible for
suppressing the 1980 rebellion.
   ``Punish culprit Roh Tae-woo!'' the students shouted.
   Anti-government demonstrations marking the Kwangju anniversary
have been routine, but this year's protests, riding on an
opposition victory in last month's legislative elections, seem to
be more widespread.
   Also contributing to the bold mood of the anniversary was the
ritual suicide of a dissident student at Seoul's Myongdong
Cathedral on Sunday.
   Cho Sung-man, 24, a chemistry major at Seoul National
University, demanded the release of all political prisoners before
stabbing himself in the stomach and jumping from a building.
   Dissident leaders said Cho, although not a native of Kwangju,
will be buried there Thursday, near the victims of the 1980
protests. They said they plan to make his burial site a
``sanctuary'' for their democratic movement.

<HEAD>PORTLAND: against Bush.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The near certainty that Bush and Dukakis will win their party
nominations has turned the remaining primaries into virtual
formalities, with the outlines of the general election campaign
beginning to take shape.
   Two nationwide public opinion polls released this week showed
Dukakis leading Bush, and the two men swap charges almost routinely
as they make their campaign rounds.
   In another sure sign that the nominating hostilities are fading,
both Bush and Dukakis have begun making plans to help retire
campaign debts left over from rivals' campaigns.
   Jackson, the only other active candidate on either side,
complained during his Oregon campaign that he was not getting the
support from party leaders that he deserves.
   But even so, if he intends to play a spoiler to Dukakis, he's
kept his intentions well hidden.
   The two Democrats held a private meeting when their paths
crossed in New Jersey on Sunday, and the Massachusetts governor
sounded anything but worried about the prospects for party unity
this fall.
   Dukakis spent much of the past week behaving like the
front-runner he is, meeting with Democratic congressional leaders
in Washington, conferring with South Africa bishop Desmond Tutu and
trying to raise doubts about Bush.
   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug
runners and murderers,'' he said in repponse to reports that the
United States would drop drug charges against Manuel Noriega if the
Panamanian dictator agreed to leave his country.
   ``I think before we start talking about dropping indictments and
making deals, the American people deserve a full explanation of
what kind of relationship this administration has had with
Noriega,'' Dukakis said.
   But Dukakis also ran into heckling by gay political activists in
California who challenged a Massachusetts policy that gives them
low priority in determining suuitablity to be foster parents.
``Bigot,'' shouted one man, while another yelled, ``You're
anti-gay. Why don't you admit it.''
   The vice president also launched a few attacks at Dukakis, and
gingerly began setting himself apart from President Reagan as he
neared the end of his primary campaign.
   He said Dukakis was ``an extremely liberal Democrat'' whose
election would cause a ``radical swing'' in defense policies.
   As for the president, whom he has served loyally for seven
years, Bush said, ``I don't think we've been doing enough to
protect our environment in recent years. We need to do more,''
particularly on the subject of acid rain.
   Bush's last remaining active opponent, Robertson, officially
abandoned his effort on Monday, but seemed to indicate interest in
another run in 1992 if Bush is defeated this fall.
   Robertson, who became known to millions through his religious
broadcasting, resumed his leadership of his Christian Broadcasting
Network on Tuesday.

   Nearly 400 inmates who filed a class-action suit
to protest having to use buckets as toilets in cells at the county
jail in Lawrence will split $1.2 million in a settlement.
   Inmates sued in 1981, claiming the lack of plumbing violated
their rights, and Superior Court Judge Paul G. Garrity two years
later gave Essex County six months to provide toilets and sinks.
   A financial settlement recently was reached out of court. Essex
County Special Sheriff Harry Coppola said Tuesday the money will be
divided among 397 inmates forced to use plastic ``night soil pots''
in their cells after the 9 p.m. lockdown.
   The state will pay half the settlement this year, and Essex
County will pay the rest in three installments over the next three
years.

   A motorcycle rider was stalked,
knocked down and run over three times in a random killing as his
brother struggled to pull him out of the car's path, police said.
   ``There's no way in the world it can be explained,'' said police
Sgt. Phil Mason of Sunday night's slaying in this Orange County
city. ``Kind of like a frenzy. It could have been anybody.''
   Three men were arrested, Mason said Monday.
   Javier Sarabia, 26, of Garden Grove, and his brother, Alex, 21,
were returning home about 11:30 p.m. when they noticed a car
trailing them, Mason said.
   ``They were tailgating them so closely that the victim and his
brother could not stop for their driveway,'' he said.
   Alex, who was driving, continued to a corner and ducked down a
side street before heading back, but found the car blocking the
road.
   ``Those men went to the nearest corner and waited for them,''
said the Sarabias' father, Hector, 60. ``Then they started yelling
at my sons, `We are going to kill you. We are going to kill you.'''
   One attacker aimed a revolver at the motorcyclists, and Javier
Sarabia jumped off and tried to knock the gun away, Mason said. The
car then struck Sarabia down.
   ``It passes over the boy, backs up and comes back around three
separate times,'' Mason said. ``There's no doubt they knew what
they were doing.''
   His brother tried to pull Sarabia onto the curb, Mason said.
Sarabia, who was not wearing a helmet, died of head injuries.
   Witnesses reported the attack.
   Dallas Keith Carter, 18, of Costa Mesa, Ernest J. Bustos, 20, of
Garden Grove and Sergio Sanchez, 18, of Santa Ana, were arrested
for investigation of murder and robbery, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopia's two biggest rebel groups
Tuesday accused the government of killing more than 400 civilians
in separate bombing and tank attacks, calling it the worst massacre
in a dozen years.
   The clandestine radio of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
claimed hundreds of people died in a May 12 government attack on
the village of Sheib in eastern Eritrea.
   ``Eighty people were crushed by tanks and 320 were killed by
gunfire,'' reported the Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea,
monitored in Nairobi.
   The rebels said troops then looted and set fire to Sheib and six
nearby villages, destroying 2,000 houses and forcing 8,000 people
to flee.
   The radio said it was ``the greatest mass killing'' by
government troops since 1976. It gave no details.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting the central Ethiopian
government in Addis Ababa for 27 years in Africa's longest civil
war.
   In Tigre, Eritrea's southern neighbor and home to a 14-year-old
civil war, rebels said Ethiopian warplanes bombed the ancient
capital of Axum on Sunday for the second time in two weeks, killing
a teen-age girl and wounding five other people.
   ``The repeated bombardment of Tigrean towns and population
centers is part of the regime's scorched earth policy and total war
against the Tigrean people,'' the Tigrean People's Liberation Front
said from their London office.
   The Tigrean rebels said Zemzem Adem, 15, was killed in the
bombing and her younger sister, Zeniba Adem, was severely wounded.
The other injured included 6-year-old Zera Senai Mesfin, they said.
   Axum, 340 miles north of Addis Ababa, was capital of an ancient
northern Ethiopian kingdom that flourished from 500 B.C. until the
seventh century. The area has been in rebel hands since a major
offensive in March.
   The Tigreans said government jets also bombed Axum April 3 but
there were no casualties.
   On Saturday, President Mengistu Haile Mariam declared a state of
emergency in Tigre and Eritrea allowing the government to designate
certain areas as prohibited. Western diplomats said the move was
part of a planned government offensive against the northern rebels.
   War-torn northern Ethiopia is the most remote part of the
country and access to the area by outsiders is limited.
   The war has disrupted a massive Western-financed relief effort
to save 3.2 million drought victims, 2 million of whom are believed
to be in rebel territory and beyond the reach of emergency aid.

   Andrew Duggan, whose distinctive face, voice
and bearing brought characters to life on screen, stage and TV
since the close of World War II, died of cancer. He was 64.
   Duggan died Sunday at his Westwood home.
   He got into show business after Army service in India, China and
Burma during World War II, when he was assigned to a Special
Services Company led by actor Melvin Douglas.
   Douglas encouraged Duggan, and that contact led to a role
opposite Lucille Ball in ``Dream Girl,'' at the old Biltmore Bowl
in Los Angeles, Duggan said in a 1962 interview.
   Broadway stage work followed and included roles in ``Rose
Tattoo'' and ``Paint Your Wagon,'' where he met his future wife,
who was a dancer in the musical.
   He did live TV shows in New York City during the 1950s before
moving on to memorable roles such as Dwight Eisenhower in the 1979
miniseries ``Backstairs at the White House,'' and Col. Deiner in
``Rich Man, Poor Man.'' He also played Gen. Ed Britt in the 1965-67
series ``Twelve O'Clock High.''
   Duggan's movies include ``Three Brave Men,'' ``Merrill's
Marauders,'' ``Seven Days In May,'' ``In Like Flint,'' and ``Doctor
Detroit.''
   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, a son, two daughters, and
a brother and sister. Funeral arrangements were not disclosed.

   Officials will designate the Matewan
Massacre site a historic district Thursday, the 68th anniversary of
the conflict depicted in the film ``Matewan,'' in a move to
nominate it for the National Register of Historic Places.
   Paul McAllister, director of Matewan Development Center, said
the area to be nominated includes the Buskirk Building and the
alley behind Matewan where the shootings are believed to have
occurred.
   What has come to be known as the Matewan Massacre occurred in
1920 when detectives working for coal operators tried to arrest
Mingo County Constable Sid Hatfield, who supported miners trying to
join the United Mine Workers union. Nine to 13 people died in the
shootout, including the mayor and several detectives.
   Hatfield was later shot on the courthouse steps in Welch, where
he was on trial for murder in the massacre.
   The John Sayles movie ``Matewan'' was released last summer and
enjoyed critical acclaim, although it was not a box office success.
The movie was filmed in Thurmond in Fayette County because Matewan
had changed too much after a 1977 flood.

<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking for a lawyer? Interview several, learn
their backgrounds and specialities, bargain with them over fees and
get any agreements in writing.
   That is some of the advice on lawyer-shopping from Everyday Law,
a new consumer-oriented magazine published by the nation's trial
lawyers.
   Some newspapers and magazines have regular law columns, but this
will be the first full-time consumer law magazine, said Anne Grant,
who pioneered its development and is editor.
   ``People are gradually becoming aware that they need to know
more'' about the law, she explained, so it was a ``natural
connection'' for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America to
launch the magazine.
   Trial lawyers specialize in suits between people and in
defending people accused of crimes. Thus, the group is oriented
toward consumer and individual issues, Grant said.
   But how will association members react to a magazine that
advises potential clients to consider mediation instead of
lawsuits, to shop around for lawyers and to bargain with them over
fees and services?
   The advisory board, which includes consumer advocates, lawyers
and others, was pleased with the first issue, said Grant.
   They ``feel if you can get out of the (legal) system things that
don't belong in there, the system will operate more efficiently ...
we want to (help people) avoid problems. Some will arise anyway,
but we want to avoid those that are avoidable.''
   In addition to advice on choosing a lawyer, the first issue
explains the legal aspects of product warranties, discusses the
Taxpayers Bill of Rights under consideration in Congress, examines
the legal ramifications of sexually transmitted disease, advises on
dealing with real estate developers, gives an overview of the
Consumer Federation of America and has an interview with People's
Court judge Joseph A. Wapner.
   Future issues will consider prenuptial agreements, sports
officiating, lemon laws, dealing with dentists, insurance
adjustors, car insurance, laws affecting boating and government
accountability.

<HEAD>Young Reaching Out to Jackson</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Primary Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After listening to a Jesse Jackson speech that
stirred him to tears, Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young embraced Jackson
and then wrote a letter to the man with whom he has often clashed.
   ``You make me feel proud and humble when I hear you speak,''
Young wrote. ``Martin (Luther King Jr.) would be proud too. You
have my full endorsement as the moral voice of our time.''
   The letter, written after Jackson's speech at a recent
fund-raiser in San Francisco, marked just one of several times that
Young has reached out to the Democratic presidential candidate in
the past month.
   He called Jackson's home in Chicago after the New York primary
to express concern over Jackson's fatigue and to congratulate him
on what Young considered the dignified way he had run his campaign
despite attacks by New York Mayor Ed Koch.
   ``His followers have been telling me that he really is out there
alone, that the people around him are pulling at him for power, and
he really needs some people who just love him and are concerned
about him to tell him that he's doing good,'' Young told The
Atlanta Constitution in an interview published Tuesday.
   ``And so a number of people in the last month or so have been
saying that, from time to time, I ought to call him and just tell
him what I think.''
   Young said many people have misunderstood his differences with
Jackson and he believes Jackson shares that misunderstanding. ``I
think he feels that I am standing in judgment,'' the mayor said.
   Young was among those who publicly disputed Jackson's first
account of his role in the minutes that followed the 1968
assassination of King in Memphis, Tenn. He has said Jackson was not
the last person to speak to King, was not on the balcony when King
was shot and did not cradle the dying man in his arms.
   The Atlanta mayor also was among the black leaders who
criticized Jackson's decision to run for president in 1984, calling
it at one point an ``extremely dangerous'' strategy that would
build up and then deflate the hopes of poor Americans.
   And Young has questioned whether someone who has never held
elective office would have the preparation needed to handle the
presidency.
   In the interview, Young acknowledged the help Jackson has given
him in his own election campaigns and added, ``By the same token, I
think I have been his defender, too. That part never gets
publicized. The public does not know about it.''
   ``If I said anything questioning what Jesse did or said _ and it
wasn't even questioning _ the fact that I would not be a true
believer made me an enemy and I have just resented that. I don't
buy that.''

<HEAD>Librarian Says She'll Send Others to Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHESTER, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The librarian who signed a warrant for the
arrest of a woman who had two books that were 52 days overdue says
the publicity has other overdue books pouring in.
   ``We had a lady come in who had books out since 1985,'' said
Chester County Library Director Ann Ramsey. ``We've had a lot of
calls from people saying, `I'll bring the books in, but please
don't put me in jail.'''
   Ms. Ramsey said Tuesday that close to 100 overdue books have
been returned in the last two days.
   ``Nobody here can remember collecting as many fines in one
day,'' she said. She said about $50 in fines were paid Monday and
about $50 was paid to replace lost books.
   Ms. Ramsey signed the warrant for the arrest of Sharon Adams of
Fort Lawn.
   She said she didn't realize it was an arrest warrant, ``but in
retrospect, it doesn't matter because it was within our rights.
I'll probably do it again before the end of the month.''
   Ms. Adams was arrested May 10 by state Trooper Robert Neely for
failing to return ``Trapping _ A Practical Guide'' and ``The
Complete Book of Trapping'' within 15 days of receiving an official
notice they were overdue. She was handcuffed, fingerprinted and
taken to jail.
   State law makes it a misdemeanor to fail to return a library
book within 15 days of written notification.
   Ms. Adams, 36, returned the books Friday and was found guilty by
Chester County Magistrate Court Judge James Turner and given a
one-day suspended sentence.
   She said she plans to appeal.
   Ms. Adams has said she had asked the library to order the books
from the state library on Jan. 27. She said her boyfriend, Roy
Turner, picked up the books from the library Feb. 22 without her
knowledge or library card.

<TEXT>
   Former President Carter described Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis as ``highly competent'' on Tuesday and
said Dukakis would fare well against Republican George Bush in the
Nov. 8 general election.
   ``I know him well. He and I were governors together,'' said
Carter, who was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and won the
presidency in 1976.
   Carter said the Massachusetts governor ``is highly competent. I
think among all the governors, he would be voted one of the top
ones in administrative ability, in vision and competence and sound
judgment.''
   Carter said Dukakis' nomination was ``the obvious likelihood
now'' and predicted ``he will do well'' against Bush.
   As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the
convention in Atlanta this summer. He said it is still his
intention to go to the convention as an uncommitted delegate
because he told the candidates earlier that he would not choose
among them until the convention.

<HEAD>Vatican, Rebel Bishop Reportedly Reach Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the Vatican
have reportedly reached an agreement that will end a
schism-threatening dispute that dates back to the reforms of Second
Vatican Council in the 1960s.
   The Italian news agencies ANSA and AGI, without indicating their
sources, reported Tuesday that an official announcement of the
settlement was expected soon, possibly after Pope John Paul II's
return on Thursday from South America.
   The Milan-based newspaper Il Giornale and Il Resto del Carlino
of Bologna carried similar, unattributed reports this week.
   Lefebvre's case has been handled by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,
who as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, is
the Vatican's guardian of theological orthodoxy.
   Officials of the congregation declined to say if an agreement
had been reached with the 82-year-old French bishop, who was
suspended by Pope Paul VI in 1976 from his priestly duties,
including saying Mass. They referred inquiries to the Vatican press
office, which said it had no comment.
   In defiance of the Vatican, Lefebvre has ordained priests and
celebrated the Tridentine Mass, a banned, 16th-century liturgy in
Latin. He claims millions of followers and sympathizers and much
enthusiasm for the Latin Mass.
   John Paul II wrote Ratzinger in April in which he said he was
hoping for a settlement with the rebel archbishop.
   The news reports said Lefebvre had agreed to accept the
conclusions of the Second Vatican Council. Among the council's
legacy to the Roman Catholic church is the present custom of
celebrating Mass in the local language, an emphasis on ecumenism,
or promoting better relations between various faiths and Catholics,
and a broader, more active role by lay people.
   Lefebvre had agreed to accept the council's reforms but without
renouncing traditional ways, the reports said.
   The agreement, which ANSA said was reached after Lefebvre and
Ratinzger met in Rome in early May, reportedly would allow the
archbishop to consecrate bishops.
   Lefebvre was quoted in February as saying he planned to
consecrete three bishops in June. That act, without Vatican
permission, would lead to excommunication from the church and set
the stage for a possible schism.
   Lefebvre has ordained more than 200 priests in the past 15 years
without Vatican permission.
   His traditionalist Pius X Fraternity, based in Switzerland,
would again have Vatican approval, according the the reports.
   In October, Pope John Paul II gave Cardinal Edouard Gagnon the
task of working toward a settlement in the case.
   In his letter to Ratzinger in April, the pope, possibly
establishing the framework for the reported agreement, cited
possible problems and advantages of both conservatism and
``progressism'' in the church.
   Progress sometimes does not take into account the function of
tradition, the pope wrote, ``which is fundamental to the church's
mission.''
   On the other hand, John Paul wrote, conservatism ``stops at the
past itself, without taking into account the correct aspiration to
the future.''
   In Switzerland, spokesmen at the fraternity's Rickenbach
headquarters and at the traditionalist seminary in Econe declined
comment. They said Lefebvre was in France and the fraternity's
superior general, the Rev. Franz Schmidberger, was in the United
States until June.
   A well-placed traditionalist source who insisted on anonymity
said he considered the reports of a reconciliation to be
``credible.''
   The French Catholic monthly Trente Jours reported that a secret
meeting in Rome April 11-13 between Vatican experts and
traditionalists gave ``new hope for peace between Econe and the
Vatican.''
   It quoted an ``authorized Vatican observer'' as saying that
there were only two potential obstacles in the way of a
reconciliation: an extremist group in the traditionalist movement
that might make Lefebvre change his mind or ``some national
episcopates'' opposed to recognizing Lefebvre.

<HEAD>President Backs Push to Upgrade Intelligence-Gathering</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Arms Treaty Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Tuesday the United
States must modernize its intelligence-gathering system, regardless
of what arms control treaties are negotiated with the Soviet Union.
   ``It is important for our national security interests that our
country have all of the means necessary to assure compliance with
these agreements,'' Reagan said in a statement.
   ``With or without future arms control agreements, it is
important to our national security interests that we keep pace with
changes in technologies in other nations.''
   The president's statement supported bipartisan efforts in
Congress to upgrade the so-called ``national technical means,'' the
system by which this country, among other things, uses
sophisticated satellite technology to monitor compliance with arms
control agreements.
   Reagan's comments were released shortly after he met privately
with the two ranking members of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
and as the Senate prepared to open floor debate on the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the committee's chairman, told
reporters that Reagan gave him and Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, ``a
real commitment to make sure that our national security interests
are protected by continuing to modernize our national technical
means.''
   In his statement, the president said, ``I welcome bipartisan
support to start this year on a multi-year program to improve these
systems.''
   ``I will also include funding for the second year of this
program in the final budget which I submit to Congress,'' he said,
``and I will urge the next administration to assure continuity of
this vital effort. After 1989, the funding for this program should
be additive to the 2 percent real growth objective for national
security spending.''
   Neither Reagan nor the senators indicated how much money was
being envisioned for the modernization program.
   Boren said the congressional Armed Services and Intelligence
committees have been concerned about ``the need to improve our
national technical means, to modernize those systems, to keep
pace'' with changing weapons technology.
   The changes are needed not only to ensure compliance with arms
control pacts, but also to ``have a good assessment of what's going
on the world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Education Dept. Official Pans Study That Acquitted Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Education Department official on Tuesday
blasted a RAND Corp. study, partially financed by his agency, that
acquitted teacher unions of obstructing school reform.
   Chester Finn Jr., an assistant secretary whose Office of
Educational Research and Improvement paid $35,000 for the study,
said the RAND researchers engaged in ``very selective reporting''
and did a poor job of analyzing events in the six states they
examined.
   The report, ``Teacher Unions and Educational Reform,''
concluded, ``Despite charges to the contrary, teacher unions have
not been a major obstacle to educational reform.''
   It did not name names, but Education Secretary William J.
Bennett has accused unions of trying to ``hijack'' the reform
movement with demands for more money without stricter
accountability.
   The RAND study said unions generally have accommodated reforms,
even if they had misgivings about such initiatives as career
ladders for teachers.
   ``I don't think the report is an accurate depiction of the state
of affairs,'' Finn said in an interview. ``We've got a much longer
list of hijacking episodes than they have of `accommodationist'
episodes.''
   The RAND study reviewed 151 teacher contracts and examined the
impact of reform laws in six states: Arizona, California, Florida,
Georgia, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.
   Finn said unions have fought bitterly with governors in
Tennessee, Texas, New Jersey and Indiana over career ladders,
competency tests for teachers, alternative certification methods
and other reforms. The teachers' union in St. Louis, Mo., is in
court battling a plan to tie teacher evaluations to student
performance, he noted.
   Even if the unions accommodated reforms that seemed inevitable,
Finn said, ``Going along with something only after it's clear you
can't beat it is scarcely a very positive thing to say about a
professional organization.''
   He claimed unions are still engaging in ``guerrilla warfare''
against reform efforts aimed at upgrading the quality of teaching.
   The RAND report said rank-and-file teachers are unwilling to
accept reforms as a substitute for bread-and-butter improvements in
their basic working conditions.
   Lorraine M. McDonnell, co-author of the RAND report with Anthony
Pascal, said, ``We certainly stand by our data and what we saw in
these six states.''
   ``We chose six states that had different approaches to reform.
We didn't want to choose all the Southern states,'' she said.
   To Finn's charge that just going along with reform was hardly
praiseworthy, McDonnell said, ``Those reforms could not have been
put in place had there not been accommodation and cooperation from
the local teacher unions. ... Had the teacher unions wanted to
sandbag them, they probably could.''
   Eighty percent of America's nearly 2.3 million public school
teachers belong to unions, and 60 percent of them are covered by
collective bargaining contracts.
   The RAND study cost $75,000, with RAND itself contributing the
larger share of the costs.

<HEAD>Hundreds Antique Dresses Found in Stable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of dresses from the 1920s and 1930s, some
by top designers like Coco Chanel, have been found in trunks left
in a stable in 1937 by one of the first Britons to sell elegant
second-hand clothes.
   Textile specialist Anne-Marie Benson of auctioneers Phillips
said Tuesday the collection of about 600 dresses will be sold at
auction June 2. She estimated the dresses, including 80 to 100 by
top Paris couturiers, would bring nearly $40,000.
   The dresses come from the estage of Robina Wallis, who died last
year at age 87. In the 1930s, her mother, Ellen Mary Wallis, began
selling clothes by designers such as Chanel, Worth, Callot Soeurs,
Vionnet and Molyneux that had been worn by socialites and
ladies-in-waiting at Buckingham Palace. At the time, second-hand
sales were very new and very discreet.
   When Mrs. Wallis' husband died in 1937, she and her daughter
moved from Devon to Wartha Manor on the Cornwall peninsula and
trunks containing hundreds of dresses were put in the stables.
   Miss Benson said the silk, velvet and chiffon dresses, many
hand-beaded and embroidered, remained untouched for a half-century,
when they were found by the executors of Miss Wallis' estate.
   ``The trunks had been stepped on, the horses had kicked them and
cats had been sleeping on them. ... The newspaper lining the trunks
was dated 1937,'' Miss Benson said.
   ``Although some dresses are slightly damaged, many are in
excellent condition,'' she said. ``This was a very exciting find.''
   ``They're more sort of cocktail and dinner party dresses than
ballgowns, but you'd look very swish in one of these today.''

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng reported
outside earnings of at least $119,500 last year, virtually
unchanged since he joined the Reagan cabinet in March 1986, his
financial disclosure report showed Tuesday.
   The outside earnings were in addition to his annual Cabinet
salary, which was raised to $99,500 in February 1987.
   According to the statement, Lyng owns assets worth at least
$775,000, primarily in real estate investments and a family seed
business in Modesto, Calif. His 1987 outside income was in the
range of $119,500 to $260,000.
   Lyng's liabilities, secured by mortgages and home equity, are at
least $300,000, according to the report.
   Income, assets and liabilities are reported only in broad ranges
by the financial disclosure reports.
   When Lyng underwent Senate confirmation proceedings in March
1986, he reported 1985 assets of at least $775,000 and an income in
the range of $205,000 to $344,000. The 1985 income included $82,500
salary from his private consulting firm, which he sold after being
chosen for the USDA post.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia is a solid
choice of Southern Democratic party leaders as a running mate for
likely presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, according to
interviews by The Charlotte Observer.
   The party officials, in 14 Southern and border states, also say
that a ticket including Jesse Jackson would hurt Dukakis in their
states, though most say promising Jackson a lesser but key role in
a Democratic administration would help.
   The 11 Southern states and three border states _ Kentucky,
Missouri and West Virginia _ offer 164 electoral votes, 30 percent
of the total and more than half the 270 needed for nomination. No
Democrat this century has won the White House without carrying a
majority of Southern states.
   Officials in seven states want Nunn as their first choice. Those
in four others rank him second to favorite sons: Sens. Bob Graham
in Florida, Lloyd Bentson in Texas, Albert Gore Jr. in Tennessee
and Rep. Richard Gephardt in Missouri.
   Other names often mentioned favorably by party leaders include
Sens. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and John Glenn of Ohio and Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton.

<HEAD>Baltimore City Council Moves toward Passage of Gay Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of gay rights legislation say they
are thrilled the Baltimore City Council gave the bill preliminary
approval after twice rejecting it in the last eight years.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Curt Decker, a lobbyist for the Baltimore
Justice Campaign, after Monday night's 12-6 vote in an overflowing
council chamber. ``I've worked on this eight years. It's time that
it happened.''
   Decker predicted final passage when the bill is taken up again
next week. The Baltimore Justice Campaign, which handles issues
facing the gay community in this largely Roman Catholic city, began
working in December to marshal support for the bill. It prohibits
discrimination against homosexuals in housing, employment,
education, health and welfare services.
   Similar bills have been passed in several other cities,
including New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.
   Baltimore's Catholic leadership has opposed the bill, but this
time gay rights advocates got critical backing from Mayor Kurt L.
Schmoke and City Council President Mary Pat Clarke. During his 1987
mayoral campaign, Schmoke promised support for the measure, which
his predecessor in City Hall, Gov. William Donald Schaefer, had
never endorsed.
   Opponents, including placard-carrying parents pushing their
children in strollers in front of City Hall on Monday, immediately
vowed to collect enough signatures to force the issue to a
referendum.
   An amendment exempted religious organizations from the bill,
based on the doctrine of the separation of church and state, Mrs.
Clarke said.
   ``We leave some judgments to God,'' she said, but try to give
everyone an equal position ``at the starting gate.''
   Councilman Mike Curran, explaining his negative vote, said he
had asked himself, ``is this a civil rights matter or is it a
special rights matter?'' and concluded it ``would confer special
rights on certain people.''
   Councilman Joseph T. Landers III said it came down to voting his
conscience.
   ``I think we need to send a message out,'' he said. ``Even if it
only affects the lives of half a dozen people ... we will be
recognizing justice.
   ``We tried to protect religious principles. We've also looked at
the issue of discrimination. In my heart, I know from all of the
values I was brought up with, I can't deny there is
discrimination.''
   John Glorioso, sporting a Baltimore Justice Campaign sticker,
said opponents who gave religious arguments for their opposition
were failing to show Christian attitudes.
   ``Their concerns are really unjustified. They're unable to be
rational. They're really fixated on parts of the Bible and seemed
to ignore other parts of the Bible. Basically it's a hysterical
issue,'' Glorioso said.
   Nonetheless, supporters and opponents peaceably sat side by side
during the council session.
   Next to Glorioso, wearing ``Vote No'' stickers, were Susan Walsh
and her husband, Mike Walsh.
   Although they have no children, Mrs. Walsh said they were
``concerned about the effect it's going to have on our children.''
   She said opponents feared the precedent set by establishing
homosexuals as a minority. If students are taught the history of
such minorities as women and blacks, ``then you could have
Homosexual Week and teach about how they got started and what they
do,'' she said.

   The U.S. Navy on Tuesday marked the first
anniversary of the Iraqi air attack on the USS Stark by dropping a
wreath in Persian Gulf waters where the frigate was hit by two
errant missiles with the loss of 37 lives.
   During the ceremony, a Navy chaplain offered a prayer and a
seven-man rifle team fired a salute from the deck of the destroyer
USS Stump.
   ``We pause amidst our duties to honor men of Stark, who laid
down their lives in service to country, and to dedicate ourselves
as fellow shipmates to the great task of protecting peace and
righteousness among all nations,'' said the chaplain, Lt. Cmdr.
Jerry McNabb.
   Flanked by a 24-man honor guard in dress whites, a chief petty
officer and a seaman, the oldest and youngest members of the
Stump's 325-man crew, tossed the wreath over the side. Cmdr.
Constantine L. Xefteries, the destroyer's skipper, also spoke.
   McNabb had attended survivors after the May 17, 1987 attack,
according to naval sources who provided details of the ceremony.
   The Stump is one of the 16 U.S. warships serving in the gulf,
having recently arrived as a temporary replacement for the frigate
Samuel B. Roberts. The Roberts, a sister ship of the Stark, was
severely damaged by an Iranian mine last month.
   The Stark was hit by two Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi
warplane as it conducted what the Navy said was a routine patrol
mission in the central gulf.
   Ravaged by fires fed by unspent missile fuel and hot enough to
melt the steel decks, the 3,700-ton warship was saved from sinking
by its crew and salvage tugs that rushed to its aid.
   The main damage and most casualties were in the combat control
center and the enlisted crew quarters as the missiles slammed into
the 445-foot vessel amidships, just behind and below the bridge on
the port side.
   Iraq apologized for what it called a mistaken attack, saying the
F-1 Mirage fighter-bomber's missiles were intended for an Iranian
vessel.
   The United States officially accepted Baghdad's explanation but
demands for compensation for the ship and families of the dead
crewmen have yet to be settled.
   The Stark's captain and tactical action officer were retired
from the navy after an official inquiry held they had failed to
protect the ship sufficiently from the possibility of attack.
   The Stark, homeported at Mayport, Fla., is nearing completion of
repairs and extensive overhaul at the Ingalls Shipyard in
Pascagoula, Miss. Four other Perry-class frigates are in the gulf.
   Many U.S. Navy officers say the attack on the Stark has led to
tighter defensive measures aboard the American ships in the gulf,
where Iraq and Iran have been at war for 7{ years.

   Actor-singer Tommy Steele stepped in Tuesday as
temporary director of ``Ziegfeld,'' a lavish musical about the
legendary Broadway showman which has been hit by poor reviews and
the departure of its director and leading actor.
   Budgeted at $5.9 million, ``Ziegfeld'' received poor notices
from British critics after opening three weeks ago. And on
Saturday, Len Cariou, the Tony-winning star of ``Sweeney Todd'' on
Broadway, left the lead role as Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.
   The director, Broadway veteran Joe Layton, has also departed.
   Cariou said he was fired after English producer Harold Fielding
ordered changes without consulting Layton or the 60-strong cast.
   Steele, who starred in the London Palladium's longest-running
show, ``Singing in the Rain,'' said ``Ziegfeld was `90 percent
good.'''
   ``I'm going to tell them (the cast) the truth _ they're
wonderful, the show is wonderful, it just needs a couple of
changes,'' he told reporters.

   Christo, the artist who has wrapped Florida
islands and a Paris bridge in material, says he can understand that
anyone can live without his art work.
   ``Nobody needs these projects. It's first myself, my urge to do
this work,'' Christo said Monday before the National Convention of
The American Institute of Architects.
   Currently he is working on a plan to plant 3,000 huge umbrellas
across parts of Japan and Southern California.
   Christo said his work creates an ``innocent, almost irrational,
irresponsible attitude. That's what makes the people think. The
absurdity on all these levels really gives man his full freedom.''
   In 1985, Christo wrapped the almost 400-year-old Pont Neuf
bridge in Paris with 440,000 square feet of champagne-colored
fabric. Two years earlier, he surrounded 11 islands in Florida's
Biscayne Bay with 6 million square feet of shocking pink
polypropylene. In 1976, he used a white translucent fabric to
create ``Running Fence,'' an 18-foot-high fence that ran like a
ribbon across 24{ miles of Northern California.

   Sally Kirkland, nominated for an Oscar
for her portrayal of a forgotten refugee actress in ``Anna,'' will
star in ``Cold Feet,'' a comedy western.
   The film, from an original screenplay by Tom McGuane and Jim
Harrison, is to be shot June 13 through the end of July in the
mountains of southern Montana.
   ``It is indeed a go,'' producer Mary McLaglen, who has been
scouting locations in the region for several days, said Monday.
Assistant producer Sue Bridges, who has a ranch south of Livingston
with her husband, actor Jeff Bridges, was influential in bringing
the film to Livingston.
   McGuane's screenplays have included ``The Missouri Breaks'' and
``Rancho Deluxe,'' also shot here. Harrison is the author of the

   Newsman David Brinkley says ABC News has
gotten to the top of the television network ratings with the suave,
informative delivery of anchorman Peter Jennings and the foreign
affairs acumen of Ted Koppel.
   Nielsen ratings placed ABC News No. 1 for the last three weeks.
   ``World News Tonight'' with Jennings and Koppel's ``Nightline''
have elevated a ``poor, underfinanced and understaffed'' network,
Brinkley said.
   Brinkley, half the Chet Huntley-David Brinkley NBC news team of
the 1960s and now host of ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
said Jennings delivers news effectively and intelligently.
   ``And, ABC has stuff that nobody else has. `Nightline' is pretty
special _ no one else has a Koppel,'' Brinkley said in a telephone
interview this week.
   ``He's the only newsman I've ever known who, when somebody
suggests he could be secretary of state, nobody laughs. He knows
foreign affairs profoundly. He is only interested in foreign
affairs. He doesn't like American politics, hates them, in fact.''

<HEAD>Three Tortured By Drug Dealers Over $90 in Missing Crack</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two suspected drug dealers trying to recover $90
worth of crack cocaine stabbed and tortured three people, dousing
one with boiling water before rubbing salt into his wounds,
authorities said.
   A 28-year-old man was in fair condition Tuesday at Parkland
Memorial Hospital with multiple knife wounds and second-degree
burns on his back and buttocks, said hospital spokesman Tom Geddie.
   He was cut and stabbed in the chest and legs more than 80 times
Sunday, officials said. His 27-year-old wife was bound and whipped,
and a 17-year-old man was treated for second-degree burns he
suffered when boiling water was poured on him, Geddie said.
   Police said the victims told them they sold crack and cocaine,
and two suppliers were trying to recover either the crack or $90.
The assailants came to an apartment occupied by the older man to
collect daily drug-sale proceeds, according to police reports.
   One victim said the crack had been flushed down a toilet the
night before because of a rumor of a police raid. No raid occurred,
but one victim said the apartment was ransacked to make it appear
there had been one so the suppliers could be told police had seized
the drugs.
   But the assailants did not believe the story, said police.
   No one had been arrested Tuesday.

<HEAD>Synar Raps Du Pont Co. Plan To Pay Severance to Weapons Plant
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman said Tuesday he
would investigate Du Pont Co.'s plan to use $75 million in federal
funds to pay severance benefits to 6,500 workers at a nuclear
weapons plant, even though virtually all will keep their jobs under
new management.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said ``there is no logical or
equitable reason for the taxpayers to provide a $75 million
windfall to workers who will not lose their jobs or benefits,
solely to enhance Du Pont's corporate image.''
   Synar charged that the Department of Energy, which owns the
Savannah River Nuclear Plant in Aiken, S.C., has failed to actively
resist Du Pont's plan to invoke cost-reimbursable language in its
contract to pay severance to its employees when the company
withdraws from the facility in October 1989.
   He said he had instructed his staff to investigate the matter.
   Du Pont designed and constructed the plant, and since 1950
operated it under government contract before deciding last year to
pull out when the currect pact expires. Under DOE rules, the new
contractor, yet unnamed, must offer jobs and comparable benefits to
all Du Pont employees except for those in 37 key positions or among
support staff at the company's Wilmington, Del., headquarters.
   Synar, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee
on the environment, energy and natural resources, said,
``Department of Energy officials appear to be more concerned about
protecting the corporate interests of private contractors than the
government or taxpayers.''
   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, declined comment
except to say ``it's an issue still under review.'' That review was
triggered in April by the DOE's own inspector general, after it
appeared initially that the department would accept the Du Pont
plan.
   Synar, in a letter to Energy Secretry John S. Herrington, said,
``This delay and inaction only casts doubt on DOE's willingness to
be aggressive in its stewardship of public funds.''
   Synar asked DOE to provide ``all internal analyses, memos, legal
opinions, communications, responses and any other documents
generated by DOE or contractor staff or officials related to the
severance pay issue.''
   Earlier, a Du Pont spokesman, Jim Felder, declined comment on
the case except to note that ``Our employment plans call for the
payment of severance, and we expect the federal government to
reimburse Du Pont for the cost of severance.''
   Under the plan, Du Pont employees would receive a week's pay for
each year of service with the company up until Sept. 30, 1985. That
was the year when Du Pont and DOE agreed to stop accrual of
severance benefits for employees who actually would keep their jobs
under new management.
   Synar said there has been no instance in which the government
paid severance to workers who retained their jobs when there was a
change of contractors at other federal nuclear facilities.

<HEAD>Late Jewish Leader Suspected of Embezzling Reparation Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former leader of West Germany's
Jewish community is suspected of embezzling millions of dollars
from government reparations to Nazi Holocaust survivors, his
successor said Tuesday.
   Werner Nachmann is suspected of stealing more than $6 million in
interest accumulated from Holocaust survivor funds before his death
in January, said Heinz Galinski, Nachmann's successor as president
of the Jewish Council of West Germany.
   ``I am shocked, horrified and furious that such a thing could be
even possible,'' Galinski said.
   Hessischer Rundfunk radio in Frankfurt reported the Jewish
Council believes Nachmann embezzled about $19 million from West
German government funds for Holocaust survivors between 1980 and
1987 but Galinski said the radio's figure was ``pure speculation.''
   About $236 million were made available by the West German
government in 1980 for Holocaust survivors all over the world who
had never made reparations claims.
   The funds were in addition to about $47 billion already paid out
by West Germany to Holocaust survivors or victims' families who had
applied for reparations.
   ``After the death of Werner Nachmann, financial irregularities
of considerable proportions were discovered'' in transactions
involving the funds approved in 1980, Galinski said.
   ``Learning of this surprised and dismayed the council's
directorate, which immediately informed (West German) government
leaders,'' he said in an interview from his West Berlin office.
   Galinski said the Jewish Council has hired financial experts to
look into the accusations, and the investigation is expected to
take two to three weeks.
   Nachmann was in charge of the funds to be handed out to
Holocaust survivors, Hessischer Rundfunk radio reported.
   The radio said the Jewish council believes Nachmann transferred
millions of dollars to dummy corporations ``which seem to be
unknown to anyone.''
   Galinski said the Jewish Council has asked a civil court in
Karlsruhe to freeze money from Nachmann's estate pending an
investigation into the allegations.
   A court spokesman said no action has yet been taken on the
council's application.
   ``This is still in a preliminary stage,'' spokesman Alfred
Mueller said. ``More documents and other information will be coming
in on this matter.''
   Mueller said that if the allegations against Nachmann are proven
true, the money would have to be repaid from the deceased Jewish
leader's estate.
   Galinski said he was deeply upset about the possibility that
Nachmann may have embezzled money from the accounts.
   ``This has presented me with the most serious problem I have
ever faced in my 40 years of working for the Jewish community,'' he
said.
   The 62-year-old Nachmann died Jan. 21 of a heart attack at his
home in Karlsruhe.
   He had been active in trying to help heal wounds in West Germany
left by the Holocaust, in which about 6 million Jews were killed
during Nazi rule.
   Nachmann's family fled Nazi Germany to France in 1938. He
returned to Karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward
re-establishing Jewish communities in the country.
   About 525,000 Jews lived in Germany when the Nazis took power in
1933. West Germany has about 30,000 Jewish residents today.

   U.S. industry operated at 82.7 percent of
capacity in April, the highest level in more than eight years, the
government said Tuesday. Economists said the report renewed
inflation fears.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the operating rate at factories,
mines and utilities last month jumped by 0.3 percentage point from
82.4 percent a month earlier. It was the highest since March 1980,
when the operating rate was 83.7 percent.
   The rate at manufacturing concerns increased from 82.6 percent
in March to 83.0 percent in April.
   Economists attributed the climb to rising export sales, spurred
by the devalued dollar. In a separate report Tuesday, the Commerce
Department said the trade deficit in March shrank dramatically to
$9.7 billion as American exports surged 23 percent to a record
$28.97 billion.
   ``Both reports show good health for the economy and a boom
developing in the U.S. manufacturing sector. That's good news. The
other side of that is higher inflation and higher interest rates,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Interest rates edged up in the bond market after the two reports
were issued.
   Economists consider an operating rate of 85 percent as
inflationary. They fear that prices will rise as factories have
trouble meeting both demand in the United States and the rising
appetite abroad for U.S. goods.
   Operating rates in some industries _ paper, textiles, chemicals,
petroleum products _ already approach or surpass 90 percent.
   ``We are in the danger zone and I think that is why the Fed has
been tightening,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data
Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   Sinai predicted that overall operating rates would rise to the
84-85 percent level by October or November.
   ``My guess is through no particular manipulation on the
president's part, the election will be about the time when we have
really closed up the slack both in labor and products markets,'' he
said.
   ``... The next president will have a new problem to think about:
How do you handle inflation and interest rates?''
   Some analysts are hoping that corporations' efforts to expand
capacity will eventually ease the strain. In a survey by the
Commerce Department earlier this year, businesses said they would
spend 8 percent more than last year on new plant and equipment. But
Sinai said demand for goods would likely increase faster than
companies' ability to expand.
   The April gain in operating rates was the first increase since
January, when the rate stood at 82.5 percent. The level fell by 0.1
percentage point in February and was unchanged in March. Before
that, the operating rate had climbed for four successive months,
from 81.1 percent in September.
   The April advance was led by the second steep monthly increase
at car, truck and automotive parts plants. They operated at 80.9
percent of capacity last month, up from 79.4 percent in March and
76.8 percent in February.
   Operating rates at factories producing durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, rose by 0.5 percentage point
to 81.1 percent of capacity. The rate for non-durable goods held
steady at 85.7 percent.
   The mining industry, which includes oil and gas drilling,
operated at 81.5 percent of capacity, up from 80.3 percent in
March. U.S. utilities operated at an 81.1 percent rate last month,
down from 81.8 percent a month earlier.
   The changes left the overall operating rate of 82.7 percent, up
sharply from a year earlier, when American industry operated at
79.6 percent of capacity.

<TEXT>
   Renovations and landscaping work
on singer Whitney Houston's new home has upset neighbors who don't
like the construction vehicles parked there.
   Houston, who was born in Newark, bought the five-acre estate
last summer and began installing a swimming pool, sound studio and
tennis courts in the fall, said township officials.
   Residents are not opposed to having a celebrity move in, but the
trucks have disrupted the quiet neighborhood, said Ruth Kollmer,
who lives four houses away.
   But Mayor Marian R. Wysong said the problem has been
exaggerated, and many of the construction vehicles are parked on
the singer's property.
   Police have gone to the site several times but the vehicles have
been legally parked, Police Chief F. Herbert Herron said Tuesday.
   The 24-year-old singer has missed much of the flap because she's
been on a European tour since mid-April.
   Sylvia Weiner, a spokeswoman for Houston, said she can't
comment. ``Her private residence is not something we are given
information on,'' she said.

<HEAD>Communist Party to Consider Limiting Leader's Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party conference next month will
consider setting limits on the length of time its top leader stays
in power, a top official said.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose job as party general secretary is
that which may be limited if the party acts, himself has said the
party needs to find ways to replace aging officials.
   Dmitri A. Lisovolik, a deputy to party Central Committee
secretary Anatoly F. Dobrynin, told members of the Young Presidents
Organization and a reporter Monday night that proposals have been
introduced to limit the party leader to two or three terms of eight
years each.
   He did not mention proposals for age limits, and said he could
not predict whether the proposals for fixed terms would be adopted.
   Lisovolik indicated that support had been growing for limits to
the terms of Communist Party leaders.
   A second official told a U.S. newspaper that if limits are
adopted, it should not be considered a blow to Gorbachev.
   Many letters have appeared in recent weeks in the Soviet press
proposing fixed terms and age limits for the country's leaders, an
indication that the idea is being brought back under consideration.
   Gorbachev raised the idea of limits in the highest echelons of
Soviet power creating a mechanism to replace aging officials in top
party jobs at a January 1987 meeting of the Central Committee.
   He apparently met with opposition then because the meeting's
final documents only made passing reference to it.
   The Soviet leader has said more freqent turnover would make
officials more accountable to the people. He has criticized
middle-level officials for falling behind his calls for a
restructuring of Soviet society, and says that confusion about his
reform policy reaches to the highest levels of the Communist Party.
   Gorbachev has pushed aside many older Communist Party leaders
who were uncomfortable with his policies, but still faces stiff
opposition.
   He has sharply criticized the 1964-82 rule of former Communist
Party chief Leonid I. Brezhnev as a period of economic stagnation
and corruption.
   Dictator Josef V. Stalin's abuses during his 29 years in power
also are coming under increasing criticism as Soviets re-examine
their past.
   The party conference that begins June 28 is considered to be a
key opportunity for Gorbachev to strengthen his hand in the
policy-making Central Committee.
   In its Tuesday's editions, The Washington Post quoted Central
Committee member Georgi A. Arbatov as saying there is a ``good
chance'' the party conference will back proposals limiting the
general secretary's term.
   Arbatov said the changes would not indicate any setback for
Gorbachev, who has been general secretary since March 1985.
   The Young Presidents Organization is a group of foreign business
leaders, including Americans. A delegation of the group arrived in
Moscow on Saturday.
   Lisovolik, 50, has been chief of the U.S. section of the
International Department of the Central Committee since December
1984. He served briefly in the Soviet Embassy in Washington under
Dobrynin, who was ambassador from 1962 to 1986. Dobrynin is Central
Committee secretary in charge of foreign affairs.

<HEAD>Hotline, Planes Ready For Locust Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel set up emergency telephone hotlines
Tuesday and readied insecticide-spraying airplanes to fly into
action against a possible plague of locusts, the desert insects
feared since biblical times.
   Only a small number of the yellow insects were sighted in
southern Israel and the Jordan valley but officials warned of a
possible larger invasion from the south and said the hotlines would
remain open until the end of the week at least.
   ``If they are not controlled, locusts can destroy all the
country's crops and orchards in a matter of days,'' said Chaim
Hahan, an Agriculture Ministry official working on the hotline.
   ``If the winds are right, they can travel about 130 miles per
day,'' he said. ``They are fast and deadly.''
   Locust migrations occur infrequently after a build-up of the
population. Swarms of the insects can obscure the sun when they
pass overhead and turn the ground black when they settle to rest
for the night.
   Some crops are destroyed by the flying swarm, but most of the
destruction occurs after the insects lay eggs at night. The larvae,
which hatch in 15 to 20 days, devour all green vegetation.
   The last serious locust invasion into Israel was in 1959. Then
Israel was younger and less modernized, and many Israelis banged
pots and pans outdoors in an attempt to ``scare off the swarms,''
Hahan said. ``It didn't work.''
   But this year, Israel is ready with planes and has asked
residents to call the hotline if they spot insect swarms covering
up to four to five acres, which officials fear could come from
Egypt's Sinai Desert, where some have been seen.
   ``It takes a swarm of 5,000 to 10,000 insects before we get
really worried,'' Hahan said. ``And even if a farmer sees that
many, he shouldn't take any action on his own. Wait for us.''
   Israel's concern was heightened by a four-day heat wave, the
worst in the country in 18 years. Warm weather is one environmental
factor known to trigger locust migration.
   Due to hot winds from the north, temperatures in parts of Israel
and the occupied West Bank have reached 113 degrees this week. One
Austrian tourist died after hiking in the area of the Dead Sea and
suffering from heat stroke.

   Relatives of 37 seamen killed
aboard the USS Stark in the Persian Gulf cried and hugged each
other as they dropped yellow roses into the sea Tuesday to
commemorate the first anniversary of the attack.
   ``I'm still asking myself, `Why did it have to happen?''' said
Diana Pierce, widow of Petty Officer Randy E. Pierce.
   Almost 150 wives, parents, children and other relatives of the
victims took part in a dockside memorial service at the
guided-missile frigate's North Florida home port. Many of them then
rode the USS Antrim about five miles into the Atlantic Ocean for a
wreath-laying ceremony from the vessel's stern.
   Nancy Ciletta, with daughters, Laura, 4, and Dawn, 14, wiped
away tears as they moved from the ship's railing after tossing
their tissue-wrapped roses into the ocean.
   ``I'd rather not go through it over and over,'' the widow of
John Ciletta said. ``I would rather just remember John as he was.''
   Chaplain Bill Perry and Capt. John B. Mitchell Jr., Mayport's
commanding officer, memorialized the 37 as heroes, as President
Reagan had in services last year.
   Standing before a stone and bronze monument to the Stark at the
Mayport dock, Mitchell told the crowd sitting under white awnings
that the reason for the observance was engraved on the memorial:
``You will never be forgotten ...''
   ``Last May, we were God's people caring for God's hurting
people. One year later, we are now God's people caring for God's
healing people,'' Mitchell said.
   Said the chaplain, as the name of each dead seaman was intoned
to the ringing of a ship's bell: ``Even if you wanted to, you could
not forget the pain, that personal pain that goes beyond
description,''
   Similar observances were held in Pascagoula, Miss., where the
Stark is undergoing a $100 million overhaul, in Washington and
aboard many Navy ships and installations around the world.
   A wreath-laying ceremony was also held by Navy ships still
patrolling the central Persian Gulf, where the Stark was hit by two
missiles fired by an Iraqi jet.
   At Mayport, flags on the base and aboard ship flew at half mast,
and the echo of taps wafted far out over the Antrim's wake
following a 21-gun salute by an honor guard.
   Many relatives of the dead took pictures of each other at the
waist-high monument. Others stared straight ahead, or prayed
silenty at times.
   ``My only anger is at the Iraqis, at my son's loss,'' said
Rodney Erwin, 50, a General Motors plant supervisor from Troy,
Mich., whose 22-year-old son, Steve, was among the victims. The
plane's pilot reportedly said he mistook the Stark for a tanker
from Iraq's enemy Iran.
   ``My son and I always loved the water,'' added Erwin, aboard the
Antrim with his wife, Nancy. ``We had boats all the time when he
was growing up, and when I was putting our little boat into the
water the other day, I cried.''
   Joseph Wilson, a mail carrier from Charleston, S.C., the father
of victim Lloyd Anthony Wilson, moved around the crowd before the
services, consoling some of the mothers who had lost their sons.
   ``The thoughts and the pain are still the same after a year. But
the healing process is less severe,'' he said. ``Life has to go
on.''
   Mrs. Ciletta's message was similar: ``As hard as it is, you do
survive and go on.''

   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, indicted in
the United States in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner, will
stand trial in a West German juvenile court in July on charges
stemming from the air piracy.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot to death during the
hijacking that began on June 14, 1985, on a flight from Athens to
Rome, and ended up in Beirut. Thirty-nine Americans were held
captive for 17 days in the ordeal.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was indicted in the United
States on air piracy and murder charges related to the act.
   West Germany turned down a U.S. extradition request last year,
but after two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut by the
defendant's brother, West Germany said he would be tried here.
   Hamadi was arrested in Frankfurt on Jan. 13, 1987, while
carrying liquid explosives and false documents, and has been jailed
in Frankfurt since then. He was charged by West German officials on
Feb. 8 with air piracy, murder, illegal possession of explosives
and carrying a false passport.
   On Jan. 17, 1987, West German businessman Rudolf Cordes was
kidnapped in Beirut and three days later another West German,
Alfred Schmidt also was abducted in Lebanon.
   Hamadi's 29-year-old brother, Abbas, was arrested at Frankfurt
airport Jan. 26, 1987 after arriving on a flight from Beirut. He
was charged with kidnapping the two West Germans in an attempt to
win freedom for his brother.
   Abbas Hamadi was found guilty by a Duesseldorf court last month
in connection with kidnapping the two West Germans and sentenced to
13 years in prison.
   Schmidt was released in September in what his captors said was a
``goodwill gesture,'' but Cordes remains a hostage.
   Justice officials have decided to open the case against Mohammed
Hamadi in juvenile court in July, Hesse state court spokesman Falk
Thomas said at a news conference. No exact starting date was given
for the trial, which is expected to last several months.
   The final decision to try Mohammed Hamadi before a juvenile
court was made because his age at the time of the crime could not
be determined, he said.
   Mohammed Hamadi first told West German authorities he was born
on June 13, 1964, but later he said he was two years younger.
   Under West German law, an adolescent is described as between
ages 18 and 21, an adult 21 and older, and a juvenile as less than
18. Juvenile courts also handle adolescent cases.
   ``If he is found guilty and the court determines that he was 21
at the time the crimes he is charged with actually began, the
maximum sentence is life imprisonment,'' Thomas said.
   A juvenile court may give a life sentence to an adolescent based
on a determination of personal maturity at the time a crime began,
despite age, said Thomas.
   He added, however, that the usual maximum sentence is between 10
and 15 years in prison for an adolescent not judged as mature.

<HEAD>Hoarding Continues In Nominal Price Freeze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgrade residents have gone on a
shopping spree, snapping up important consumer items because of a
government decision to postpone the lifting of a price freeze.
   Flour, sugar, coffee, detergents and cooking oil were all
reported to be in short supply, newspapers said Tuesday.
   Even furniture has become a hot item.
   Prices are expected to rise by fifty percent and more when the
six-month price freeze is lifted later this month.
   The largest circulation daily, Vecernje Novosti, described the
buying spree as ``A Fever on the Eve of the De-Freeze'' in a
front-page headline Tuesday.
   The newspaper and Belgrade authorities said sales of detergents
went up by 100 percent last week, while sales of flour rose by 50
percent, of cooking oil by 70 percent and of sugar by 45 percent.
   The daily published an appeal by Belgrade authorities not to
hoard staple items already in short supply.
   ``There is no need to hoard and create unnecessary queues,'' the
daily quoted the appeal as saying.
   According to the newspaper, shelves storing staple items in
highest demand ``are virtually empty.''
   Officials promised to restock the supply of coffee, the first
item to disappear from Belgrade shops, from emergency reserves.
Vecernje Novosti said 250 tons of coffee would be made available,
but the federal government, meanwhile, announced a 3 percent price
increase on coffee going into effect immediately.
   Yugoslavians pay about $13 for 2.2 pounds of coffee.
   The Politika Ekspres daily quoted the owner of one store as
saying his furniture sales had doubled over the past two months.
   Local media have reported that about 80 percent of the country's
manufacturers will announce new prices for their goods when the
government lifts the freeze.
   The end of the six-month price freeze was originally scheduled
for May 15, but was postponed for at least 10 days, until the
government secures about $300 million in emergency credits from the
West.
   The government has not set a specific date for the price freeze
to be lifted, but it is expected to be before the end of May.
   The government said the emergency funds were needed to implement
an economic package made in conjunction with the International
Monetary Fund.
   The package of economic measures, which includes the lifting of
the price freeze, is intended to reduce Europe's highest inflation
of 170 percent and help Yugoslavia repay its $20 billion foreign
debt.
   Yugoslavia is expected to secure $1.4 billion in new loans from
the IMF, Western governments and banks this year.
   Vecernje Novosti said sales taxes were increased Monday on
carpets, ready to wear clothes, soaps, tires, tractors and coal
stoves.
   The government's austerity program is likely to contribute to a
further decline of Yugoslavs' living standards which have already
fallen by one-third since 1980. Labor unrest is also expected to
grow.

<HEAD>Campaign Will Go On, Jackson Says</HEAD>

   As primary voters went to the polls,
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson reminded Oregon
supporters on Tuesday that he is the only candidate who made a
major effort here.
   ``I campaign amongst you because I do not take you for
granted,'' said Jackson. ``Oregon can make a big decision today to
change the course of America.''
   Jackson campaigned five days in Oregon in an attempt to build
momentum heading into the crucial California primary on June 7.
   Jackson noted the 34th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Brown
vs. Board of Education ruling that desegregated the nation's public
schools but said schools remain segregated economically.
   ``In public schools, 34 years later, some children get $5,000
invested in them and some get $1,600,'' he said. ``There must be
equal access for education. It's legally sound. It's morally right
and it's cost efficient.''
   Jackson repeated his familiar comparison between the cost of
school and the cost of incarceration. He said one year of high
school for a student costs $2,500 in Klamath County, compared with
a $15,000 price tag to house an inmate for a year in the Klamath
County Jail.
   ``Unless we have equal access to education, we have unequal
access to jail,'' he said.
   Jackson was scheduled to meet Wednesday with California leaders
of Jewish groups, with whom his relations remain strained. But the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said Tuesday it would
boycott the closed meeting.
   ``To have it behind closed doors ... just creates more potential
for disharmony between the Jewish community and Jackson than ought
to exist,'' said ADL regional director David A. Lehrer.
   Jackson has been urged to mend fences with the Jewish community,
still rankled by Jackson's 1979 embrace of Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yassar Arafat and his 1984 reference to New
York as ``Hymietown.''
   Jews comprise about 10 percent of the California electorate.

   Two days before his church bus
collided head-on with a pickup truck, driver John Pearman told
relatives ``something felt wrong.''
   Pearman, the Hardin County circuit clerk and assistant pastor at
Radcliff First Assembly of God church, had driven youngsters from
the church to Kings Island amusement park as many as 10 times
before but ``didn't feel right about this one,'' said his uncle,
state Sen. Virgil Pearman.
   ``He didn't want to go,'' the older Pearman said. ``In fact, he
wasn't going to go because he felt funny about it, but then the
person who was going to take his place didn't, and John didn't want
to disappoint anyone, so he went.''
   The fiery collision on Interstate 71 Saturday night killed
Pearman and 26 others, mostly young people from the church who were
returning from the park north of Cincinnati. Authorities charged a
Worthville man with 27 counts of capital murder after tests showed
his blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit.
   Ronald Hockman, minister of the North Hardin Christian Church
and president of the Dove Academy, a school operated by First
Assembly of God, knew Pearman had been trying to find someone else
to drive the bus.
   ``I hadn't heard about any premonitions,'' he said. ``But I do
know he tried real hard to find others to drive the bus. But I
don't know why.''
   Friends remembered Pearman as a likeable role model in church
and at the courthouse.
   ``He was a guy who doesn't come down the road every day,'' said
Bill Faulkner, who served with Pearman for two years as Hardin
County magistrate. ``He was always a real gentleman and a real
class guy.''
   ``I knew him all his life,'' said Allen T. Bell, who served on
the city council for more than 20 years. ``He was a very dedicated,
very enthusiastic, and very good Christian boy growing up. And he
stayed that way.''
   Pearman's family moved to Radcliff shortly after he was born 37
years ago.
   Shortly after high school Pearman joined the Army and served in
Vietnam from 1971 to 1973.
   ``When he came back, he was more seasoned and more mature,''
Bell said. ``He never talked to me about it in detail, but the war
changed his perspective on things. He seemed to know more what he
wanted. And that was to serve others in church and government.''

<HEAD>Final Federal Approval for Greyhound-Trailways Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission gave final
approval Tuesday to the $80 million merger of Greyhound and
Trailways, the nation's two largest bus companies.
   The two bus lines have been operating as a single carrier since
last July when the ICC gave temporary approval to the merger
because Trailways was on the verge of going bankrupt while
operating independently.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. bought its biggest competitor, Trailways
Lines Inc., for $80 million. The deal did not affect 34 small,
regional bus companies around the country that also use the
Trailways name.
   Fred Currey, Greyhound's chairman, called the ICC decision ``a
positive development in Greyhound's efforts to rebuild the
intercity passenger bus business ... and thereby increase
competiton in the travel market.''
   The ICC approved the deal by a 3-2 vote.
   The final merger was likely to be little noticed by bus
travelers.
   George Gravley, a Greyhound spokesman, said the company would
continue to use the Trailways trademark on buses and terminals in
parts of the country where the name is well known.
   ``Obviously, we're delighted (by the decision),'' Gravley said
in an interview from the company's Dallas headquarters. He said
Greyhound had expected final ICC approval since the commission gave
its tentative clearance to the deal last July.
   Together, Greyhound and Trailways carried more than 33 million
passengers last year. The combined company, which has its
headquarters in Dallas, has 3,750 buses and terminals or ticket
agents in 2,500 communities.
   Greyhound had announced in June 1987 that it planned to purchase
Trailways. The ICC granted its temporary approval to the merger two
weeks later after the Justice Department concluded that as an
independent company Trailways had ``virtually no chance of being
restructured as a viable entity.''

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years after the bloodiest
civil uprisings in South Korea's modern history, residents of this
southern city are pressing for a full accounting of the deaths
resulting from government force used against protesters.
   At least 191 people died and more than 800 others were injured
when the government deployed the army to crush a pro-democracy
demonstration in this opposition stronghold in May 1980.
   Now, thousands of people from various parts of the country make
pilgrimages to Kwangju's Mangwoldong Cemetery, where the victims
are buried.
   A mile-long road leading to the cemetery was neatly paved for
this year's anniversary and city authorities installed pay phones
and supplied drinking water for visitors.
   Encouraged by an opposition victory in last month's legislative
elections, many of Kwangju's 800,000 citizens are in a hopeful mood
before the anniversary of the uprising on Wednesday.
   ``I am proud of Kwangju. In the long end, we are beginning to
have some breathing space,'' said Kim Soon-il, a shop owner.
   Kim and many others plan to close their businesses to mark the
day.
   But the mood is marred by clashes between police and thousands
of dissident students, who are staging anti-government protests.
They believe newly elected President Roh Tae-Woo and other top
leaders, who were army generals at the time of the 1980 uprising,
are responsible for the harsh military operations that resulted in
the high casualty toll.
   The dissidents continue to claim that the death toll from 1980
is much higher than the government officially reported and demand
punishement of those responsible for it.
   Roh's government, which succeeded former President Chun
Dooh-hwan on Feb. 25, has promised to begin a month-long review
starting Monday into reports that many victims have not been
accounted for.
   During seven years of rule under Chun, the citizens of Kwangju
were considered political outcasts, whom the regime labeled
``rioter or impure elements.''
   ``We are glad to have our honor back at long last,'' said Lee
Dal-sun, 35, a businessman. ``We need a full accounting of the
incident more than anything else.''
   Roh also has promised to financially help Kwangju victims and
erect a monument dedicated to their ``democratization efforts.''
   ``Financial compensation may be important but more important is
the restoration of honor,'' said Kim Yong-an, 31, who limps from
gunshot wounds in the riots.
   But radical students at Kwangju's state-run Chonam University
say there is no compromise with the Roh government, which they say
is no better than its military-run predecessor.
   ``We should not let down our guards. We must continue fight
against the military dictatorship,'' said a student leader, who
requested anonymity.

Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   4tyagon budget bill
that has become a vehicle for anti-drug proposals and a
condemnation of administration proposals to cut a deal with
Panama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The dispute involves an amendment proposed by Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., which would permit the death penalty for drug dealers
convicted of killing people.
   ``We don't want to be the fly in the ointment'' delaying final
action on the bill, said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   But he said D'Amato and other supporters of the death penalty
plan would not drop their amendment until they were assured it will
be considered at a later date.
   D'Amato complained that because of filibusters threatened by
opponents, ``we've been unable to get a straight vote on whether
the death penalty should be imposed.''
   The two sides were trying to agree on a compromise, but no final
action on the bill will be taken before Wednesday morning, Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Reagan will talk about the drug problem in a commencement address
Wednesday at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., and said
the president wants the nation ``to depoliticize the drug policy
debate.''
   ``I think the president hopes that people will be careful and
realistic in discussions of where we go on the drug effort,''
Fitzwater said. ``Everybody wants to out-drug each other in terms
of political rhetoric.''
   Reagan is ``very frustrated'' with the progress of anti-drug
abuse efforts, the spokesman added.
   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and includes a trio of anti-drug
provisions overwhelmingly added by senators who contend the U.S.
public wants sterner action to halt illegal drug-trafficking.
   Two of the provisions were approved Tuesday in the wake of
reports that the administration was willing to drop
drug-trafficking charges against Noriega if he steps down.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges in Florida, but he has
refused to quit. U.S. economic sanctions have thus far been
ineffective in forcing him out.
   The Senate voted 95-0 approval of an amendment by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., which provides that no U.S. aid be sent to Panama
until Noriega leaves power and until Reagan certifies that no
Soviet or Cuban troops are in the Central American nation.
   Then the Senate passed, 86-10, a resolution offered by Dole
which put the Senate on record as opposing any deal in which U.S.
drug-trafficking charges would be dropped.
   Dole said ``we'd be making a mistake'' by dropping the
indictments. The White House opposed his non-binding resolution, he
told his colleagues.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., agreed with Dole. ``A deal that
would allow this man to escape justice is a deal that stinks,'' he
said.
   The American effort to remove Noriega ``was not merely
ineffective,'' said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., ``I believe they
work against the return of democracy to Panama. The indictments
should be left in place.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said ``the administration has painted itself and our
nation into the corner on this matter.''
   The main anti-drug provision was added last week by the Senate,
which voted 83-6 to give the military a bigger role in stopping the
flow of illegal drugs into the country, including new arrest powers
for Navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug boats on
the high seas.
   Senate passage would send the bill to a House-Senate conference
committee to be reconciled with the Pentagon budget bill passed
last week by the House.
   The House also added an anti-drug provision, but it was more
far-reaching that the Senate bill. The House ordered Reagan to have
the military basically seal off U.S. borders against illegal
drug-trafficking.
   Both bills authorize $299.5 billion for the Pentagon, which
would essentially freeze defense spending for a fourth straight
year after large Pentagon budget increases during Reagan's first
term.
   That was the amount approved by Reagan last December in an
agreement with congressional leaders on a spending package designed
to reduce federal budget deficits. The Pentagon had expected to get
about $333 billion for defense next year.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci achieved the lower defense
budget by ordering cuts of about 34,000 personnel from the
Pentagon's civilian work force, along with retiring a number of
older weapons, including 16 aging Navy frigates.
   One difference to be resolved by the conference committee will
be the question of a pay raise for the nation's 2.1 million
uniformed military personnel. The House proposed a 4 percent
increase, while the Senate measure includes the entire 4.3 percent
hike originally sought by Reagan.
   Another difference involves spending for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, as Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile program is known
formally.
   The House proposed $3.5 billion for Star Wars, while the Senate
bill authorizes $4.6 billion. Reagan had sought $4.8 billion,
compared with the current $3.9 billion SDI budget.

<HEAD>USDA Says Total Feed Grain Production May Increase This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have indicated they intend to plant
fewer total acres of feed grains this spring, but an Agriculture
Department report said Tuesday that total 1988 production may
increase because of greater corn acreage in high-yielding states.
   ``Production of feed grains is forecast at 219 million metric
tons, 2 percent above 1987's 215 million,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said.
   Besides corn, other feed grains include sorghum, oats and
barley. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4
bushels of corn.
   In a related report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said that by mid-May, corn planting had advanced rapidly
to about 88 percent completed in the major producing states,
matching the fast pace of a year ago. Normally, only 66 percent of
the acreage is planted by May 15.

<HEAD>Fired AIDS Victim Complains About Justice Department Actions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS victim fired from his clerk-typist job
at the Justice Department said Tuesday he will turn down a one-year
temporary position offered to him in the wake of publicity about
the incident.
   ``I'm not going to accept. They owe me my job back. They fired
me because I had AIDS,'' Mark Gregory told Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., chairman of the House civil service subcommittee.
   Gregory said he has taken 30 days off since learning last
October that he has AIDS-related complex, a precurser to full-blown
AIDS _ nearly half of the time to participate in a treatment study
at another federal agency, the National Institutes of Health.
   Despite what he called an excellent six-month evaluation early
this year, Gregory was fired April 25 on the grounds that his
absences made him incapable of performing his job.
   The firing came several weeks after the Office of Personnel
Management had instituted a policy saying federal workers with AIDS
had to be treated like those with other serious medical problems
and could not be discriminated against.
   Mrs. Schroeder said ``a newly stated, enlightened policy ...
appears to have been thrown overboard within the first month.'' She
said she was dismayed by the Justice Department action and also by
the department's refusal to testify Tuesday on the grounds of short
notice and the press of other business.
   ``We will not let this go,'' she said. ``We want to make sure
that federal policy is leading the way and not catching up.''
   Mrs. Schroeder said she will hold another hearing June 2 and
expects the Justice Department to testify unless the controversy is
resolved to Gregory's satisfaction before then.
   The Justice Department offered Gregory the temporary post on
Monday, five days after The Washington Post published an article
describing the incident.
   But Gregory said he would have no protection in a temporary job.
``They could a week later say ... we don't need you anymore,'' he
said.
   He also said the temporary job was in the same office as his old
job, where he said a supervisor had violated his confidentiality
and word of his disease had spread among co-workers.
   ``That would be an impossible situation,'' Gregory said. ``They
are insensitive to AIDS. I doubt very seriously they've made any
educational effort since the day I was fired. I don't know how
people could change their attitudes that fast.''
   Gregory said he took two weeks off immediately following his
diagnosis at the suggestion of a supervisor who told him to ``get
my act together.'' He said another six days were devoted to
doctor's appointments and dealing with his roommate's illness and
death from AIDS shortly before Gregory was fired.
   Gregory said he took the rest of the time, 14 days, to
participate in an NIH study recommended by his doctor. He did it
even though his advance request for leave, accompanied by a copy of
the NIH study plan and his own consent form, was never granted. The
reason given, he said, was insufficient documentation.
   ``I decided it was more important to save my life than to deal
with them,'' Gregory said. ``It was like they were trying to
interfere with something that was going to save a lot of people's
lives.''
   Gregory said he knew of one other federal worker with AIDS _ a
man who eventually went blind from it. His supervisors at the Labor
Department ``went so far as to hire a reader for him,'' Gregory
said. ``He worked for a long time.''
   Gregory is losing his health insurance as a result of the
firing. However, he said much of his experimental treatment at NIH
is free and as an Air Force veteran, he is eligible for VA benefits.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   As of May 2, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 60,852 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 34,088 have died since June 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.

   Elite security forces closed in on Sikh
extremists in the Golden Temple complex Tuesday, capturing two
towers and a dining hall that adjoin the inner sanctum of Sikhism's
holiest site, police said.
   Sikh gunmen had used the minarets as vantage points to fire at
police and paramilitary troops who besieged the temple complex May
9.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, attacks by Sikh extremists killed 15 people
in 24 hours, the United News of India reported. That followed 44
killings late Sunday and Monday, the highest total in a 24-hour
span since militants began a terrorist campaign for a separate Sikh
nation in 1982.
   K.P.S. Gill, chief of the Punjab state police, said the towers
overlooking the gold-domed temple were taken Tuesday evening but
``operations still are continuing in the basement connecting the
towers.''
   He said about 90 men of the ``Black Cat'' commandos penetrated
the two-level basement, firing gas bombs and incendiary shells to
force out the extremists.
   Dense clouds of smoke billowed from holes at the tops of the
towers. About six militants were believed still in the basement,
which the militants had made into a major fortification.
   The body of a Sikh militant was recovered from the first floor
of one of the towers, Gill said, and police expected to find more.
Authorities have reported 36 people slain in the siege, most of
them Sikh militants.
   At least 1,023 people have been killed in Punjab this year. The
killings prompted the siege of the Golden Temple, which is used as
a refuge by extremists.
   Tuesday's commando raid was the first major penetration of the
temple complex. The minarets are attached to the dining hall on the
eastern flank of the pool surrounding the gold-domed inner sanctum.
   A senior police official said security forces were keeping a
vigil around the Golden Temple with searchlights. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Gill said police had recovered nine guns, including four
Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles and a machine gun and more than
1,000 rounds of ammunition in the complex.
   He said they also found literature about Khalistan, the Sikh
nation the extremists want to inaugurate in this rich northern
agricultural state.
   Police said about 60 radicals still were believed to be in
various parts of the complex. Some were believed to be inside the
clock tower over the main northern entrance and about 10 were
thought to be in the Akal Takht, seat of Sikhism's spiritual and
temporal power.
   The Akal Takht building faces the gold-domed inner sanctum on
the western side.
   According to police, the militants have large stocks of food and
ammunition in the compound. An officer of the paramilitary National
Security Guard said police had been firing incendiary shells at
buildings believed to hold food.
   Officials called a called a cease-fire at 7 a.m. Tuesday and
urged the Sikhs to surrender, but militants in the temple used the
lull to replenish their supplies.
   Two Sikh fighters ran from the temple with their hands in the
air, as if to surrender, then darted into a nearby building and
moved several sacks to the temple walkway.
   On Sunday, 146 people surrendered to security forces. Some of
them, relatives of Sikh militants, appealed through loudspeakers
for the men to surrender.
   Police generally don't enter places of worship in India, for
fear of stirring religious outrage.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered an army raid on the Golden
Temple on June 1-4, 1984, in which more than 1,200 people were
killed. She was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards on Oct. 31 of that
year.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 800 million people and claim
discrimination by Hindus, who account for 82 percent.

<HEAD>Americans Change Eating Habits, But Sometimes Erratically</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mix of foods consumed by Americans has
changed dramatically since 1970, but some of those changes have
been inconsistent, an Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   Of all the meat consumed in 1986, two-thirds was red meat,
mostly beef, pork and lamb, compared with three-fourths in the
early 1970s.
   ``Instead, we ate more poultry, fish grains and cereal
products,'' the report said. `` We also cut back on whole milk,
while consuming more low-fat milk and yogurt. Fresh fruit and
vegetable consumption rose as well.''
   But the report added: ``While there was a general shift toward
foods perceived as low in fat or calories, our cheese consumption
increased during the period. In addition, consumption rose for fats
and oils, frozen potatoes, and corn sweeteners and soft drinks.''
   And families ate fewer eggs and fresh potatoes and drank less
coffee during the 16-year period.
   Overall, the changes in consumer habits were attributed to
higher incomes, new food production and marketing techniques, and
changes in lifestyles.
   Consumption of red meat declined, but poultry more than took up
the slack. Total meat consumption, which includes poultry,
gradually crept higher.
   The report was prepared by a team in the department's Economic
Research Service and was included in the agency's quarterly
National Food Review.
   In the early 1970s, the report said, Americans ate an average of
151 pounds of red meat annually on a per capita basis, and about 49
pounds of poultry. In 1986, red meat dropped to 140 pounds while
poultry averaged 72 pounds.
   ``Poultry's rise stemmed largely from retail prices that
remained well below those for red meats, primarily because of
savings passed on from the farm and processing levels,'' the report
said. ``As a result, poultry was used to a greater extent in frozen
entrees and convenience foods than red meats were.''
   But poultry's price advantage was not the only factor that
affected consumers. Cut-up birds and heavily advertised brand name
items such as those of Holly Farms, Perdue, Louis Rich and Tysons
Foods gained popularity.
   Pan-ready or precooked items, along with upscale raw products
such as boneless breast fillets, also attracted consumers.
Processors began offering chicken and turkey franks, turkey
breakfast sausages, and turkey ham and salami in an effort cater to
consumer concerns about fat.
   ``Other food processors and retailers joined the move toward
value-added items,'' the report said. ``Dairy processors introduced
fresh and microwave pizzas, a variety of flavored and textured
yogurts, Mexican-flavored cheeses, fruit and onion-flavored cream
cheeses, upscale frozen dairy products and ready-to-make quiche
mixtures.''
   Frozen vegetable processors developed new combinations, sauce
selections and single-serving products in microwave containers. And
supermarkets now have a wider variety of fresh produce than they
had in the 1970s, and have become more convenenience oriented with
salad bars and soup kettles.

   Madison Avenue spoke to the socialist masses on
Tuesday night, with Soviet TV showing commercials that featured
bottles of Pepsi-Cola popping their tops to the riffs of rock music.
   Sony TV sets and Visa credit cards also flashed across the
screens to millions of viewers during the late-evening premiere of
a five-part series on life in the United States.
   They were the first paid commercials on staid, state-run Soviet
TV, and they came in advance of President Reagan visit to Moscow
later this month.
   Each company had one brief advertisement on the hour-long
program, which featured commentator Vladimir Posner interviewing a
panel of Americans in Seattle about life in the United States.
   The ads broke clumsily without explanation into the show, titled
``Posner in America.''
   Pepsi's ad showed a group of young people looking for a way to
open several bottles of Pepsi, a drink that has been available in
the Soviet Union for almost 30 years. When no bottle opener
appeared, a red-headed guitarist pops them open with long riff from
his guitar and the screen proclaimed in Russian: ``The new
generation chooses Pepsi.''
   Sony and Visa got their chance around midnight Moscow time,
about five minutes before the program ended.
   Visa showed athletes preparing for the Summer Olympics in Seoul,
South Korea, and told viewers its credit card was good in any
country in the world. Sony promoted the quality of its electronics
products.
   But Sony electronics products and Visa cards aren't available to
the average Soviet consumer.
   ``I expect we might get some angry letters from people saying,
`Why are you advertising Sony TVs when we can't buy any,''' Posner
had said earlier this month at a news conference announcing his
series.
   The colorful, fast-paced commercials contrast sharply with most
programming on Soviet television. Two of Pepsi's commercials to be
shown during the week feature pop star Michael Jackson, who is
well-known to Soviet youth from music videos shown occasionally on
TV here and recordings that circulate unofficially.
   One commercial has Jackson dancing and singing his hit song
``Bad.'' Another ends with a shot of U.S. and Soviet flags
accompanied by Pepsi labels in Russian and English.
   Posner said the commercials aren't being shown on Soviet TV for
consumer sales _ at least not right away.
   ``We on our part can make some money out of this, which in our
day and age when we are becoming economically self-supportive and
self-sufficient, also makes sense,'' Posner said.
   Interest in America is particularly high among Soviets since
Reagan arrives May 29 for a summit with Kremlin chief Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   In the West, commercials try to get consumers to buy one
company's product over a competitor's, but in the Soviet Union,
there's no need to stimulate demand because consumer goods are in
short supply, Posner said.
   Officials refused to disclose how much money the advertisers
were paying for air time, but reports in the United States said the
Soviet broadcast agency Gostelradio received $10,000 for each
30-second ad.
   ``Certainly it's not competition. It's more establishing an
image,'' said Edward Wierzbowski, vice president of Global American
Televison Inc., a company based in Colrain, Mass., that deals in
American-Soviet television productions.
   Soviet TV already features infrequent home-made commercials that
advertise shoes, short-wave radios and personal stereos, but the
products they pitch aren't always available.
   Posner, who frequently appears as a Soviet spokesman on U.S.
television, said the purpose of Soviet-produced commercials are
``more informing than pushing a product.''
   Posner predicted foreign television sets might become available
in the Soviet Union. Later this year, Visa International plans to
issue credit cards through a Soviet organization to Soviets who
travel abroad and foreigners living in the Soviet Union.
   Western commercials have been seen previously on Soviet
television during ``space bridges'' _ international satellite
television programs involving discussions between Americans and
Soviets _ but the advertisers did not pay Soviet television for
that air time.
   Posner said his program's audience was expected to be about 120
million people.

   President Reagan, discussing two of his most
persistent problems, said Tuesday that he retains ``complete
confidence'' in Attorney General Edwin Meese III and declined
comment on reports he was offering to drop drug charges against
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Asked whether he believed in astrology, Reagan said, ``I don't
guide my life by it.`` But he said he could not say whether it was
valid. ``I don't know enough about it,'' he added.
   Reagan opened his news conference with a statement hailing the
agreement to start Senate debate on the U.S.-Soviet arms treaty and
the March trade figures, which showed a dramatic drop in the
monthly deficit in the balance of exports and imports.
   Most of the questions during the brief session concerned Noriega.
   ``We are in the midst of real negotiations,'' said Reagan,
referring to discussions the administration hopes will lead to
Noriega's relinquishing power. ``I can't comment further on this.''
   There have been persistent reports that the administration has
offered to drop drug charges against Noriega in exchange for his
leaving the country at least until after elections are held.
   Reagan said much of what has been written about the negotiations
has been ``based on some kind of leaks or misinformation, because
there are no facts to sustain it.''
   On Meese, the president said, ``I have complete confidence in
him.''
   As for the firing of Terry Eastland, the Justice Department
spokesman who has been defended by conservatives, the president
said there may be ``more than meets the eye.''
   He did not elaborate on that statement except to tell reporters
they should ``talk to the atttorney genenral about that.''
   Reagan also dismissed reports that he and his wife, Nancy, have
considered astrological signs in determining his schedule.
   ``Nothing of that kind was ever going on,'' he said.
   ``It didn't happen that way at all,'' Reagan said of allegations
by his former chief of staff Donald Regan that an astrologer
influences decisions on presidential scheduling.
   Reagan, who leaves next week for a summit in Moscow with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said he was confident that the Senate
would ratify the INF treaty, which he described as a ``diplomatic
milestone.''
   The agreement would eliminate U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear missiles from Europe.
   On trade, the president called the $4.1 billion drop in the
nation's trade deficit ``good news, the best news on this front
since March of 1985.''
   He cited the improved trade figures as evidence that restrictive
trade legislation recently passed by the Democratic-controlled
Congress was not needed.
   He said he expected to act on that legislation ``within a couple
of days.'' Reagan is expected to veto the bill.

<HEAD>U.N. Food Aid To Refugee Camp May Have Gone to Guerrillas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A refugee camp in Thailand administered
by the communist Khmer Rouge may have diverted U.N. food deliveries
to guerrillas while blocking efforts to monitor how the aid was
used, sources said Tuesday.
   The U.N. Border Relief Operation halted food deliveries starting
May 1 to Huay Chan, a Cambodian camp of about 9,000 people in the
eastern province of Sisaket, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A U.N. source in New York, who is familiar with Huay Chan and
asked not to be identified, said the camp operators were violating
a cardinal principle involved in food aid: that the delivery must
be monitored and the U.N. agency must know that it has not been
misued.
   ``That principle has not been assured in that camp, and at
several other camps for some time,'' he said.
   Camp authorities had been given warnings about the monitoring
problems and told that they risked a cut-off in aid, he said.
   He said that the camp appeared to have another, independent
source of food, which could make the U.N. food surplus for
diversion.
   They said the France-based Operation Handicap International, the
only other aid group working in the camp, pulled out at the same
time in coordination with the United Nations agency.
   The sources said the main concern in Khmer Rouge camps was
diversion of food from civilians to guerrillas. The camps, all
located near the Cambodian border, are believed to play some role
in military infiltration into Cambodia.
   The agency has struggled for years to improve monitoring and
delivery of medical and other services to camps run by the Khmer
Rouge, the main guerrilla group fighting Vietnamese forces
occupying Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge massacred millions of Cambodians when they ruled
the country from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978.
   Some officials say the Khmer Rouge keeps civilians in its camps
in Thailand as virtual prisoners. There have been reports of people
dying of illness after camp authorities refused to allow their
evacuation to an outside hospital.
   The only Khmer Rouge camp where access by aid officials hasn't
been a significant problem is Site 8, a showcase-type camp housing
33,000 people in Prachinburi province south of Sisaket.
   The other two guerrilla groups opposing the Vietnamese
occupation _ the non-communist forces of Son Sann and Prince
Norodom Sihanouk _ allow free access to their civilian camps along
the border. About 300,000 Cambodians live in border camps.
   The U.N. agency earlier threatened to halt aid to four
``closed'' Khmer Rouge camps unless access was improved. The
sources said that during the past year, improvements were made at
Natrao, Bo Rai and Ta Luan camps, where the agency finally was able
to post camp officers and send regular medical teams. These camps
house more than 30,000 people.
   Authorities at Huay Chan resisted, however, and did little more
than allow relief officials on occasional escorted tours of the
camp, the sources said.
   ``Huay Chan was not the only Khmer Rouge camp where (access) was
a problem but it was most flagrant in denying access,'' one source
said. ``Their basic attitude was: you leave the supplies at the
gate of the camp and we'll distribute them.''
   Aid won't be resumed until access is improved, but the sources
said Huay Chan's administration has not reacted to the cut-off of
food.
   The U.N. agency had been giving to Huay Chan a little less than
a pound of rice per person daily and other foodstuffs. It was not
clear where alternative sources of food would come from, but the
Khmer Rouge is known to get substantial aid from China, Thailand
and other countries. The refugees raise vegetables and chickens in
Huay Chan, the sources said.

<HEAD>Army Investigating Problems With Beretta Handguns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army stopped accepting deliveries of its
new 9mm Beretta handgun last November because of unexpected
cracking in the frame and is now investigating a second problem
involving the gun's slide mechanism, the service said Tuesday.
   Beretta USA, a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker Armi Beretta
SpA, has submitted a plan to deal with the cracking problem and the
Army expects to resume accepting deliveries next month, said Paul
Powell, a spokesman for the Army's Armament, Munitions and Chemical
Command.
   In the meantime, though, the Army has been forced to start a new
test program to determine why two slide bolts on M-9 Berettas
cracked while being fired, throwing shards of metal back into the
chests of the shooters. A similar incident occurred with a
non-military Beretta made for commercial sale that was being tested
by the Navy.
   No one was injured in the three incidents, which occurred late
last year and in February, Powell said.
   ``But we don't like the fact that if a slide ever did break it
could go back and whack a guy in the face,'' said Col. Richard
Williams, the Army manager for the Beretta program.
   The problems with the handgun contract were first disclosed this
week by the trade publication ``Defense Week'' and subsequently
confirmed by Army officials.
   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,
Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide
9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45. The Army,
serving as the executive buying agent for all the services, awarded
Beretta an initial contract worth $75 million for 316,000 pistols.
   According to Powell, 109,000 guns had been delivered before the
delivery suspension in November. All told, the spokesman said
Beretta would fall about 36,000 pistols behind in its deliveries
before shipments resume in June.
   Beretta is about to face a new, congressionally ordered
competition with the Massachusetts gunmaker Smith & Wesson and any
other interested arms maker for the next 9mm gun contract. Powell
declined to discuss how the production problems might affect
Beretta's chances.
   The Army said the first problem with the Beretta surfaced in
November when quality-control testers discovered the pistols could
develop hairline cracks on part of the frame. The problem was
considered minor and posed no danger to soldiers firing the gun,
but the Army had made it clear earlier it would not tolerate any
cracking and insisted the problem be fixed, Powell said.
   The second problem involving the slide bolt _ which is thrown
backward after a shot is fired as part of the process of chambering
a new round _ materialized during Navy and Army tests after the
delivery suspension began.
   Beretta maintains that the slide failures occurred only after
special ammunition was fired.
   ``U.S. government engineers and technicians have extensively
examined the metallurgy, dimensions and manufacturing of the pistol
and can find nothing which indicates that the cause of the breakage
lies with the weapon,'' the company said in a statement.
   Powell disputed that statement in part, saying the Army had not
concluded that special ammunition caused the problem.
   ``We are still running tests to determine the cause of this
problem,'' the spokesman said. ``We're not prepared to say it's the
ammunition. It could be a design flaw, ammunition, the
manufacturing process or misuse of the weapon. We don't know yet.''
   In the meantime, the Navy has suspended all firearms training
with the new Beretta and the Army has ordered the slides on its
guns be replaced after every 3,000 rounds fired.
   The slide on one of the military-issue guns that failed did so
after 4,500 rounds had been fired and the other after 6,007 rounds.
The commercial Beretta failed after 30,000 rounds, Powell said.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told Iran's
leaders Tuesday to patch up their differences now that
parliamentary elections are over.
   The elections strengthened the hand of economic radicals with
whom the 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch has appeared to side
recently.
   They seek land reform, price controls and a minimum wage.
Opposing them are conservatives backed by the ``bazaaris,'' or
merchant class.
   A report Monday in the French newspaper Le Monde said nine
people were killed in the central province of Isfahan during
election violence between conservatives and Revolutionary Guards, a
radical organization with personal loyalty to Khomeini.
   Speaking at the end of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan,
Khomeini also wished death upon President Reagan and Saddam
Hussein, the president of Iraq, with which Iran has been at war
since September 1980.
   His remarks to a gathering at his home in north Tehran were
broadcast by state radio and television. Khomeini said in reference
to elections for the Majlis, the Iranian parliament:
   ``A Majlis without diversity of views is an imperfect Majlis ..
. but the outcome should not result in dividing us into two hostile
groups.''
   He said there were attempts to ``create discord,'' which he did
not describe, but ``thanks to God, they did not succeed.''
   In what appeared to be his first public reference to a division
between radical and conservative thinking, Khomeini said:
   ``There are not two fronts. Of course, there are two ways of
thinking and it should be so. There are two opinions, and there
should be different tastes and views. But different tastes do not
mean the people should not be on good terms with each other.''
   The first round of elections for the 270-seat parliament was
held April 8 and the second last Friday. Although little detailed
information was available from the latest round, results favored
the radicals.
   President Ali Khamenei told the gathering:
   ``During the elections there were some harsh words said between
certain candidates, or their followers. Now that, thank God, the
elections have been successfully completed, these arguments should
end too.''
   Le Monde said a conservative religious leader in Isfahan
province, Hojatoleslam Ahmadi, resigned during the election
campaign as prayer leader of the mosque in the town of
Khomeinishahr to protest ``certain electoral methods'' used by the
Interior Ministry.
   His resignation prompted violent protests by his supporters in
the town, which were suppressed by Revolutionary Guards, the paper
reported. Le Monde said three people were killed and several
arrested, including Ahmadi.
   He was imprisoned in the city of Isfahan, 12 miles away.
Supporters demonstrated there for his release and some reports said
six more people were killed, according to Le Monde.
   It said radicals won the elections in the Isfahan area and that
made the conflict worse.
   Khomeini said Tuesday the best prayer for President Reagan and
Hussein, the president of Iraq, ``is to wish them to die.''
   ``This is for their benefit,'' he said, ``whereas if you want to
curse them you'd better wish them a long life. The more they stay
alive, the worse their situation will become and their hell will
become hotter. Therefore if you wish them death, they will die
quicker and avoid the hotter hell.''

   The Senate Small Business Committee on
Thursday approved legislation designed to strengthen the federal
government's program of fostering businesses owned by women and
members of minority groups.
   The committee also approved a fiscal 1989 reauthorization of
Small Business Administration programs at approximately the same
spending level as this year, some $5.3 billion.
   The minority businesses aid program, under Section 8 (a) of the
Small Business Act, has come under sharp criticism and public
scrutiny because of the Wedtech case and other scandals, although
it also has had its successes.
   Under the program, created in 1968, certain government
procurement contracts are set aside for companies owned and
controlled by women and members of minority groups who are both
socially and economically disadvantaged. Since there is no
competitive bidding, the process has been viewed by critics as
particularly vulnerable to abuse.
   Companies can participate for five years but could receive a
two-year extension.
   The Senate measure calls for an eight-year fixed program term,
with no provision for extensions. A companion House bill provides
for a nine-year term.
   The voice-vote approval of the bill came after Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., proposed an amendment, and then withdrew it, to
provide for a 10-year program. Then, the committee accepted her
amendment calling for a study of the program.
   The committee-approved measure also requires that participating
concerns show that 30 percent of their business comes from
competitive contracts outside the program after five years to be
eligible for new contracts in the sixth year. The percentage
remains the same in year six, but increases to 50 percent for the
seventh and eighth years of participation.
   The House version also calls for a varying mix of competitive
contracts but recommends that they be goals and not requirements.
   Ms. Milkulski unsuccessfully proposed that the Senate bill be
changed from ``requirements'' to ``goals.''
   ``We don't want to create `contract junkies,' but we're putting
the burden on small business when it should be put on the SBA,
which has administered the program in a arbitrary and confusing
way,'' she said.
   A staff study showed that 30 percent of the business fail after
they leave the program.
   Similar to the House legislation, the measure provides that
contracts can be terminated by the government if the business is
transferred or sold during the initial year of performance.
   The committee also approved several amendments sponsored by Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., as an outgrowth of the Wedtech case, requiring
unconditional ownership and a yearly certification of ownership.
   The Wedtech Corp., a Bronx, N.Y., military contractor founded by
a businessman born in Puerto Rico, benefited from the federal
program. In four years, it was awarded more than $250 million in
military contracts in which there was no bidding.
   Wedtech, which has filed for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy law, has been the subject of at least five state and
federal criminal investigations.
   There have been allegations that its executives bribed federal
officials and conspired to obtain government contracts through
fraud and misrepresentations.

   Relatives and friends of the Navy seamen
killed during last year's attack on the USS Stark gathered at
Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday to commemorate what one
mother called ``unnecessary'' deaths.
   ``I don't feel he should have been there or any of them should
have been there and I don't feel they should be there now.'' a
tearful Kathleen Ciletta of Philadelphia said of the deaths of her
son, John A. Ciletta Jr., and his 36 shipmates last May 17. ``It
was very unnecessary.''
   Although Mrs. Ciletta said it was important that the memory of
her son be kept alive in memorial services, she still had ``a lot
of anger'' in her heart.
   ``Anger toward the whole situation because I feel like he was
killed for all the wrong reasons,'' she said while clutching a
miniature replica of the ``Lone Soldier'' statue, presented to her
by Rear Adm. William Thompson, president of the Naval Memorial
Foundation.
   During the service Vice Adm. John W. Nyquist, assistant chief of
naval operations for surface warfare, praised the slain seamen as
examples of the ``selfless dedication and indomitable spirit of
courage and patriotism of the men and women of the armed services.''
   ``We share a special and timeless bond _ a bond that only
sailors and their families know,'' Nyquist said. ``It is a bond so
great that nothing can undo it, not even death.''
   The Stark, one of several U.S. ships stationed in the Persian
Gulf to escort tankers and other vessels with American registry,
was attacked by an Iraqi jet presumed to be ``friendly.''
   No effort was made to warn the plane away until it was too late
and the fighter had fired two Exocet missiles. The second missile
nearly sank the ship.
   A Navy board of inquiry concluded the Stark's officers should
have prevented the tragedy by warning away the Iraqi aircraft.
   Since the Stark tragedy, the Navy's rules of engagement in the
gulf have been changed to allow ship commanders to open fire on any
plane or vessel that comes close enough to fire upon their ship.
   ``If the policy one year ago today was what it is today, I
wouldn't be here today. Neither would my son,'' Mrs. Ciletta said.
``Like I said, it was a little too late for my boy.''
   The Ciletta family was chosen to represent the families of the
Stark crewmen in the memorial service, said Carmella LaSpada, head
of No Great Love, the sponsor of the program.
   No Greater Love is a non-profit support group for families of
POWs, MIAs, hostage and terrorist victims.
   Following the wreath-laying ceremony, Mrs. Ciletta planted a
kiss on her son's tombstone.
   ``He had just turned 21 when he was killed,'' she said of her
only son. ``He turned 22 last week.''

<HEAD>Vehicles Seized in Drug Crackdown</HEAD>

   Customs officials seized 136 vehicles and
arrested 82 people, mostly Americans returning from Canada, in the
first 40 days of the ``zero tolerance'' drug crackdown, a spokesman
said.
   ``Some of them can't believe that you're actually going to seize
their vehicle and place them under arrest,'' Mike Jordan, customs
inspector in Detroit said Monday. ``To them, it's always just been
just another trip over a bridge.''
   Previously, when inspectors found small amounts of a drug, the
suspect was fined up to $600 and allowed to drive away. Under the
Zero Tolerance program, inspectors automatically seize vehicles if
any quantity of a drug is found.
   The vehicles were seized in the Detroit district, including the
Sault Ste. Marie and Port Huron areas, he said.
   Nationally, 27 boats and 700 vehicles have been seized since
April 11, officials said.
   The program received national attention with recent seizures of
the yachts Monkey Business and Ark Royal after small amounts of
marijuana were found on them. Monkey Business is the charter yacht
that once ferried presidential contender Gary Hart and model Donna
Rice.
   Jordan said about 75 percent of the suspects arrested at
Michigan border crossings have been U.S. citizens returning from
Canada, and marijuana and hashish have been the drugs most often
found.
   Terence Heverin, U.S. Customs Director of Inspection and Control
for the Detroit District, said Tuesday he doesn't know how many of
the vehicles have been returned because that is up to the federal
court, where people cited at the border are ordered to appear.
   But he said few of the people are jailed.
   The amount of drugs seized April 1 to May 10 range from a trace
amount of hashish and a pipe, to four grams of marijuana found in
an 18-wheeler, Jordan said.
   ``We have internal guidelines on the amounts of substances we're
looking for, but basically it is in the personal use quantities,''
Heverin said.

   Many of the nation's leading publishers have
joined the fight against AIDS with a community action book
featuring advice from celebrities, politicians and a Vermont high
school class, organizers said Tuesday.
   The 126-page paperback, ``You Can Do Something About AIDS,'' was
created with the time, money and know-how of more than two dozen
publishing concerns.
   It will be given away at bookstores around the country beginning
June 1 _ about a week after the U.S. government is to start mailing
explicit brochures about acquired immune deficiency syndrome to 107
million households.
   ``This is the `Live Aid' or the `Farm Aid' of the publishing
industry,'' said Sasha Alyson, founder of Alyson Publications in
Boston and the project coordinator. ``It's a massive effort to
raise the public's consciousness about this terrible disease by
showing people exactly what they can do to fight it.''
   The authors include Elizabeth Taylor; U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop; U.S. Sen. Lowell Weicker Jr., R-Conn.; Abigail Van
Buren; Whoopi Goldberg; actor and writer Harvey Fierstein; Greg
Louganis, Olympic gold medalist diver; and former White House Press
Secretary Jody Powell.
   ``This book will help provide concrete examples of what anyone
can do to make a contribution in the fight against AIDS,'' Taylor
writes in the introduction.
   The authors tell how to educate children, parents and friends
about AIDS and protect oneself from it; volunteer for AIDS-related
activities; write letters to elected officials; and change bigoted
attitudes about the fatal disease.
   ``If you're housebound, you could offer baby-sitting help for a
volunteer who's providing other services,'' suggests Goldberg.
   ``An AIDS benefit show need be no more than a local talent
showcase,'' writes Fierstein. ``What's important is the concern,
not the content.''
   ``Explaining does not mean condoning,'' advises Dear Abby.
``Children become sexually active earlier today than they did even
20 years ago. Parents will never reverse that trend by keeping
children ignorant.''
   ``Working on the AIDS issue at our school meant breaking a
barrier,'' writes a social studies class taught by Jeff Lavin at
Springfield High School in Vermont. ``AIDS _ and more particularly,
homosexuality _ had always been a subject no one was willing to
talk about in the classroom.''
   The students suggest other classes enlist guest speakers _
including an AIDS patient, preferably from the audience's own age
group.
   ``Some students, teachers or parents may spread fears that
letting a person with AIDS come into the school is dangerous.
Address and rebut that kind of hysteria directly,'' they write.
   The Book-of-the Month Club and Ingram Book Co. published an
initial run of 300,000 copies. An additional 150,000 copies are due
around June 6, with a third printing later in June, said project
spokeswoman Annik La Farge.
   More than 20 members of Congress have endorsed the project, she
said.
   Alyson estimated donations for the first printing at about
$200,000 in cash, materials and services such as writing, printing,
distribution, marketing and publicity.

   The driver of a converted school
bus reportedly told passengers there was something wrong with the
vehicle just before it crashed at the bottom of a hill, killing
three people and injuring 20, authorities said Tuesday.
   State police Sgt. Dennis Cody said investigators are trying to
determine whether mechanical failure or high speed contributed to
Monday afternoon's accident.
   Eight people, including driver Lewis Taylor, were still
hospitalized Tuesday, hospital officials said. Taylor was in
serious condition, suffering from head injuries, cuts and broken
bones.
   The bus, carrying a group of mentally handicapped people, was
traveling down a steep hill and failed to make a sharp right turn
at an intersection, Cody said. It hit a utility pole, tipped over
on its right side and came to rest 30 feet from the road and a few
feet from Little Wappingers Creek.
   When asked about reports that Taylor had spoken of a mechanical
problem, Cody said, ``We are aware of statements made by people at
the (accident) scene and on the bus that the driver made a
statement like that prior to the accident.''
   Taylor reportedly repeated his assertions to witnesses at the
crash site, but Cody refused to say what the problem was. Police
said no charges have been filed.
   Except for Taylor and a bus attendant, all the passengers were
mentally handicapped people working for Rehabilitation Programs
Inc. of the Town of Poughkeepsie. They were being driven home when
the accident happened, Cody said.
   Chris Scott, who lives nearby, said he had seen many accidents
at the turn in the past five years and described it as
``outrageously sharp.''
   A state police accident reconstruction expert is expected to
take at least five days before releasing a report on the accident,
Cody said.
   Three passengers were in critical condition Tuesday, while one
listed in serious condition and three in stable condition,
according to officials at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie and
the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.
   The bus was owned by Laidlaw Transit, headquartered in Van Nuys,
Calif. Tayler, 44, has worked for Laidlaw for 2{ years. Clinton
Corners is about 60 miles north of New York City.

   A suspicious storeroom fire forced the
evacuation of Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship department store
Tuesday, officials said.
   The fire occurred one day short of the one-year anniversary of a
fire that forced the evacuation of the store. Saks spokeswoman
Susan Stern said investigators and store officials ``haven't made a
connection yet. It could be a coincidence.''
   The fire in a fifth-floor stockroom was put out quickly by two
ceiling sprinklers and a nearby hose, fire spokesman John Mulligan
said. There were no injuries, and Ms. Stern said damage was limited
to some sportswear.
   Another department spokesman, Efrain Parilla, said the fire was
labeled suspicious because the storeroom was not considered prone
to fire.
   Dozens of people were evacuated.
   On May 18, 1987, a smoky fire in an empty brownstone building
next to Saks forced the evacuation of the department store and
caused four minor injuries. Mulligan said he did not know the
outcome of an investigation into the cause of that blaze.

   Government opponents on Tuesday
denounced warnings given to broadcasters to exercise restraint and
the opposition newspaper La Prensa declared: ``The Muzzle Law
Returns.''
   But the broadcasters appeared undaunted by the threats of
sanctions and continued Tuesday to criticize the leftist government.
   The Interior Ministry summoned directors of eight private radio
news programs Saturday and cautioned them to be careful in reports
about military recruitment, the economy and government. A vaguely
worded communications law provides for sanctions as severe as
closing the stations.
   Critics said the action was a backward step in the process of
democratic reform.
   The government began to lift press restrictions last fall as
part of its compliance with a peace plan signed by the presidents
of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras on
Aug. 7.
   La Prensa, which had been closed for 15 months, was permitted to
reopen in October. Several news programs that had been barred were
allowed back on the air.
   News media were censored under the state of emergency law
enacted in 1982. That law was revoked last January in compliance
with the peace plan.
   In an editorial Monday, La Prensa said, ``The Sandinista regime
imposes censorship restrictions on the broadcasters because it
doesn't want freedom of expression.''
   The newspaper has said some of its reporters have been harassed
by the Sandinistas, but the government has not clamped down on its
editorial policy.
   Radio Corporacion on Tuesday quoted the head of the
non-governmental human rights commission, Lino Hernandez, as saying
the communications law was ``absolutely a violation of human
rights.''
   In a report Tuesday on the economy, Radio Noticias said the
black market rate for dollars was rising, government measures were
causing unemployment and the state-run oil company is an ``organism
without authority.''
   Radio Catolica said Tuesday the Social Christian Party condemned
the media restrictions and sent a letter of protest to President
Daniel Ortega.
   Radio Mundial, in a commentary Tuesday, said: ``The liberals,
having suspended the state of emergency, substituted it with
another system based on the application of the law of security and
maintenance of public order.''

<HEAD>Reagan Won't Say If He'd Drop Charges Against Noriega; Stands By
Meese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan refused to say Tuesday
whether he had approved the dropping of drug charges against
Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, and defended embattled
Attorney General Edwin Meese, saying his longtime friend would live
``under this cloud'' if he resigned.
   Reagan said he had ``complete confidence'' in Meese, whose
Justice Department has been rocked by unrest and resignations and
who is the target of criminal investigations of his affairs.
   At a brief news conference, the president also said, ``I don't
guide my life'' by astrology but he did not disavow believing in it.
   Reagan said no changes were ever made in his schedule because of
astrological forecasts, as former White House chief of staff Donald
T. Regan has claimed.
   ``We made no decisions on it and we're not binding our lives to
this,'' Reagan said. ``And I don't mean to offend anyone who does
believe in it, or engages in it seriously,'' Regan added.
   Asked if he believed in astrology, Reagan paused a long moment,
and said, ``I don't guide my life by it, but I won't answer the
question the other way because I don't know enough about it to say,
is there something to it.''
   Questions about Noriega and Meese dominated the nationally
broadcast question-and-answer session in the White House briefing
room. It was his most extensive meeting with the press since a news
conference Feb. 24.
   There have been numerous reports that Reagan has offered to drop
drug-trafficking charges against Noriega if he would leave Panama
at least until after elections are held.
   ``We are in the midst of real negotiations. I can't comment
further on this,'' Reagan said. Repeatedly, he said he would not
reveal what the United States was offering Noriega while the
negotiations were continuing, but promised to make ``a full
statement'' to the public ``at the appropriate time.''
   However, Reagan said much of what has been written about the
negotiations had been ``based on some kind of leaks or
misinformation, because there are no facts to sustain it.''
   In refusing to discuss the negotiations, Reagan said, ``It would
be foolish to do so. Some things you have to keep to yourself when
you're arguing with someone else. ...
   ``There has been no decision made on some of the things that are
being discussed,'' he added.
   ``You're asking me to lead into what's being talked about and I
can only tell you that we're not going to whitewash anyone,'' he
said.
   Reagan also defended the administration against allegations that
it knew long ago that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking, but
chose to look the other way.
   ``There had been some rumors ... but no one ever received or
could get evidence to substantiate those rumors,'' the president
said.
   The president gave a warm endorsement of Meese, his friend of
more than 20 years who is under increasing pressure to resign.
   ``I have complete confidence in him,'' Reagan said.
   He said there has been a recent practice ``in which accusation
or allegation is taken to mean conviction, and there's been too
much of that. In this land of ours, you are innocent until you are
proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Embracing Meese's rationale for remaining on the job, Reagan
said, ``I think that for him to step aside, as he has said, would
be for him to live the rest of his life under this cloud, where
nothing had ever been proved.''
   He raised questions about Meese's firing of Terry Eastland, the
Justice Department spokesman who has been defended by
conservatives. The president said there may be ``more than meets
the eye.'' He refused to elaborate, telling reporters they should
``talk to the attorney general about that.''
   Reagan opened his news conference with a statement hailing the
agreement to start Senate debate on the U.S.-Soviet
intermediate-range arms treaty and the March trade figures, which
showed a dramatic drop in the monthly deficit in the balance of
exports and imports.
   He said the $4.1 billion drop in the trade deficit was ``good
news, the best news on this front since March of 1985.''
   He cited the figures as evidence that restrictive trade
legislation recently passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress
was not needed. He said he expected to veto the bill and send that
message to Congress in the next few days.

<HEAD>Fallon McElligott's New Ad Labeled Sexist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising agency that sent a photo of an
African boy apparently kissing a cow's rear to the head of a
women's center is drawing new criticism for an ad depicting a
female athlete with a bulge underneath her gym shorts.
   ``It's extremely demeaning to women,'' said Suzanne Born, member
of the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission, which on Monday branded
the ad designed by the Fallon McElligott agency as sexist.
   The commission's ruling came four months after the agency
apologized to the same commission for racist and sexist remarks
directed at the director of the Women's Center at Mankato State
University. The agency lost a major account as a result of that
controversy.
   Fred Senn, director of account services for the Minneapolis
agency, said Monday the ad attacks a serious problem. ``It's
vulgar. It's hard-hitting, but you've got to scare these kids out
of using that stuff,'' he said.
   The poster, part of the University of Minnesota's campaign
against use of steroids by athletes, shows a female wearing shorts
with the caption: ``Steroids: They'll make a man out of you yet.''
   The poster does not show male genitalia directly, but shows ``a
bulge, as it were,'' according to Gail Shore, a public affairs
officer for the Women's Athletic Department.
   Many athletes take steroids to increase muscle bulk, but can
cause emotional and physical problems, including kidney ailments.
The posters were produced for the Men's Athletic Department and
were withdrawn in January, said Mark Banker, an intern on the
department's promotions and advertising staff.
   Baker said only five to 10 posters were actually sold before
they were withdrawn following a complaint from the Women's Athletic
Department.
   Senn said the agency warned the men's department that the
posters were potentially controversial, but Born asked why the
women's department was not consulted from the beginning.
   Senn told the board on Monday the agency has hired a consultant
in an effort to to nurture sensitivity toward race and sex issues,
but some commissioners were skeptical.
   ``It says to me that you really haven't learned anything. You're
paying lip service but you just don't get it,'' Born said. ``Your
agency continues to come up with sexist ad campaigns.''
   In January, Fallon McElligott President Pat Fallon apologized to
Neala Schleuning, head of the Mankato Women's Center, for sending
her a photo of an African boy apparently kissing the back end of a
cow.
   An accompanying letter suggested Schleuning use her energies to
rid the world of such barbaric rituals, rather than criticizing the
agency for negative stereotypes of women in its ads.
   Fallon McElligott, known as a hot and growing agency with $140
million in billings, was asked to withdraw from competition for
future US West business as a result of that controversy. The
telecommunications company provided $8 million of the agency's
annual billings.
   A US West spokeswoman said at the time that the company had
expressed its objections to the letters ``in the very strongest
terms.''
   Although the city civil rights commission vote carries no direct
consequences, chair Ophelia Bancos said: ``We just wanted them to
be aware that they we are unhappy with what they are doing. The
only thing we can do is ask them to change their ads.''

<HEAD>Democrats Question Administration Progress in Broadcast Minority
Hiring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic members of Congress on Tuesday
questioned the effectiveness of the Reagan administration's efforts
to increase hiring and promotion of minorities at broadcast
stations and cable television systems.
   But Dennis R. Patrick, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, and Clarence Thomas, chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, said Democrats in Congress could contribute
to minority gains by confirming President Reagan's nomination of
Bradley Holmes to the FCC.
   ``This appears to have been derailed at the highest levels,''
Thomas told members of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee,
referring to the nomination of Holmes, a black who heads the FCC's
policy and rules division of the Mass Media Bureau.
   Reagan nominated Holmes, a 34-year-old attorney and former aide
to Patrick, last November. But friction between the FCC and
congressional Democrats have led Senate leaders to put off
confirmation hearings for Holmes and attorney Susan Wing, also
nominated by Reagan to become a commissioner.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, has said he opposes the Holmes nomination. Hollings'
displeasure with the FCC stems from the agency's decision last
August to abolish the fairness doctrine, a policy that required
broadcasters to air conflicting views of controversial issues.
   Patrick joined Thomas in urging action on Holmes' nomination.
Patrick also defended his agency's efforts to hire and promote
women and minorities inside the agency and to encourage equal
employment opportunities at radio and TV stations and cable systems.
   In the broadcast and cable industries, progress has been gradual
but steady, he said.
   In radio and TV, minority employment has risen from 9.9 percent
overall and 8.4 percent in the top four job categories in 1972 to
16.2 percent overall and 14 percent in the top jobs in 1987, he
said.
   Women have increased their numbers during the period from 23
percent overall and 9.7 percent in the top four job categories to
37.8 percent overall and 29.9 percent in top jobs.
   For cable, FCC figures show minorities going from 11.7 percent
overall and 10.2 percent in the top four job categories in 1978 to
19.5 percent overall and 15.7 percent in the top jobs in 1987.
Women went from 30.6 percent of cable's overall workforce and 11.4
percent in the top jobs in 1978 to 40.4 percent overall and 27.8
percent in the top jobs last year.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., subcommittee chairman, disputed
Patrick's claim that minority employment in the top broadcasting
and cable jobs continues to improve and suggested the FCC's
enforcement of equal employment opportunity efforts is weak.
   Patrick conceded that in some specific job categories, the
percentage of minorities has been declining. National Cable
Television Association figures show that while minorities in the
top job category, officials and managers, grew from 8.8 percent in
1984 to 9.6 percent in 1987, minorities in the second job category,
professionals, declined from 15.5 percent to 12.3 percent during
the period.
   Markey said his concern was that the people who decide ``what
Americans will view'' are in the top four job categories. ``It is
their view of America, our culture, our society'' that is
presented, he said. ``To the extent that blacks are not fully
represented ... gives us some concern.''

   The United States and South Korea will hold
their 20th annual Security Consultative Meeting in Seoul from June
7 to June 9, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The U.S. delegation will be led by Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci, who intends to tour various American and South Korean
units in the field during his visit.
   The sessions will be hosted by South Korean Minister of National
Defense Oh Ja Bok and the two men intend to ``carefully review ...
plans for security cooperation by the two nations to help ensure
the success of the Seoul Olympics,'' the Pentagon said in a
statement.
   The Security Consultative Meetings rotate each year between
Seoul and Washington, and focus on issues surrounding the
stationing of American troops in South Korea and the military
threat posed by neighboring North Korea.

   Critical home-state lawmakers said Tuesday that
Gov. Michael Dukakis ignored repeated warnings of a state budget
crisis because the signals came at key junctures of his
presidential campaign.
   However, Dukakis' top budget officer said the governor had
warned the Legislature a year ago that the budget was based on
revenue projections that might prove overly optimistic.
   New state figures released Monday showed the state was $243
million short for the fiscal year that ends June 30. That would be
$166 million more than the shortfall projected by the governor's
Revenue Advisory Board on April 12, a week before the New York
primary and two weeks before the Pennsylvania primary. Wins in
those contests made it clear that Dukakis was all but certain to be
the Democratic presidential nominee.
   The $243 million shortfall is in addition to $233 million that
the administration told state agencies not to spend after the money
had been allocated.
   House Taxation Committee Chairman John Flood, a Democrat, said
Tuesday, ``They will be rolling on across the Potomac River while
the ship of Massachusetts goes down with the rest of us on it.''
   House Republican Leader Steven Pierce said ``Potomac fever'' led
the administration to ignore the warning signs.
   ``I think when the governor signed this budget at the beginning
of last July, anyone who knew anything knew that it was out of
balance,'' said state Republican Party spokesman Charlie Manning.
``Yet this guy is running as a fiscal manager.''
   Secretary of Administration and Finance Frank Keefe scoffed at
the criticism, pointing to budget-paring Dukakis vetoes and to the
Legislature's rejection of a $255 million Dukakis-filed tax
enforcement and fee package.
   ``I'm a little bit amused by folks who want to rewrite
history,'' Keefe said. ``It was the Legislature that fully believed
the future was going to be just like the immediate past, which was
a period of enormous good fortune.''
   Keefe said Dukakis had instructed him in September 1987 to put
together contingency plans to cut $185 million in spending, and he
said the governor at several intervals since had told him to look
for further cuts.
   The administration privately considered the Revenue Advisory
Board's projected shortfall conservative, but ``we weren't about to
say absolutely that things were horrible when we had no concrete
evidence that that was the case,'' Keefe said.

<HEAD>Reagan Won't Repudiate Astrology But Denies Its Use in Schedule
Decisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

   President Reagan refused to disavow the
practice of astrology on Tuesday, saying he did not know enough
about it to say whether or not there is ``something to it.''
   But Reagan also insisted that no changes were made in his
schedule because of first lady Nancy Reagan's dealings with an
astrologer.
   ``We made no decisions on it and we're not binding our lives to
this,'' Reagan told reporters in a short question-and-answer
session in the White House briefing room.
   The president then quickly added, ``And I don't mean to offend
anyone who does believe in it, or engages in it seriously.''
   But asked if he believed in astrology, the president paused
before replying.
   ``I don't guide my life by it, but I won't answer the question
the other way because I don't know enough about it to say, is there
something to it,'' he then replied.
   It was the most detailed response given by the president to the
report that his wife used stargazing to help formulate his schedule
and make decisions about other White House activities.
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan revealed the
practice in his book, ``For the Record,'' and White House officials
have confirmed that the first lady has ``an interest'' in following
the stars.
   Reagan offered a sometimes rambling defense of his wife's
activity, saying that the experience of the March 30, 1981,
assassination attempt contributed to her reliance on advice
provided by a person, whom he only identified as being ``a friend.''
   Reagan said the ``friend'' called the first lady after the
shooting and told her that it would have been helpful to have known
what the president had planned to do that day because ``all the
signs were bad.''
   ``That was a trauma that didn't g away easily,'' Reagan said.
   In an apparent explanation of his wife's dealings with the
astrologer, he added: ``And when suddenly things of the same kind _
just for a short period there _ when I was booked for something of
the same kind where the accident occurred, why she would ask, `What
does it look like now?' And no changes were ever made on the basis
of whether I did or did not conduct this.''
   The president was asked whether he believed that based upon a
warning from an astrologer, he could have changed what had happened.
   ``No, this friend thought that had I been told of _ that that
was supposed to be a horrendous time for me, that I might have done
something. Well, we didn't,'' he replied.
   While the Reagans have never identified the astrologer, San
Francisco heiress Joan Quigley has confirmed that she has spoken
with the first couple on the subject. Miss Quigley has authored
several books on astrology.
   Asked if he had allowed astrology to be used in setting his
schedule, Reagan responded, ``It didn't go on, and this whole thing
is built around an incident in which it is printed that this had to
do with scheduling of one of my operations _ Well, it didn't happen
that way at all.''
   Regan, in his book, relates a conversation he had with the first
lady in which she spoke of a possible delay in the president's July
1985 colon cancer surgery. The former chief of staff said he feared
the first lady was speaking of a possible delay because she wanted
to consult first with her astrologer.
   ``Nancy Reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant
powers of this woman,'' Regan wrote.

   A pharmaceutical company is replacing
potentially contaminated batches of a popular cholesterol-lowering
drug, but a spokesman said Tuesday the action will not interrupt
availability to patients taking the medication.
   Bristol Laboratories is restocking pharmacists' and wholesalers'
shelves with new supplies of Questran.
   Company spokesman Rolland Eckels said an estimated 150,000
Americans take the drug each day, but that there was no way to
estimate how many may need to have their prescriptions replaced.
   The voluntary action by the company is listed by the Food and
Drug Administration as a ``Class II'' recall, a category in which
the risk of serious adverse health consequences is considered
remote.
   The recalled cans and packets bear an expiration date of between
August 1988 and October 1991: from ``USEBY 8 88'' through ``EXP 1
OCT 91,'' or have the following batch codes: MKH81, MKH82, MLH46,
and MLH47.
   Patients in doubt can check with their pharmacist to see whether
they should get a free replacement.
   The action was taken after the company learned that one of the
ingredients in the drug _ supplied by an Italian manufacturer _ may
have been contaminated by agricultural chemicals made by the same
manufacturer.

<TEXT>
   Medical records do not support a woman's
claim that the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused her infertility,
an attorney for the IUD's manufacturer told a federal jury Tuesday.
   ``When the question is a medical one, we must look to the
medical records for the answer,'' Paul Strain, an attorne for G.D.
Searle & Co., said in opening arguments.
   A jury of five women and three men is hearing the civil suit
against Searle by Esther Kociemba, 29, and her husband, William, of
Elk River.
   Michael Ciresi, an attorney for the Kociembas, said in his
opening arguments that Searle displayed ``corporate
irresponsibility'' by withholding knowledge that its Copper-7 IUD
had the potential to cause infertility.
   ``It's a story of a company closing the door on the God-given
right of a woman to bear children,'' Ciresi said.
   But Strain said attorneys for Mrs. Kociemba would be introducing
evidence not central to the issues involved in the case.
   ``This is a case about whether they (the plaintiffs) have met
the burden of proving that the Copper-7 caused the infertility of
Mrs. Kociemba,'' Strain said.
   The Kociembas are asking for an unspecified amount in
compensatory and punitive damages for injuries Mrs. Kociemba,
including infertility, allegedly suffered as a result of using a
Copper-7 IUD for about 1{ years in 1977 and 1978.
   Strain asked the jury for a ``fair and just'' decision. ``I ask
you to decide this case solely on the evidence. You are not to
decide this case on sympathy or any other bias,'' Strain said.
   ``Experts in obstetrics and gynecology will address other
periods in Mrs. Kociemba's life and whether (the infertility) could
have occurred before she started using the Copper-7,'' Strain said.
   Mrs. Kociemba was 19 and single when she had the IUD inserted.
She had it removed after she married, but Strain said there ``is no
record that she was fertile before she started using the Copper-7.''
   Ciresi, meanwhile, accused Searle of covering up information
that its IUD was causing problems. Although the company received
reports of problems, ``The company hid that information from
doctors in this country and the women in whom the devices were
being inserted,'' he said.
   Ciresi's law firm, Robins, Zelle, Larson & Kaplan, represented
plaintiffs in many of cases involving A.H. Robins Co.'s Dalkon
Shield, which was eventually withdrawn from the market. The firm is
representing more than 30 women in Copper-7 lawsuits against Searle.
   While the Kociemba case is the 18th involving the Copper-7
nationwide to go to trial, it is the first being tried by Robins,
Zelle, which has said it will introduce internal Searle documents
never before presented.
   The firm has said evidence introduced in the Kociemba trial is
expected to set a foundation for lawsuits to come.

<HEAD>Italy Bars Ship Carrying Toxic Waste That Has Been Afloat For a
Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto ROM-4</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MARINA DI CARRARA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Port authorities on Tuesday
refused for a second time to let a Syrian ship enter the harbor
with a cargo of toxic chemical waste that left Marina di Carrara
more than a year ago.
   The cargo of 2,000 tons of waste has been transferred from ship
to ship since it was first loaded aboard a freighter in this
northern port in February 1987.
   At one point, after a trans-Atlantic voyage, the hazardous waste
was unloaded in Venezuela but officials there said a boy died after
playing near some of the open drums and the government asked Italy
to take the cargo back.
   Francesco Rizzuto, an attorney for the Syrian ship's owner,
Tobalo Shipping, said Tuesday there are 12,000 drums of
unidentified chemicals aboard the Zanoobia and leakage has made two
of the 18 crew members seriously ill.
   The Zanoobia has been anchored off Marina di Carrara, 60 miles
southeast of Genoa, for three weeks.
   Since the waste was first loaded aboard the Cypriot-flagged
freighter Ljnx, there have been efforts to dispose of the cargo in
Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria and Greece.
   Rizzuto said the waste is jeopardizing the crew of the Zanoobia
and posing a threat to the Italian coastline.
   Port officials refuse to allow the ship to enter the harbor,
saying it does not have the proper permits from regional
authorities.
   Rizzuto gave this account of the cargo's journey:
   The Milan-based company Jelly Wax paid the equivalent of 36
cents per pound to have the chemicals disposed of and the waste was
loaded aboard the Ljnx.
   When authorities in Djibouti rejected the cargo, the ship sailed
to Venezuela where it was unloaded.
   After Venezuela insisted that Italy take the waste back, the
drums were put on the Cypriot-flagged ship Makiri. But when the
Makiri arrived in Sardinia, Italian authorities said the vessel did
not have the proper documents and it sailed to Syria.
   In Syria, the cargo was transferred to the Zanoobia. That ship
sought unsuccessfully to unload the cargo in Greece before it
returned the drums to Marina di Carrara.
   Rizzuto said there is a criminal investigation in Italy into the
handling of the waste. He said the ship's captain, Atmed Tobalo,
also had filed a request for an investigation into the contents of
the drums.

   The man charged with 27 counts of murder
for allegedly driving drunk and slamming his truck into a bus is
shy, would not intentionally hurt anyone and was well-liked at
work, friends and his boss said.
   ``He's a good person,'' said Billy Joe Cull, manager of
Drifter's Tavern, where Larry W. Mahoney of Worthville often shot
pool. ``I never saw him get out of hand here. He never caused a
problem.''
   Mahoney, 34, was convicted of drunken driving in 1984 and paid a
fine. He also had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in 1980 and
1983. His former wife charged he allegedly threatened her with a
knife in 1980, but the charge of terroristic threatening was
dropped.
   Mahoney was living with the former wife, Janice King Mahoney,
and their son at the time of the accident. He had been divorced
from his second wife, Betty Mahoney, by whom he had a daughter.
   ``He was just an easy-going, good ole country boy,'' said Linda
Mefford, a friend. ``He was a little backward _ shy and
quiet-spoken. But people should know that he wasn't some kind of
wild maniac.''
   Mahoney was charged with murder Monday and Carroll County
Commonwealth's Attorney John Ackman said he would seek the death
penalty.
   Authorities said tests showed Mahoney's blood alcohol level was
2{ times the legal limit when his pickup, traveling the wrong way
on Interstate 71, struck the bus Saturday night, killing 27 people
on a church outing.
   ``He might have had a drink now and then on a Saturday night,
but he didn't have a drinking problem,'' Mrs. Mefford said.
   Mahoney was transferred to the prison unit of Humana
Hospital-University in Louisville, where he was listed in fair
condition and will remain under 24-hour guard during his recovery,
said Taylor Rice, the hospital's public relations manager.
   State police said they talked Monday with Mahoney, but would not
discuss details.
   Mahoney dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and grew
tobacco with his father and a brother-in-law until he got a job at
M&T Chemical Co. in Carrollton.
   Plant manager Richard Vonnahme called Mahoney an excellent,
well-mannered employee. He was a a production worker, helping mix
chemicals, said John Way, personnel manager at the company.
   ``He's respected by everyone and well-liked within the plant,''
Vonnahme said.
   ``I feel sorry for the people who lost their children, but I
feel sorry for Larry, too,'' said Mrs. Mefford. ``He wouldn't hurt
anybody for the world.''

   Employees worked ``fast and furious''
Tuesday to clean up a medium-security prison while state agencies
began investigating a 59-hour weekend uprising.
   Prison officials offered counseling to eight guards taken
hostage at the Mack Alford Correctional Center, and prison
spokeswoman Anita Trammell said the disturbance tightened bonds
among the prison's 148 employees.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon said he was assigning the investigation to
the Department of Public Safety even though the Oklahoma State
Bureau of Investigation had already begun its probe.
   ``Our problem with the OSBI's prison investigation is that it
takes them so long,'' said Bellmon.
   OSBI spokesman Paul Renfrow said agents expect to interview
about 100 people involved in the incident, which began Friday
evening and ended Monday morning when the last hostages were
released unharmed.
   State corrections director Gary Maynard said 40 inmates
identified as being ringleaders or involved in the riot were being
held in a disciplinary unit called ``The Rock'' at a state prison
in McAlester.
   ``All of those will receive misconduct reports. If found guilty
(of misconduct), they will most likely receive 30 days in the
disciplinary unit,'' he said.
   Maynard said during the 30 days the inmates would receive no
privileges with only one visit a month from family members and one
hour a day of exercise during which they will wear handcuffs and
leg irons.
   ``Their cases also will be submitted to the district attorney
for review,'' he said.
   Prison officials met Tuesday with seven of the eight hostages
and their families at the prison visitor's center, and Marcus
Pogue, health services administrator at the prison, offered
counseling to the families.
   Most of the prison's 653 prisoners have been transferred to
other institutions, and the staff is working ``fast and furious''
on a cleanup, Ms. Trammell said.
   Ms. Trammell said an early $5 million estimate on damage may be
low, but added it may be several days before authorities come up
with another estimate.
   State corrections officials said about 130 inmates remain at
Stringtown. They said they did not know when the damaged portions
of the prison would be ready for reoccupation.

   In many of the 21 counties, this initial report will include
returns from most or all precincts, giving the appearance in vote
summaries transmited by AP that the county is complete, or nearly
so.
   In reality, the ``early pickup'' from about 550 of the state's

   Randy Curtis is glad to hear that Sioux
City Gateway Airport no longer will be known as SUX.
   ``It was somewhat of a joke in the industry,'' said Curtis, the
airport manager.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced Monday it would
change the airport's three-letter identification, which all
airports have for airline directories, identification on baggage
tags and some radio frequencies.
   Curtis said he favors SUI, for Sioux City, Iowa.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, had asked the FAA to change the code
after complaints from residents and the airport's advisory board.
   ``The community of Sioux City has been interested in having the
designation changed to something more appropriate and less
suggestive,'' a spokeswoman for Harkin said.
   The request was submitted more than two years ago, so the
decision to nix SUX ``came as sort of a surprise,'' Curtis said.
   Curtis said the airport has had the three-letter code for years.
``It probably goes back quite a few years ago when the connotations
were not like that,'' he said.

   A teacher is giving his fifth-grade
students a hands-on lesson in interest-group politics.
   Students at Carrollton Elementary School had complained about
the state of the playground, which had too few swings in good
repair near the school and lacked a ball field. So John Bushroe got
his 27 students to obtain estimates for repairs and petition the
Board of Education as part of their social studies class.
   After two months of checking with local suppliers, they found it
would cost $1,400 to repair and move swings, build a baseball
diamond and make other small changes, said 11-year-old Craig Stuart.
   Then, they got the Parent Teacher Organization to pledge $700 in
matching funds and submitted a petition with 234 signatures to the
Board of Education for the balance.
   The board will decide on the request June 1, and President May
Lou Miller already seems impressed by the students' homework.
   ``It'll be a matter of deciding if we can put it in this year's
budget or build into next year's,'' she said.
   ``The worst they can say is `no,''' Craig said. ``Maybe if they
don't give us everything, we can get part of what we want.''

   The Senate opened debate on the U.S.-Soviet
medium-range missile treaty Tuesday, just over a week before
President Reagan leaves for the Moscow summit.
   Not long after the debate opened, Reagan renewed his appeal for
quick action on the pact, saying it ``has placed U.S.-Soviet arms
discussions on a path that goes beyond arms control and toward real
nuclear arms reduction.''
   Reagan entered the White House briefing room to say he is ``both
hopeful and confident that after careful consideration, the Senate
will agree that this treaty is a diplomatic milestone and give its
consent to United States participation.''
   The White House wants the Senate to act quickly enough to alow
Reagan to go to Moscow with a ratified treaty. Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he too hopes the president can
take to the summit ``the treaty with a blue ribbon on it.''
   But there is no guarantee the Senate will be able to act before
Reagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Kremlin on
May 29. The president is to leave Washington next Wednesday for a
rest stop in Finland before going on to Moscow.
   As debate opened Tuesday afternoon, Byrd said the exhaustive
scrutiny to which the accord has been subjected should prove a
useful ``civics lesson'' to both the White House and Kremlin that
the Senate's role in the approval of treaties is ``not symbolic,
that it is not a rubber stamp, that the Senate will not just roll
over and play dead.''
   ``It's time to roll up our sleeves and go to work,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``There's no reason the
president should not have the treaty to ratify in Moscow.''
   ``When Ronald Reagan steps off Air Force One onto Russian soil,
I want Mr. Gorbachev to know that he's facing a man with the solid
backing of Congress and the American people,'' Dole said.
   Dole said the Senate should aim at ratifying the treaty on next
Wednesday, the day the president leaves on his Moscow trip.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., urging approval of the pact, said
the treaty spells ``the beginning of the end of this mindless race
to add ever more nuclear weapons.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the treaty's leading Senate
opponent, repeated a litany of complaints about the treaty, and
said the Reagan administration is promoting the pact with ``snake
oil claims.''
   Helms complained that the treaty requires only the destruction
of missiles, not their nuclear warheads.
   ``The official U.S. claim is that this treaty removes from
Europe an entire class of nuclear weapons, Helms said and added:
``There is an old song called, `It Ain't Necessarily So.'
   ``I have a hunch that if Ronald Reagan were running for
president this year instead of being in his last year in office he
would be out on the hustings demanding the Senate reject this
treaty,'' Helms contended.
   Vote counts show that Helms is badly outnumbered in his
opposition to the treaty and that it is likely to be ratified by
far more than the required 67 votes, two-thirds of the Senate if
all 100 members are present and voting.
   But Helms said the odds make no difference to him.
   ``I am going to vote against ratification even if I am the only
senator to do so,'' he said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said the treaty has only small military
significance, because it eliminates only about 5 percent of the
missiles in the two superpowers nuclear arsenals.
   Its importance, he said, is because it represents ``a small but
vitally important step ... towards more substantial arms
reduction,'' Pell said. ``It is of immense psychological and
political importance.''
   Pell said the terms of the pact strongly favor the United
States, however, because it requires the destruction of missiles
capable of carrying four times as many nuclear warheads than the
U.S. missiles which are to be eliminated.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty requires the
destruction of all ground-launched medium-range missiles with a
range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.
   The ground-breaking arms control pact has been under
consideration by three Senate committees since the beginning of the
year, but Senate debate on ratifying it was delayed by last-minute
problems.
   Byrd announced Monday that all roadblocks had been cleared by an
agreement reached in Geneva last week between Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Byrd said the Senate's Foreign Relations, Intelligence and Armed
Services committees were satisfied that the agreement had resolved
misunderstandings over the implementation of the treaty's on-site
inspection provisions.
   Additionally, the committees said Shultz had succeeded in
winning Soviet agreement to endorse the U.S. position that the
treaty bans all medium-range weapons, including those using
futuristic technology such as laser rays, particle beams and
high-power microwaves.
   ``I feel that it is a good treaty, much better than it was when
it was first sent to the Hill,'' Byrd told the Senate on Tuesday.
   ``That is a tribute both to the Senate and to the
administration,'' he said, praising the three committees, which he
said ``insisted there were loose ends that needed to be tied.''
   ``I hope the treaty will be approved, will be ratified, and it
is not unreasonable to hope that it will be done before the
president leaves for the summit,'' Byrd said. ``That will be our
main goal. Delay for the sake of delay is certainly not one of the
approaches I would embrace.

   Undocumented aliens are still pouring into
the United States despite a new immigration law making it illegal
for employers to hire them, officials said Tuesday after finding 42
people hidden in a northbound freight train.
   Juan Garcia, assistant chief with the Border Patrol's McAllen
Sector, said the numbers have been increasing lately, and agents
who stopped the train Tuesday had been expecting to find even more
aliens in the train's 113 cars.
   ``This is an extremely low count,'' said B.A. French, a
supervisory patrol agent with the Border Patrol's Harlingen station
in the lower Rio Grande Valley.
   A recent five-day sweep of trains netted more than 100 aliens
per day, French said, including a group suffering from dehydration
in a sealed boxcar.
   Among those apprehended Tuesday were several families and two
small children huddled in a grain hopper car. The Mexicans appeared
stunned as they climbed down a ladder while a Border Patrol
helicopter circled overhead shining a spotlight on the predawn
scene.
   ``I came to find work wherever it (the train) stops,'' Tomas
Vega, 21, of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, said while another man from
the same city carried a crying 3-year-old boy.
   During the first week of May, the Border Patrol's McAllen Sector
reported 1,691 apprehensions of undocumented aliens. Last week, the
sector reported 1,080 apprehensions, 204 involving people from
countries other than Mexico, said Fred Rangel, a Border Patrol
agent in McAllen.
   Rangel said the number of aliens has dropped since the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was passed, but the
total is higher than a year ago.
   Patrol Agent Michael O'Barr, with the Laredo Sector northwest of
here, said the situation is the same in his area.
   ``Overall, we're seeing slightly above what we were'' last year,
O'Barr said. ``The new law's had its impact, but still people are
willing to take a chance. Unfortunately, we have those employers
who are willing to hire them.''
   Recently many undocumented aliens who have been in the United
States for five years were able to register for legal status, but
that process ended May 4 and did not apply to new arrivls.
   The new immigration law also makes it illegal to hire
undocumented aliens, and employer sanctions under the new law go
into full effect June 1. But aliens keep coming because of the
desperate economic situation in Mexico, O'Barr said.
   ``We're still catching 500 or 600 a day,'' said Doug Mosier,
with the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector in western Texas and New
Mexico.
   He said apprehensions are about 30 percent below the rate in
1986, when the sector made 312,000 alien arrests.
   ``The situation in Mexico is terrible, and people are caught in
a situation where their country has nothing to offer them,'' said
Telma Longoria, director for Catholic Social Services in the
Brownsville Diocese.
   She said the diocese is seeing more Central Americans than ever
at its shelter east of Brownsville, which averages 150-200 aliens
at any given time, primarily from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala
and Honduras.
   ``The people are coming,'' Ms. Longoria said. ``There is no
doubt about that. We see it all the time.''
   With the weather heating up, officials said they are checking
trains more often to prevent a repeat of last year's tragedy in
Sierra Blanca, Texas, when 18 aliens suffocated in a sealed,
sweltering boxcar.
   ``The smugglers don't care about the aliens that much,'' said
Travis Johnson, who is in charge of the Harlingen station. ``They
want their money.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee,
after being rebuffed by federal regulators, said Tuesday he will
proceed with legislation abolishing a much-criticized agency set up
to handle property from insolvent savings institutions.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., in a statement prepared for
the House floor, said he was not suprised by the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board's decision to defend the Federal Asset Disposition
Association ``to it's final hour.''
   St Germain, in a letter May 3, had asked Bank Board Chairman M.
Danny Wall to dissolve FADA, a quasi-public agency created by the
bank board three years ago.
   St Germain has accused FADA of favoritism, conflicts of interest
and mismanagement of the $4.2 billion in loans and real estate in
its care.
   Wall replied in a letter Friday that St Germain's criticisms
``are historical in nature.''
   ``The facts about FADA under its new management are markedly
different,'' Wall said, referring to Gerald P. Carmen, the former
director of the General Services Administration who took over as
FADA chief executive in February.
   Wall said staff reductions ordered by Carmen will save $2
million a year. He argued that abolishing FADA would ``at a minimum
cost millions of dollars ... create confusion (and) destroy the
value to the system already created.''
   ``I am confident that in the coming months you will see how
sound the concept of FADA is and how much good will have come from
its new management,'' Wall told St Germain.
   However, St Germain, noting his threat in the May 3 letter to
push legislation abolishing FADA, said, ``We will proceed on that
course.''
   ``Washington boondoggles have a life of their own and unless
they are nipped in the bud they become part of the landscape
forevermore,'' St Germain said. ``FADA is at just such a
crossroads.''
   Reps. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Tom McMillen, D-Md., on
Wednesday planned to introduce legislation to dismantle FADA within
60 days and return its functions to the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., the government insurance fund backing S&L deposits
up to $100,000.

<HEAD>Report: Kidney Funds Bypassing Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   W.R. Grace & Co. used $21 million in federal
funds earmarked for kidney patients to finance acquisition of the
nation's largest kidney dialysis company, The Philadelphia Inquirer
reported Tuesday.
   A federal audit concluded that the use of the money was
improper, the newspaper said.
   In the same year, 1984, in which Grace's chairman, J. Peter
Grace, headed a president's commission to investigate waste, fraud
and fiscal abuse, his company took control of the dialysis company,
National Medical Care.
   W.R. Grace, in a statement read by spokesman Frederick Bona in
New York, said the Inquirer article contained ``many inaccuracies''
and showed a lack of understanding of ``the mechanisms that
determine the dialysis remimbursement rate.''
   The newspaper said that in 1985 a dialysis clinc in Puerto Rico
owned by the Grace subsidiary made a $1 million profit. It said a
federal program paid the clinic $2.5 million to treat about 140
patients, while a government audit showed the treatments cost $1.5
million.
   More than $500,000 was profit for the clinic, the newspaper
said, and the remaining $500,000 paid non-patient expenses and
physicians' salaries that federal auditors deemed excessive.
   Dialysis, which keeps kidney-disease patients alive, costs about
$20,000 a year.
   Congress moved 16 years ago to ensure that dialysis was
available to everyone. It launched a program that this year will
pay $2.5 billion to 1,665 clinics.
   Federal records show that many clinics are making profits
approaching 30 percent from the average $125 per treatment paid by
the government, the Inquirer said.
   Federal officials acknowledge that they have little idea of how
the clinics spend the money they receive through Medicare.
   ``We don't ask questions about how they parcel out that amount
of money,'' said Bernadette Shoemaker, director of the Division of
Dialysis and Transplant Policy for the government's Health Care
Financing Administration.
   ``We pay the rate. It's up to the facilities to divvy up the
amount.''
   The Inquirer said that the spending of the money is largely
uncontrolled and feeds a tremendously profitable industry.
   W.R. Grace & Co., a giant conglomerate that owns chemical
companies and restaurants, obtained NMC, according to the Inquirer,
through a $350 million buyout of shareholders. But the new company
borrowed about $290.4 million to complete the deal, the newspaper
said.
   According to the audit, NMC paid about $35 million in interest
in 1985 on the money borrowed from the stock buyout and labeled a
portion of that interest as a cost of patient care.
   Edmund G. Lowrie, senior vice president of NMC, estimated in an
interview last week that about 60 percent or about $21 million of
that $35 million payment was charged to the federally funded clinic.
   ``The root cause of this is the denial of government to
acknowledge that a return on invested capital is an allowable
cost,'' Lowrie said.
   Larry Simmons, deputy assistant inspector general for health
audits in the Department of Health and Human Services, said there
was no finding of illegality in the audit.
   ``How they spend their money is not really a concern of the
government,'' Simmons said. ``When that money hits NMC, it's their
money.''
   In its statement, Grace said that since federal dialysis
payments began in 1973, the reimbursement rate dropped 10 percent
from about $138 per treatment to about $125 per treatment today,
while health-care costs rose by more than 200 percent.
   ``NMC received no more money as a result of the sale of the
business than if they didn't sell it,'' Bona said. ``Whatever the
costs are, that's up to the provider.''
   Grace's statement also said that in 1983, NMC's last full year
as a publicly traded company, net income was $23 million, compared
with $8.4 million in 1985, NMC's first full year after the
acquisition.
   ``This drop is accounted 100 percent by the increased interest
expense associated with the acquisition and, therefore, was borne
by the current NMC shareholders,'' Grace's statement said.

<HEAD>INS Wants Anti-Castro Militant Deported</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Immigration officials ruled Tuesday that
anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch is a danger to the community and
ordered him deported, bringing bitter protests from his family.
   Bosch, a hero to many in Miami's Cuban exile community, served a
sentence for a 1968 rocket attack on a Polish freighter here, and
was held 11 years in Venezuelan prisons on an unproven accusation
he bombed a Cuban jetliner in 1976, killing 73 people.
   Bosch's attorneys are seeking a stay of the deportation. A
hearing is scheduled Friday before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler. The expulsion also must be reviewed by regional
Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Steve Martin in
Dallas.
   INS officials in Washington decided to deport Bosch after
receiving custody of him Monday from federal parole officials, who
had held him since his arrival from Venezuela in February.
   ``They feel he is a threat and a danger,'' Perry Rivkind,
Florida INS district director, said Tuesday. ``Today I received
instructions from Washington to send him a temporary exclusion
notice. It will be presented to him shortly.''
   Bosch's angry daughter, Myriam Bosch, accused the INS of
persecuting her father.
   ``You know why they don't want to release him?,'' she said.
``Because they don't want to give him the chance to show he's not a
menace to society.''
   Bosch came to the United States in the 1960s and lived in the
Miami area, joining thousands of other Cubans in flight from Fidel
Castro's takeover. He is not a U.S. citizen.
   The pediatrician-turned-activist was convicted of a 1968 Miami
rocket attack on a Polish ship that had done business in Cuba. He
fled the United States while on probation for that crime.
   Venezuelan authorities then arrested him on an accusation of
masterminding the bombing of the Cuban jetliner. He was detained
for 11 years despite being acquitted by Venezuelan military and
civilian courts, but earlier this year was finally freed to the
United States. On his arrival here in February, Bosch was taken
into custody for violating parole.
   Bosch was turned over to the INS Monday, said Tom Kowalski,
Atlanta spokesman for the U.S. Parole Commission.
   Bosch is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
south Dade County.

   President Vinicio Cerezo said Tuesday that
two former presidential candidates were among the civilians
involved in last week's failed coup attempt against his government.
   He identified them as Gustavo Anzueto Vielman, the candidate in
1982 for the ultraconservative Authentic Nationalist Center party,
and Mario David Garcia, the party's candidate in 1985 and director
of a television news program.
   The army has said eight civilians were involved in last
Wednesday's attempt. Six army officers, including deputy commanders
of two bases, are under arrest and three others were retired
temporarily or permanently.
   The president identified another purported plotter as Mario
Castejon, who was a member of the National Renovation Party and was
trying to form his own party. For a time Castejon was with the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   Cerezo, who took office on Jan. 14, 1986 as Guatemala's first
civilian president since 1970, said military authorities will file
complaints in civilian courts against the civilians involved. None
was under arrest Tuesday.
   He spoke with reporters after inaugurating a preventive
detention center at the Pavon prison in Fraijanes, 15 miles east of
the capital.
   Cerezo said the former military officers involved in the coup
attempt included retired Gen. Mario Lopez Fuentes, military chief
of staff during the government of Gen. Efrain Rios Montt and until
recently Guatemalan ambassador to Italy, and retired Col. Fernando
Luis Gordillo Martinez, who was a member of the junta formed after
the March 23, 1982 coup that brought Rios Montt to power.
   The junta later was dissolved and Rios Montt named president.
   Gordillo Martinez is secretary-general of the Emergent Concord
Movement, a small political party. His brother, Maj. Manuel Maria
Gordillo Martinez, who was in charge of training at the base in
Retalhuleu, is among the active officers under arrest in the
attempt.
   Columns of officers and soldiers from the bases at Retalhuleu,
115 miles southwest of Guatemala City, and Jutiapa, 75 miles
southeast, were stopped by troops loyal to the government as the
rebel soldiers moved toward the capital early Wednesday.
   Officials said the forces were stopped peacefully.
   Rios Montt was overthrown in an Aug. 8, 1983, coup and replaced
by Gen. Humberto Mejia Victores, who in 1986 turned over the
government to Cerezo, the winner in two rounds of elections.

   President Abdou Diouf said Tuesday night
he will end the emergency imposed during riots after the Feb. 28
general elections and grant an amnesty.
   At a feast ending the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, Diouf also
said he would meet with opposition leader Abdoualaye Wade to
``examine ways and means to consolidate Senegal's democracy and to
find solutions to problems facing the young, including education
and employment.''
   These actions showed his ``confidence in the Senegalese
people,'' Diouf said, and he was ``betting on the maturity and
wisdom of my countrymen.''
   Wade claimed his Senegalese Democratic Party won the elections.
He was convicted of instigating post-election riots and last
Wednesday was given a one-year suspended prison sentence. He also
was barred from his seat in the National Assembly.
   Boubacar Sall, the No. 2 man in Wade's party, was sentenced to
two years in prison and two other party officials were given six
months each.
   Diouf said he would submit an amnesty proposal to the National
Assembly, but gave no details. The state of emergency will be
lifted this weekend, he said.
   The president, who leads the Senegalese Socialist Party, won 73
percent of the presidential vote and Wade 25 percent, according to
official returns. Wade claimed the elections were rigged.

<TEXT>
   A possible U.S. requirement that all of Canada's
10 provinces approve the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement put the
government on the defensive Tuesday. Ontario's premier said the
pact is dead if it depends on him.
   On Monday, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee won the Reagan
administration's support for the condition. Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas
Democrat, is chairman of the committee.
   The Free Trade Agreement was Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
initiative and he has assured Washington his Conservative
government has the power to implement it.
   His problem is that the governments of Ontario and Prince Edward
Island oppose the agreement, which was signed Jan. 2 and is to
become effective Jan. 1, 1989, if approved by Congress and
Parliament.
   Four other provinces have told the federal government not to use
the measure to intrude on areas of provincial jurisdiction.
   The trade deal, which took 18 months to negotiate, would be
undermined without the participation of Ontario, Canada's
industrial powerhouse.
   Ontario Premier David Peterson said Tuesday the deal is finished
if it depends on his formal approval.
   ``If you ask me to sign a piece of paper saying that I agree
with it, the answer is no,'' he told reporters. ``If that in fact
stops the deal, then the deal will stop. I am not prepared to
implement anything ... we don't like.''
   Peterson said the agreement gives the United States too much
influence over Canadian policies on energy, agriculture and service
industries without protecting Canada from U.S. countervailing and
anti-dumping duties.
   The federal government has the power to make international trade
agreements but Peterson, a Liberal, threatened court action if it
tries to impose changes in areas traditionally under provincial
jurisdiction, such as marketing rules for wine and liquor.
   Under the free trade pact, Canada must end ``discriminatory''
markups on U.S. wine and liquor products Jan. 1.
   Peterson, who wants to protect vineyards in the Niagara region,
has said he will make changes only over a seven-year period. He
also threatens to fight federal intervention in Ontario's service
and energy industries.
   Both main opposition parties, the Liberals and New Democrats,
oppose the free trade accord and have said they will scrap it if
they win the next parliamentary election, expected either this fall
or next spring.
   After learning of the Senate committee condition, Liberal Party
leader John Turner said Mulroney's government is letting ``a
foreign country dictate how we should operate.''
   Canada and the United States are the world's biggest trading
partners and about 80 percent of the trade already is duty-free.
The Free Trade Agreement would eliminate all remaining duties over
a 10-year period and relax investment restrictions and other
non-tariff barriers.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev may withdraw 50,000 to
100,000 troops from Europe this year to kick off a new round of
East-West negotiations on conventional forces, a U.S. official said
Tuesday.
   A unilateral Soviet pullback would have ``little impact
strategically,'' said a U.S. official, but the political effect
could be major in Europe, where polls show high regard for
Gorbachev on arms control issues.
   The official said 50,000 to 70,000 Soviet troops might be
withdrawn. Another U.S. official said as many as 100,000 Red Army
troops could be pulled back within Soviet borders from positions in
East Europe.
   While the two officials spoke on condition of anonymity, former
Defense Secretary Harold Brown predicted that Gorbachev might try
to throw Reagan off balance at the Moscow summit May 29-June 2 by
announcing a unilateral withdrawal.
   Brown told reporters he would not be surprised if the Soviets
``move spectacularly on the conventional arms control front.''
   The withdrawals could come from among the estimated 380,000
Soviet troops kept at a high state of readiness in East Germany.
   U.S. officials trying to anticipate Gorbachev's summit strategy
also have detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summit
meeting before Reagan leaves office in eight months. The projected
sites are Vienna or Budapest.
   Another summit would give the two sides more time to work on a
treaty to cut their strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by 30 percent
to 50 percent. Reagan had hoped to make the treaty the centerpiece
of his visit to Moscow, but negotiators are stymied over the U.S.
Star Wars anti-missile program and means to verify compliance with
the pact.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz acknowledged after making
final summit preparations last week in Geneva with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that ``it is now clear there is no
way these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for the
summit.''
   The two sides have agreed on a ``confidence-building measure''
that was negotiated as part of the treaty but which Reagan and
Gorbachev are likely to sign during the summit as a separate deal,
another U.S. official said.
   It provides for advance notification of all U.S. and Soviet
missile test launchings, including those from submarines, as well
as the approximate target location.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
proposal for the summit signing was made by Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci and accepted by Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov.
   Because no major agreements are to be signed at the summit, U.S.
officials foresee it as an event to consolidate improvements in
U.S. Soviet relations since Gorbachev took office in 1985 and began
the summit meetings.
   At the same time, U.S. officials were preparing for possible
surprises.
   At Reykjavik in 1986, Gorbachev seized the initiative with
sweeping proposals to slash nuclear weapons.
   This time, U.S. officials said, Gorbachev may propose reducing
ground forces in Europe by 25 percent and opening negotiations in
Vienna in late fall.
   The United States and its 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies have balked at new talks on conventional arms until the
Soviets fulfill the human rights pledges they made in the 1975
Helsinki accord.
   Senior U.S. officials said Shevardnadze told Shultz there soon
would be some practical moves by Moscow in the area of religious
practices and religious education. He did not offer any details,
but his statement was taken seriously by the U.S. side.
   The conventional force negotiations between NATO and the
seven-nation Warsaw Pact would supersede to Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction talks that began in 1973 but failed to produce an
agreement on cutting troops on the Central European front.
   Reagan administration officials are hopeful now because
Gorbachev seems to have accepted the principle of the West's
argument that ``asymmetry'' _ the geographic and possible numerical
advantages _ of the Warsaw Pact must be addressed in negotiations.
   ``The Soviets can afford to take significant cuts without
hurting their military capability,'' the U.S. official said. ``The
first U.S. objective is to get the Soviets down to NATO levels.''
   Pentagon and other estimates of NATO and Warsaw Pact troop
strengths vary widely _ from a 900,000-man edge for the East to a
200,000 Western edge.
   Where the Warsaw Pact has a decided lead is in tanks and
artillery. The Pentagon estimates the Soviet-led alliance has
52,000 tanks compared with 20,000 in NATO, and 43,000 artillery
pieces compared with NATO's 18,000.

<TEXT>
   A man who tried to escape from jail after fellow
inmates recognized him from the ``America's Most Wanted''
television program agreed Tuesday to return to Oklahoma, where he
is wanted for bank robbery and another escape.
   Mark Austin Goodman, 27, was on the U.S. Marshals Service's
wanted list when his case was described on the Sunday television
program, which each week highlights suspects being sought for
serious crimes.
   Using the alias James Ron Eide, Goodman had been serving a
75-day sentence for burglary at the Palm Beach County stockade when
other inmates watching the program recognized him, said sheriff's
spokesman Bob Ferrell.
   Goodman was due to be released Saturday, and guards decided to
transfer him to more secure quarters while they determined his
identity, Ferrell said.
   But Goodman, who has a deformed right arm, slipped out of his
handcuffs Sunday night and scaled an eight-foot fence topped with
barbed wire.
   An off-duty deputy spotted him Monday at a shopping mall. He was
arrested without incident and is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in Dade County until he is taken to Oklahoma.
   Shackled and surrounded by marshals, Goodman was brought Tuesday
before Chief U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo. Goodman acknowledged
his true identity and signed a waiver agreeing to go back
immediately to Oklahoma.
   His departure time was not revealed for security reasons, said
marshal's Inspector James Simmons, but he added ``he'll be back
there within five days.''
   The marshals stamped ``Captured'' in red letters across
Goodman's picture on their bulletin board at the Miami federal
courthouse.
   Goodman escaped Oct. 30 from the Federal Correctional
Institution in El Reno, Okla., where he was awaiting trial on
charges of robbing 10 Oklahoma City-area banks last year.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Tuesday
he fired chief spokesman Terry Eastland because ``it was time for a
change in leadership'' and that the dismissal did not revolve
around a question of aggressively defending Meese.
   Meese made the comment to reporters after President Reagan
reiterated his confidence in Meese and said in reference to
Eastland's firing that ``there is more than meets the eye with
regard to this latest departure.''
   Meese said ``I suspect'' what Reagan ``had in mind'' concerning
Eastland's departure was ``that I determined it was time for a
change in leadership'' rather than ``all this big blowup in the
paper ... about this reason or that reason.''
   Eastland, Meese's public affairs chief since April 1985, said in
a letter Monday that the attorney general had told him Friday he
wanted someone ``willing to aggressively defend you against ... any
and all criticism.'' He said Meese had concluded ``my efforts have
not sufficed.''
   Meese flatly contradicted that portion of Eastland's letter late
Monday afternoon, telling reporters that Eastland's departure ``had
nothing to do with a defense of me. ... Actually, ... defending me
... was not one of Terry's tasks.''
   Meese said the task of defending him was being handled by his
personal lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap. They are
representing the attorney general in a year-old criminal
investigation being conducted by independent counsel James McKay.
   Meanwhile, Eastland's special assistant, Ronald Tomalis,
resigned. Tomalis was asked to remain at the Justice Department but
handed in his resignation and plans to leave the department in two
weeks, said Patrick Korten, who is Eastland's replacement.
   Tomalis declined to comment on his reasons for leaving, but it
is customary for aides to departing political appointees to leave
as well.
   In addition, Meese announced that Deborah Burstion-Wade is the
new deputy director in the public affairs office, succeeding Korten.
   Burstion-Wade joined the Justice Department's public affairs
office in October 1986 after working as a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission.
   On another matter, the manager of a public relations firm said
Tuesday he has spoken to Meese about a possible contract to examine
the Justice Department's public portrayal of its war on drugs.
   Charles Crawford, who manages the Washington office of Hill &
Knowlton, said ``I discussed with the attorney general the whole
veracity of the process'' in publicizing the department's drug
enforcement efforts.
   Crawford said there was concern that drug enforcement programs
were being ``lost in the background'' of other issues and said ``I
suppose'' the other issues include Meese's current legal troubles.
He said no contract had been drawn up. Meese and Hill & Knowlton
Chairman Robert T. Gray are friends.
   The Justice Department's public affairs office has a $1.7
million annual budget. The FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and
other department agencies have their own public relations
operations.

<TEXT>
   A farm family faced with an eviction deadline
on Tuesday drove away from land they had worked for almost 40
years, but bank officials said the family was not broke and vowed
to press them over debts estimated at $500,000.
   ``We might have to pitch a tent. The bank took all our money,''
Marguerite Leffelman, 57, said angrily. Mrs. Leffelman drives a
school bus, and as she pulled out to make her morning rounds she
could be heard singing, her voice breaking, ``Happy school days,
happy school days.''
   Mel Heckman, president of the First Bank of Princeton, had no
sympathy for the Leffelmans.
   ``If you think these people are broke, you're crazy,'' Heckman
said. ``They've got money. They tried to offer us $375,000 to
settle this thing.''
   Leffelman, 59, loaded the last few belongings from a
stripped-down ranch-style house into his pickup truck just before
the 7 a.m. eviction deadline.
   ``I'll be back,'' he said as he drove away from the land where
the couple had raised livestock, grain and a family. About 200
friends and relatives joined Monday for a ceremonial last meal _ a
pot luck spread in a farm-machine shed, Mrs. Leffelman said.
   ``It was great to see how many friends were out there,'' she
said of the dinner sponsored by the Farm Support Group of Sterling.
   Taking possession of the 440-acre Leffelman spread was a major
step toward settling debts, said Steve Kouri, an attorney
representing the bank. But a dozen lawsuits remain unresolved and
there is more property to be claimed.
   In the meantime, the farm is under guard ``because we've had all
kinds of hearsay threats that the place is going to be torched,''
Kouri said.
   ``Two or three grain bins are missing from the farm and they're
worth upwards of $30,000 apiece. There's machinery missing that
Leffelman valued at $75,000 that we intend to find.
   ``There's a problem with another 240-acre tract of land that
somebody is farming illegally,'' he said. ``If we catch them,
they're going to be arrested.''
   Kouri contends the Leffelman's youngest son, Terry, 27, lives on
that tract.
   ``We're not going to chase them down to the far corners of the
earth ... but we're not going to let them use our equipment on our
land. They still owe us hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Kouri
said.
   The Leffelmans surrendered their home quietly after several
months of fighting the bank, a battle that included a two-month
stint in jail for Leffelman and sparked angry protests by fellow
farmers on the Bureau County courthouse steps.
   Lee County Ciruit Judge Martin Hill had ordered the Leffelmans
to leave their farm 100 miles west of Chicago on Tuesday or face
trespassing charges. Edward Leffelman and his wife, Susan, also
were ordered to vacate their home on the property.
   The Leffelmans recently filed for protection under Chapter 12 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a special section for financially
troubled farmers. But the Bankruptcy Court in Rockford ruled they
did not meet the requirements.

<HEAD>Storms Bring Heavy Rain, Hail to Much of East Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled over much of the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday,
pelting some South Atlantic states with hail as big as golf balls
and dumping over four inches of rain on parts of Pennsylvania.
   Thunderstorms stretched from Florida to western Virginia and
dropping hail on many areas, particularly in the Carolinas.
   Golf ball-sized hail hit several parts of South Carolina,
including St. Matthews in the center of the state and Spartanburg
and Cherokee Counties on the state's northern border. The hail
inflicted heavy damage on peach crops in the border counties.
   ``It just literally beat them (the peaches) off the trees ... 80
percent of them. The rest are just torn up,'' Spartanburg County
agricultural extension agent George W. Bowen said Tuesday.
   Iredell County in west-central North Carolina was peppered with
1\-inch hail. Smaller hail fell on several other areas in the
Carolinas, northern Georgia and western Virginia.
   The storms produced locally heavy rain, with West Palm Beach,
Fla., receiving nearly three-quarters of an inch during a one-hour
period late in the morning.
   Rain was heavy in the mid-Atlantic states. In south-central
Pennsylvania, Cashtown received up to 4{ inches of rain during the
early afternoon.
   In the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT, about three-quarters of an
inch of rain as recorded at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, and
at Allentown, Pa.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also extended from western
Montana through Utah and into southeast California. The storms
generated winds up to 45 mph at Big Piney, Wyo.
   Skies were mostly sunny over the Plains and the Missisippi
Valley, with temperatures in the 60s and 70s in the northern Plains
and the middle Mississippi Valley. Temperatures stayed in the 50s
across the northwest Great Lakes, while readings rose into the 80s
from the central Plains to the Gulf Coast, with parts of southwest
Oklahoma in the low 90s.
   Cloudy skies and temperatures in the 50s and 60s prevailed over
most of the Pacific Coast and temperatures were in the 80s and 90s
across the Southwest deserts.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 43 degrees at Grand
Marais, Minn., to 95 degrees at Biloxi, Miss.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered rain from eastern New
England to the central Appalachians, with numerous thunderstorms
across the mid-Atlantic states. Central and southern Florida also
was expected to get scattered showers and thunderstorms.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for the
northern Plains and central Rockies, and parts of the Pacific
Northwest. The rest of the nation was expected to have mostly sunny
skies.
   Highs were predicted in the 70s or 80s across much of the
nation. Highs were expected to be in the 60s from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies, and from the upper Ohio Valley
through New England; and in the 90s from the Southwest deserts to
northern and central Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle. Highs were
forecast to approach 100 degrees in southwest Texas.

   Israeli troops stopped a guerrilla squad trying
to infiltrate into Israel from Jordan Tuesday and wounded one
guerrilla in the firefight, the army said.
   In other developments Tuesday, the Israeli army disciplined two
soldiers for firing against orders in a village where an Arab
teen-ager was killed, and officials promised to start reopening
West Bank schools.
   The military administration closed 1,199 West Bank schools
nearly four months ago in an effort to to quell unrest. The vow to
begin reopening the schools next Monday was taken as a sign of
Israel's growing view that the 5-month-old Arab uprising is waning.
   Violence persisted, however. Troops wounded a Palestinian who
tried to grab one of their weapons Tuesday in a refugee camp north
of Jerusalem.
   And in central Israel, activists of the anti-Arab Kach Party
hurled eggs at American folk singer Joan Baez and about 30 Israeli
leftists who staged a performance Tuesday outside the Zerifin
military base.
   The military command reported no Israeli casualties in the
attempted infiltration. It said the guerrillas planned to stage an
attack in Israel.
   It was the second reported attempt by guerrillas to sneak into
Israel from Jordan since the Palestinian revolt began in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Dec. 8.
   The army said the guerrillas tried to cross into Israel at about
9 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) near the border kibbutz of Kefar Ruppin on the
banks of the Jordan river 48 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   The wounded guerrilla was captured, the army said.
   The brief military announcement did not say which guerrilla
organization the squad belonged to, and gave no further details.
The army delayed the announcement for more than five hours.
   It was the first reported infiltration attempt from Jordan since
last Dec. 24 and the second in 10 years.
   Ms. Baez, who is in Israel on a concert tour, came to the
Zerifin base to show support for Israeli conscientious objectors
who are being held at the base prison.
   Associated Press photographer Anat Givon said about 15 members
of Kach, which is led by Brooklyn-born Rabbi Meir Kahane,
interrupted the performance, and that scuffles broke out between
the groups.
   Witnesses said three people were detained. Ms. Baez herself was
not hurt. However, she was ordered to leave by police, who revoked
a permit issued to the group earlier.
   Merchants in the occupied lands observed a near-total commercial
strike as Moslems marked the second day of Id el Fitr, a three-day
feast at the end of the Ramadan holy month. Curfews remained in
force on four towns and refugee camps.
   The army said an officer was ``severely reprimanded'' and
another soldier was given a 35-day suspended jail sentence for
firing live ammunition, against military regulations, in the West
Bank village of Azmut on Monday.
   A 15-year-old Arab was shot to death in the village during a
confrontation with Israeli troops. The army says it is
investigating whether the boy was killed by soldiers.
   An army spokesman said the soldier was punished for firing and
the officer was reprimanded for not stopping him.
   ``There are orders of when to shoot, and when not to shoot, and
the commanders decided he fired against regulations,'' the
spokesman said.
   The army lifted a four-day curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city. It also lifted a curfew on the Shati refugee camp in
Gaza, but later declared it a closed military zone, barring
residents from leaving and reporters from entering.
   Since protests began Dec. 8, 190 Palestinians and two Israelis
have been killed.
   Officials said the West Bank schools would be reopened in three
phases starting Monday.
   Olivier Rafovitch, spokesman for the West Bank military
administration, said primary schools would reopen first, allowing
203,000 children to return to classes.
   Rafovitch said plans were to allow 70,000 elementary school
pupils back to school in the last week of May and 37,000 high
school students during the first week of June, ``depending on how
the students behave.''
   The most violent incident Tuesday took place in Kalandia refugee
camp when troops tried to stop an Arab man who was violating a
curfew, an army spokesman said.
   The man got out of his car and tried to seize a soldier's gun,
the spokesman said. The troops opened fire, wounding him in the
abdomen, he said.
   A doctor at nearby Ramallah hospital said Ali Asnan Youssef, 31,
had bruises on his stomach, indicating he had been beaten.

   Australia and New Zealand flew riot
gear to this remote island group Tuesday, the day after a march for
land rights turned into a street battle in which one person was
killed and several were injured.
   Shops were looted and office windows smashed Monday after the
march by 2,000 villagers became violent, and police arrested 30
people, official Vanuatu radio reported.
   All shops and offices in Port Vila, the capital, were closed
Tuesday.
   The radio said many residents spent the night outside Port Vila.
It said security forces fired at a boat in the harbor Tuesday and
arrested a man who failed to stop, but gave no details.
   Prime Minister Walter Lini's government met in emergency session
Tuesday.
   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, is 930 miles
northeast of Australia. It achieved independence in 1980 and has a
population of 130,000, including about 15,000 in Port Vila.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia said he sent a military
C-130 Hercules loaded with gas masks, tear gas canisters and
launchers to help the government with riot control.
   He said Lini requested the equipment. ``In a city with a
population of less than 20,000 it is clear that these disturbances
have been on a very serious scale,'' Hawke told Parliament in
Canberra.
   New Zealand sent similar supplies, but Foreign Minister Russell
Marshall told reporters in Wellington there had been no thought of
sending soldiers.
   ``There has been no request ... for military units,'' he said.
``If the situation deteriorated, we'd have to look at it very
seriously.''
   About 2,000 people from tribes in three villages marched through
Port Vila on Monday to protest the closure last week of the Vila
Urban Land Corp., a government agency that administered leased
tribal land in the capital, the radio said.
   It said protesters began rioting, police fired tear gas and a
police vehicle ran over a man, killing him. The radio said Lini, an
Anglican priest, was not in Port Vila at the time.
   The government said Tuesday it had received a petition from
tribal chiefs saying they would form a new body to collect revenue
from tribal land in the capital. According to the radio, Lini's
government promised land leases would be honored.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday denounced
the exploitation of Latin America's peasant farmers, telling
hundreds of thousands of ``campesinos'' not to be resigned to
poverty.
   ``Although it is true this fertile land that God has given
rewards your efforts abundantly, how many times do those who do the
work fail to reap the benefits?'' the pope declared at a Mass in
Villarrica, a farm center 100 miles southeast of Asuncion.
   Heavy rains disrupted the pope's itinerary on the next to last
day of his four-nation South American visit.
   After the Mass John Paul flew to Mariscal Estigarribia, 335
miles northwest of Asuncion, and spoke to about 5,000 Indians
representing 16 tribes from Paraguay and areas of neighboring
Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia.
   ``Above all, you want to be respected as persons and want your
rights, both human and civil, to be recognized and protected,'' he
told the crowd gathered at the Santa Teresita Mission.
   He urged the Indians ``not to abandon yourselves to despair''
and said ``the church has defended the freedom and dignity of
native people'' in South America since the 16th century.
   The pontiff's last event of the day was a controversial meeting
with civic leaders, including opposition politicians, in Asuncion.
   The meeting with the church-sponsored ``Builders of Society''
was abruptly canceled by the government of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner
last week. The government dropped its ban after the Vatican
protested publicly.
   About 300,000 to 400,000 people stood in ankle-deep water on a
field in Villarrica and burst into applause and song when John Paul
arrived by car from Asuncion instead of by plane as planned.
Officials said the rains made it impossible to land on the dirt
airstrip.
   Paraguay's authoritarian government has harshly repressed
attempts by peasant farmers to organize. The Roman Catholic Church
has given some support to those efforts, and 19 foreign
missionaries have been expelled in the last 20 years.
   Police Monday briefly detained two leaders of the Peasants
Rights Movement, who were arrested along with an American priest
and an union activist. All were freed without explanation.
   Addressing the crowd, John Paul said living a Christian life
``does not mean simply accepting with resignation the difficulties
that you encounter.''
   John Paul cited lack of adequate social benefit for farmers,
``intransigence regarding salaries and unfair contracts and
difficulty in obtaining property'' as ``some of the modern thorns
and thistles that increase the already difficult conditions of your
work.''
   Questions of trade and pricing on the national and international
levels have added to their difficulties, he said.
   The pontiff, speaking from under a thatched canopy, switched
several times from Spanish to Guarani, the Indian language spoken
widely by farmers in this landlocked country of 3.8 million people.
   The pope began the day with an hour-long meeting with more than
1,000 priests, nuns and seminarians in the National Cathedral in
Asuncion.
   He told them they must give preference in their ministry to the
poor ``who in Paraguay, as in so many parts of Latin America,
suffer every kind of privation.''
   ``So many peasants, laborers, workers without employment or
being exploited lack their badly needed bread,'' he said.
   Peasants who were occupying a church in Paraguay's capital ended
a hunger strike and prayer service Tuesday. A spokesman said they
accomplished their goal of bringing their plight to the attention
of the public as well as the local church and Vatican.

   The Rev. Charles Curran, whose views on sex
caused the Vatican to bar him from teaching moral theology at
Catholic University, charged Tuesday that the school broke its
contract by refusing to offer him another ``acceptable'' teaching
assignment.
   ``The board of trustees at Catholic University is not willing to
offer me a position in my area of competence with no strings
attached,'' Curran told reporters. ``I was willing to make a
tremendous amount of concessions. Unfortunately, they were not
willing to accept them.''
   Catholic's board of trustees stripped Curran of his canonical
mission on April 12, prohibiting him from teaching in the
department of theology because his lectures on homosexuality,
abortion and other issues of sexual morality differed from the
Vatican's position.
   But the trustees retained his right as a tenured professor to
teach in another area.
   A faculty committee had gone along with the trustees as long as
Curran, a member of the theology department for more than 20 years,
be offered a position acceptable to him before his canonical
mission was revoked.
   Curran said negotiations with the oard this spring led him to
believe he would be allowed to teach Christian social ethics in the
sociology department, as long as he avoided issues of sexuality and
human reproduction.
   Curran said he was willing to accept such an arrangement,
provided ``the position was truly in the area of my competence,
that I had access to students interested in this area, and that I
was in no other way worse off that I had been in the department of
theology.''
   But he said the trustees have now stipulated that students in
the departments of theology and canon law and the school of
philosophy cannot take Curran's courses for credit, and his courses
cannot be required to satisfy core requirements of the department
of religion and religious education.
   ``They were going to put me over there and isolate me from every
student,'' Curran said. He demanded his classes be open to all
students.
   The university also required that Curran promise in writing he
would not teach Catholic theology.
   ``A breach by Professor Curran of this provision shall
constitute adequate cause for his dismissal from the university,''
the proposed agreement said.
   ``I just cannot sign a statement that says I won't teach
Catholic theology at Catholic University,'' Curran said. ``That's
who I am. It would be untrue.
   ``Basically, this is constructive termination,'' he said.
   Catholic University President William J. Byron said in a
statement: ``The university has been attempting to arrive at a
solution that is faithful to the Holy See's judgment that Father
Curran is unsuitable to teach Catholic theology and that is
respectful of the faculty committee's recommendation that Father
Curran continue to teach moral theology and-or ethics somewhere at
the university.
   ``The university has chosen to offer Father Curran a position in
the field of social ethics in the School of Arts and Sciences,''
Byron said in the statement read by university spokeswoman Anne
Smith. Ms. Smith said this is the same offer that was presented
previously to Curran.
   Curran already has accused the school in a lawsuit with breach
of contract and said he will add to his complaint the assertion
that he was terminated illegally.
   ``This is not a church-state issue,'' said Curran's attorney,
Paul Saunders. ``It's fundamentally a question of breach of
contract.''
   The trial is scheduled for September.
   Curran is finishing a one-year visiting professorship teaching
Catholic studies at Cornell University.

   Soviet soldiers heading home Tuesday
in a 300-vehicle convoy faced the most dangerous stretch of their
three-day journey: a guerrilla-infested gorge north of Kabul.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported that residents of the
Soviet border city of Termez had decorated the streets with
streamers and flags and were preparing a meal for the soldiers.
   Correspondents traveling with the Soviet column leaving
Afghanistan were unable to report on developments after leaving
Kabul, but they were told before departure Monday that the most
perilous portion of the journey north would be through the gorge
and the Salang tunnel in the Hindu Kush mountains.
   Most of the 1,300 Soviet troops in the convoy pulled out of a
base in Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan, early Sunday and
spent the day wending their way along the 88-mile rutted route to
the capital.
   They set off for the Soviet border after a ceremony conducted by
Afghan President Najib. Officers said the journey would take about
three days.
   ``We feel more sure that everything will be OK now,'' one
soldier said above the din of revving tank engines, referring to
the 250-mile trip north.
   But others indicated the convoy would be lucky to escape the
journey without casualties.
   The Soviet television news program ``Vremya'' showed a series of
reports Tuesday night from Afghanistan.
   In the first, a Soviet correspondent reported from an armored
vehicle while rifle fire rang out in the background. He said he was
on the road with the Soviet forces withdrawing from Afghanistan,
but did not say exactly where or comment on the shooting.
   A second report said rebels had hit Jalalabad with six rockets
since the Soviets began pulling out. It showed pictures of dead and
wounded Afghans, but did not say if the casualties were in
Jalalabad.
   Gunshots could be heard in the mountains towering over the
Jalalabad-Kabul route on Sunday, and a pool reporter riding with
the convoy said the travelers felt especially vulnerable on low
ground between mountains from which the anti-communist guerrillas
can take aim.
   Information about the Soviet withdrawal has been relayed from
Kabul by a Reuters news agency pool report. The Associated Press
was denied permission to travel to Afghanistan for the pullout, and
a Soviet Foreign Ministry official said the exclusion was the
result of ``inappropriate questions'' asked during a previous visit
by AP.
   Tass said in a dispatch from Termez, located in the Soviet
republic of Uzbekistan, that ``city streets and squares are decked
out with streamers with words of welcome for the
soldiers-internationalists who have courageously fulfilled their
duty.''
   A meal of mutton, vegetables and pilaf would be waiting for the
soldiers, it said.
   ``We have the great honor to be the first to welcome to the
Soviet land the soldiers who have fulfilled their internationalist
duty in Afghanistan,'' city Communist Party leader Tamara
Dzhurayeva told Tass.
   Tass reported from Kabul that Afghan officials on Monday
presented a note to U.N. observers monitoring the pullout, alleging
that Pakistan was violating conditions of the April 14 agreement
that set out conditions for the Soviet withdrawal. Tass said no
details of the note were made public.
   Under the Geneva accord, Pakistan is to stop aiding the
insurgents.
   Pakistani Foreign Minister Zain Noorani, in Moscow on an
official visit, met with Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov on
Tuesday, and the conversation focused on Afghanistan, Tass said.
   Tass said Noorani was told by Soviet officials that ``in
present-day conditions'' there are better prospects for improving
Soviet-Pakistani relations, apparently referring to the Afghan
peace accord.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a
news briefing Tuesday that the start of the pullout was ``a strong
impulse'' toward success of Najib's policy of national
reconciliation _ a plan laid out two years ago that proposes to
share power with other political groups.
   Gerasimov said the withdrawal refutes accusations that the
Soviets were seeking to conquer the neighboring country with the
hope of obtaining a warm sea port. He also dismissed speculation
that the Soviets were planning to divide Afghanistan with Najib's
government holding the resource-rich northern areas adjacent to the
Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Town Demotes Lieutenant Who Complains Of Racism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Town Council demoted a police
lieutenant and cut his pay by $1,683 because he complained about
the town's racist attitudes, the town police chief said Tuesday.
   But Town Manager Dana Whitman Jr. said the demotion was needed
to eliminate an unnecessary position and was not in retaliation for
complaints by Lt. John C. Herbst.
   ``I don't care what way it's masked, and what way it's put
forth. It's retaliatory,'' countered Police Chief Philip H.
Schnabel.
   Herbst's complaint of ``pervasive racism'' more than a year ago
led to an investigation by the state Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities. The commission issued a report in January that
substantiated Herbst's claims and recommended changes in town
policy to eliminate racism.
   In addition to the demotion and pay cut, Herbst will be forced
to work a rotating shift on nights and weekends. He currently works
daytime hours and no weekends.
   ``It's really upsetting,'' Herbst said Tuesday. He declined
further comment on the Town Council's action, but his attorney said
a lawsuit would be filed as soon as possible in federal court.
   ``There's simply no question this is punishment for blowing the
whistle on racism in the Police Department,'' said John Williams,
representing Herbst. ``The people who did this are going to have to
pay for it. They've aligned themselves with the racism cancer in
that town.''
   William Olds, executive director of the Connecticut Civil
Liberties Union, said the organization would discuss the case later
this week at a meeting.
   Rocky Hill, a well-to-do Hartford suburb of about 16,000
residents, including about 330 blacks, has 28 police officers.
   Herbst complained that racial jokes and slurs were common at
Town Hall and tolerated by town officials. He also said some police
officers were in the habit of making stops based on a suspect's
race.
   Whitman termed Herbst's demotion as a ``reduction in force,''
which is allowed under the town's contract with the local police
union. He said when council members decided to eliminate one of the
department's three lieutenant positions, they had no idea Herbst
would be the officer affected.
   Herbst and the other lieutenants all achieved their rank the
same day in 1982. Herbst, the department's administrative
assistant, was considered the senior lieutnenant since that time
because he had the highest score on the lieutenant's test.
   But the Town Council decided seniority should be based on the
length of employment, leaving Herbst with the least seniority.
Herbst was hired in 1976.
   Whitman also said the idea for cutting a lieutenant's position
``came up at a budget meeting'' last month. He said the chief told
town leaders that the duties performed by Herbst duplicated those
handled by Deputy Chief Robert Riley.
   Schnabel agreed that the job description for Riley and Herbst
are similar, but complained that the council was forcing him to
choose between the two men. Riley said that his job and Herbst's
are not in fact similar.

   Moscow Mayor Valery Saikin, visiting
Dublin for the Irish capital's 1,000th birthday celebration,
sampled some American fast food Tuesday.
   He ate a Big Mac at a McDonald's restaurant and then stopped at
a Kentucky Fried Chicken store to try its fare.
   McDonald's recently signed a contract to open 20 restaurants in
the Soviet Union. Kentucky Fried Chicken sent vice president Robert
Thiess from Louisville to Dublin to meet with Saikin.
   The mayor told Thiess that Kentucky Fried Chicken might be
considered for a Moscow deal. ``We will learn from them all, and
then take the best,'' he said.

   Militant rightists hurled eggs at
American folk singer Joan Baez when she took part Tuesday in a
rally backing Israeli soldiers who refuse to serve in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Ms. Baez was not hit, said Associated Press photographer Anat
Givon.
   The attack came as the singer and about 30 Israelis demonstrated
outside this military base, 8 miles south of Tel Aviv, where some
of the conscientious objectors are being held.
   Ms. Baez, 47, who is on a concert tour, was giving an impromptu
performance when about 15 members of the anti-Arab Kach movement
heckled her.
   A scuffle ensued and saome Kach members threw eggs.
   Three Kach members were detained, Israel radio said. Kach is an
extreme right-wing movement led by Brooklyn-born Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   Police did not question Ms. Baez but ordered her to leave the
area after revoking a demonstration permit issued earlier.
   The rally was organized by Yesh Gvul, Hebrew for ``There is a
Limit,'' a group organized by reserve soldiers and officers who
refuse to serve in or carry out Israel's policies in the occupied
lands. The organization was founded after Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon.
   Ms. Baez arrived in Israel on May 11 at the invitation of Peace
Now, an organization that supports territorial concessions in
return for peace with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   The folk singer has said she would donate the proceeds from her
two concerts in Israel to Peace Now and other anti-war groups.
   During her tour, Ms. Baez has performed at a Palestinian refugee
camp and met with Jewish activist Natan Sharansky, who spent nine
years in a Soviet prison before being allowed to emigrate to Israel.
   On Monday, Ms. Baez had a dispute with editors at Israel's army
radio. She accused radio officials of censorship after they
canceled a live broadcast of her performance because she sang an
Israeli protest song banned by the station.
   Army radio later broadcast an edited version of the performance,
leaving out the song, ``Shooting and Crying,'' which criticizes
army methods in the occupied lands.

<TEXT>
   The screening Tuesday of Chen Kaige's
``The King of the Children'' at the 41st Cannes Film Festival
marked the first time a film from China has been in the official
selection, the most important category.
   Kaige, 36, is a leading figure in the new Chinese cinema. His
formative years were dominated by China's Cultural Revolution, the
radical upheaval from 1966-76.
   ``The King of the Children'' is set in the late 1970s, and Kaige
indicated his approval of aspects of the Cultural Revolution.
   ``Man invented culture and became its slave,'' Kaige told a news
conference. ``The fire in the last scene symbolizes my attitude
toward the traditional culture.''
   ``The King of the Children'' _ as teachers were once known in
China _ is Lao Gar. He is sent to a village school in a remote area
in Yunnan province where he is confronted by children who learn to
read and write by copying, without understanding the information
from the teacher.
   The teacher abandons the established teaching program with its
official manual and encourages the students to use their
imagination and write essays about their lives.
   The unorthodox methods provoke officials and district
authorities expel him from the school.
   The story reflects elements of Kaige's experiences.
   Kaige was sent to work in the country under the re-education
plan adopted in 1968 as part of the Cultural Revolution. The plan
sent students from the cities to rural areas to work in the fields
and learn about peasant life.
   In the film, Lao Gar spends seven years as a farm laborer before
receiving the teaching post.
   ``I had the same age as the teacher and received the same
education, full of big words and devoid of sense,'' Kaige said.
``We didn't know how to construct our own personality.''
   China's new leadership introduced reforms following the end of
the Cultural Revolution and Communist Party leader Mao Tse-tung's
death in September 1976.
   Kaige, commenting on the current situation in China, said, ``The
fact that I was able to make `The King of the Children' is a sign
of good health.''

   A remote Scottish island contaminated with
dangerous bacteria during World War II experiments was declared
safe after a government cleanup, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.
   The 520-acre island of Gruinard will be offered to the original
owner, a family trust, for $930, the price paid by the government
when it took it over in 1941, the ministry said in its annual paper
on the defense budget.
   The ministry spent two years using the island off the western
Scottish Highlands to test bombs containing anthrax bacteria in the
belief that Nazi Germany was doing something similar. The bacteria
can be fatal to humans.
   Briton subsequently passed the test results to the United
States, which began making anthrax bombs.
   In 1979, government tests showed only 10 acres were still
contaminated.
   Last year, a company with experience in soil-decontamination
began treating the soil with a mixture of sea water and
formaldehyde. When that appeared to work, sheep were taken to the
island for study.

   A burning Spanish supertanker exploded at
Iran's Larak Island oil terminal Tuesday, killing crew members on
tugs that were fighting fires started by an Iraqi air raid last
weekend.
   The unofficial toll of dead and missing already stood at 22 from
the raid Saturday that damaged five ships.
   Several explosions ran through the 235,000-ton Barcelona, which
had been beached in shallow water, just after noon. Lloyd's
Shipping Intelligence Unit in London said four tugs were attending
it at the time.
   It reported ``all crew lost'' on the tugboat Scan Force and
three dead on the Beaufort, and said the tugs Safir and Ferdinand
Verbiest were damaged. A salvage tug normally has nine or 10 crew
members.
   Lloyd's said it ``understood'' the Scan Force sank and said the
other three had left for the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf,
where Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   An earlier report from Lloyd's had said five crewmen were
reported missing from the Scan Force, a Panamanian-flag tug, and
two from the Belgian vessel Ferdinand Verbiest. There was no
immediate explanation for the differences.
   Shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
had reports of bodies washing onto the rocks of Larak Island, in
the narrow Strait of Hormuz that leads into the gulf, and the
bodies might be those of dead tug crewmen.
   Iran uses shuttle tankers to ferry oil from its main Kharg
Island export terminal in the northern gulf to makeshift terminals
at Larak and Sirri islands in safer waters about 450 miles down the
gulf. Iraqi warplanes make occasional raids on the southern
terminals, refueling in flight.
   At the United Nations in New York, diplomatic sources said
Tuesday that Iraq had accepted Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar's call for negotiations outside New York to help set dates
for a cease-fire. It attached the usual condition that Iran also
must accept.
   Perez de Cuellar has not received a response from Iran, which
insists Iraq must be declared the aggressor before there can be a
cease-fire. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several
border incidents.
   Iranian leaders threatened on Tuesday to block all petroleum
exports from the gulf and exhorted followers of the fundamentalist
Shiite Moslem regime to pray for the deaths of President Reagan and
Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq.
   President Ali Khamenei said at prayers ending the Moslem holy
month of Ramadan that, if Iran's oil exports were cut off, ``there
would be no way for any other country to do the same through the
waterway.''
   Iraq raids Iran's terminals and the shuttle tankers it owns and
charters in an attempt to halt the oil exports with which it
finances the war. Iraq sends most of its oil abroad by pipeine.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, was
quoted by Tehran radio as saying the best prayer for Reagan and
Hussein would be ``to wish them to die'' because ``the more they
stay alive, the worse their situation will become.''
   A U.S. Navy ship dropped a ceremonial wreath in waters of the
central gulf on the first anniversary Tuesday of another Iraqi air
strike, a mistaken missile attack on the missile frigate U.S. Stark
that killed 37 sailors.
   Lt. Cmdr. Jerry McNabb, a Navy chaplain, conducted memorial
ceremony on the destroyer Stump at about 4 p.m. in the area where
the frigate was hit. A 24-man honor guard and seven-member rifle
team took part, and the oldest and youngest members of the Stump's
crew dropped the wreath over the side.
   The Stump is in the gulf to replace the Samuel B. Roberts, a
sister ship of the Stark that was damaged by a mine last month.
   Shipping executives identified the tanker attacked by Iraqi
warplanes Monday as the 112,445-ton Bisoton, formerly Norwegian and
now owned by Iran.
   It was the 12th attack on a ship Iraq had reported in 18 days.
Six have been confirmed.
   In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence said the Bisoton was
hit off Iran. Gulf shipping executives said 10 crew members were
killed.

   A second employee of the British Broadcasting
Corp. died Tuesday in an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at BBC
headquarters, a public health office said.
   Five people were seriously ill among the 39 known cases of the
disease in and around the BBC, and 44 more cases are suspected, the
Westminster Public Health Office said.
   A 53-year-old man working as an assistant manager in charge of
studios was hospitalized May 10 and died Tuesday, the office said.
   A 63-year-old cleaning supervisor, Jim Morgan, one of the first
cases diagnosed in the outbreak between mid-April and early May,
died last Thursday.
   Legionnaires' disease produces symptoms similar to pneumonia and
often is caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning
units. The BBC said its air systems in Broadcasting House and a
nearby building had been disinfected.
   The disease was diagnosed first in 1976 when 221 people
contracted it at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention in
Philadelphia.

   Clusters of olive-green parachutes
drifted down to a Mediterranean beach Tuesday in a group jump by
120 paratroop veterans, most of them Americans, to mark Israel's
40th anniversary.
   Three U.S.-built C-130 Hercules transports circled the dunes of
Palmachim Beach, about 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, to drop the
members of the International Association of Airborne Veterans.
   ``This is my show of support for Israel,'' said Jim Costa, 58,
of Charlestown, N.H., who said he lost his left leg in the Korean
War and has jumped five times since with an artifical one.
   ``I also wanted to make this my last jump and I thought there's
no better place to do it than the place where Christ walked,'' said
Costa, wiping sweat from his face as he moved toward a table laden
with cakes and fruits.
   Some paratroopers came to express solidarity with Israel, but
others said a sense of adventure attracted them.
   Cleo Crouch of Boca Raton, Fla., at age 72 the oldest jumper,
said: ``I landed on my butt and my back hurts a little, but I'm
fine.''
   Crouch, a retired trucking company owner, said Tuesday's jump
was his third. He said he first parachuted over the Rhine River on
a combat mission in March 1945, then tried a freefall on a dare in
1985.
   ``Everybody thinks I'm crazy,'' said Crouch. ``Where I live, the
guys my age are just sitting around smoking, drinking beer and
eating too much. I feel I can do everything I want to.''
   In addition to 80 Americans, the group included 30 West Germans,
a few Britons and Canadians, a jumper from Denmark and one from
Singapore.
   It was the Chicago-based association's second jump over Israel
since its founding five years ago. The last jump it organized was
in Taiwan in November.
   Karl Houy, 43, a physician from Neuenkirchen, West Germany, said
he participated to overcome fear that began when he broke his leg
jumping in 1983.
   ``I was scared and I wanted to prove to myself that I can still
do it,'' he said. ``I have to tell you, though, that I didn't see
much of the view. I just wanted to get down safely.''

   The government-run
broadcasting network assailed the pro-sanctions position of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Tuesday and challenged the Anglican
Church to say if it supports or rejects Tutu's stance.
   Tutu, the first black to head the Anglican Church in South
Africa, was completing a U.S. tour where he appealed for additional
U.S. economic sanctions to protest South Africa's apartheid
policies.
   ``Archbishop Tutu has never been voted into a public office that
gives him the right to claim a significant constituency,'' the
South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a commentary.
   The statement failed to note that Tutu, like all of the nation's
26 million blacks, is ineligible to vote or be elected to national
political office.
   The SABC also said, without elaborating, that the Anglican
Church ``is deeply divided as a result of his (Tutu's) political
utterances.''
   ``What is the church's stand on the widely held view that
sanctions will bring deprivation and hardship in increasing numbers
to black South Africans?'' the SABC asked.
   ``The church owes it not only to parishoners but to all South
Africans to state unequivocally where the church stands on
sanctions, disinvestments, and their consequences.''
   Anglican Church officials could not be reached for comment
despite repeated telephone calls to their offices.
   The government has attacked Tutu in harsh tones on a number of
issues. In March, President P.W. Botha sent a letter to Tutu and
other church leaders saying they ``love and embrace'' the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla group.
   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,
hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' Botha said.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, has continued to
call for sanctions and other forms of international pressure as the
most likely ways to bring about race reform in South Africa.
   The U.S. Congress imposed limited sanctions against South Africa
in 1986, banning the import of selected goods and stopping direct
air links between the two countries. Congress now is considering
much tougher legislation that would ban almost all bilateral
economic activity.
   Under apartheid, a racially segregated society is established by
law and custom, with the 5 million whites controlling the economy
and maintaining separate districts, schools and health services.

   A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that
a psychiatric hospital's officials could be sued in connection with
the 1985 rape and murder of one hospital patient by another.
   In two 3-0 decisions, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected attempts by Napa State Hospital officials to dismiss suits
filed by the victim's estate and her psychiatrist.
   The court said the victim, Marilyn Conners, was lured from her
ward to a remote part of the hospital grounds by John Duncan, who
raped and strangled her.
   Duncan had been admitted to the hospital after entering an
insanity plea to a separate charge of rape and murder. He also had
tried to rape another female patient about two weeks before his
attack on Ms. Conners, but still was allowed to roam the hospital
grounds, the court said.
   Duncan later pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and
assault with intent to commit rape of Ms. Conners.
   Ms. Conners' heirs sued five hospital administrators claiming
gross negligence and reckless indifference to patient safety in
allowing patients hospitalized on criminal charges to walk around
the grounds.
   Dr. William Schwartzman, a staff psychiatrist who treated Ms.
Conners, sued two administrators after he was fired in 1985
following disputes with management over the previous three years.
He claimed his dismissal was motivated partly by his public
criticism of the hospital for allegedly administering too many
drugs, providing unsafe working conditions and inadequately
supervising Duncan.
   Tuesday's rulings upheld earlier decisions by two federal judges
who refused to dismiss the suits.
   Although government officials have some protection from
lawsuits, the immunity does not apply to violations of clearly
established rights, said the opinions written by Judge Alfred
Goodwin. He said the suits would meet that test if plaintiffs can
prove that hospital officials were indifferent to patient safety
and that Schwartzman was fired because of his criticism.

<TEXT>
   The European Space Agency on
Tuesday launched its 22nd Ariane rocket, putting into orbit a
communications satellite.
   Officials at the space center on the northeastern shoulder of
South America called the launch ``a complete success.''
   The countdown had been stopped for 15 minutes at 8:37 p.m.
because of bad weather conditions.
   ``A storm cloud passed over the launching pad,'' a space agency
official said. The countdown was resumed at 8:52 p.m. and the
rocket lifted off at 8:58 p.m.
   Sixteen minutes and 40 seconds later, the International
Telecommunications Organization satellite separated from the
rocket, according to the official.
   The agency said the flight was ``nominal,'' or perfect, except
for the brief weather problem.
   New French Premier Michel Rocard watched the operation from the
space agency's facility in suburban Paris.
   Four of the previous 21 Ariane shots were unsuccessful. A
failure in 1986 grounded the program for more than a year, but the
last three launches have been a success, including the previous one
on March 12.
   The Intelsat V-F13 satellite put into geostationary orbit 22,500
miles above the Earth is part of a series of 15 satellites built by
an international consortium headed by Ford Aerospace. The satellite
contains 15,000 telephone circuits and two television channels.
   Tuesday's launch involved an Ariane 2 rocket.
   On a nearby pad other crews are preparing for the first launch
of the larger Ariane 4 rocket that can carry 4.2 tons into orbit _
nearly double the Ariane 2 payload. The Ariane 4 launch is
scheduled for June 8.
   The European Space Agency now has 44 launches on its order
books. It plans a total of eight in 1988 and nine in 1989 and 1990.
   Ariane launches cost between $53 million and $105 million,
depending on the version.

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel rejected
the advice of an advisory committee Tuesday and declared a national
historic landmark the Maryland farm where Whittaker Chambers hid
the ``pumpkin papers'' that convicted Alger Hiss.
   Chambers was ``a figure of transcendent importance in the
nation's history,'' Hodel said in a speech to the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative group.
   Hodel, a staunch conservative who like many in the modern
conservative movement acknowledges an intellectual and
philosophical debt to Chambers, himself nominated Pipe Creek Farm
in Westminster, Md., for landmark status.
   Westminster is about 30 miles northwest of Baltimore. The farm
is operated by Chambers' son, John.
   He was supported by the staff of the National Park Service,
which administers the landmark program.
   William Penn Mott, director of the service, wrote Hodel that the
staff concluded ``that Whittaker Chambers was exceptionally
significant and that the farm represents that significance with the
requisite degree of historical integrity.''
   Both the Maryland state historic preservation office and a
professional review committee, including outside historians,
supported the designation but the advisory board of the National
Park Service on April 26 opposed it.
   The board cited the service guideline that 50 years should
elapse before designation of landmarks to give historians time for
an objective assessment.
   ``I appreciate that the board disagrees but I do not chose to
follow its advice in this instance,'' said Hodel.
   The chairman of the advisory panel, Daniel Jordan, was
philosophical about the secretary's rejection of its advice.
   ``I'm surprised and disappointed. I felt the advisory board had
met its obligation in a serious manner, and had made the correct
decision,'' said Jordan, who is head of the Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation in Charlottesville, Va., in a statement relayed
by an aide.
   ``But I also recognize that the board is responsible only for
making a recommendation, and that the final decision always rests
with the secretary of the interior.''
   Bruce Craig, cultural resources specialist for the National
Parks and Conservation Association, a private group that lobbies
for policies to benefit the parks, said interior secretaries had
disregarded the 50-year rule before, but it was the first time in
memory that one had overruled the advisory board.
   Hodel's disregard of the 50-year rule ``constitutes a threat to
the preservation program insofar as it represents a politicization
of the program,'' Craig said.
   It was 40 years ago that Chambers, then an editor at Time
Magazine, accused Hiss, a former State Department official who had
been secretary of the founding conference of the United Nations, of
being a fellow member of a communist spy ring in the late 1930s.
   At first not many people believed Chambers, a rumpled figure
with bad teeth who looked seedy in comparison with the patrician,
Harvard-educated Hiss, then head of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
   Hiss denied the allegation before the House Un-American
Activities Committee and sued Chambers for libel.
   But a young committee member named Richard Nixon followed up,
and for him Chambers retrieved copies of 1937 State Department
documents from a hollowed-out pumpkin.
   Hiss was indicted for perjury. Prosecutors were able to prove
that the documents had been typed on a machine owned by Hiss.
   Convicted, Hiss served 44 months in prison. His libel suit was
dismissed. He has maintained his innocence ever since, in two
volumes of memoirs and elsewhere, and has declined to comment about
the landmark discussions.
   Chambers died in 1961. President Reagan awarded him a Medal of
Freedom posthumously in 1984.

   The hotly contested post of tree warden was
won by John Morandi in a landslide Tuesday. Now all he has to do is
figure out what the job entails.
   The post was vacant for a year and has a total budget of $50,
but to everyone's surprise, including the candidates', four people
sought the job during a March 29 caucus in this little Berkshire
Hills town.
   Only the top two vote-getters at the caucus won a place on
Tuesday's ballot. According to the unofficial tally, Morandi won
with 42 votes to Louise Hardy's 20.
   With only about 250 registered voters, Alford has had trouble
frequently getting enough candidates to fill its ballot. Tree
warden was the only contested office out of 17 on Tuesday's ballot.
   ``You'd think they were running for president,'' said Helene
Morandi, wife of the winner. She said her husband is retired and
decided to run because he thought no one else would.
   In campaigning, Hardy had pledged that, ``If elected, I'll find
out what the job entails.''
   A former tree warden, David Germain, summed up the duties: ``The
important thing in this job is not to cut down any trees before the
owners are told about it.''

   Fire broke out at a major suburban
Manila department store and burned out of control until Wednesday
morning, almost 12 hours later, fire officials said. Three people,
including two firefighters, were injured.
   The blaze broke out about 9:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. EDT) Tuesday on
the second floor of the Shoemart Department store in a shopping
center in Makati and quickly spread to three of the building's four
stories, officials said.
   They said the fire was brought under control about 9 a.m.
Wednesday. The store was closed when the fire began. Besides the
two injured firefighters, a store employee suffered smoke
inhalation.
   There was no immediate estimate of damage.
   The store is in the Makati Commercial Center, which includes two
luxury hotels _ the Manila Garden and the Intercontinental. The
hotels were not threatened and no guests were evacuated.

<HEAD>GSA Judge Affirms AT&T Charges of Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge ruled Tuesday
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. was treated unfairly by the
General Services Administration and awarded AT&T four
telecommunications contracts previously won by regional Bell
telephone companies.
   However, Judge Vincent LaBella, ruling for the GSA's Board of
Contract Appeals, found that bias against AT&T was not pervasive
and refused to award the company three other contracts it sought.
   AT&T had appealed the contract awards, charging that GSA
discriminated against the long-distance leader in favor of the
regional Bell companies in its evaluation of AT&T's bid and by
leaking secret information about the bid to its competitors.
   AT&T said it was pleased with the board's decision, but
spokesman Herb Linnen said ``above all, we remain gravely concerned
about the larger implications of the GSA's conduct in this entire
matter. Clearly, based on today's decision, something must be done
to restore public confidence in the integrity of the GSA's
procurements.''
   The procurement, for 12 large electronic switches in the
government's long-distance telephone network, raised concerns about
GSA's handling of bids on contracts for an all-new federal phone
system known as FTS 2000, worth as much as $25 billion over 10
years.
   But GSA, in a statement reacting to the decision, assured that
the people who worked on the switch contracts ``are not responsible
for the evaluation of FTS 2000.'' The agency also noted it has
taken steps to ensure security of the FTS 2000 procurement,
including restricting access to information about bids.
   The seven disputed contracts and five won by AT&T _ worth a
total of $55 million are being investigated by the GSA's inspector
general's office, the Justice Department and the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
   LaBella's decision, with which the other two board members
concurred, affirmed many of AT&T's charges, including the claim
that GSA engineer Sureshar L. Soni leaked confidential AT&T price
information.
   The judge said Soni ``resorted to an auction technique'' by
disclosing the price to beat to AT&T's competitors. He also said
Soni improperly accepted gratuities in the form of meals from
BellSouth and should not have participated in the contract
procurement at all because his daughter was employed by BellSouth.
   Soni, who has been reassigned within GSA, refused to answer
questions about his role in the procurement, invoking his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination in a deposition during
the course of the board's investigation. He also refused to answer
questions about his daughter, Neelam Soni, who was hired by
BellSouth as a manager-trainee in April 1987 when bids were being
formulated.
   LaBella ordered the two switch contracts previously won by
BellSouth to be given to AT&T because of the disclosures concerning
Soni. Earlier in the board's investigation, BellSouth offered to
give up the contracts because an internal probe indicated the
company's bid may have been tainted.
   The judge also ordered contracts won by Bell Atlantic for a
switch in Philadelphia and by Pacific Bell for a switch in San
Francisco be turned over to AT&T. He said the GSA discriminated
against AT&T in evaluating its bid for the switches and failed to
provide AT&T sufficient information about certain GSA policies.
   He ordered the GSA to re-evaluate bids for a Seattle switch, won
by US West, but he left undisturbed contract awards to Bell
Atlantic for a switch in Washington, and to US West for a switch in
Minneapolis.
   He also termed as frivolous GSA's attempt to turn the tables on
AT&T by charging that the company also may have received
confidential pricing information and used it to develop its bids.
   In conclusion, LaBella said bias and bid-leaking by GSA
``resulted in less than fair treatment of AT&T,'' but he said AT&T
``failed to establish that any of these actions were taken with the
specific intent of harming AT&T or benefitting the RBOCs (regional
Bell holding companies).''
   He attributed the GSA mishandling of the bids to personnel who
``operated with less than a masterful understanding of the actual
requirements of GSA and of the terms and conditions of the
solicitation.''

<HEAD>Judge Declares Mistrial In Fraud Case Involving Ex-Dukakis Aide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial Tuesday in the
fraud and conspiracy trial of a businessman accused of
participating in a kickback scheme with Gerard Indelicato, former
top education adviser to Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Indelicato, who pleaded guilty last month to participating in
the scheme, testified against Michael Freedman two weeks ago.
Indelicato won a recommendation from federal prosecutors for a
reduced sentence in exchange for his cooperation with what
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Gants called an ``ongoing
investigation.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Woodlock declared the mistrial
Tuesday afternoon after a 12-member jury was unable to reach a
unanimous verdict on one count of mail fraud and one count of
conspiracy.
   The key issue on which the jury appeared to be stumped was
whether the prosecution had proved willfulness on Freedman's part
in accepting kickback money. After the jury raised that question
Tuesday morning, Judge Woodlock reiterated instructions.
   Later in the day, as the deadlock continued, Gants asked that
the jury be queried specifically on whether they could find
Freedman guilty on either of the two counts. The answer was no.
Freedman's defense attorney, John Burns, moved for a mistrial and
Woodlock granted the motion.
   Woodlock set a new trial date for July 11.
   ``It's analagous to a baseball team playing to a 2-2 tie in the
ninth and it rains,'' Gants said.
   Burns did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Indelicato testified that the kickback scheme involved skimming
some $80,000 from two adult education programs between 1979 and
1983. Indelicato headed the state's adult education program at the
time the scheme got under way.
   According to Indelicato's testimony, the conspiracy involved
using federal funds administered by the state to pay more rent than
necessary for classroom space and then splitting the difference
among Freedman, Indelicato, his brother Joseph and a fourth
conspirator, Antonio Perrotta.
   All but Freedman have already pleaded guilty. Gants said it
would be ``a mischaracterization'' to say Indelicato agreed to
plead guilty and win a recommendation for a lesser sentence solely
in exchange for his testimony in the Freedman trial. But the
federal prosecutor declined to specify in what other matters
Indelicato is cooperating with authorities.
   Indelicato is scheduled to be sentenced July 8, three days
before the new Freedman trial is set to begin. Gants declined to
say whether Indelicato would testify in the new trial.
   Prosecutors agreed to recommend to Judge Woodlock that
Indelicato receive a five-year prison term and pay an $80,000 fine.
Woodlock could exceed that recommendation if he chose.
   Gants called the recommended punishment ``a very fair sentence.''
   Indelicato became Dukakis' education adviser in March 1983, two
months after the conspiracy alleged by the government ended. While
he worked for Dukakis' election bid in 1982, Indelicato testified,
he was receiving cash kickbacks of hundreds of dollars per month
from the adult education program.
   ``It was a regular income, if you will, for all of us,''
Indelicato testified during Freedman's trial.
   Indelicato said Freedman accepted his share and was aware of
where the money was coming from. But his testimony did not depict
Freedman as one of the architects of the scheme.

<TEXT>
   A deadlocked jury forced a judge to declare
a mistrial Tuesday in a $1.3 million suit filed by two teen-agers
against the heavy metal band Motley Crue for injuries allegedly
suffered at a 1985 concert.
   The jury told Limestone County Circuit Judge Henry Blizzard that
they were at an impasse on their second day of deliberations, court
reporter Regeana Gentry said.
   ``We will put it on the next civil docket,'' she said of the
case.
   Foreman Marshall Mitchell of Athens said later that 10 jurors
believed the California-based rock band was not at fault and two
wanted to award damages because ``somebody should pay.''
   Attorneys for the injured teen-agers claimed the special effects
display at the Huntsville concert propelled dry ice into the
audience where Robbie Miller, 17, of Piney Chapel, and David Hunt
Wright, 19, of Grant, were standing in front of the stage.
   Miller lost his right eye and Wright contends he suffered facial
cuts.
   Before sending the case to the jury, Blizzard dismissed the City
of Huntsville as a defendant based on insufficient evidence, and
the plaintiffs' attorneys dropped the band's promoters from the
suit.
   Jimmy Alexander, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said they
will file for reinstatement of the city as a co-defendant within
the next few days. He said he and the teen-agers' other attorneys
believe the dismissal of the city as a defendant was a major factor
in the jury deadlock.
   Mitchell said most jurors were sympathetic to the plaintiffs,
but insufficient proof of ``something coming off the stage''
produced the deadlock.
   ``Someone could have thrown a bottle; there are a lot of things
that could have happened, and if you go to one of those rock
concerts you are likely to see anything going on,'' he said.
   The trial, which began May 9, drew crowds of young fans trying
to catch a glimpse of band member Nikki Sixx, who was in the
courtroom daily.

<TEXT>
   A single-engine airplane crashed
Tuesday into a ditch beside a dirt road on the outskirts of
Albuquerque, killing all five people aboard, authorities said.
   Four adults and one child died in the crash, which witnesses
said occurred about 5 p.m., when it was raining, Albuquerque police
Sgt. R.C. Porter said.
   The airplane was attempting to land at nearby Coronado Airport,
Porter said. It aborted its first attempt and was coming in for a
second try when it crashed, he said.
   State police said the red-and-white Cessna P210, which seats six
people, was from Salt Lake City.
   Identities of the victims were not immediately available. The
bodies were taken to the Office of the Medical Investigator in
Albuquerque.
   Walter Ramazzini Jr., 17, of Albuquerque, said he was sitting
about 100 yards from the airplane when it crashed.
   ``He was going east, making a left turn from the airport,''
Ramazzini said. ``A gust of wind hit him from right to left.
   ``He did three banks. The wind made him bank to the left 30
degrees or so. To correct for that, he banked right and he kept
going and passed level flight as if to turn right,'' Ramazzini said.
   ``To correct again for that, he went again to the left ... and
went nose-first into the ground,'' said Ramazzini, a student pilot.
``He hit the ground and cartwheeled over.
   ``All I saw was a puff of smoke,'' he said.
   The airplane ``wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet,'' Ramazzini
said. ``The weather was gusty and showery. It was sprinkling.''
   He said he was among the first four people at the crash site.
   ``We went up there and there was nobody alive,'' Ramazzini said.
``You could smell fuel. We were looking for fire extinguishers.''
He said the witnesses thought the airplane might blow up, so they

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday
emphasized the importance of public participation in government in
a meeting with government opponents that Gen. Alfredo Stroessner
initially tried to block.
   It is impossible to speak of liberty and democracy, the Roman
Catholic leader said, ``where there is no real participation of all
citizens in making the great decisions that affect the life and
future of the nation.''
   Stroessner, who has ruled since 1954, calls Paraguay a democracy
but it is widely regarded as a dictatorship.
   The pope was nearing the end of a four-nation South American
trip that has taken him to Uruguay, Bolivia and Peru. He was to
leave for Rome on Wednesday, his 68th birthday.
   The Asuncion meeting with the church-sponsored ``Builders of
Society'' was abruptly canceled by Paraguay last week, the first
time a government had taken such action during any of the pope's 37
foreign trips. Stroessner's regime agreed to lift the ban after the
Vatican protested.
   A block of about 60 white plastic chairs sat empty on the floor
of the enclosed sports stadiy of a company closing the door on the God-given
right of a woman to bear children,'' Ciresi said.
   But Strain said attorneys for Mrs. Kociemba would be introducing
evidence not central to the issues involved in the case.
   ``This is a case about whether they (the plaintiffs) have met
the burden of proving that the Copper-7 caused the infertility of
Mrs. Kociemba,'' Strain said.
   The Kociembas are asking for an unspecified amount in
compensatory and punitive damages for injuries, including
infertility, that Mrs. Kociemba allegedly suffered as a result of
using a Copper-7 IUD for about 1{ years in 1977 and 1978.
   Ciresi called as his first witness a doctor who testified that
inserting an IUD can introduce bacteria into the normally sterile
uterus.
   Dr. Richard L. Sweet, chief of the department of obstetrics and
gynecology at San Francisco General Hospital and co-author of the
book ``Infectious Disease of the Female Genital Tract,'' also said
an IUD can ulcerate the uterine lining and that the ulcerated
lining is not expelled completely during a woman's menstrual
period, as Strain had indicated in his opening argument.
   The fallopian tubes, which carry eggs from the ovaries to the
uterus, are probably the part of the upper reproductive tract most
susceptible to infection caused by invading bacteria, he added.
   Mrs. Kociemba claims that the Copper-7 infected her uterus,
resulting in pelvic inflammatory disease and, ultimately, tubal
infertility.
   Ciresi's law firm, Robins, Zelle, Larson & Kaplan, represented
plaintiffs in many of cases involving A.H. Robins Co.'s Dalkon
Shield, which was eventually withdrawn from the market. The firm is
representing more than 30 women in Copper-7 lawsuits against Searle.
   While the Kociemba case is the 18th involving the Copper-7
nationwide to go to trial, it is the first being tried by Robins,
Zelle, which has said it will introduce internal Searle documents
never before presented.
   The firm has said evidence introduced in the Kociemba trial is
expected to set a foundation for lawsuits to come.

<HEAD>Britain to Replace Old Free-Fall Bombs With New Weapon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain will replace its aging free-fall nuclear
bombs with a new nuclear weapon, Defense Secretary George Younger
said in a BBC interview broadcast Monday.
   The Independent newspaper, whose correspondent interviewed
Younger on the TV program, said nuclear-tipped missiles would
replace the bombs.
   The program called ``Replacing the Hidden Bomb'' also quoted
Ronald Lehman, a U.S. assistant secretary for defense, as saying
the United States has been discussing a joint project to build the
weapon with France and Britain.
   Younger said on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s current events
program ``Panorama'' that details of the new weapon would be
decided in a year to 18 months.
   He rejected the notion that the project might undermine the
U.S.-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty to eliminate an
entire class of land-based missiles in Europe, saying the weapon is
a ``replacement, a modernization of a system which is going out of
date.''
   The Independent reported that the government wants to build a
missile with a 300-mile range, with stealth-radar absorbing
materials. The missiles covered by the INF treaty have a minimum
range of about 310 miles.
   The new missiles would replace the British air force's
20-year-old bombs codenamed WE177, and would be carried by
Britain's Tornado bombers, the same planes that carry most of the
old bombs, it said.
   The old bomb has to be dropped over or very close to its target.
A missile could be launched from a distance and enable the bomber
to avoid enemy air defenses.
   The newspaper estimated that about 200 of the old bombs were
produced.
   It quoted unidentified defense sources as saying the final cost
of the new missile project was likely to be 3 billion pounds ($5.67
billion).
   Last December, Younger and French Defense Minister Andre Giraud
announced after a meeting that they would study further the
possibility of an Anglo-French missile.
   Published reports, which were not denied by officials, said the
missile would be a longer-range version of France's ASMP nuclear
air-to-surface missiles carried by Mirage warplanes.
   These missiles have a 50-125-mile range, depending on the firing
angle.
   The BBC program quoted Lehman as saying the United States
supported the idea of a three-way project and had discussed it with
both countries.
   Lehman said the United States believed that a cooperative
program would be a ``very good way'' for it to modernize its own
nuclear weapons economically.
   ``When Younger raised this in December, we thought it was a good
idea,'' said Lehman. ``We've had good discussions in a number of
bilateral meetings and our first trilateral meeting in March.''
   Giraud also appeared on the program Monday. He said that
although he has no objections to a three-nation deal, he was ``very
suspicious of cooperation involving too numerous partners.''

   ``Carrie,'' the musical version of Stephen
King's horror novel, closed over the weekend after a
five-performance run and a loss estimated at a record $8 million, a
spokesman for the show said Monday.
   The musical about a teen-age girl with the power to move and
destroy objects folded Sunday after five performances and 16
previews, spokesman Jim Baldassare said.
   The show, which starring Betty Buckley and newcomer Linzi
Hateley in the title role, was panned by most critics, receiving
some of the severest reviews of the season.
   ``Carrie'' was budgeted at $7 million, according to Baldassare,
but needed extra financing after the opening was postponed several
weeks to allow more rehearsal time. Other shows, such as ``The
Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Starlight Express,'' have cost as much
but are still running.
   Broadway has had some quick and expensive flops in recent years,
but nothing as costly as ``Carrie.'' ``Big Deal,'' a Bob Fosse
musical from 1986, lost an estimated $5 million, as did ``Grind,''
a burlesque musical that had a short run in 1985.
   ``Carrie'' was plagued by trouble ever since it began its
pre-Broadway tryout in Stratford, England, last February. Barbara
Cook, its original star, dropped out after the British engagement
and was replaced by Miss Buckley.
   ``Carrie'' was produced by Friedrich Kurz, a West German
financier, and the Royal Shakespeare Company and directed by Terry
Hands, the artistic head of the the RSC.
   The show had music and lyrics by Michael Gore and Dean
Pitchford, the team responsible for the music for the movie version
of ``Fame.''
   Its cast was a mixture of American and British performers who
were allowed to appear both in England and New York under a special
agreement from actors unions in both countries.
   ``Carrie'' was more successful as a film. The movie, directed by
Brian Depalma, starred Sissy Spacek as the troubled teen-ager who
is taunted and tormented by other high school students and her
mother before she gets revenge on prom night.

   The fuel tank of a bus that burst into a

   At the time of the accident, one of the nation's deadliest bus

   Ancient rivers that once flowed across an
Earthlike Mars may have harbored primitive forms of life that
flourished briefly before the red planet turned bitterly cold and
dry, scientists say.
   Steve Squyers, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, said
that most evidence now indicates that Mars and the Earth were very
similar shortly after their formation some 4.5 billion years ago
and that conditions that led to the formation of life on Earth may
also have existed on Mars.
   Squyers was among the scientists discussing planetary research
at a meeting Monday of the American Geophysical Union. In an

Martian life is soil laid down billions of years ago when water is
thought to have flowed freely across the planet's surface.

   A record level of export sales gave the United
States its lowest monthly trade deficit in three years in March,
the government said Tuesday in a report that President Reagan
seized as rhetorical ammunition against the trade bill.
   The Commerce Department reported that the deficit shrank
dramatically in March to $9.7 billion, a drop of 29.5 percent from
the February imbalance of $13.8 billion _ statistics which sent the
dollar soaring on world money markets.
   The improvement came from a 23 percent surge in American
exports, which rose to an all-time high of $29 billion, as demand
for U.S. machinery, aircraft, computers and chemicals picked up
sharply. This offset a smaller rise in imports, which climbed 3.6
percent to $38.7 billion.

   The dramatic improvement in the nation's trade
deficit bolstered the dollar Tuesday, but it also intensified the
gloom of pessimists in the stock and bond markets who recently have
been seeing a lot to worry about in good economic news.
   The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit shrank
more than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion _ the lowest monthly
shortfall since March 1985.
   The news catapulted the dollar higher against other major
currencies. It jumped to just under 126 Japanese yen in New York
from 125 yen earlier in London and rose to about 1.71 West German
marks from 1.69 marks.

<HEAD>A Price Increase Does Not Always Mean Inflation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To discover a price increase of any sort in
today's nervous economic environment is akin to spotting a whisp of
smoke in a crowded theater. The warning alarms go off, and everyone
gets excited.
   But not everything that looks like smoke signifies a
conflagration, and not every price increase means inflation. Most
economists know this, but a goodly number of them seem to have
forgotten for the moment.
   Some price increases are reasonable and maybe even desirable,
says Professor William C. Dunkelberg, who measures prices and other
indicators as part of a quarterly economic survey for the National
Federation of Independent Business.
   In the latest survey, Dunkelberg did indeed find evidence of
growing price pressures, based on detailed reports from 1,936
small- and medium-size companies belonging to the 500,000-member
federation.
   ``Although not large, there is a clear upward drift in the
percent of firms planning to raise prices,'' he reported this month.
   Dunkelberg attributes much of this to relatively higher import
prices after the dollar's decline, to the opportunity this gave
domestic competitors to follow suit, and to the tightening of labor
markets.
   But then he issued a caveat that has been ignored by some of his
fellow economists: Not all price increases are inflationary.
   It must be remembered, he said, that general inflation is really
a monetary phenomenon, meaning in this instance that if the Federal
Reserve flooded the nation with dollars it would provide the
support to keep those prices higher.
   But without increases in the money supply, some price increases
have a different meaning, a meaning that is as basic as any tenet
of economics. That is, price increases are a reaction to supply and
demand.
   If the money supply remains fairly constant, ``rising prices in
growing sectors will be offset by declines elsewhere, as demand
weakens in less popular sectors,'' he states, adding this pertinent
explanation:
   ``The role of prices is to signal resource reallocation.''
   He explains: ``Where demand grows, prices and profits rise to
generate the needed investment and increase in capacity and to
attract labor.
   ``Where demand falls and profits fade, prices will fall,
encouraging resources to leave for greener pastures.''
   Such price changes, he says, can be confused with general
monetary inflation. And these are days in which that confusion may
be pervasive.
   It is a situation, he says, that presents an immediate challenge
for monetary authorities, a challenge whose outcome is potentially
as critical as any other factor in steering the economy on a
healthy path.
   That challenge, he says, is this:
   ``... to determine the extent to which the price changes that
are occurring are reasonable and desirable before acting to snuff
out an inflation that may not in fact be present.''
   There is a lesson in it for the general population, and also a
reminder for those nervous, forgetful economists: Not every price
increase or decrease needs to be viewed in the context of inflation.
   Prices serve other purposes, too.

<HEAD>Opposition Candidate Says His Party Is Mexico's `Only Option'</HEAD>

   ``What is lacking is democracy, where
the people no longer are tricked, where there are no monopolies of
any kind, particularly when the monopoly opens the door to
electoral fraud,'' presidential candidate Manuel J. Clouthier was
saying.
   ``We are fighting all of this and we are going to win.''
   ``We'' is the National Action Party, which has put up the
staunchest opposition to Mexico's long-dominant Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has won every election since its
inception in 1929.
   But National Action, known as PAN, has been making deeper
inroads against PRI in northern Mexico in recent years and now
believes it has a better chance than ever to come away with an
upset in the presidential election July 6.
   The 53-year-old Clouthier, a prosperous agricultural
businessman, made his point about winning in an interview with The
Associated Press while on a campaign swing through the northwestern
border state of Northern Baja California.
   He has visited more than 70 cities and towns across Mexico in
his campaign and has sought to portray himself and PAN as a
free-market alternative to PRI's political and economic
centralization.
   ``We are the only real option for change because we are rabidly
democratic, because we want democracy politically, economically,
culturally,'' Clouthier said. ``We are not in favor of government
control of the economy; we represent a social market economy.''
   National Action is strong in northern Mexico, but it has never
been able to build a national base to challenge the PRI, whose
presidential candidate is Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   ``I see that the people of Mexico are more disposed to change
things,'' Clouthier said of conditions now. ``They have been
repressed but are ready to fight once more for the change that they
yearn for.
   ``Our way is distinct; the state monopoly is not concerned with
initiative because it sacrifices everything for the sake of
control.''
   ``Maquio,'' as Clouthier is popularly known, places
responsibility for Mexico's economic troubles on Salinas de
Gortari, who had served as budget and planning secretary under the
incumbent president, Miguel de la Madrid.
   Clouthier supports private enterprise, more government
austerity, greater foreign investment and allowing peasants to own
the land they now are allowed to use and pass on to their children
but not sell.
   For years National Action was the only significant opposition to
the PRI, but the economic difficulties that have lasted throughout
de la Madrid's administration have allowed Clouthier and four other
minority candidates to take a more vocal and visible role this year.
   PAN, cast as a conservative opposition group, has strong support
from business and the Roman Catholic church hierarchy.
   Clouthier, running on a Program for Economic Construction,
contends that corruption has played an important part in Mexico's
economic crisis.
   ``Regarding the foreign debt, the majority of which the
government contracted on the shoulders of the people, I would first
seize the goods of the public officials who have enriched
themselves,'' he said in the interview.
   Mexico's foreign debt of $105 billion is the second largest in
the developing world after Brazil's.
   Clouthier favors the return of the Mexican banking system to the
private sector.
   ``Since the banks have been `ours,' there has been no credit for
the campesino (peasant),'' he said.
   The government of President Jose Lopez Portillo nationalized the
banks in September 1982, at the outset of the economic crisis
brought on by falling oil prices.
   PAN was the runnerup in the 1982 presidential race, with 15.8
percent of votes against 70.9 percent for de la Madrid.

   Issue or non-issue, it still was the question.
   United Methodists debated whether to retain a rule requiring use
of grape juice in communion. They dropped the rule, but most will
still retain the practice.
   That was the curious consequence of a bubbling interlude at the
church's governing conference in St. Louis earlier this month,
throwing a spotlight upon the diverse customs of denominations.
   Some use wine, some juice, some both. For some, it's an option
to be decided congregation by congregation.
   Whatever the choice, it is a feature of Christianity's central
act of worship, commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus with his
apostles before his crucifixion, at which he bade them perpetuate
that sacred meal.
   ``Take, eat, this is my body, which is given for you,'' he said
as he broke bread with them. Of the wine, he said, ``Drink ... this
is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for you and for many
for the forgiveness of sin.''
   Distinct communion customs among Christian denominations
sometimes produce unusual arrangements. In some ecumenical
settings, such as the Consultation on Church Union, involving nine
denominations, celebrating communion sometimes has involved two
tables, one dispensing wine, the other grape juice.
   In general, wine is used in churches with classic liturgies,
including the Episcopal, Lutheran, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches. It's also standard in the Christian Reformed
Church.
   Among Presbyterian, United Church of Christ and Reformed Church
in America congregations, the usage varies, some congregations
using wine, others grape juice, some offering both.
   Grape juice is used in most Baptist churches and in the majority
of Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregations, although a
few use wine.
   That is also the case for United Methodists, whose choice of
grape juice has a commercially tinged story behind it that
knowledgeable old-timers insist is real history.
   The story is that the founder of the Welch grape juice
enterprise, a devoted Methodist, persuaded the church's governing
conference in the early 1900s to adopt a rule requiring use of
grape juice.
   That rule has been on the books ever since, a part of the
rubrics for worship in the church hymnbook, reading in its 1966
edition:
   ``The Lord's table should have upon it a fair linen cloth. Let
the pure unfermented juice of the grape be used.''
   But that hymnbook, its rituals and rubrics were replaced at the
recent conference, and the revised version leaves out the grape
juice rule.
   This omission caused considerable splashes of debate, twice
impelling the Rev. Richard L. Wright of Buckhannon, W.Va., to
intervene with proposals to restore the rule for grape juice.
   ``We have a long tradition of opposition to the use of alcoholic
beverages in our church,'' he said.
   However, the Rev. Tex S. Sample, a Kansas City, Mo., theologian,
argued that keeping a rule that looks ``highly moralistic'' would
drive off young people who would go elsewhere.
   He said research indicates the reason United Methodists are not
increasing is because ``we are not attracticing those young people
under 42 or 43 years of age on the cultural left of our country. ...
   ``If we continue to moralize about these personal issues, we
will drive them away from our denomination and not have a
compelling evangelical power to draw them into it.''
   However, June Goldman, a Spirit Lake, Iowa, delegate, said, ``We
have been adrift,'' and young people ``want us to say there are
parameters.'' Keeping the rule, she said, would give ``definite
directions'' to the young.
   ``When we are wishy-wishy, our young people lose faith in us,''
she said.
   The delegates voted strongly, 525 to 343, against retaining the
rule, and also, en bloc, voted down a batch of similar measures,
thus eliminating the old juice-only law.
   In the new hymnal-worship book, the communion service uses the
words, ``the cup'' and ``the wine'' interchangeably, while old book
uses only ``the cup,'' not mentioning wine _ as now is done.
   Even so, veteran Methodists said the long-time custom of using
juice would doubtless continue, although a few, scattered
congregations use wine.

   The Consultation on Church Union says the
United Methodist Church at its general conference this month became
the third church to accept the ``COCU consensus.''
   It is a theological agreement worked out over 25 years by nine
denominations. The United Methodists recognized the consensus as a
sufficient basis for ``covenanting acts'' of working partnership
among the participating churches.
   Previously accepting the consensus were the Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church and the International Council of Community
Churches. Six other denominations are still to act.

   People who live together before marriage
should be denied a full church wedding because ``such a wedding
would be dishonor,'' and instead be married in a low-key ceremony,
Hartford Archbishop John F. Whealon said in a column published in
The Catholic Transcript.
   ``I would be happy to witness your marriage in a simple, quiet
ceremony with two witnesses, and perhaps your immediate families,''
Whealon said in comments addressed to priests confronted with issue.
   Whealon said, however, couples living together should be granted
a full marriage ceremony if they are willing to ``live separately
and chastely'' until they are married.
   The statement serves as an advisory and does not set policy.
Parish priests say they make the ultimate decisions on church
weddings based on pastoral consideration.

<DATELINE>STAPLEFORD PARK, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strapping, exuberant Bob Payton,
Britain's most famous American entrepreneur, has one very prominent
British characteristic: eccentricity.
   It's evident all over Stapleford Park, the 500-year-old country
house the man who became London's pizza king is turning into a
hotel-like-no-other in his latest venture.
   For example, he'll have a fire in the fireplace every day of the
year, not for the heat but for the smell.
   Then there's the trompe l'oeil in the grand tea room. Peering
over the painted banister is a likeness of Gunther, Mrs. Payton's
giant schnauzer, wearing a red-white-and-blue bandanna. The dog was
added to the decor to celebrate his release from the six-month
quarantine required of every immigrating pet.
   ``I wanted things to be 5 degrees off,'' Payton said, explaining
his desire to have things a bit off-kilter.
   Gunther now trots happily around the 55-acre estate in
Leicestershire hunt country, where Payton and his wife, Wendy, are
striving to create the American dream of an English country house.
More specifically, it's a Victorian gentleman's hunting lodge,
which opened its doors to guests in April.
   ``It's sort of Disney World for real,'' said Payton, who is 6
feet 4 inches tall and weighs 250 pounds and on this misty day was
wearing a bold argyle sweater with matching socks.
   Payton bought the home, 110 miles north of London, from Lord
John Gretton of the Bass brewing family more than two years ago. He
used $1.4 million of his own money and since has spent millions
more of investors' money renovating it.
   Payton, who became famous and wealthy by bringing Chicago-style,
deep-dish pizza to London, is deliberate in his details and panders
to American notions of what is English.
   The 23 rooms and suites, which cost $160 to $611 a night, have
been decorated not only by the usual interior designers but also by
well-known English companies, chosen for their recognizeable brand
names.
   For the Wedgwood Room, the chinaware makers chose hand-printed
wallpaper in its blue-with-white-cameos Jasper design.
   Shirtmakers Turnbull and Asser hung framed bow ties and curtains
made of forest green velvet, of the smoking-jacket variety, lined
with silk paisley.
   The Liberty Room is cheered with the fabric designer's renowned
small-flower prints.
   The 125-room house, with a grand, sweeping staircase, is long on
marble, mahogany paneling, 16-foot ceilings, leather sofas and
framed pictures of British royalty.
   Peek into the ``loo,'' the men's room, and heads of wildebeests
stare down at you from high on the walls.
   Not wanting the hotel to look too new, he ordered reproductions
of Victorian spigots.
   From the stone mullion windows are stunning views of gently
undulating, green countryside featuring sheep, frolicking horses in
a grazing paddock and a still lake.
   Payton has worked under the close scrutiny of British
preservation officials who have allowed him some distinctly
American flourishes, too, like the miniature golf course and a
basketball net and backboard. Homemade chocolate-chip cookies are
left on bedside tables in the rooms.
   Payton, who went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill and still gulps diet soda from an oversized school mug, is
treating the hotel like an informal house party.
   The Land Rover that picks up guests at the train station, half
an hour away in Grantham, arrives with a cooler stocked with
Chicago beer.
   ``It's not going to be a health farm,'' said Payton.
   He has lived in Britain for 15 years and first saw the house in
1980 while he was ``riding to hounds,'' or fox hunting.
   ``I walked through the front door of the place and I knew it had
to be preserved for what it was,'' Payton said. ``This is quite a
staggering edifice.''
   At the time, he added, ``I was looking for something new to
invent. I thought, `What am I going to do with my life once I've
created my business?'''
   Payton launched that business with a pizza restaurant in 1977,
when he quit the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, which had
hired him in Chicago and transferred him to London.
   Payton had worked his way through college playing drums in a
rock band, and went on to Northwestern University in Evanston,
Ill., to earn a master's degree in advertising.
   The son of a traveling salesman, Payton was born in Troy, N.Y.,
and reared in Miami.
   Although he had trouble raising the initial $66,000 for his
first pizza restaurant, his company became hugely successful and
will be operating 14 restaurants with names like Chicago Pizza Pie
Factory and Chicago Rib Shack in London and on the European
continent by the end of the year.
   The company is called My Kinda Town Ltd. _ Payton says that
refers both to Chicago and London _ and had an after-tax profit of
$1.88 million on revenue of $21 million in 1987.
   Payton managed to raise $8.5 million for Stapleford Park by
privately selling stock in My Kinda Town, in which he retains a
majority interest.
   What makes this hotel a bold experiment is that it's in a part
of the country that has traditionally attracted few tourists.
   It is a two-hour drive from Heathrow Airport in London, or a
90-minute train ride from London's King's Cross station, before you
get into the Rover and take a beer from the cooler.
   Payton, who lives in a private wing of Stapleford Park, is
relying on word of mouth instead of advertising and says not only
Americans will come to his hotel.
   ``Americans don't want to come here and meet other Americans,''
he said. ``The worst thing is people coming here and it's all
Americans.''
   Bookings are ``pretty good,'' said Payton, who expects the
operation will break even in the first year and make a profit in
the second.
   And if he fails, he can always sell the house, which he now
values at about $12 million.
   However, he says profit is not his principal motive in
Stapleford Park.
   ``I`ve done my bit for society by preserving this,'' Payton
said. ``I've given this house the opportunity to live again like it
did in its heyday.''
   Carved on the outside of the limestone building is ``William
Lord Sherard Baron of Letrym Repayred this Building Anno Domini
1633.''
   Payton had a mason carve in an addition: ``And Bob Payton Esq.
Did His Bit Anno Domini 1988.''

<TEXT>
   Sandy-haired Alex Singer, an American Ivy
League honors graduate and jazz lover, dreamed of being an artist
or writer, but religious fervor brought him to Israel and to his
death as a soldier on his 25th birthday.
   Lt. Alex Singer was killed in a raid inside Lebanon on Sept. 15.
   But his talents as an artist and writer live on in 200 pages of
diaries.
   He has left behind a rare portrait of an Israeli soldier.
   The diaries are filled with pencil drawings of military
maneuvers, army camps and the barren landscape of war.
   The words, in verse and prose, are of his thoughts as a
commander of other men in war and tell of listening for the sound
of enemy footsteps in southern Lebanon and confronting Palestinian
anger in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Some of the notebooks were found in Singer's kitbag the day he
was shot on a mission to flush out Palestinian guerrillas trying to
infiltrate Israel's northern border settlements. His family gave
copies to The Associated Press.
   In verse done while still in officers' training, Singer
confronts his feelings about the day when he will face combat:
   ``If the war comes
   ``When the war comes
   ``I will have to lead men to die.

   ``But those men were not men a short time ago.
   ``Some don't even shave yet.
   ``And I will have to have the calm power

   ``Kadima (Hebrew for ``forward'')
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``And
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I will have to have the calm power
   ``To step forward myself.''
   Alex Singer came to Israel in December 1984, seven months after
graduating summa cum laude from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
Three days later he joined the army.
   His brother Daniel, 22, said Alex's deepening attachment to
Judaism moved him to emigrate and join the military.
   ``As a Jew, Israel played an important part in his life, and it
wasn't enough to talk about it, but to act,'' Daniel said in an
interview. ``He considered it a duty and an honor to help defend
the country. He wasn't trying to prove anything. Here it isn't like
in the States, where the Army seems distant. Here it's part of
life.''
   Little in Singer's early days points to a future as a combat
soldier. Daniel said family life in Washington, D.C., was not
religious. The boys' father, Max, is a writer for the Jewish
magazine Commentary, and mother Suzanne is a magazine editor.
   Alex was not athletic. He suffered from asthma and was a
bookworm, a loner. On travels he went off by himself to sketch
landscapes. He took solace in the jazz of Ella Fitgerald and Louis
Armstrong and the folk rock of Simon and Garfunkel.
   A boyhood trip to Israel inspired Alex to think seriously about
Judaism, said Daniel. In college, his Jewish identity became so
intense that he devoted his thesis to the subject.
   For the thesis, ``Letters from the Diaspora,'' Alex traveled to
London, Moscow and Cordoba, Spain, in search of Jewish life.
   Later he visited Jordan, and Daniel said it was the trip to the
Arab world that solidified Alex's feeling for serving Israel.
   ``There he really learned what the Arabs think of us. It really
brought it all down to earth for him,'' said Daniel, who also
served three years in Israel's army.
   In the military, Alex combined his talents for writing and
drawing with his duties. His journals are filled with meticulous
drawings of weapons, such as Israeli-made Galil rifles, grenades
and TOW missiles.
   On a page dated July 9, 1987, Singer sketched an officer
briefing soldiers before a battalion exercise in the Golan Heights,
near the Syrian border.
   The troops sweated up a hill attacking a mock Syrian base, but
Singer's record was mostly about losing his prayer shawl and
phylacteries, or prayer straps, in a bag that disappeared in the
charge.
   ``We ran and retraced our exact steps,'' he wrote. ``I was just
about to give up looking when two-thirds up the hill, I saw the bag
on the ground, right where we started charging.''
   In training, Singer dedicated one diary page to a drawing of his
feet with arrows pointing to callouses and bunions. He bemoaned the
life of a foot soldier and talked of transferring from the infantry
to the tank corps.

   Nevertheless, he volunteered for the Givati Brigade, an elite
combat unit famed for its fight on the Egyptian border in the
Independence War of 1948.
   The Givati troops get the toughest jobs, and Singer frequently
wrote that he was glad to be guarding the northern frontier.
   ``I like this type of front-line duty,'' he wrote in January
1986. ``Being in Lebanon makes all that goes on closer. I feel
pride when I know that we are the ones sent in the end to do the
work.''
   In later entries Singer described in painstaking detail missions
he commanded along the border. In one instance, he wrote about
being on watch in a wooded border post.
   ``I heard footsteps on the other side of the fence, 20 yards
from our gang. I put a bullet in the chamber of my gun and looked
to find the source of the steps.
   ``My heart was beating fast and we were ready to open fire. I
passed an order left and right not to shoot until they hear me
shouting `fire'! The tension was unbelievable. After 15 minutes or
so the sounds stopped _ it must have been a wild boar or
something.''
   In an entry last summer, Singer wrote of awakening to find the
platoon's sentries asleep near the border fence, near what Israelis
call Mount Dov, the site of battles between the Israelis and
Palestinian guerrillas attempting to infiltrate.
   ``There is no doubt that my waking up on my own saved one or
more of us ... from paying the corresponding price.''
   The diaries also include descriptions of a month in 1987 in the
occupied Gaza Strip, a coastal zone crowded with 600,000
Palestinian refugees.
   Most of these accounts reflect the hostility and fear of
soldiers in street patrols and house-to-house searches for
guerrilla suspects.
   ``I saw `Palestine' written on a door,'' Singer wrote. ``We
stop, I call a man from the house, take his ID, tell him he gets
his ID when the graffiti is gone. He calls his wife who brings
H-2-O and washes it.''
   But Singer also wrote that he tried to teach men in his platoon
to be tolerant of Arabs. In an entry titled ``Idea for Teaching
About the Difference of a Jewish Army,'' Singer wrote:
   ``We can go either way: 1) Arabs as ... `jukim' (cockroaches) or
2) Arabs as people.
   ``Israel must take the second path because Israel is a Jewish
state, a democratic state and a light unto nations.''
   Four months later, Singer was sent on his final mission into
Lebanon and got the first taste of combat he'd written about in
verse two years before.
   According to other accounts of the day, guerrillas hiding behind
boulders surprised Singer's patrol with bursts of gunfire just
after the Israelis landed near Mount Dov by helicopter. Singer was
shot as he ran up a hill taking a medic to a wounded comrade.
   President Reagan praised Singer's heroism in a message of
condolence to his parents.
   Daniel said the family is proud of Alex's devotion to Israel and
plans a public exhibit of his drawings and diaries.
   But, he added, it does not make up for a lost brother.
   ``This is something that takes the glamour out of being in the
army,'' he said. ``It's like having a hole where something was. You
can't fill it. You have to walk around it.''

<HEAD>Glasnost Brings Openness, But Soviets Still Looking for Better
Life</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is the first part in a four-part series</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An editor on an influential Soviet newspaper told
his dinner guests how he had spent much of his afternoon arguing
heatedly with his colleagues about a particular article.
   ``It was wonderful,'' he said. ``I get drunk on `glasnost.'''
   Glasnost, the new openness that tolerates such intellectual
disputes now spilling from the editorial conference rooms onto the
pages of some Soviet journals, is the most apparent manifestation
of the changes Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to make
in his drive to modernize a slothful giant.
   It is visible not only in the newspapers, which are swamped with
letters to the editor of almost every stripe, but in cultural life
and on the streets as well.
   Long-banned books are finding publishers, works of art hidden in
storerooms since the early days of Communist rule are being
exhibited, and theaters, movie houses and concert halls are jammed
with patrons anxious to see and hear the latest experiments with
ideas that were unwelcome in this country for years. Grievances
rooted in long-repressed ethnic and nationalist concerns have
sprouted as well, igniting demonstrations, strikes and even deadly
riots.
   At the same time, the better life promised by Gorbachev's
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, is still evanescent.
   The Soviet editor who got ``drunk on glasnot'' left work early
that day to hunt for wine or vodka to serve at dinner. The search
proved futile. And his wife had to take two different buses across
town to find a suitable piece of meat to serve to her guests.
   That's just one example of the enormity of Gorbachev's task to
bring about economic reform.
   The problems he faces also are illustrated daily on the streets
of Moscow as the city prepares for the arrival next week of
President Reagan and a horde of foreign journalists.
   A team of eight laborers has been sent to refurbish the
children's playground in the center of the country's largest
compound for foreigners. At practically any time of day, a casual
glance at the worksite reveals six of the workers sitting down or
standing idle watching the other two work.
   A workman sent to replace the linoleum floor of an elevator in
an eight-story building shut off the lift for an entire afternoon
while he measured and cut a new piece of flooring and nailed it in
place with broken molding he had ripped out with the old flooring.
   When the job was finished, the new linoleum didn't fit and was
so thin that puncture holes appeared within a week. The floor
undoubtedly will look as bad as the old one in a matter of months.
   To instill a work ethic or pride of craftsmanship will take more
than daily exhortations by the Communist Party to work harder in
order to enjoy the fruits of perestroika.
   The Soviet Union is a land where shoddy craftsmanship and
grudging service are the norm. Machines break down, and their
operators shrug, rather than embark on what they know will be a
long and frustrating search for repairs.
   Human resources are squandered on make-work jobs. People have
money but there is nothing to buy.
   Offering incentives, such as higher pay for better work, is
among the innovations being tried, but skeptics also must be
persuaded there will be something for them to purchase with their
increased incomes. And even a desire to do the job right doesn't
help much when parts and materials are ordered by central planners
who don't necessarily send them when and where they are needed.
   Speaking to a gathering of farm workers in March, Gorbachev said
people are ``willing and able to pay for consumer services, but the
trouble is there is seldom any person or establishment supplying
them.''
   To help fill that gap, the government has agreed to permit
cooperative ventures in which individuals may get together to start
their own businesses offering goods and services to the public.
   Thousands of these have sprung up in the form of restaurants,
groceries, car repair shops, cleaners, even computer services.
There is at least one co-op that provides a directory of other
co-ops. But the prices at the new establishments generally run high
and have met considerable resistance from consumers accustomed to
paying heavily subsidized state rates.
   The new enterprises also have sparked resistance among Communist
Party conservatives who fear Gorbachev is leading them toward
capitalism.
   ``As soon as an off-beat decision is made, there is an outcry,''
Gorbachev told a recent meeting of newspaper editors and
ideologues. He quoted his opponents as wailing, ```Help, socialism
is in danger; they are spawning private operators!'''
   The depth of the opposition is difficult to measure in a society
where virtually all discussion by decision-makers takes place in
secret. But recurrent rumors of power struggles at the top and
publication of ideological disputes that seem to flow from those
struggles are unsettling by-products of glasnost.
   Resistance to change is strong in this society, where change all
too often has brought horrors beyond comprehension. At least two
major famines have swept the country in this century, one after the
Bolshevik Revolution and civil war, the second when dictator Josef
Stalin forced farm collectivization in the 1930s.
   Western historians estimate as many as 20 million perished in
the purges as Stalin eradicated his rivals and drove the country
relentlessly to industrialize, and that another 20 million died in
a desperate struggle for survival against Nazi invaders in World
War II.
   Against that backdrop, the security of a job, however menial,
housing, however cramped, and food, however plain, is hardly
insignificant. Risks like those inherent in a free-enterprise
system or a market economy can appear terribly threatening to
people whose life-long goal is little more than security.
   In two giant steps toward improving peoples' sense of security,
Gorbachev has successfully negotiated the first weapons treaty with
the United States that bans an entire class of nuclear arms. And he
has begun to withdraw Soviet troops from the protracted war in
Afghanistan, where they had been bogged down for eight years.
   Gorbachev has instituted competitive elections of some
supervisory personnel in plants and lower-level party officials in
a move to make the bureaucracy more responsive and to root out dead
wood and corruption. And he has begun to prune the party and
government apparatus in an efficiency drive that has frightened
many who think they see the spectre of unemployment looming on the
horizon.
   He also has sought to reassure people that his more pragmatic
approach to socialism will improve their lives, not threaten them.
   ``This society will inevitably be more multi-layered,'' he said,
``but it will remain socialist, and it will not forgo the
principles of social justice, comradeship and internationalism in
the slightest.''

<HEAD>At The Movies: ``Da''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, ``Da'' captivated Broadway audiences with its
Irish charm and insights into father-son relationships. Now, ``Da''
has been translated to film and, as the Irish might say, a lovely
movie it is.
   Time, which sometimes dims the best of stories, seems to have
burnished the glow of ``Da,'' which transports viewers from
present-day New York to a rural Irish village with cobblestone
streets and fragrant gardens.
   It is here that we meet Da, the shorthand name for father.
Barnard Hughes, whose portrayal won awards on the New York stage,
recreates the role of the old man whose death stirs up an emotional
whirlwind for his adopted son, Charlie.
   Martin Sheen is Charlie, a successful playwright who returns to
his Irish homeland for the funeral of his adoptive father and is
haunted by memories of the man whose complex personality colored
his son's life.
   ``I love you, Da,'' Sheen tells the father whose ghost
self-confidently replies, ``Why wouldn't you?''
   That question leads Sheen on a tortuous journey back to his own
childhood, reliving the worst moments through now critical eyes.
Da's interference in Charlie's youthful pursuit of a neighbor girl
becomes humorous in retrospect. A sequence in which Charlie's
mother decrees that the rambunctious family dog must be drowned and
Da sets out to do the deed is agonizing. Da's outrageous defense of
Hitler while Charlie's prospective employer visits the family makes
the old man out as something of a fool.
   But there are better times remembered as well, and Charlie is
inevitably lured back by his father's Irish magnetism. As Da
declares: ``Love turned upside down is love for all that.''
   Hughes' portrayal of Da is about as pefect as acting gets. The
white haired, blue-eyed Hughes creates the magic that makes Da the
inhabitant of his son's dreams. Sheen is just right as Charlie,
resentful but loving, determined to shed his father's ghost but
unwilling to let their relationship die.
   There are other fine performances here. Karl Hayden makes an
impressive film debut as the self-conscious young Charlie. William
Hickey is memorable as Drumm, Charlie's first, demanding employer.
And Doreen Hepburn, as Charlie's mother, projects the combined
sweetness and strength of a realist who sees her gardener-husband
for what he is.
   Matt Clark directed the film, which is often seen in the brown
and gold tones of memory. A co-star certainly is Ireland, in
particular the village of Dalkey which was playwright Hugh
Leonard's home. The seaside vistas, the green hills and the
extraordinary rose garden which Leonard's father (the real life Da)
planted 60 years ago are part of charm of this thoroughly
satisfying film.
   Da is rated PG. Running time is 102 minutes.

   How do retailers know what will sell and what
won't among the 500 or more home videos available each month?
   Box-office hits, such as ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Beverly Hills
Cop II'' and ``Dirty Dancing'' are sure shots, regardless of their
artistic demerits. Then there are sleeper films, such as ``Prick Up
Your Ears,'' that attracted small audiences and might not make
whopping good rentals.
   Some video store owners are turning to ``Video Forecaster,'' a
report published by bi-monthly by Warren Adler, who uses consumer
polls and other marketing tools to give retailers the odds on a
particular movie.
   In the May 1-15 edition, for example, ``Barfly,'' starring Faye
Dunaway and Mickey Rourke, received a ``high'' consumer awareness
level and a ``good'' from critics, but the much acclaimed ``Hope
and Glory'' only got a ``poor'' awareness level and a ``rave'' from
critics.
   ``Fatal Beauty,'' the Whoopi Goldberg bomb, had a ``very high''
consumer awareness level but a ``poor'' rating from critics
   The publication also lists stars, a synopsis of the film,
consumers' intent to rent or buy _ medium for ``Barfly'' and ``Hope
and Glory,'' but very high for ``Fatal Beauty'' _ box office
grosses, number of weeks it ran and comments from Video Forecaster
on how it will do.
   ``We've reduced our purchasing now to a few hours a month,''
said J. Fred Sproule of Super Video, Inc., in Seattle. ``We buy for
60 stores and spend over $100,000 a month on video, so this has
become very valuable to us.''
   Bruce George of Sundance Audio and Video in Yuba City, Calif.,
said the report ``protects us from buying everything out there.''
   Adler, whose ``The War of the Roses'' will be produced by
Academy Award winning director James L. Brooks (``Terms of
Endearment,'' ``Broadcast News''), started ``Video Forecaster'' in
Los Angeles in 1987.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Barfly'' and ``Real Men.''

   Spanish subtitles and closed captioned for the hearing impaired,
$89.95, Rated R for language)
   
   Despite great reviews, this offbeat 1987 Barbet Schroeder film
didn't get a wide release, so if you missed it, the video is a
second chance to catch first-rate performances by Mickey Rourke and
Faye Dunaway, not to mention beat- generation writer Charles
Bukowski's wonderfully lucid observations which fall like diamonds
from the mouth of muttering skid-row writer Henry Chinaski.
   Henry falls in love with fellow barfly Wanda Wilcox, an
irascible sort who observes when she meets him, ``I hate people. Do
you hate people?''
   ``No,'' says Henry, ``but I feel better when they're not
around.''
   When not stimulating his senses by taunting a tough-guy
bartender (Frank Stallone) into knocking the stuffing out of him,
Chinaski dashes off brilliant scribblings to a literary magazine
which hires a private eye to track him down. What a gem. Not a
Naugahyde barstool out of place.

<HEAD>``Real Men'' (CBS@Fox, VHS@Beta, $79.98, Rated PG-13)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Real Men'' is a far-out farce about male bonding and role
reversals that sinks under the weight of its own absurdity.
   The funny parts appeal to those who laugh at assassinations, car
bombings, kidnappings, gun fights and double crosses, all of which
happen in the first 10 minutes.
   A macho CIA agent played by James Belushi coerces the help of a
wimpy suburbanite insurance agent played by John Ritter in order to
save the world. Ritter happens to look just like a dead CIA agent.
   The mission is to get to Washington within five days to get a
secret formula from space aliens who have an antidote to a poison
that is destroying the food chain and will make the Earth lifeless
in five years.
   Wait, there's more.
   The unlikely pair must contend with Soviet agents and a faction
in the CIA that wears clown suits. The CIA clowns have a different
deal for the spacemen. They want a gun capable of destroying the
planet instead of the antidote.
   On their wacky journey, Ritter meets Belushi's father _ who had
a sex change operation and comes on to Ritter.
   Later, in a Pittsburgh bar, tough guy Belushi falls in love with
a whip-cracking seductress. Ritter, meanwhile, sheds his
milquetoast mannerisms by foiling a robbery and completing the
mission.
   The price asked by the spacemen to save the world is a glass of
water. The payoff somehow matches the drippy comedy.

   ``Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm'' (Geffen) Joni Mitchell
   
   Joni Mitchell doesn't need any help, but she is nevertheless
joined by an all-star cast on this eclectic, profoundly political
effort. The cast is just as varied _ Willie Nelson, Billy Idol,
Peter Gabriel, Don Henley, Tom Petty, Wendy and Lisa and even Iron
Eyes Cody makes a guest appearance.
   The cuts include some remakes: a jazzy version of ``Corrina,
Corrina'' (titled ``A Bird That Whistles'') featuring Wayne Shorter
on sax, and ``Cool Water'' _ yeah, that song by the Sons of the
Pioneers _ a duet with Willie Nelson.
   Mitchell seems to be having more fun musically on this album
than she has in the past, but in some ways she seems almost
visually oriented, casting parts in the songs and referring in an
interview to one of them as ``cinematic.''
   Her own material, evincing at various times her folk, jazz and
rock influences, is emotional and highly political.
   ``The Tea Leaf Prophecy,'' is a poignant reminiscence of wars
past set against a melodic chant, ``Study war no more.'' Gabriel
sings on the lovely ``My Secret Place.'' Henley trades vocal leads
with Mitchell on the wry ``Snakes and Ladders.'' Iron Eyes Cody
intones the opening lines of ``Lakota,'' a pulsing Hopi lament.
   Recorded, appropriately enough, at Peter Gabriel's studio in
Bath, England, ``The Beat of Black Wings'' was written after the
U.S. bombing of Libya. The lyrics are the words of a soldier,
``Killer Kyle,'' who notes ``the old pick the wars, we die in
'em.'' He gives the album its poignant title: ``Keep the drinks
comin', girl. 'Til I can't feel anything. I'm just a chalk mark in
a rain storm. ...''

   ``Green Thoughts'' (Capitol) _ Smithereens
   
   Ever since John, Paul and George strapped on guitars and sat
Ringo behind the drum kit, thousands of kids have devoted their
lives to a search for the perfect melody. It's a wonder the classic
1960s song structure can still sound fresh today.
   The Smithereens, a New Jersey-based quartet, do better than
most. Their crisp melodies and tight performances made 1986's
``Especially for You'' an unusually strong debut, and the new
``Green Thoughts'' is a worthy follow-up.
   Actually, those '60s comparisons probably rankle the
Smithereens. As much as bands want to emulate their heroes from
those days, a reputation as a band more interested in the past than
the present could be a death sentence.
   That fear seems to be a motivating force encouraging the
Smithereens to stretch a bit. They know the rock graveyard is
littered with nondescript jangly guitar bands.
   On songs such as ``Drown in My Own Tears'' and ``The World We
Know,'' guitarist Jim Babjak employs a bass-like fuzztone that
rattles the backbone. Fortunately, the Smithereens are equally
adept when things quiet down, with the ballad ``Especially for
You'' noteworthy for its sax solo by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin.
   ``Green Thoughts'' may be more appropriately titled after a
darker shade. Lead singer Pat DiNizio, whose odd goatee gives him
the look of a beatnik, is one lonely guy. Consequently, the record
is top-heavy with songs of shattered romance and late-night
yearning.
   That can be done well, of course; ``Elaine'' is a particularly
pretty take on that theme. But DiNizio's already come close to
exhausting it. Maybe a girlfriend would help.
   Given the well-documented pitfalls of new bands trying to prove
they have more than one good album in them, the Smithereens can be
proud of ``Green Thoughts.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Grinning Optimist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Tom Hanks seems like a grinning optimist
on the screen, it's not just acting.
   ``When I wake up in the morning, I'm a pretty happy guy,'' he
says. ``I'm not one of these guys who rolls out of bed and is
groggy for an hour and a half until he has blueberry pancakes and
six cups of coffee. I wake up and the sun is shining or the clouds
are raining and I think it's great either way.
   ``Where that comes from, I don't know. I'll leave that off to
the DNA (genetic materials) that my parents planted in me.''
   Hanks has more than the usual reasons to be happy nowadays. He
stars in two promising comedies this summer: ``Big,'' in which he
plays a 12-year-old whose wish to be an adult is granted;
``Punchline,'' in which he co-stars with Sally Field as a pair of
aspiring stand-up comics.
   And on March 30 he married actress Rita Wilson, whom he met
while both were appearing in ``Volunteers.''
   Until now, Hanks has mostly been seen with co-stars: Darryl
Hannah (``Splash''); John Candy (``Volunteers''); Shelley Long
(``The Money Pit''); Jackie Gleason (``Nothing in Common''); Dan
Aykroyd (``Dragnet''). With ``Big,'' Hanks flies solo, though he
draws strong support from Elizabnt and debonair.''
   The highlight of ``Big'' provided the biggest physical
challenge. Hanks and his boss, Loggia, perform a dance in New
York's F.A.O. Schwarz toy store on king-size piano keys, tapping
out ``Chopsticks'' and ``Heart and Soul.''
   ``It was a huge dance number that required hours and hours and
hours of rehearsal stretched out over a six-week period,'' Hanks
said. ``When we finally finished shooting it, I said, `Our long
national nightmare is over.'''
   Like Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Rebecca De Mornay and other stars
of his generation, Hanks had an unsettled childhood. His parents
divorced when he was young, and he moved back and forth between
them. Growing up in Northern California, he figures he and a
brother and sister changed homes every six months. Instead of
growing withdrawn, he became a joker.
   ``Part of it is a self-defense mechanism,'' he reflected. ``I
moved around a lot when I was a kid and found myself in new cities
and with new friends and new family members. It also comes from a
brand of communication that was developed between my siblings and
my mom and my dad.''
   Hanks discovered theater at Sacramento State University and was
invited by director Vincent Dowling to join the Great Lakes
Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland. He moved to New York, then came
to Hollywood in 1980 to star in the well-remembered ``Bosom Buddy''
series for ABC. The series' untimely end freed Hanks for films, and
he has been working steadily ever since.
   He has played a variety of roles, but producers view him as a
comedian. He remains philosophical about being so pigeonholed.
   ``I have made my peace long ago with the fact that I'm a funny
guy,'' he said. ``I treated it like a curse for a long time, but
it's just as much of a fact that I have two feet.
   ``The fear of being labeled as a comedian? I don't care. I'd
rather just let the sum total of all the work just speak for itself
over the long haul.''

<HEAD>The Artists: The Secret of Spoleto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secret of the Spoleto Festival's success is
that there is no real program, says composer Gian Carlo Menotti,
who has led the arts celebration for three decades.
   ``We do whatever we feel like doing. We surprise our audience
and the press,'' he said.
   ``We are against all commemorations. During the anniversary of
Bach's birth, we do Beethoven. During the anniversary of Beethoven,
we do Stravinsky. We keep away from everything that is somewhat
dictated. We use instinct and imagination. We don't announce a
program two or three years in advance because we never know what
we're going to do.''
   This year, at the 112-event Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in
Charleston, S.C., Menotti felt like presenting Dvorak's 1901 opera,
``Rusalka.'' Since the first act is supposed to take place under
water, ``Rusalka'' has only been done in this country a handful of
times since its American premiere in 1935.
   John Paull III, technical production manager for Broadway's
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' is in charge of ``Rusalka.'' He is
swathing the stage in China-blue silk for the water and bringing
soprano Maria Spacagna as the water nymph Rusalka _ who lives in
the lake _ onto the stage through a trap door.
   Her father, the Water Sprite, at one point becomes angry and
creates a whirlpool. The silk spins round and round.
   Menotti founded the Festival of the Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, in 1958, and later founded the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in
Charleston _ this year it runs from May 20 to June 5 _ and the
Spoleto Festival of the Three Worlds in Melbourne, Australia. He
still heads all of them.
   ``We create a festive atmosphere,'' Menotti said in a recent
interview. ``I always think of it involving the whole town. I
wanted to see if an artist can be as important a member of a
community as a doctor. The people of Charleston have the dignity of
knowing arts are needed.''
   Menotti recently directed his 1950 opera, ``The Consul,'' in
Bulgaria. The opera, which opened the first Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
in 1977, is set in an unidentified police state in which a woman
tries to get a visa for another country where her husband has found
refuge.
   ``I never thought I would ever see `The Consul' in Bulgaria,''
he said. ``I think they feel it is about some other country. I had
no trouble. I asked somebody if the translation was faithful and
the answer was yes. The audience stood and cheered.
   ``Now the government has asked me to do a film of it in Bulgaria
in English. They offered to pay for everything, the whole
production. They only thing is, they cannot pay foreign singers _
they have no dollars. Soprano Mirella Freni wants to sing the
woman. Her husband, bass Nicolai Ghiaurov, is Bulgarian. There's no
reason his character, the chief of police, shouldn't have an accent.
   ``I accepted. If I'm still alive, I'm going to do it next
year.'' Menotti will be 77 in July.
   The composer also recently has been in Korea where two of his
operas, ``Amelia Goes to the Ball'' and ``The Medium,'' were done
in Korean last year.
   ``Unfortunately, they were a big success. The day before I left,
the head of the Olympic Games talked me into doing an opera. The
only sport I do is tennis and I only win when my son lets me win,''
he said.
   ``I asked what sort of opera I should write. The Olympic Arts
Festival gave me the choice of three possible subjects. I chose the
one I like best for `The Marriage.' It was supposed to be ready in
January and wasn't.'' The premiere is to be in September in Seoul
and Menotti will direct.
   Menotti will compose a piece for chorus and orchestra for the
Atlanta Symphony and will direct ``Tosca'' for the Washington Opera
next spring. ``It is a promise I made to Placido Domingo. It's my
swan song as a director of operas other than my own.''
   He'll also direct when Domingo sings the title role of ``Goya,''
which Menotti composed for him, in Spain next February in its
European premiere.
   Menotti's first grandchild will be a year old in July. ``He is
called Claudio in honor of (composer) Claudio Monteverdi. He
already bangs on the piano. He is very angry because I play
something for him and he can't make it himself. I know he is
musical.
   ``I play for him. He listens and looks at my hands. Then he
bangs. Then he looks at me. Then he gets very frustrated,'' he said.
   The composer of ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' would like to
do another children's opera.
   ```Help, Help, the Globolinks!' is doing very well and so is
`The Boy Who Grew Too Fast,''' he said. ``I think it is marvelous
to write for children. But I don't know. I don't want to become the
Brother Grimm of opera.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Strait Revitalizes Country Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country music singer George Strait has a
crisp tenor, a lean frame and a career that is rolling like the
tumbleweed in his native Texas.
   The 36-year-old performer has recorded nine gold albums
incorporating a blend of ballads about broken hearts and happier
times.
   In seven years of entertaining, he has helped revitalize
hard-core country music while maintaining a family tradition as a
fourth generation cattle rancher in the Lone Star state.
   Strait has twice been voted male vocalist of the year by the
Country Music Association, but says of his singing: ``I feel that
I'm just getting started.''
   With more than 20 No. 1 records to his credit, the gentleman
cowboy has established himself as a top concert draw treated much
like pop star Tom Jones. The handsome Strait finds boots, flowers,
room keys, cowboy hats, women's underwear and various other items
thrown on stage.
   ``It surprises me,'' he said in an interview. ``People are so
generous. I get nice gifts like quilts, afghans, artwork. I know it
took them a lot of time to make them.''
   He has performed for almost 50,000 at the Houston Astrodome and
says singing for that many people can be intimidating.
   ``It's very scary and exciting,'' he said. ``You can't see them,
but you can feel them.''
   He believes his audiences appreciate his concert mixture of old
country songs plus his own material such as ``All My Ex's Live in
Texas,'' ``Ocean Front Property'' and his most recent No. 1 hit,
``Famous Last Words of a Fool.''
   ``I just go out and do my songs and don't tell jokes or do a lot
of talking,'' Strait said.
   Strait was born in Poteet, Texas, and grew up in Pearsall,
Texas, as the son of a junior high school math teacher who was a
part-time rancher. He went into the Army after high school where he
taught himself to play the guitar by reading some Hank Williams'
song books.
   After the Army, he earned a degree in agriculture from Southwest
Texas State University in San Marcos and sang in small bars and
clubs throughout Texas.
   He enlisted his band, The Ace in the Hole Band, by putting up a
flier on a campus bulletin board. Three of them are still with him.
   He went to work as a rancher and for two years was foreman of a
1,000-head cattle ranch. At night, it was off to sing.
   ``I'd have about half an hour to get cleaned up and get to that
night's gig,'' he said of his crowded schedule.
   Two self-financed records went unnoticed. He visited Nashville
in 1976 and 1978, hoping to sign a recording contract. He was not
successful, and instead took a full-time job designing barns and
other ranch facilities. But at the last minute, he decided to try
music for one more year.
   He was finally signed by MCA Records in Nashville in 1981.
   Strait is noted for his white cowboy hats, pressed jeans and
starched, button-down shirts that all accent his trim, athletic
appearance.
   ``During my career, I've always tried to project a clean look,''
he said. ``I feel this is important to my fans, even though I've
been criticized . . . for being too wrinkle-free.''
   He writes few of the songs he records, but does make most of the
decisions about picking album material.
   ``I think what I look for first is the melody,'' he said. ``I
look for something a little different. Then I listen to the lyrics
and if it will fit me.
   ``I don't look for any specific type of song, but if I have a
lot of ballads picked I start looking for up-tempo material for
balance.
   ``I have always gone into the studio to make it better than the
last one. Each time, I feel I have.''
   Many of his songs have Texas cities in their title, such as
``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your
Mind.''
   ``It's pure coincidence,'' he said. ``Those were strong songs.
`Amarillo by Morning' was one we'd been doing for a long time
before I recorded it. That's why we released it.''
   His current album, which has been No. 1 on the country charts,
is ``If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin').'' He's also completed
a 60-minute concert video, ``George Strait Live.''
   But he's had to cope with tragedy. His 13-year-old daughter,
Jennifer, was killed in an automobile accident in June 1986. That
October, he dedicated his CMA award to her.
   As he prepared to set out recently on a concert tour, he said
about his success: ``I would like to think talent had a lot to do
with it. The material has been good and the timing had a lot to do
with it.''

   The Reagan administration working group on the
stock market crash has issued a report recommending a variety of
modest financial market changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of
last October's market crash.
   The panel's major recommendation Monday was adoption of a
``circuit breaker'' mechanism to shut down trading in the stock and
futures markets when extreme market movements threaten the entire
system.
   The panel said all trading should be halted for one hour on both
stock and stock index futures markets when the Dow Jones industrial
average declines by 250 points from its closing level of the
previous day.

   Irving Bank Corp. says preliminary results
indicate its shareholders backed the company over hostile suitor,
Bank of New York Co., in a heated proxy battle for control of
Irving.
   Bank of New York said it was disappointed by Monday's

its seven-month effort to acquire the rival banking company for
about $1.08 billion.
   Irving said that while it had no specific numbers, an early
count of proxies submitted that a slate of 16 incumbent directors
had been re-elected over Bank of New York's nominees.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Move Higher On Production Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices have risen in response to reports
that the world needs more oil production, not less.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, advanced 17 cents
Monday to settle at $17.66 per barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale prices
for unleaded gasoline increased 0.39 cent to 52.73 cents per
gallon, while heating oil moved up 0.51 cent to 47.98 cents per
gallon.
   Analysts said the market was bolstered by European forecasts
that OPEC would have to boost production in the months ahead to
meet demand later this year.
   Those reports said production by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would have to increase to 19 million barrels
per day, from the current 18 million.
   ``If we don't have an increase in production, we'll have an
extremely tight and volatile market through the second half,''
observed Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Baker said the strong move in outer-month contracts confirmed
the market's bullish tone. Contracts for September delivery of West
Texas Intermediate, for example, traded 31 cents higher than the
June contract.
   Worries about continuing hostilities in the Persian Gulf also
helped pull prices up, the analysts said. Iraq reported its 12th
attack on an Iranian tanker in 18 days on Monday.

   Bank of New York Co. says it may drop its
seven-month hostile effort to acquire Irving Bank Corp. now that
Irving management apparently has won a heated proxy battle for
control of the company.
   Irving had no specific results Monday, but said a preliminary
count of proxies submitted at its May 6 annual meeting showed
shareholders re-elected a slate of incumbent directors over Bank of
New York's 16 nominees.
   Bank spokesman D. Emerson Phelps said the results were released
by Corporation Trust Co., an independent elections inspector based
in Wilmington, Del. A final vote count is expected at a reconvened
shareholders' meeting May 24.
   Re-election of Irving's directors would amount to a vote of
confidence in the company's defensive restructuring plan and stock
sale to state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's
second-largest bank. The proposal was made as an alternative to
rival Bank of New York's $1 billion-plus hostile tender offer,
which expires Friday.
   ``This vote of confidence in Irving's board is gratifying,''
Irving said in a statement.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's common shares. The offer is valued at about $63 a share or
$1.08 billion.
   The company said Monday that it held about 62 percent of
Irving's common shares, including its own shares and those tendered
to it. The company said its offer was contingent upon it receiving
two-thirds of Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding.
   Irving was unchanged at $60.62{ a share Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange, while Bank of New York rose $1.25 to $32 a share.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said the company was
disappointed by Irving's announcement Monday and was reviewing all
of its options, including dropping its bid. Brady refused to
elaborate.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $75 a share for 9.5 million Irving
shares, about 51 percent of the outstanding common stock, for a
total of $712.5 million. In addition, it said it would pay
shareholders interest on the purchase price from May 31 until the
deal closes.
   The Banca Commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that includes sales of assets such as Irving's 50-story Wall
Street headquarters, cost-cutting measures and a special
$10-a-share cash dividend. Irving said the offer has a blended
value of between $65.20 and $72.55 a share.
   Banking experts said they were surprised by Irving's apparent
victory in the proxy battle.
   Most analysts had given Bank of New York an edge, mainly because
it already had secured the necessary regulatory approvals from the
Federal Reserve and New York State Banking boards. Banca
Commerciale, which is controlled by the government agency Instituto
per la Recostruzione Industriale, has just begun the lengthy
regulatory review process.
   ``I guess all the right analysts were wrong once again,'' said
Stephen Berman of County Securities USA.
   James McDermott, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, said,
``barring a change in attitude by Irving management ... it would be
unlikely that the Bank of New York would acquire Irving.
   ``I guess as a practical matter it probably takes the Bank of
New York offer out of play,'' he said.
   Irving has staunchly resisted Bank of New York's advances since
they began in late September.
   Hostile takeover efforts are very rare in the banking industry.
A Bank of New York-Irving merger would have created one of the
nation's 15 largest banks with assets of more than $40 billion.
   Banca Commerciale has assets of about $60 billion.

<HEAD>Ripple Of Boeing's $3.69 Billion Order Will Be Felt In Seattle For
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State, local and company officials weren't
popping champagne corks when Boeing Co. landed a $3.69 billion
commercial jet order, but they nevertheless were delighted about
the years of economic stability expected to stem from the sale.
   ``As the saying goes, `what's good for Boeing is, by and large,
good for Seattle,''' laughed D'Anne Mount, spokeswoman for the city
of Seattle's Department of Community Development.
   The order Boeing announced Monday represented the lion's share
of a record $5.04 billion, 130-plane purchase by International
Lease Finance Corp., which leases planes to many of the world's
airlines. Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium got the rest of the
order.
   R.R. Albrecht, executive vice president in charge of sales and
marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the order would not
change production schedules.
   But it will add stability and keep the world's leading airplane
manufacturer working at full capacity through 1991, even if Boeing
receives no other airplane orders, Albrecht said.
   Boeing employs 90,000 people in the Seattle area, and directly
or indirectly provides for one of every four jobs in a metropolitan
area of 1.5 million people, Ms. Mount said.
   But the ripple effect of Monday's 100-plane order will be felt
by the whole state through the early 1990s, said Dick Milne, Gov.
Booth Gardner's press secretary.
   ``Any time Boeing gets an order of that magnitude it's good news
for the whole state,'' said Milne. ``It may not mean a single new
job, but it means that the ones we have are secure through 1995.''
   Monday's order easily put Boeing on a record sales pace, one
that industry analysts said may quicken more as recent safety
incidents prompt airlines to review their aging fleet and consider
orders for new planes.
   George D. Shapiro, of the investment firm Salomon Brothers in
New York, said Boeing sales may be spurred by the Aloha Airlines'
Boeing 737 that lost part of its fuselage, killing a flight
attendant, before landing safely earlier this month.
   ``One of every four airplanes today is over 19 years old. What
that says to me is the potential for future sales for Boeing,''
Shapiro said.
   ``Passengers are concerned and that's going to put pressure on
the airlines to replace older planes,'' he said.
   In the first five months of 1988, Boeing has amassed $11.6
billion in orders. The previous yearly high was last year's $19.9
billion in jet orders. The 1988 total already is the airline's
third highest total, with seven months to go.
   Boeing now has a backlog of 930 airplanes to deliver.
   The company's portion of Monday's order consisted of 72 planes
of models 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500; eight 757-200s; nine
767-300ERs; four 747-400s; and a previously unannounced order of
six planes in the 737 series and one 757-200.
   Boeing valued its share of the contract at $4.6 billion,
including the price of 24 additional planes on which International
Lease Finance has purchase options.
   The largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986, when
British Airways ordered 16 Boeing 747s for $2.3 billion. That deal
includes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring the
value to $4.1 billion.

<HEAD>Texaco, Icahn Talking About Settling Differences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. and Carl Icahn, its biggest
shareholder and main potential antagonist, are discussing how to
resolve their differences without continuing a proxy fight over
five seats on the oil giant's board.
   The company said late Monday that it and Icahn also had agreed
to support a one-week adjournment of its June 7 annual shareholder
meeting _ if each party requested it _ in order to facilitate the
discussions.
   Icahn, who is chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., has
nominated five candidates including himself for Texaco's 14-member
board. The election is scheduled for the June 7 annual meeting in
Tulsa, Okla.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, has filed a
federal court suit to block Icahn from soliciting proxies and
accusing him of securities law violations.
   The company claims Icahn is trying to get Texaco to buy back his
14.8 percent stake at a premium, to force Texaco's acquisition by a
third party or to acquire Texaco and liquidate its assests.
   But in a statement late Monday from White Plains, Texaco said it
and Icahn were ``engaged in discussions seeking to resolve their
differences without continuing a proxy contest.''
   The statement said Texaco and Icahn stressed that any resolution
of their differences ``will not include consideration for any
shareholder that is not equally available to all Texaco
shareholders.''
   ``Any such resolution would also require that Texaco be
satisfied that it would retain an investment grade credit rating,''
the statement said.
   ``To facilitate such discussions, Texaco and Mr. Icahn have
agreed that each of them will vote the shares and proxies under
their control to support an adjournment of the annual meeting from
June 7 to June 14 if a request is made by the other party to do
so,'' it said.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, Texaco fell
62{ cents a share to $48.87{.
   Icahn began buying stock in Texaco while Texaco was negotiating
a settlement with rival Pennzoil Co. over a $10.3 billion judgment
awarded Pennzoil after a Texas jury found Texaco had interfered
illegally with Pennzoil's merger with Getty Oil Co.
   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code last year to forestall payment of the massive
judgment. It emerged from Chapter 11 last month under a
court-approved reorganization plan that included a $3 billion
settlement with Pennzoil.

   Eds: updates with other banks cutting rate, includes details of
reported rift.
   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's major commercial banks announced on
Tuesday they would cut their base lending rate by half a percentage
point to 7.5 percent, heeding a signal from the central bank which
was an apparent effort to stem the strong pound.
   The recent strength in the pound has caused a reported rift in
the government.
   National Westminster Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank
PLC and Midland Bank PLC cut the benchmark borrowing rate,
effective Wednesday, after the central bank cut its money-market
dealing rate to 7.5 percent from 7~ percent.
   The pound plunged on the news, which surprised the markets.
   It was quoted at $1.8740 and 3.1550 West German marks, down from
$1.8810 and below 3.18 marks just before the central bank announced
its move at about midday.
   The latest cut brings the base lending rate to its lowest level
since April 1978, Natwest said. The base rate previously was cut on
April 8, when it was lowered half a point to 8 percent.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at one percentage point
above the base lending rate.
   The Bank of England's move came when sterling actually was
weakening a bit on on unconfirmed reports that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, an advocate of free-market policies, would back
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's desire for a more
managed exchange rate.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has expressed concern that sustained
intervention could fuel inflation, was to answer questions in the
House of Commons later in the day, and she was likely to be
questioned closely on exchange rate policy. Mrs. Thatcher
repeatedly has cited fighting inflation as her main economic aim.
   Lawson suppports curtailing the pound through interest rate cuts
and central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets. A
strong pound could hurt British exports and corporate profits.

<TEXT>
   With Britain's economy on the upswing, a
new phenomenon has emerged: Employers can't find workers to fill
many jobs.
   The buoyant economy is creating new jobs very quickly, and they
require new skills. Hence, Britain has 2.5 million people
unemployed, but 700,000 job vacancies.
   ``It totally amazes most people because they're constantly
bombarded with articles about unemployment,'' said Bill Horsman,
managing director of 98-year-old hatmakers W. Wright and Son Ltd.
in Luton, a town that suffers from this problem.
   The Trades Union Congress, Britain's umbrella labor
organization, blames industry for failing to train workers.
   Employers acknowledge that companies haven't trained or
retrained enough workers, but they also maintain that Britain's
schools have failed to equip students with proper skills.
   The schools counter that while this was true in the past, they
are more responsive today.
   Adding to the problem are the economic disparities among
Britain's various regions, which discourage job seekers from
relocating because living in one place, mainly the Southeast, can
cost so much more than in another.
   At the same time, school graduates, whose numbers are shrinking
because of lower birth rates, shy away from the ``sweat-shop''
work, such as in Luton's hat industry, and ``oily, dirty''
engineering that in a country like West Germany is a high-status
profession, said Brian Sykes, manager of an employers' self-help
group called the Bedfordshire Network.
   While unemployment stood at 9 percent in March, the number of
unfilled jobs was up 15 percent from a year ago, according to the
Department of Employment.
   Luton, a city of 150,000 people 28 miles northwest of London,
had 1,199 vacancies and 7,641 unemployed people, or an estimated 8
percent of the work force.
   ``You have this peculiar situation where you have a relatively
high unemployment rate, which coexists with quite a large number of
unfilled jobs, partly because of the skills shortage,'' said Sykes.
   For Horsman, the hatmaker, it means: ``You can't take on new
business because you can't fulfill the orders.''
   The traditional industries are vulnerable because they are
having trouble replacing their aging work forces.
   The shortage not only makes companies less productive, but also
forces them to pay more to attract employees. That cuts into
profits and can fuel inflation.
   Luton also is more expensive to live in because its proximity to
London pushes up house prices, discouraging people from other, the
less expensive areas to move here.
   But things are looking up.
   Local schools are teaching skills the job markets need.
Commercial training companies also have stepped in to fill the gap
and profit from it.
   The Conservative government's Manpower Services Commission has
launched various plans under which it and employers jointly pay
employees during training.
   The Trades Union Congress has called for the government to
require employers to train workers and pay for it.
   Separately, employers have set up 80 networks around the country
to identify the shortages, and start training programs.
   In the meantime, individual companies have taken other steps.
   Horsman, for example, has bought stitching machines and uses
glue guns to cut down on the number of seamstresses he needs. He
also uses 10 outside workers, mostly young women with children, who
trim hats at home.
   A year ago, he built a new $1.32-million factory.
   ``If you can't attract people to a factory like this, you might
as well give up,'' Horsman said.
   But he still hasn't been able to find the six to 10 extra
workers needs to boost his $3 million annual production by 20
percent.

   Eight years ago, Britain's largest bank discovered
it was being hurt because more and more of women managers were
leaving to have babies and not coming back.
   That's when National Westminster Bank became the first of a
number of British institutions to take a radical step. It offered
maternity leaves for as long as five years.
   Open mainly to young executives, NatWest's pioneering ``career
breaks'' program also is open to men, but the emphasis is on women
and could help revolutionize Britain's tradition-bound working
world as the economy soars and a labor shortage looms.
   The programs have been criticized, however, as too limited.
   ``Career break programs are very much geared to managerial and
professional occupations,'' said Carole Truman, a research fellow
and author of a study of career breaks.
   ``They're still very few and far between, but it may have opened
the door to enabling people to take a more flexible approach to
work.''
   Zeena Gooch, a 30-year-old NatWest assistant manager who
recently returned from five years off, says that without the
program she may never have come back.
   ``You lose your confidence when you're away ... and you're out
of touch,'' she said.
   Companies offering career breaks include several other banks, as
well as Esso UK PLC, a computer company, and six government
ministries.
   But overall, Britain is behind others on national leave
programs, childcare facilities and flexible working hours.
   ``In terms of a range of options ... we're lagging far behind
other European countries,'' said Bronwen Cohen, head of policy at
the government-funded but independent Equal Opportunities
Commission.
   Under a 1976 law, only about half of working women qualify for
maternity leave, Ms. Cohen said in an interview.
   Only women who have worked at least 16 hours a week for the same
employer for two years, or at least 8 hours a week for five years,
can get their jobs back after 40 weeks off. The government is
considering raising the limit to 20 hours a week.
   In France, most pregnant workers get maternity breaks for as
long as two years and in Spain three years, Ms. Cohen said. The
European Economic Community is studying a three-month parental
leave as a legal minimum for all 12 member nations. Britain is an
EEC member.
   The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to create a
national 25-week leave. Only 20 to 25 U.S. states have legal
maternity leaves, averaging two months, according to the
Congressional Committee on Women's Issues.
   When British women quit their jobs to have children, most don't
return to the same company, studies show.
   The Equal Opportunities Commission found 20 percent of
non-working mothers stayed home because they wanted to care for
their children, but two-thirds said they quit working for lack of
childcare or flexible work hours.
   When they return to work, usually after five years, they often
must take lower-paying, lower-status or part-time jobs, Ms. Truman
said in an interview.
   Ms. Gooch said that without her bank's program, ``I would have
had to start again or come back as a cashier.''
   NatWest lost three-quarters of the 80 women a year who took
maternity leaves before the five-year plan was introduced. It now
offers breaks to men and women with managerial potential, who have
been with the bank for five years and will stay 20 years more when
they come back.
   Those who take the long breaks work for two weeks a year, attend
annual seminars, and receive regular updates on the office.
   Annette Weller, a mother of two on a civil service career break,
said, ``It doesn't keep you up with the work you were doing, but it
keeps you in touch with what's happening in the office. It's an
initial step back.''

   Twenty years ago the chairman of a major company
asked a professor to help him evaluate the executives who worked
for him, especially in regard to what might be expected of them.
   The professor, Eugene E. Jennings, had developed a reputation
for analyzing corporations and the people who manage them, and
already had advised many chief executives on executive personnel
matters.
   This assignment was different: Before he could project the
performance that might be expected of the executives he would first
have to determine who they were and what made them do the things
they did.
   It required him to develop an analytical framework. Should he
fail to develop one, he feared, he might find himself doing what he
had often criticized in the news media, that of judging a top
executive on style alone.
   Style is perhaps the least important aspect of an executive,
says Jennings, professor of business administration at Michigan
State University and author of many books on institutional
leadership.
   Style is a reflection of temperament, the degree to which a
person is, for example, vociferous, brusk, patient, passive and so
on. ``But the person who focuses on style never gets to
substance,'' Jennings says.
   He believes it is much more rewarding and revealing to focus on
the person's personal and functional values or operating
principles; the individual's own view of his or her role; their
technique of decision making.
   Evaluate executives on that basis and you will have a much
fuller picture of the person, he advises the media, stock market
analysts, authors, executive headhunters and others who, he says,
customarily fall into the style trap.
   He refers to his system as VTRS.
   V is for personal and functional values. Every executive, he
says, has certain values that foretell behavior. If you want to
find out about your boss' values ask yourself: What would most
upset my boss if I did it?
   President Jimmy Carter, for instance, wanted nothing given to
him that had not been formatted, or put into a logical format from
which he could make judgments, Jennings says.
   T is technique of decision making. For example, is the chief
analytical or intuitive?
   Some chiefs, says Jennings, require lots of data and get
involved in intense analyses. Others might need little data. Some
need many sources, others few.
   R is for role. Every executive has a view of his or her job that
goes beyond the usual job description. It is that person's
essential justification for being the boss.
   ``What is his or her driving force? How does the boss view his
or her role in history? What will history say about the boss?''
   S, or style, is easy to spot, says Jennings, since it involves
outward and obvious personality traits. It lends itself to colorful
and even dramatic descriptions, but seldom does an analysis of
style get far beneath the surface.
   Jennings observes that style analysis cannot help a reader
understand how, for example, 10 executives fail to get along _
because they have incompatible operating values, disparate views of
each others' roles, and employ decision-making techniques that
require varying amounts of time, information and people.
   He suggests that those called upon to analyze the uniqueness of
executives use his guide, or a similar one, as a means of avoiding
the style trap.
   He warns against books by so-called insiders such as
speechwriters. ``Speechwriters are provided peepholes in which they
learn just enough in order to write the story but not enough to
understand the full content of an event.''
   He criticizes a current book, ``Call Me Roger,'' by a former
General Motors speechwriter, as an example of the emphasis on
style. ``If you want to know what makes the chairman of GM tick you
won't find it there,'' he says.

   Share prices jumped Tuesday, buoyed by a sharp
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit and by a cut in the British
commercial banks' base lending rate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 23.8
points, or 1.3 percent, by early afternoon.
   At midday, volume was a modest 203.5 million shares compared
with 164.5 million shares at the same time Monday.
   Share prices spurted after the Commerce Department reported that
the U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $9.7 billion in
March from $13.8 billion in February.
   The markets had been expecting a deficit of between $12 billion
and $13 billion.
   Earlier, Britain's major commercial banks, heeding a signal from
the Bank of England, announced they would cut their base lending
rate by half a percentage point to 7.5 percent.
   The banks announced the cut in the benchmark borrowing rate,
effective Wednesday, after the central bank cut its money-market
dealing rate to 7.5 percent from 7~ percent at about midday.
   The Bank of England's move, which surprised the markets,
apparently was in response to the pound's recent strength on
foreign exchange markets.
   The pound plunged against the dollar on the interest rate cut
and trade report.

   The nation's trade deficit shrank more than $4 billion in March
to $9.7 billion, the lowest monthly shortfall since March 1985, the
government reported today.
   U.S. producers sold a record amount of goods overseas in March,
slicing by 29.5 percent the February deficit of $13.83 billion.
   The Commerce Department said U.S. exports shot up 23 percent to
an all-time high of $28.97 billion while imports rose only 3.6
percent to $38.72 billion. The trade deficit is the difference
between the two.
   The besieged dollar was boosted by news of the dramatically
improved trade performance. The U.S. currency was trading at around
125.90 Japanese yen in New York shortly after the figures were
released, up from 124.95 yen earlier in London.
   The dollar also jumped to around 1.7060 West German marks from
1.6875 marks. The British pound dropped against the dollar, to
around $1.8500 from $1.8855.
   The stock market got a late-afternoon lift Monday from
speculation that the March trade-deficit numbers being released
today would show substantial improvement.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which moved in a
narrow range for much of the day, rose 17.08 points to 2,007.63 on
Monday. Broader market indicators also rose.
   Earlier Monday, the government reported U.S. industrial
production surged 0.7 percent in April, the biggest gain in six
months. The rise was more than three times as rapid as the 0.2
percent March increase and pushed overall industrial output up 6.4
percent from a year ago.
   The April increase reflected widespread production gains at
manufacturing plants, where output rose 0.7 percent. Factories
producing durable goods expected to last three or more years saw
output climb 0.9 percent while plants making non-durable goods
boosted output by 0.4 percent.
   Auto production, which had been lagging as manufacturers tried
to work down a huge backlog of unsold cars, jumped sharply for a
second straight month with passenger cars being assembled at an
annual rate of 7 million units, up from a rate of 6.6 million in
March.
   The overall production increase in April was the strongest since
a 1.1 percent rise last October. Output slowed a bit early in the
year, reflecting in large part a drop in auto production.
   Still, the slowdown was nowhere near as severe as some
economists had forecast immediately following the October stock
market crash, which had raised concerns of sharp production
cutbacks early this year that could push the nation into a
recession.
   In other economic news on Monday, interest rates on short-term
Treasury securities fell in the latest auction to the lowest level
in two weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.28 percent, down from 6.31 percent
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.50 percent, down from 6.51 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since May 2, when three-month bills
sold for 6.13 percent and six-month bills averaged 6.41 percent.

   Stock prices rose broadly this morning after the
government reported an unexpectedly large drop in the trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which climbed
back over the 2,000 level late Monday on expectations that the
trade deficit would narrow, advanced 7.62 points to 2,015.25 by 10
a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.51 to 146.72. On the
American Exchange, the market value index rose 0.93 to 298.89.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4-to-1 on the
NYSE, with 880 up, 200 down and 428 unchanged. Volume on the Big
Board totaled 24.72 million shares after the first 30 minutes.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit shrank to $9.7
billion in March, a drop of more than $4 billion over the previous
monthly deficit, reflecting a 23 percent surge in exports to a
record $29.97 billion. Imports rose 3.6 percent to $38.72 billion.
   The improvement was a major surprise, driving the dollar sharply
higher, inciting a rally in the dollar and easing interest rates in
the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 17.08 points to
2,007.63. Advancing issues outnumbered declines on by slightly more
than 3-to-2 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 901
up, 559 down and 508 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.01 million shares, vs. 147.24
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Cites Trend Toward Smaller Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said
Tuesday the sharp drop in the U.S. trade deficit in March confirmed
a clear trend toward closing the gap between the nation's imports
and exports.
   The Commerce Department reported in Washington that the American
trade gap shrank to $9.7 billion in March as U.S. exports surged to
record levels. The February deficit had been $13.83 billion.
   ``The U.S. trade deficit has been declining in volume terms for
quite some time,'' said Baker, who was in Paris to attend a meeting
of Western trade and finance ministers starting Wednesday. ``While
monthly figures will tend to fluctuate, it is nevertheless clear
that the U.S. trade deficit is now also declining in nominal terms
as well.''
   Baker was referring to the fact that the trade gap, measured in
nominal dollar terms, has been fed by the effects of a weakening
U.S. dollar, which has boosted the value of imported goods even as
import volumes have leveled off.
   World trade imbalances are expected to be a central focus at
Baker's two days of meetings this week with his counterparts from
the 23 other member countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Agriculture and other economic
policies also are to be discussed.

   The dollar surged against other major currencies
today, bolstered by news of a better-than-expected U.S. trade
performance in March.
   But stock prices turned mixed following a short-lived rally
sparked by the trade figures, while bond prices dropped after an
initial strong advance.
   The Commerce Department reported today that the trade deficit

   The report triggered a sharp rise in the dollar on foreign
currency markets.
   The dollar jumped to around 125.90 Japanese yen in New York from
124.95 yen earlier in London, and rose to just under 1.71 West
German marks from 1.69 marks. The British pound dropped to around
$1.85 from $1.89.
   Stock prices rose broadly after the trade report was released
but then gave up most of the gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which climbed
back over the 2,000 level late Monday on expectations that the
trade shortfall would narrow, was down 2.49 points at 2,005.14 at
11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   After an initial surge inspired by the trade news, bond prices
dropped as traders began to look more closely at the statistics.
They were disappointed that U.S. imports rose during the month, by
3.6 percent to $38.72 billion.
   In addition, the bond market viewed the 23 percent jump in
exports _ to an all-time high of $28.97 billion _ as a sign the
U.S. economy could overheat from the surge in production of export
goods and thereby intensify inflationary pressures.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments such as
bonds and tends to depress bond prices and drive interest rates
higher.
   Bond traders saw further evidence that the economy risked
overheating when the government reported at midmorning that U.S.
industry operated at 82.7 percent of capacity in April, the highest
level in more than eight years.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down about {
point, or $5 for every $1,000 in face value, at around mid-morning.
Its yield rose to 9.16 percent from 9.11 percent late Monday.

   Stocks rose broadly this morning after the
government reported an unexpectedly large drop in the trade
deficit, but the rally quickly faded in another sign of post-crash
investor apathy and fear of inflation.
   ``The fact that it waned so quickly is disappointing to me,''
said Peter J. DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The psychology is negative and low. One number
isn't going to change that.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose about
15 points at the opening on the trade news, retreated by 11 a.m.
EDT to 2,005.14, down 2.49.
   Among broader market barometers, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 0.23 to 145.98. On the
American Exchange, the market value index was unchanged at 297.96.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with
628 up, 576 down and 536 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled
50.83 million shares after the first 90 minutes.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit shrank to $9.7
billion in March, a drop of more than $4 billion over the previous
monthly deficit, reflecting a 23 percent surge in exports to a
record $29.97 billion. Imports rose 3.6 percent to $38.72 billion.
   The improvement was a major surprise, initially driving the
dollar sharply higher and rallying the bond market, a sensitive
barometer of the economy. But bond prices later retreated.
   Some economists interpreted the trade figure as another sign of
a rapidly growing domestic economy, which translates into higher
inflation and rising interest rates.
   That theory was reinforced by another economic statistic
released this morning from the Federal Reserve, which showed
American industry operated at 82.7 percent of capacity in April,
the highest level in more than eight years.
   Texaco was the most-active NYSE issue, up ] to 49\ on volume
exceeding 1 million shares. The oil giant was holding talks with
its largest shareholder, takeover strategist Carl Icahn.
   Among other actively traded blue-chips, General Electric fell \
to 40\, IBM rose [ to 111} and AT&T fell ] to 26~.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 17.08 points to
2,007.63. Advancing issues outnumbered declines on by slightly more
than 3-to-2 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 901
up, 559 down and 508 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.01 million shares, vs. 147.24
million in the previous session.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed but
quickly turned higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Dry-weather fears continued to dominate the market, with some
private forecasters predicting an extended period of dryness in the
Corn Belt, said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Dry conditions could damage the winter wheat crop, which is in a
critical stage of maturity, and delay germination of corn and
soybeans, Loewy said.
   ``There's no ceiling on the soybean market if this dry weather
continues,'' he said. Soybean futures have gained more than 60
cents a bushel so far this this month.
   The Agriculture Department reported Monday corn planting was
about 88 percent complete as of Sunday. Soybean planting was about
40 percent finished.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with
May unchanged at $3.19 a bushel; corn was { cent to 1{ cents higher
with May at $2.07} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with
May at $1.62} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 2{ cents
higher with May at $7.48{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange following Monday's USDA report
showing larger-than-expected cattle marketings during April.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .37 cent higher with June at
73.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .60 cent
higher with May at 80.85 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .55
cent higher with June at 53.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .28 cent to .63 cent higher with May at 54.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday.

   The world's two biggest computer companies and
five others are rebelling against the efforts of American Telephone
& Telegraph Co. to control a critically important computer
operating standard.
   The rift has the potential to slow progress in creating computer
programs that can run with little or no modification on a wide
range of machines.
   Pitted against AT&T and its Silicon Valley partner, Sun
Microsystems Inc., are giant International Business Machines Corp.
and Digital Equipment Corp. as well as Hewlett-Packard Co., Apollo
Computer Inc. and three European companies.
   Top executives of the seven companies appeared at a news
conference today to announce creation of an Open Software
Foundation, which would create a computing standard independent of
AT&T.
   IBM, Digital and the others believe AT&T and Sun are exerting
too much control over the operating system known as Unix, a layer
of software that controls basic computer operations.
   AT&T invented Unix and licenses it to other computer makers for
use on their machines. The dispute is important because Unix is
becoming a major force in the computer industry, because of the
ease with which it runs on computers of different designs.
   In a rare display of power, IBM Chairman John F. Akers, Digital
President Kenneth Olsen and Hewlett-Packard chief John Young made
appearances at today's news conference.
   ``It's not every day we find so many heavyweights in the ring at
the same time,'' Young said. ``We all agreed to redefine the rules
of the next round of battle.''
   The European companies that participated in the news conference
are Siemens AG and Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and Groupe
Bull of France.
   The companies will each contribute about $4.5 million a year to
the Open Software Foundation for the first three years, it was
announced.
   The seven computer makers are irked by the requirements AT&T
imposes on companies that license the latest version of Unix.
Licensees must assert that they comply with certain AT&T standards
for the way their versions of the operating system hook into
applications software, such as database managers.
   As a last resort, if companies failed to bring their versions
into compliance, AT&T could revoke their Unix licenses.
   Digital's Olsen said the Open Software Foundation was not
intended to compete with AT&T and said that AT&T had in fact been
invited to join.
   But Robert Kavner, the new president of AT&T's Data Systems
Group, said in an interview today, ``If we did join, we would put
Unix and the future of open systems in the hands of a foundation
that has inherent conflicting motives among its sponsors.''
   Some critics of IBM and Digital have questioned whether IBM and
Digital really want to promote an industrywide computing standard,
since that could liberate their customers to buy other companies'
computers and software.
   Michael DeFazio, AT&T's director of software systems, said
computer users and independent software developers are happy with
the company's efforts to ensure uniformity because it makes it
easier for them to run programs on a variety of machines.
   DeFazio denied claims that AT&T and Sun Microsystems were
working to make sure that future versions of Unix worked best on
their own computers.
   AT&T recently agreed to buy a stake of up to 20 percent in Sun,
a Mountain View, Calif.-based maker of scientific and engineering
workstations that has been moving into other segments of the
computer industry.
   The computer companies said the Open Software Foundation would
create a new software ``environment'' that would go beyond an
operating system to standardize other aspects of the computer's
software, including the way computers hook together in networks.
   For a starting point, the new software will be based on IBM's
version of Unix known as AIX. It will comply with standards
specified by Posix, a project of the Institute of Electrical
Engineers, and X-Open, an international standard-setting
organization.
   Posix stands for Portable Operating System Environment.
   The seven companies in the Open Systems group are suspicious of
AT&T and its role in overseeing Unix, said Greg Cline, an analyst
for the Yankee Group in Boston. But AT&T is suspicious of those
companies, too, Cline said.
   ``It's like verifying nuclear treaties on-site,'' he said.

<HEAD>Times Are Good for Las Vegas' Golden Boy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Steve Wynn first visited here in
1952, sharing his father's dream of a flashy bingo parlor on a
patch of desert called the Strip, $5 million could have bought the
clump of casinos that captivated the 10-year-old.
   Today, Wynn is spending more than a hundred times that amount on
a desert paradise that staggers even his immense imagination _ a
new Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.
   The youngster who was star-struck by this neon fantasyland 36
years ago has become Nevada's golden boy. With a penchant for
pizazz and a flair for doing deals, he promises the best is yet to
come for the city that sent his father back to Maryland in 1952,
nursing busted dreams.
   ``You ain't seen nothin' yet,'' boasted Wynn, chairman of Golden
Nugget Inc. and listed by Forbes magazine as one of the 800 most
powerful executives in America.
   Equally at home in the boardroom or at the blackjack table, Wynn
has taken the Golden Nugget from a honky-tonk casino in downtown's
Glitter Gulch to one of the nation's premier gaming companies with
revenues of about $190 million a year. And he's betting $550
million that his new resort, scheduled to open in the summer or
fall of 1989, will be ``a wonderment the world will flock to see.''
   Wynn already has $200 million invested in the Golden Nugget
downtown, where the Las Vegas gaming industry was born. He says his
new 3,300-room property on the Strip, now attracting a more upscale
breed of gambling visitor, is the forerunner to other giant
developments there.
   ``For half a billion dollars, you could have owned the entire
state of Nevada,'' Wynn said, comparing his blossoming resort with
his first visit to Las Vegas in the '50s.
   His father, Michael, hoped to open a bingo parlor on the
sparsely-settled Strip in those days, but a downtown casino heard
of his plans and opened its own operation, forcing Wynn and his son
to return East. Ironically, that casino was the Golden Nugget.
   Steve Wynn returned to Las Vegas in 1967 with a $35,000
bankroll. He engineered a deal with the late billionaire Howard
Hughes for a piece of land next to Caesars Palace, resold it to the
resort months later for a $1 million profit, and used that money to
buy into the Nugget.
   Today, that $1 million would hardly cause a ripple in this
gaming capital.
   ``We've already invested more money in this property (downtown)
than the entire capital expenditure of the city of Las Vegas,''
Wynn said in a recent interview in his plush office atop the
downtown resort.
   ``The enormous megabuck investment is not only necessary, it has
become the safest route to take,'' Wynn said. ``We've learned that
a destination resort like Las Vegas is the perfect launching pad
for bigger and better projects. This place is a big, huge, roaring,
successful destination resort, with people coming from all around
the world.''
   With nearly 17 million visitors expected in 1988 and tourism
growing at a double-digit pace each year, Wynn says Golden Nugget
won't be the last giant property built on the booming Strip, where
20,000 new hotel rooms are under construction or planned.
   Wynn admits he suffered from an attack of cold feet seven years
ago when he shelved plans for a similar project, down the Strip
from his present development.
   ``I started one of these babies for $400 million in 1981 and
chickened out,'' Wynn recalled. ``We didn't know the impact of New
Jersey on Nevada; we had a recession starting that scared the
dickens out of everybody. We didn't know how Las Vegas would handle
a recession; how it would handle a recession including Atlantic
City and deregulation of the airlines. There were no non-stop
flights here from the East Coast anymore.''
   ``Those questions were frightening, frightening enough for me to
say `Hey, I ain't gonna spend $400 million. We could make a
mistake.' Now, five, six years later, we saw what happened with the
recession _ practically nothing. We saw what happened with the
airlines; that hurt a little bit but we overcame it. We saw what
happened with Atlantic City _ $1.8 billion (in gambling) in Nevada
in 1979 to $5 billion today. Nobody dreamed there was that kind of
elasticity in America.''
   Wynn said he has already talked with Caesars chairman Henry
Gluck about joint ventures on major sporting events, particularly
boxing. When completed late next year, the Nugget and Caesars will
occupy a one-mile stretch of the famous Strip.
   Wynn bristles at competitor Donald Trump's claim that Atlantic
City has stolen from Las Vegas the title of boxing capital of the
world. Trump has, in recent months, landed the megabucks Mike
Tyson-Larry Holmes fight and the upcoming Tyson-Michael Spinks bout.
   ``He'd better make that claim while he can, because he won't be
able to make it long,'' Wynn vowed.
   The two gaming giants are hardly best of friends. Trump has been
quoted as calling Wynn a ``classic underachiever.'' Wynn has called
Trump ``twinkle toes.''
   The two were competitors when Wynn owned the Golden Nugget in
Atlantic City. Wynn's sale of the Atlantic City Nugget to Bally
Corp. for $440 million last year was a factor in blocking Trump's
efforts to take over Bally's.
   Months later, Trump announced he had bought a 4.9 percent stake
in Golden Nugget Inc. and indicated he might try to acquire
controlling interest in Wynn's company. Wynn still fumes over the
publicity Trump generated from that move.
   ``He did that for publicity and admitted it,'' Wynn growled.
``He never owned 5 percent. He owned 2 or 3 and he sold it right
away.''
   Will the new Nugget be locking horns with Trump for the big
fights? ``You bet we will,'' Wynn vowed.
   Wall Street analysts are generally high on Wynn and his
enthusiasm, but a little less confident about the gaming market's
capacity to support his dreams.
   Daniel Lee, an analyst for the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., said Wynn's income estimates for the new resort may
be overly optimistic considering the competition on the Strip.
   ``The big uncertainty is what that casino can do,'' Lee said.
``I think it will be successful because of Steve Wynn.''

<HEAD>NBC's Cable Venture Would Bridge Television Rivalry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National Broadcasting Co.'s plan to buy a cable
television channel promises to forge the strongest link to date
between rival segments of the television business.
   With prime-time network ratings dropping and cable advertising
revenue rising, even the owner of top-rated NBC Television is
looking for ways to broaden its base.
   Analysts say NBC's new cable channel, which it plans to use as
an outlet for sports and business news, could boost the return on
its investment in information gathering and provide a hedge against
further erosion in the audience for network broadcasts.
   ``This could be a model for what happens in the industry over
the next couple of years,'' said media industry analyst Peter
Appert of the investment firm Cyrus J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc.
   The audience for the three major networks has slipped in recent
years as viewers turned to cable, independent and pay television
and videocassettes. In the just completed television season, for
instance, the prime-time audience for the three major networks fell
9 percent.
   At the same time, advertisers have spent more on cable
television. Ad spending on cable networks alone is expected to rise
20 percent this year to more than $1 billion, industry analysts say.
   Although cable audience ratings and ad spending remain only a
fraction of what the networks get, a trend is evident.
   ``The broadcast networks have reached a relative stage of
maturity ... while cable still has the largest portion of its
growth curve ahead of it,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst
for the media research firm Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif.
   The companies that own the three major broadcast networks have
already taken their first steps into the cable business:
   _NBC owns a 24 percent stake in the Arts & Entertainment Cable
Network, which has about 32 million subscribers. It is proposing to
buy Tempo Television, a cable network with 12 million subscribers.
   _Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the parent of the ABC Television
Network, owns 80 percent of the ESPN sports cable network, with
about 46 million subscribers; 38 percent of Arts & Entertainment
and 33 percent of Lifetime cable network, with about 38.9 million
subscribers.
   _CBS Inc., which owns the CBS Television Network, operated a
cultural cable channel in the early 1980s, but dropped the project
after a year when it failed to generate sufficient viewers and
advertising revenue.
   In each of these cases, the cable networks operated autonomously
from the broadcast operations. NBC said it plans to operate its
cable network separately from its broadcast network, but wants to
have broadcast network talent contribute to the cable sports and
business news programs that it hopes to launch by early 1989.
   While NBC executives say details of how that will be done are
being developed, Tom Rogers, an NBC vice president, said NBC wants
to stamp ``a visible imprimatur of NBC's resources'' on the cable
programming.
   The clearest indication of that, he said, would be to have
people familiar from the NBC network appearing on the cable
programs as well.
   Another feature of this cable proposal that makes it different
from the others is that NBC plans to offer cable operators a chance
to buy a piece of the sports programming service. Terms have not
been disclosed, but Rogers said NBC would retain majority interest
of the sports service.
   NBC President Robert C. Wright had spoken often of his desire to
get into cable, a segment in which he worked before taking over at
NBC in 1986.
   NBC would buy Tempo Television from TeleCommunications Inc., a
Denver-based concern that is the nation's largest cable operator.
The price was not disclosed but it has been reported to be about
$20 million.
   Tele-Communications' president, John Malone, said in announcing
the deal that the cable industry benefits from high-quality
programming and he wanted to encourage NBC's efforts to provide it.
   Some NBC affiliates have expressed concerns that NBC may pay
less attention to its network operations, but others said NBC
executives have repeatedly assured them that the broadcast network
remains the company's main interest.
   Eric Bremner, president of broadcasting for King Broadcasting
Co. in Seattle, which owns three NBC affiliates, expects NBC's move
into cable will ultimately benefit the affiliates.
   NBC could bid for the rights to sports events confident it can
sell the rights to secondary events to its cable partner. The
networks have struck such arrangements with ESPN, for instance, for
events such as tennis or golf.
   It could also test programs on the cable service and bring them
to the network if they prove popular.
   ``The truth is other business entities are moving into these
same areas. We won't be well-served if NBC sits on the sidelines
and lets these developments pass by,'' Bremner said.
   But CBS has no plans to get back into cable anytime soon. The
CBS Television Network finished third for the first time this past
season in the prime-time ratings and Laurence A. Tisch, CBS chief
executive, said he doesn't want to do anything to distract his
management's attention from regaining first place for the network.
   NBC's cable plans of airing business news in the daytime and
sports at night bears a strong resemblance to the format at
Financial News Network Inc. The FNN cable network has provided
financial news since 1981, and currently offers business news by
day, sports at night and home shopping overnight.
   David Meister, president of FNN, said he is confident his
service is lean and driven enough to compete effectively against
NBC.
   ``We take them seriously, but think we can prevail,'' he said.

   The White House today defended an
administration report on the stock market crash after it drew a
cool reaction on Capitol Hill.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the document an
``excellent report'' and said President Reagan feels its
recommendations are sound. ``We feel the report represents the
actions that should be taken,'' Fitzwater said.
   However, the reaction in Congress ensured that lawmakers will
continue work on bills aimed at altering the exchange's operations.
   ``I'm very disappointed with the report. I think it's flatly
wrong,'' Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire,
D-Wis., said Monday, shortly after the Reagan administration's
working group issued its recommendations for preventing future
market plunges.
   The group, headed by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, said
that a ``circuit-breaker'' should be put in place that would halt
trading on all stock, futures and options markets for an hour
should the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall by 250 points. A
second, two-hour close should occur if the Dow drops by 400 points,
the group said.
   The market has only dropped more than 250 points once in its
history: the 508-point plunge of last Oct. 19. It has swung wildly
ever since.
   The group, created in March, also recommended improvements in
the ways traders' transactions are completed and in coordination
among federal agencies that oversee the markets. In addition, they
said the group should continue functioning to help deal with
problems as they arise.
   But the group _ which also consisted of Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan, Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman David S. Ruder, and Commodity and Futures Trading
Commission Chairwoman Wendy Gramm _ failed to suggest other moves
that have found support on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.
   They concluded that the margins _ or downpayments _ for stock,
stock index futures and options are adequate. They failed to agree
on whether steeper margins should be required in an effort to
dampen speculation, a move Ruder supported but the other three
opposed. Margins for futures trading are much lower than for stock
transactions.
   They also ignored a recommendation issued in January by a
presidential task force headed by investment banker Nicholas F.
Brady that a single agency _ preferably the Fed _ should oversee
intermarket issues. Currently, the CFTC oversees the futures
markets while the SEC and the Fed regulate the options and stock
exchanges.
   The group also urged no actions that would limit the use of
program trading, the computer-driven transactions that critics have
blamed for volatility on the stock and futures markets.
   ``It is unrealistic and perhaps counterproductive to try to undo
the changes in financial markets or market strategies brought about
by improvements in telecommunications and computer technology,''
the report said.
   ``Legislation may or may not take place,'' Treasury
Undersecretary George D. Gould, who sat in for Baker at most of the
group's meetings, said at a news conference. ``But the fact is
there were some things we could agree on and put in place which we
felt are important to the integrity of the markets and important to
investor confidence.''
   But Proxmire, who has introduced legislation that would set up a
panel consisting of officials of the Fed, SEC and CFTC to
coordinate market regulation, criticized the report.
   ``It shows a lack of sensitivity to what's keeping the
individual investor out of the market, the volatility,'' he said.
``All the evidence is that the small investor has gotten out of the
market.''
   Asked if he would continue to seek passage of his bill, he said,
``Absolutely.''
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, faulted the group for
its failure to recommend that one agency oversee the markets and
for not urging a change in margin requirements.
   ``Now it's Congress' turn to take the ball and put forward
meaningful market reforms,'' said Markey, who is drafting his own
bill.
   Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, of which Markey's panel is a part, said the group had
made some ``useful recommendations.'' He called for the
administration and its working group to work with Congress to deal
with the overall problem.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
whose panel oversees the CFTC and the futures exchanges, called the
recommendations ``a start.'' He said a federal role in setting
margins needs to be studied.

   So-called corporate ``deadbeats'' _ companiesout how it crashed at
the bottom of a steep hill,
killing three people and injuring 20.
   ``We have some new information about a possible cause,'' state
police Sgt. Dennis Cody said. He declined to elaborate.
   Cody said police plan to talk with the driver again this
afternoon. He said investigators will try to determine whether
mechanical failures or high speed contributed to Monday afternoon's
accident.
   The driver, Lewis Taylor, 44, of Poughkeepsie, was listed in
serious condition today in Northern Dutchess Hospital in Rhinebeck.
He suffered head injuries, cuts and broken bones.
   Eight of the 20 injured were admitted to hospitals, six in
critical condition, authorities said.
   The bus was traveling down a steep hill when it failed to make a
sharp right turn at an intersection, Cody said. The bus hit a
utility pole, tipped over on its right side and came to rest 30
feet from the road, a few feet from Little Wappingers Creek.
   Killed were John Dalyrymple, 44, and Raymond Phillips, 25, both
of Clinton Corners, and Patricia Russo, 23, of Clinton Hollow,
authorities said.
   The bus was owned by Laidlaw Transit, where Taylor has worked
for 2{ years. Betty Guffy, a spokeswoman for the company's
corporate offices in Van Nuys, Calif., said Laidlaw would release
information on the accident today.
   Except for Taylor and Gussie Veach, a 54-year-old bus attendant,
all the passengers were mentally handicapped people working for
Rehabilitation Programs Inc. of the Town of Poughkeepsie. They were
being driven home from three locationswhen the accident happened,
Cody said.
   Chris Scott, who lives near the corner where the accident
happened, described the turn as ``outrageously sharp.''
   ``I've seen a lot of accidents (at the turn)'' in the past five
years, Scott said.

inflation and rising interest rates.

<HEAD>Companies Sign Definitive Merger Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. and
Lorimar Telepictures Corp. announced Tuesday they had signed a
definitive agreement for Warner to acquire Lorimar, producer of
``Dallas'' and other hit TV shows, in a stock swap.
   The deal, announced May 10, would have a value of about $630
million, based on Warner's midday stock price of $33.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The agreement calls for holders of Lorimar's 45.3 million shares
outstanding to receive .415 shares of the New York-based
entertainment conglomerate for each share of Lorimar.
   The transaction, scheduled to close in September, requires
regulatory approval and the approval of a majority of Lorimar
shareholders.
   In addition to the stock trade, Warner agreed to assume
Lorimar's debt of about $550 million.
   After announcement of the tentative merger agreement, Lorimar
disclosed that investor Marvin Davis, who previously had expressed
an interest in the company, was considering a $15-per-share bid for
Lorimar. His earlier bid, dismissed by many analysts as not being
serious, was $17 a share.
   Lorimar chairman Merv Adelson has made it clear he prefers the
stock swap.
   The merger would add a leading producer of network and
syndicated television shows to Warner's already strong movie and
music businesses.
   In addition to ``Dallas,'' Lorimar produces such network series
as ``Knots Landing'' and ``Alf,'' and has a strong lineup of shows
that are syndicated, or sold directly to individual television
stations.
   The merger agreement allows Lorimar to back out if Warner's
stock price doesn't average an amount that would bring Lorimar
shareholders at least $15 a share. If Lorimar cancels, it must pay
Warner $10 million, and if Lorimar is acquired by a third party,
Warner has the right to but 18.5 percent of the company at $15 a
share.

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher Says She and Lawson Agree on Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, apparently
healing a rift with her top Treasury official, said Tuesday she
advocated the use of interest rate cuts and central bank
intervention under the right cicrumstances to manage the pound.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who reportedly has disagreed strongly with
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson over how to respond to the
strong rise in the pound since March, made the comment in
Parliament just hours after Britain's central bank sent a signal to
the commercial banks to cut interest rates.
   The prime minister, who has championed free market policies,
maintained during a session of Parliament that she and Lawon, who
believes in managing exchange rates, were in agreement.
   When asked whether there was ``complete and total unanimity''
between her and Lawson, she replied, ``Yes.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who repeatedly has cited fighting inflation as
her economic aim, had expressed concern that sustained intervention
could fuel inflation.
   Lawson favors curtailing the pound through rate cuts and
intervention in the foreign exchange markets. A strong pound could
hurt British exports and corporate profits.
   ``We will use the available levers, both interest rates and
intervention, as seems right in the circumstances,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said.
   She said it would be a ``great mistake for any speculator to
think that sterling is one-way bet.''
   Britain's major commercial banks announced earlier Tuesday they
would cut their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 7.5
percent, heeding a signal from the central bank, which cut its own
money-market dealing rate.
   The pound fell sharply after the cuts were announced.
   In London, it cost $1.8540 to buy one pound after the rate cut
and the release of better-than-expected U.S. trade figures, cheaper
than $1.8855 in the morning and cheaper than $1.8915 late Monday.
   The prime minister said in Parliament the rate cut would not
have an inflationary impact on the economy because the rising pound
had tightened monetary conditions, meaning there is less money in
the monetary system.
   Dealers said Mrs. Thatcher's comments didn't have much of an
impact on the pound, which already had risen on the rate cut.
   ``The base rate cuts earlier today already told us that Thatcher
aligned herself with Lawson in trying to cap sterling's rise,'' one
dealer said.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson sat together during the session.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit shrank dramatically to
$9.7 billion in March _ a drop of more than $4 billion _ as
American producers sold a record amount of goods overseas, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that American exports shot up 23
percent to an all-time high of $28.97 billion while imports were up
3.6 percent to $38.72 billion. The trade deficit is the difference
between the two.
   The March deficit was the lowest monthly imbalance since March
1985 and represented a 29.5 percent improvement from the February
deficit of $13.83 billion.
   The March improvement was a major surpise and sent the dollar
soaring on foreign exchange markets. In European trading, the
dollar climbed against the British pound and the Japanese yen.
   ``Everyone is breathing a tremendous sigh of relief. This is the
breath of fresh air we have been waiting for,'' said Jay Goldinger,
an analyst with Capital Insight, a Los Angeles investment firm.
   Goldinger predicted that the trade improvement would strengthen
President Reagan's position and make it more difficult for Congress
to override his promised veto of the omnibus trade bill.
   Indeed, the White House seized upon the report as new support
for the veto.
   ``We have said for some time that there is no good time for bad
trade legislation but today's report demonstrates that this is the
worst time,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``This is no time to
shoot ourselves in the foot and ... stymie job creation.''
   But the speaker of the House, Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, said
today's report does not lessen the need for the trade bill to
become law.
   ``The trade deficit is five times as high as it was when
President Reagan came into office ...,'' Wright said. ``By the end
of 1987, the United States had amassed the highest trade deficit
for any nation at any time in history.''
   In a second report today, the Federal Reserve said that American
industry operated at 82.7 percent of capacity in April, up 0.3
percentage point from March. It was the highest operating level in
more than eight years and was further evidence, analysts said, that
American manufacturers are benefiting from the boom in export sales.
   All the good news was in sharp contrast to the jolt financial
markets recieved a month ago when the February trade report was
issued. The unexpected widening of the deficit had sent the dollar
reeling and pushed the Dow Jones average down by 101 points, its
fifth-worst loss ever.
   The monthly trade deficit has become the most closely watched
barometer of U.S. economic health.
   A narrowing of the deficit is seen as a sign of strength for the
American economy because it means more jobs in the manufacturing
sector.
   Additionally, smaller deficits usually translate into less
downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar,
which is also important for the country since sharp declines in the
dollar can send stock and bond markets tumbling because of investor
fears that inflation will rise.
   The $28.97 billion in exports sold represented a $5.4 billion
increase from the February level, reflecting gains in sales of U.S.
machinery, computers, aircraft, chemicals and telecommunications
equipment. In addition, $600 million of the increase came in gold
sales to Taiwan.
   The $1.3 billion rise in imports to $38.72 billion reflected a
small rise in imports of manufactured goods, which offset a decline
in oil imports, which fell 15.2 percent.
   For the first three months of the year, the trade deficit has
totaled $36.01 billion, which translates into an annual deficit of
$144 billion. If that pattern holds for the entire year, it would
represent a substantial improvement from the record 1987 trade
deficit of $171.22 billion.
   As usual, the trade deficit with Japan was the largest of any
country, an imbalance of $4.55 billion. The deficit with Canada,
America's largest trading partner, was $1.14 billion.
   The Reagan administration was particularly embarrassed by the
sharp deterioration in the February deficit and the turmoil it
caused on financial markets.
   That was because the February trade report, issued on April 14,
came only a day after the United States and the six other biggest
industrial countries had reaffirmed their pledge to keep the value
of the dollar stable.
   The finance ministers, in Washington for the annual spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund, had to scramble to
make good on that pledge, conducting hurried meetings to plot a
rescue effort through joint intervention.
   Intervention is the process by which governments buy a currency
on the open market to support its value. While the intervention
succeeded, it cost the United States and its allies an estimated
$700 million in dollar purchases.
   The trade deficit has become closely linked to the value of the
dollar. A higher deficit convinces financial markets that the value
of the dollar will have to fall further to produce improvement by
making the value of exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
   ``Everybody has said that until the merchandise trade deficit
starts to shrink, the dollar will keep falling,'' said Cynthia
Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Ms. Latta said this conventional wisdom may be wrong, however.
She said she believes the dollar, which has been declining since
March 1985, has finally hit a level which will insure that the
trade deficit will begin to improve.
   Last year, the United States ran a merchandise trade deficit of
a record $171.2 billion. Some analysts believe that imbalance will
improve to around $150 billion this year.

<TEXT>
   Business leaders have called on the
government to renegotiate the repayment terms on the nation's $32
billion foreign debt to ease a liquidity crisis caused by low oil
prices.
   The proposal for ``more just treatment'' by the nation's
creditors was discussed in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.
   Hugo Fonseca Viso, president of the National Federation of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry , the nation's leading business
organization, met with President Jaime Lusinchi Monday to discuss
the proposal.
   ``It is necessary for the nation to propose that the weight on
Venezuela's economy and finances of the foreign debt be
reconsidered,'' Fonseca said following his meeting with Lusinchi,
the newspaper El Nacional reported Tuesday.
   ``We believe that (international banks) have not been just with
Venezuela, taking into consideration how it has fulfilled its
obligations. We ask not for privileged treatment but at least for
the same treatment given to other Latin American nations,'' Fonseca
said.
   Venezuela is the only major Latin debtor that has been paying
principal as well as interest on its foreign debt. Since 1982 it
has reduced its debt by around $3 billion without receiving new
loans to pay the old debts.
   In the first quarter Venezuela ran a balance of payments deficit
of $850 million as low oil prices yielded income too low to pay for
both $1.7 billion of imports and foreign debt service of $1.3
billion.
   The balance of payments deficit for all of 1987 was $1.2 billion.
   The government's response has been to squeeze imports further
and restrict liquidity in an effort to contain inflation.
   About $20 billion of public sector debt is included in a 14-year
refinancing agreement that requires the nation to pay $400 million
in principal this year. Private firms owe around $7 billion abroad.

Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and the United
Rubber Workers reached a tentative three-year contract settlement
today, averting a strike scheduled for noon, a union leader said.
   Union President Milan Stone said the agreement calls for an
immediate 25-cent hourly raise, which will be deducted from any
cost-of-living increases the workers would have received in July,
October and January 1989. The pact also allows for a wage reopener
in March 1990, depending on Goodyear's financial situation.
   Stone said Goodyear agreed to keep a provision that all union
locals are required to approve mid-contract wage concessions sought
at any single local.
   ``We're hopeful that it will be ratified,'' said Stone. ``I'm
sure they were looking for more. I'm convinced that there isn't any
more and they should ratify this.
   ``It's a good agreement, and we always would like to have more
on a contract settlement obviously, but I think we have to
recognize the problems that (financier Sir James) Goldsmith has put
upon this company and ultimately puts upon the workers in a company
that's had to undergo such a corporate takeover attempt.''
   Goodyear fended off a takeover attempt by Goldsmith in the fall
1986 by purchasing the 11 percent share he had acquired in the
Akron-based company.
   Goodyear spokesman Fred Haymond said the company would have no
immediate comment but would release a statement later today.
   On average, rubber workers make about $14 an hour.
   The union postponed its strike deadline until a week from today
while another ratification vote is taken.
   The URW represents 15,000 workers at 11 Goodyear locals covered
by a master contract.
   The two sides began meeting this morning at a downtown hotel.
   Meantime, about 4,700 Firestone workers began a third day on
strike today, with no talks planned.
   The union last went on strike against Goodyear in 1976 in an
industrywide walkout that lasted four months.
   ``Both parties traditionally have been willing to work up to the
last minute to avoid strikes that create hardships for employees
and affect the company's competitive position,'' Goodyear officials
said. ``We'll do our best to resolve our differences.''
   Six of the Goodyear locals had approved a tentative agreement,
although it was rejected nationally. URW President Milan Stone
supported the tentative agreement, designed to set an industry
pattern.
   The agreement contained no pay increase, instead concentrating
on job security improvements, cost-of-living allowances, and
pension and health insurance benefits.
   In Lincoln, Neb., union leaders decided that Goodyear workers
will stay on the job, according to Lee Domeier, URW Local 286 vice
president. The local's bargaining committee and executive board
unanimously approved the decision to keep working, he said.
   In Akron, members of URW Local 2, which previously approved the
contract by a 3-1 ratio, voted 722-691 in favor of striking today.
Bill Breslin, the local's president, had urged the local's members
to keep working despite the strike deadline. After the vote,
Breslin said he would resign his post.
   Besides Akron and Lincoln, the Goodyear locals facing the strike
deadline were in Marysville and St. Marys, Ohio; New Bedford,
Mass.; Sun Prairie, Wis.; Topeka, Kan.; Union City, Tenn.;
Danville, Va.; Madisonville, Ky., and Gadsden, Ala.
   The union struck Firestone on Sunday because the company failed
to accept the Goodyear pattern, Stone said. Firestone officials,
however, said their latest offer was equal to the pattern.
   The URW represents workers at Firestone plants in Noblesville,
Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville, Ark., and
Oklahoma City as well as maintenance workers and technicians in
Akron.
   One of the nation's Big Three tire makers, Uniroyal Goodrich
Tire Co., came to terms in mid-April in a contract taking into
account the company's special needs because of the recent Goodrich
and Uniroyal merger.

   The manufacturer of the Copper-7
intrauterine device displayed ``corporate irresponsibility'' by
withholding knowledge about the device's potential for causing
infertility, an attorney for a woman suing G.D. Searle & Co. said
today.
   ``It's a story of a company closing the door on the God-given
right of a woman to bear children,'' attorney Michael Ciresi told a
federal jury in his 1{-hour opening statement.
   Ciresi, one of a team of attorneys from the Minneapolis law firm
of Robins, Zelle, Larson & Kaplan, said he will introduce evidence
showing that Searle changed the string on its Copper-7 IUD,
stretching it, which weakened it horizontally.
   After the Copper-7 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in 1974, Searle sold between 300,000 and 400,000 of
the IUDs in the United States annually. It was taken off the U.S.
market in 1986.
   Searle has denied that its IUD caused any injury. Opening
arguments by attorney for Searle were to follow Ciresi's remarks
today.
   A jury of five women and three men, including two undesignated
alternates, was chosen Monday to hear the civil suit brought by
Esther R. Kociemba, 29, and her husband, William, of Elk River.
   The Kociembas are asking for an unspecified amount in
compensatory and punitive damages for injuries Mrs. Kociemba
allegedly suffered as a result of using a Copper-7 IUD for slightly
less than 1{ years in 1977 and 1978.
   According to the suit, Mrs. Kociemba has experienced
infertility, illnesses and ``great pain, suffering and mental
anguish'' that have continued since she had the IUD removed in
November 1978.
   During Ciresi's opening remarks today, Mrs. Kociemba often wiped
tears from her eyes.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Renner is presiding over the trial,
which is expected to last up to two months.
   Robins Zelle, which is representing more than 30 women in
separate Copper-7 lawsuits, also represented plaintiffs in earlier
litigation against Dalkon Shield maker A.H. Robins Co., settling
198 cases for a total of $38 million.
   Another Robins Zelle attorney, Roger P. Brosnahan, has said that
evidence includes testimony of Searle employees and former
employees and internal company documents. He said this is expected
to set a foundation for lawsuits to be tried later.
   ``In our judgment, it will be the first real trial involving the
Copper-7,'' Brosnahan said.
   Searle won 14 of the earlier cases, while one of the cases it
lost is on appeal.
   Kay Bruno, spokeswoman for Skokie, Ill.-based Searle, said the
company doesn't view the Kociemba suit as much different from
earlier ones. Many of the documents have been used in previous
court cases, she said.
   More than 800 lawsuits involving the IUD have been filed against
Searle, Bruno said. Of those, many have been settled out of court.
She said about 500 lawsuits are pending.
   Searle withdrew the Copper-7 and its other IUD, the TATUM-T,
from the U.S. market and stopped manufacturing the two items in
January 1986, citing the cost of litigation and the unavailability
of liability insurance. The birth control devices remain available
in foreign countries.
   Since removal of the Copper-7 from the U.S. market, only one
IUD, the Progestasert, has been available in this country, although
it is not widely marketed. But a new copper IUD has been approved
for sale and soon will be available.
   According to a 1982 survey, the most recent available, 7.3
percent of women using contraceptives chose the IUD. The study by
the National Center for Health Statistics showed the majority of
women using an IUD for birth control were over 25 years old and had
at least one child.

   A Sino-American joint venture established in
Beijing Tuesday aims to encourage trade between China and the
United States by serving as consultants and partners in joint
venture projects.
   ``The objectives of ACB International Ltd. are basically to
serve as a catalyst to promote trade between the United States and
China ... in both directions,'' ACB Chairman A. Robert Abboud said
at a news conference Tuesday.
   The American partners in the project are First City Bank of
Texas and the Hong Kong-based Alexander Y. Chow & Co. Ltd. Abboud
is chairman of First City Bank of Texas.
   The Chinese side of the 50-50 joint venture is made up of the
Bank of China and two affiliates of the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade, China United Trading Corp. Ltd. and
China Export Bases Development Corp.
   As consultants, the company will match U.S. businesses that want
to do business in China with Chinese partners. It also is prepared
to invest in joint ventures and enter the project as a partner, he
said.
   Company officials said ACB offers U.S. businesses support on the
Chinese side from the foreign trade ministry and experience from
its staff and from advisers who have been successful in business
ventures in China.
   ``Other companies say they can do the same thing, but they don't
have the experience or the resources,'' said ACB President
Alexander Y. Chow.

   Prices finished higher on London's Stock Exchange
Tuesday, helped by a narrower-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for
March.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up
12.6 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,789.2.
   Volume was a healthy 425.9 million shares, compared with
Monday's 311.7 million shares.
   The London equity market was boosted at midday by news that the
Bank of England had signaled a cut in the commercial banks' base
lending rate to 7.5 percent from 8 percent.
   But several traders said the market failed to capitalize on the
rate cut as players quickly turned their attention to the U.S.
trade report.
   The Commerce Department reported the March merchandise trade
deficit narrowed to $9.7 billion from February's $13.8 billion. The
markets had expected a deficit of $12 billion to $13 billion.
   The 100-stock index was up nearly 24 points immediately
afterward, but then proceeded to drift lower throughout the rest of
the day.
   A muted opening on Wall Street dampened enthusiasm in London,
dealers said.
   The Commerce Department said that a large increase in exports
reflected gains in manufactured goods shipments, especially
machinery, computers and aircraft as well as increased shipments of
gold.
   A dealer said that ``exports were a little disturbing due to the
rise in gold and aircraft which can't be sustained over many
months.''
   But London market players also were heartened by the apparent
end to a rift between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson over exchange rate policy.

   A big drop in the trade deficit failed to
generate much excitement today in the stock market, where a rally
quickly faded in another sign of post-crash investor apathy and
growing fear of inflation.
   ``The fact that it waned so quickly is disappointing to me,''
said Peter J. DaPuzzo, manager of retail equities at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The psychology is negative and low. One number
isn't going to change that.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose about
15 points at the opening on the trade news, retreated by 2 p.m. EDT
to 2,012.27, up 4.64. Among broader market barometers, the New York
Stock Exchange composite index of all listed issues fell 0.17 to
146.04. On the American Exchange, the market value index fell 0.54
to 297.42.
   Advancing and declining issues were nearly even on the NYSE,
with 714 up, 651 down and 538 unchanged. With two hours of trading
left, volume on the Big Board totaled 80.08 million shares,
considered extremely slow.
   The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit
shrank to $9.7 billion in March, a drop of more than $4 billion
over the previous monthly deficit, reflecting a 23 percent surge in
exports to a record $29.97 billion. Imports rose 3.6 percent to
$38.72 billion.
   The improvement was a major surprise, driving the dollar sharply
higher and initially boosting the bond market, a sensitive economic
barometer. But bond prices later retreated and the stock market
followed, a reflection of the pessimism that has pervaded the
securities industry since the Oct. 19 crash.
   ``I haven't seen this negative psychology for a long time,''
said Peter A. Karos, manager of equity and over-the-counter trading
for the Minneapolis investment firm Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.
``Investors are depressed. They're frustrated. They don't know
which way to react.''
   Some economists interpreted the trade figure as another sign of
a rapidly growing domestic economy, which translates into higher
inflation and rising interest rates.
   That theory was reinforced by another economic statistic
released this morning from the Federal Reserve, which showed
American industry operated at 82.7 percent of capacity in April,
the highest level in more than eight years.
   Texaco was among the most-active NYSE issues, up } to 49| on
volume exceeding 2 million shares. The oil giant was holding talks
with its largest shareholder, takeover strategist Carl Icahn.
   Among other actively traded blue-chips, IBM rose } to 112], AT&T
fell ] to 26~ and Bethlehem Steel rose \ to 19[.
   Cray Research dropped 3~ to 78. Some Wall Street analysts
reportedly cut their earnings estimates for the company.

   Shareholders of Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc.
voted Tuesday to change the company's name to Baxter International
Inc., effective Wednesday.
   The vote at the annual shareholders meeting was part of a
continuing campaign to project a more unified image of the company
and its products, Baxter said in a statement.
   ``The proposal to change the name of our company is much more
than cosmetic,'' Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman and chief
executive, told shareholders. ``It represents the very core of our
strategy.''
   Baxter acquired American Hospital Supply Corp. in 1985, and
Loucks said officials have worked over the past two years to
integrate the two companies.
   Baxter, based in the Chicago surburb of Deerfield, is a leading
international producer of health-care products, systems and
services. It had 1987 revenue of $6.2 billion.

<HEAD>J.C. Penney, Dayton Hudson, Carter Hawley Hale Earnings Reflect
Sluggish Consumer Spending</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: rewrites throughout with Dayton Hudson earnings.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., Dayton Hudson Corp. and Carter Hawley Hale
Stores Inc. reported Tuesday that sluggish consumer has taken a
toll on their earnings.
   Penney's income was up 141 percent from the first three months
of 1987, when the company took a $140 million charge for the cost
of relocating its headquarters to Dallas from New York.
   Penney reported it earned $131 million, or 96 cents per share,
in the quarter ended April 30, compared with $54 million, or 36
cents per share, in the first quarter of last year.
   However, Penney's income dipped slightly when compared with its
year-earlier earnings before the $140 million charge. Penney earned
$136 million in the first three months of 1987, which translates
into a 4 percent decline for the latest quarter.
   The retailer's sales declined to $3.17 billion from $3.22
billion.
   Penney and other retailers suffered from sluggish consumer
spending that has continued from 1987 into the first part of this
year. Apparel retailers, including Penney, have been especially
hard-hit.
   Penney also cited other factors for its lackluster performance,
including higher expenses for selling and administrative operations
and developmental costs from the company's video home shopping
venture and interactive television program.
   Meanwhile, Dayton Hudson said its first-quarter earnings tumbled
more than 19 percent, to $30.7 million, or 36 cents per share, from
$38.1 million, or 39 cents per share, in the first quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the quarter ended April 30 totaled $2.54 billion, up
from $2.15 billion a year ago.
   Dayton Hudson chairman Kenneth Macke said soft sales put
pressure on margins, the profits on merchandise, and contributed to
the decline. A drop in profits at the company's Mervyn's division,
which sells mostly apparel, also was a factor in the Dayton Hudson
decline.
   Carter Hawley Hale was another casualty of the sluggish retail
environment. The Los Angeles-based department store company
reported it suffered a $4.4 million loss in its third quarter.
   The retailer said the loss in the three months ended April 30
compared with earnings of $7.7 million, or 1 cent per share, in the
same period a year ago.
   Sales fel to $546.1 million from $563.7 million in the latest
quarter.
   The 1987 figures are restated to account for the sale of
Neiman-Marcus Group Inc. and other stores.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Carter Hawley Hale
earned $16.6 million, or 67 cents per share, compared with a loss
of $262,000 in the year-earlier period.
   Sales for the nine-month period totaled $2.02 billion, compared
with $2.27 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Broker Pleads Innocent In Hutton Money Laundering Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former E.F. Hutton & Co. Inc. broker
pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges stemming from a
money-laundering scheme at the brokerage firm's Providence office.
   Brian Lareau, of Jamestown, R.I., appeared in U.S. District
Court on charges of false representation of a Social Security
account number and money laundering, Justice Department attorney
John Voorhees said.
   On Monday, Hutton was fined $1.01 million after pleading guilty
to two money-laundering charges and one count of conspiracy in
connection with the scheme.
   Federal authorities charged that Lareau and another former
broker, since deceased, helped clients hide about $1.5 million in
cash from the Internal Revenue Service.
   Lareau, 46, worked for the Hutton branch from 1980 to 1985. He
is accused of laundering $183,950 from August 1982 to October 1984.
The federal felony charges carry maximum penalties of six years in
prison and $6,000 in fines.
   According to documents filed in federal court, Lareau allegedly
created two accounts for fictitious people and used them to conceal
customers' money from the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the IRS.
   Cash transactions greater than $10,000, which must be reported
to the IRS, were divided into smaller amounts and deposited into
the false accounts, according to the documents.
   Lareau was released on his personal recognizance. He is
scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle on
May 25, Voorhees said.
   Authorities said another former Hutton broker, Stephen S. Fusco,
who died two years ago of cancer, was also involved in the scheme.
Fusco was accused of helping members of organized crime turn
illegally earned money into legitimate income.
   Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, head of the Justice Department's New
England Organized Crime Strike Force said Lareau had no ties to
organized crime, and that he and Fusco _ who was known to associate
with organized crime figures _ apparently were not partners in
their alleged illegal activities.
   Hutton was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
and the company is now known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

   Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid conflicting forecasts
for Midwestern crop weather.
   Soybean futures, which led grain futures in a powerful rally
Monday, were held down by soybean oil, which experienced weak cash
markets and slack demand, analysts said.
   But weather-watchers dominated the trade, said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities in
New York.
   ``We had a two-sided affair because rain was being forecast by
some meteorologists'' in contrast to earlier predictions for hot,
dry weather until late in the week, Loewy said. ``But the bulk of
them are still looking hot and dry.''
   The Agriculture Department reported most winter wheat in good to
fair condition as of Sunday but cited a lack of moisture heading
into the crop's critical heading stage.
   The USDA said late Monday corn planting was 88 percent complete
as of Sunday, while soybean planting was about 40 percent finished.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.18 a bushel; corn was } cent to
2 cents higher with May at $2.08 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2
cents lower with May at $1.61 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower
to 2{ cents higher with May at $7.51 a bushel.

<HEAD>BP America Reports 13.6 Percent Increase In Operating Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased earnings in the refining and
marketing segment, along with gains in chemicals and minerals
helped boost BP America's first-quarter operating income 13.6
percent over the same period last year, the company announced
Tuesday.
   BP America, the U.S. affiliate of British Petroleum Co. PLC of
London, said it had first quarter operating profits of $576
million, compared to a $507 operating profit during the first
quarter of 1987.
   Net income for the quarter totaled $199 million. BP America
spokesman John Andes said the company did not have a comparable
figure for the first quarter of last year because BP America did
not exist at that time.
   BP America was formed last June through the merger of BP North
America and Standard Oil Co.
   The operating income from petroleum exploration and production
dropped 22.7 percent, to $326 million from $422 million, while
operating income from refining and marketing increased 30.7
percent, to $119 million from $91 million, Ross said.
   ``In these areas, stronger margins in downstream petroleum
operations and a 5 percent increase in oil and gas production
helped offset the effect of lower oil prices,'' said James H. Ross,
president and chief executive officer of BP America.
   Operating income in the chemicals segment jumped 230 percent,
from $10 million to $33 million. In the minerals segment, operating
income increased 240 percent, from $22 million to $121 million.

   An actress depressed over the loss
of her savings in last fall's stock market crash drowned herself
off the east coast of England, an inquest ruled Tuesday.
   Coroner Rebecca Cobb recorded a suicide verdict in the case of
Robin Ross, who used the stage name Wendy Ross and had appeared on
U.S. television shows including ``Dallas'' and ``Charlie's Angels.''
   Miss Ross' mother, Virginia, testified her 33-year-old daughter
had come back to Britain and changed completely after losing her
money. She reportedly lost 100,000 pounds, the equivalent of
$186,000.
   Mrs. Ross said her daughter, who lived in Canada at the time of
the October crash, kept telling her mother she felt poor.
   A doctor also testified that Miss Ross had visited him in
January and was ``extremely anxious and depressed.''
   On April 11, Miss Ross told her mother she was going on a
shopping errand, drove to a beach near Broadstairs, swam out to sea
and drowned.

   Burt Sugarman, the Hollywood
producer and investor seeking to buy Media General Corp., is
negotiating the sale of his cement and resource recovery companies.
   Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd. announced Monday it was discussing
the sale with Environmental Treatment & Technologies Co. of
Findlay, Ohio, for $110 million cash plus warrants to buy up to 1
million shares of Environmental Treatment stock at $15 a share.
   Sugarman last week boosted his offer for Media General to $70 a
share from $61.50 a share, which amounts to $1.78 billion for the
shares he doesn't already own in the Richmond, Va., newspaper and
broadcasting company.
   Sugarman has declined to comment on how he would finance the
offer, which has been spurned by Media General management.
   The Giant Group sale talks include Keystone Cement Co. in Bath,
Pa., and Giant Cement Co. in Harleyville, S.C., which together
produce more than 1.5 million a year and are powered by burning of
hazardous waste.
   Giant's other major investments include 24.4 percent of the
television game show company Barris Industries Inc. and 23 percent
of Rally's Inc., a fast food chain.
   Giant and Barris combined hold 10.1 percent of Media General.

   Warren H. Phillips, chairman and chief executive
officer of Dow Jones & Co. Inc., received the annual leadership
award of the Center for Communication on Tuesday, marking his
contributions to journalism over a career that has spanned four
decades.
   The award, presented at a luncheon at the Plaza Hotel,
recognizes individuals who exemplify courage, conscience and
leadership in the communications field.
   Past recipients are Katharine Graham, publisher of the
Washington Post; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and publisher of
the New York Times; William Paley, founder of CBS; and Allen H.
Neuharth, chairman of Gannett Co.
   The center noted in its award to Phillips that he played a
pivotal role in shaping the Wall Street Journal, which has
undergone major design and content changes in recent years. Under
Phillips, the Journal has won seven Pulitzer prizes, added a second
section and will soon add a third.
   The company also has added Asian and European daily editions and
10 new printing plants to regionalize its U.S. editions, the center
noted.
   Dow Jones meanwhile has used the Journal to become ``a leading
global supplier of computerized business and financial news and
information,'' the center's citation said.
   Phillips began his career at the Journal as a copyreader after
graduation from Queens College in 1947. During his 41 years at Dow
Jones, he has held a variety of posts in New York, Chicago and
Europe.
   ``He is to be commended for his part in making the global
village much more of a reality,'' said Thornton F. Bradshaw,
chairman of the center and former chief of RCA Corp.
   The Center for Communication is a non-profit organization
created in 1980 to help universities keep abreast of changes in the
media business. It holds workshops and seminars for students and
professors around the country free of charge.

   Stocks sagged today despite a sharply lower
trade deficit, and brokers called the reaction another bad sign of
an anemic post-crash market that shows little inclination to
recover soon.
   ``People just don't seem to care,'' said Robert Meyer, director
of research at the New York investment firm Fahnestock & Co.
   ``It's a bit similar to what you go through when you lose a
member of your family,'' he said. ``There's a mourning period
before you go out and face life again. I don't know how long this
mourning period is going to take.''
   After a short-lived rally on the trade news, selling pressure
intensified as investors grew concerned that the surprisingly small
trade deficit of $9.7 billion for March was an abberation.
   Others worried that a record surge in exports provided further
evidence of a rapidly growing economy and higher inflation, which
caused a big selloff in the bond market that spilled over into
stocks.

   May Department Stores Co. said Tuesday it will

department stores by June 15 because the chain is trailing
competitors in the market.
   Two months ago, May announced it was closing the chain's
downtown Cincinnati store.
   ``Ayres did not have a competitive position in the Cincinnati
market. McAlpin's, Lazarus and Sears are the leaders and we're, at
best, fourth in the area,'' said James Abrams, a May spokesman.
   Abrams said the company has received inquiries about the stores,
but he declined to say who might be a prospective buyer.
   The 14 Ayres stores in Indiana would not be affected by the
closings, Abrams said. The Ayres division is based in Indianapolis.

   Analysts said the market was sleepy, with no news having any

   Despite widespread expectations of stronger second-half demand,

<HEAD>Two Banks To Merge To Form Largest Spanish Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banco Central and Banco Espanol de Credito
announced a friendly merger Tuesday aimed at creating Spain's
largest bank by 1992, when the European Economic Community is to
remove all barriers to free capital movements within the 12-nation
bloc.
   The combined bank would have assets of more than 5.5 trillion
pesetas, or $50 billion. Banco Central is currently the nation's
second largest bank, and Banco Espanol de Credito is No.3.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has
been urging mergers among the so-called Big Seven Spanish private
banks to prepare them for stiff competition expected from larger
European institutions when the EEC capital movement barriers come
down in 1992.
   The merger will give the new entity control over 25 percent of
the Spanish banking sector, or total deposits amounting to more
than 2 billion pesetas, according to the latest statistics from the
Spanish Banking Commission.
   The merger is the second among the Big Seven banks. The first,
between Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya, was announced in
January.
   The unified Banco Bilbao-Vizcaya is currently Spain's largest
bank, with 4.3 trillion pesetas in total assets.
   The sole obstacle to the latest merger appeared to have been
cleared away with the announcement by the owners of Banco Central's
principal shareholder, the Cartera Central holding company, that
they would not oppose the action.

   Stock prices sagged Tuesday despite news of a
sharply lower trade deficit, and brokers called the reaction
another disturbing sign that the market's post-crash anemia won't
disappear soon.
   An early rally over the trade report collapsed, reflecting some
concern that it signaled a surging economy, hence higher inflation
and rising interest rates. Selling intensified late in the day,
though volume remained light.
   ``People just don't seem to care,'' said Robert Meyer, director
of research at the New York investment firm Fahnestock & Co.
   ``It's a bit similar to what you go through when you lose a
member of your family,'' he said. ``There's a mourning period
before you go out and face life again. I don't know how long this
mourning period is going to take.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 21.22 points to
1,986.41, erasing its 17.08-point gain Monday. Broader market
indices also fell substantially.
   The $9.7 billion March trade deficit reported by the Commerce
Department, down from a February imbalance of $13.8 billion, was so
unexpectedly low that some investors assumed the April number
released next month would be much higher. Brokers said customers
sold stock based on that assumption.
   Some said the explosive growth in exports contained in the March
number added to growing fear in the financial markets that higher
inflation is unavoidable. That fear caused a bond market selloff
that spilled into stocks.
   Many Wall Street professionals agreed that the reaction typified
the investor cynicism and anemia that has afflicted the market
since the October crash. They also recalled that when the high
February trade deficit was announced last month, it contributed to
a 101-point selloff in the Dow average.
   ``Psychology seems to be taking a bigger portion of investor
decision-making now,'' said Peter J. DaPuzzo, manager of retail
equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The psychology is so
apathetic, people look for any excuse not to buy. You're not going
to get them off the fence if they don't want to.''
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, declines
outnumbered advances by nearly 2-to-1, with 985 down, 521 up and
473 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled 133.85 million
shares, vs. 155.01 million Monday.
   Among the most-active NYSE issues, Texaco rose { to 49] on
reports of talks between the oil giant and takeover strategist Carl
Icahn, its largest shareholder, aimed at averting a fight for
director seats.
   Losing blue-chips included IBM, down 1{ to 110[; Philip Morris,
down 1} to 82{; Alcoa, down ~ to 44{; and AT&T, down } to 26{.
   Cray Research fell 5[ to 76} on word that some Wall Street
analysts had lowerered their earnings projections and investment
rating for the company.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 156.45 million shares.
   The NYSE index fell 1.56 to 144.65.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 3.85 to 296.71,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 3.32 to 255.39.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of
5,000 NYSE, American and OTC issues, fell by $24.59 billion.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.39
to 296.57. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 372.27, down 1.08.

   A record level of export sales gave the United
States its lowest monthly trade deficit in three years in March,
the government said Tuesday in a report that President Reagan
seized as rhetorical ammunition against the trade bill.
   The Commerce Department reported that the deficit shrank
dramatically in March to $9.7 billion, a drop of 29.5 percent from
the February imbalance of $13.8 billion _ statistics which sent the
dollar soaring on world money markets.
   The improvement came from a 23 percent surge in American
exports, which rose to an all-time high of $29 billion, as demand
for U.S. machinery, aircraft, computers and chemicals picked up
sharply. This offset a smaller rise in imports, which climbed 3.6
percent to $38.7 billion.
   A month ago, the unexpectedly bad February trade deficit sent
the dollar plunging in value and triggered a 101-point drop in the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, the fifth-worst loss on
record.
   The March report was good news for the dollar, which rose
sharply against other major currencies, but the stock market and
bond market were decidely less impressed.
   The Dow Jones average closed down 21.22 points and declining
issues outnumbered advances by a nearly 2-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Reagan, fielding reporters' questions during a brief appearance
Tuesday in the White House press room, said the latest report ``is
clear evidence that the trade balance is improving as our economy
continues to grow.''
   Reagan said his veto message to Congress on the 1,000-page bill
``is currently under review'' and he expects to issue it ``within a
couple of days.''
   ``But today's news emphasizes what we have been saying all
along, that this is not the time to be imposing restrictions on
trade or reducing incentives for free open markets or closing job
opportunities,'' the president said. ``We want more jobs, not
less.''
   ``I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work with the
Congress once again in crafting a trade bill that will continue
this trend of more job creation and greater economic growth,''
Reagan said.
   Analysts said some investors are worried that the export boom
will spark another round of inflation in the United States as
factories, many already operating at peak capacity, begin to raise
prices.
   Indeed, the Federal Reserve Board said in another economic
report Tuesday that American industry operated at an eight-year
high of 82.7 percent of capacity in April, a 0.3 percentage point
rise from March.
   The high operating rate was solid evidence of the boom in export
sales, economists said, but they cautioned that the country is
approaching a danger zone when tight labor markets begin pushing
prices higher. Unemployment fell to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent
last month.
   ``You would have to read the trade number as evidence supporting
the view that wages and prices will be firming up and there will be
further inflationary pressures later this year,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Some analysts said the dramatic improvement in the trade deficit
made it all but certain that Congress would not be able to come up
with the two-thirds majorities in each house to override the veto.
   ``I think trade is now a dead issue politically,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. He said the new report
showed that the administration's strategy of driving the dollar
lower back in 1985 had proven successful, although it had taken
much longer than expected.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the one-month trade
improvement in March did not diminish the need for the trade bill
on the president's desk.
   ``With all these monthly fluctuation, the trade deficit is five
times as high as it was when President Reagan came into office and
this is intolerable,'' he said.
   ``There were times last year too when the monthly trade deficit
fell and the administration was quick to trumpet this as evidence
that the trade problem had gone away,'' Wright added.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said the report showed that
a ``decisive improvement in the trade balance is now under way.''
He noted that the deficit for the first three months of the year
was 20 percent below the high-point for the deficit from July
through September 1987.
   For the first quarter of 1988, the trade deficit totaled $36
billion, which would translate into an annual shortfall of $144
billion. Last year, the merchandise trade deficit hit a record
$171.2 billion. That figure is expected to decline by about $20
billion this year.
   ``Export growth is going to remain quite strong and will be the
major influence on the economy in 1988,'' said Jeanette Garetty,
senior economist at the Bank of America. She predicted U.S. exports
would rise by 14 percent this year.
   In March, exports rose by $5.4 billion over the February level.
Sales of American-manufactured products soared by 23.3 percent,
reflecting strong demand for machinery, computers, aircraft and
telecommunications equipment.
   Farm sales were up as well, climbing 5.5 percent to $3.3 billion
in March.
   In addition, $600 million of the export increase reflected sales
of gold bullion to Taiwan, which has come under heavy pressure to
reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.
   The $1.3 billion rise in imports to $38.72 billion reflected a
small 0.8 percent increase in imports of manufactured goods,
including passenger cars, which rose 2.8 percent to $3.98 billion.
   This gain was offset by a 15.2 percent drop in oil imports. They
fell to a daily rate of 6.7 million barrels at a price of $15.70
per barrel, down from imports of 8 million barrels in February at a
price of $16.42 per barrel.
   As usual, the trade deficit with Japan was the largest of any
country, an imbalance of $4.55 billion, up 0.3 percent from
February. But the deficits with other countries declined in March.
   The trade deficit with Canada, America's largest trading
partner, was $1.14 billion in March, down 21.7 percent from
February. The deficit with Western Europe fell to $911 million,
down a sharp 42 percent.

<HEAD>Reynolds & Reynolds Cuts 10 Percent Of Computer Division Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reynolds & Reynolds Co. says it will cut
about 10 percent of its computer division work force and refocus
the marketing of its main computer products.
   The company announced the elimination of 250 jobs on Monday,
spokesman Paul Guthrie said. The computer division employs about
2,200 nationwide.
   Another 60 jobs will depart with the leveraged buyout of
Reynolds' money-losing catalog sales operation for computer
accessories and forms, Guthrie said. He declined to disclose the
terms of the buyout.
   The Dayton-based computer and business forms maker, a Fortune
500 company, said it wanted to concentrate on marketing and service
of its industry-leading automotive dealer computer systems.
   Orders for its auto dealer systems slowed late last year, but
rebounded in January, Reynolds President David R. Holmes said.
   The cuts announced Monday stem not only from poor financial
performance, but also from the maturing of several development
projects, the company indicated.
   Much of the computer work at auto dealers now is done on
free-standing computers, not on-line or in batch processing, Holmes
said.
   ``We've invested a large amount of resources in that product
change and we've developed that product now, so we're able to do
some realigning in that regard,'' he said.
   An interactive video customer-assistance system for Chrysler
Corp. and a management system for large dealerships are among other
projects nearing completion, Holmes said.
   Computer division earnings also were hurt by losses in the
company's tax-processing business, the result of expenses to meet
new changes in the tax code.
   Computer systems division sales for the six months ended March
31 were up 13.7 percent to $119 million from the same period in
1987, but profits dropped 13 percent to $40 million.
   Net income for the entire company increased about 30 percent to
$12 million, largely because of reduced taxes and a tax accounting
change, on sales of $289.9 million.
   In its last fiscal year, Reynolds & Reynolds posted a profit of
$21.2 million on sales of $562.7 million.

<HEAD>IBM Demands Retroactive License Fees From PC Clone Makers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is putting
the squeeze on makers of personal computer clones that have not
paid for patent licenses.
   Some companies could be forced to pay substantial retroactive
royalty payments on their IBM-compatible personal computers.
   ``To be consistent, we are not going to enter into new patent
licensing agreements with companies that refuse to recognize their
liability to IBM for the use of IBM patents in their existing
products,'' spokesman Michael Starks said Tuesday.
   IBM said it will require companies to settle up their past
royalties before they are allowed to license the patents required
to make computers compatible with its new Personal System-2 line.
   IBM could also pursue companies for retroactive payments even if
they do not want to produce Personal System-2 clones, Starks said.
   ``It appears that they are being a little overbearing,'' said
Michael Shane, chairman of Leading Edge Hardware Products Inc. of
Canton, Mass., which imports Korean-made personal computers.
   ``This latest move certainly can't help the American consumer,''
Shane said. He predicted it would increase prices and increase
confusion.
   Shane said Leading Edge has no interest in building a Personal
System-2 compatible computer. In that case it would probably not be
one of IBM's first targets for royalty payments.
   Unaffected would be companies such as Tandy Corp. and Compaq
Computer Corp. that have cross-licensing agreements with IBM. Under
those agreements, the companies allow each other to use certain of
their patents without charge.
   Starks said the company would accept payments totaling 1 percent
of sales on computers sold through this past April 1, assuming the
companies settle up with IBM by the end of 1988. After that, the
fee could rise.
   IBM stated recently that license fees related to its new PS-2
line could range as high as 5 percent of sales. IBM says that
license fees on clones of its old line of PCs could also range as
high as 5 percent of sales for computers sold after this past April
1.
   IBM's failure to demand license fees until now could give
competitors some legal grounds to argue that it is too late for IBM
to start now. Starks declined to comment on that possibility, but
said, ``Depending on the circumstances, we may be in a position to
ask for payments.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News of a sharply improved U.S. trade
performance in March drove the dollar higher against most major
currencies Tuesday, but traders said the report failed to reverse
the dollar's downward trend.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid price for gold bullion of $453.75 a troy ounce at
4 p.m. EDT, down from $455 late Monday.
   The Commerce Department reported the trade deficit shrank more
than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion, the lowest monthly
shortfall since March 1985. U.S. producers sold a record amount of
goods overseas in March, slicing by 29.5 percent the February
deficit of $13.83 billion.
   Most foreign exchange dealers expected a March shortfall of
around $12.5 billion.
   ``The initial reaction was quite a bit of surprise,'' said Ron
Sapiro, head currency trader at Continental Illinois National Bank
& Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Market players swooped to buy dollars in an initial frenetic
wave after the trade report was released, but activity soon settled
down to a normal pace, dealers said.
   The narrowing of the trade deficit was good news for the dollar,
since the currency's long-term decline has apparently paid off by
making U.S. exports more attractive, and monetary authorities
likely will not seek to lower its value further.
   However, trader emphasized that the overall trend for the dollar
remains lower.
   ``I don't see a complete turnaround in the dollar's fortunes, by
any means,'' said Fred Barth, the chief foreign-exchange trader for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.82 yen, up from 124.73 yen
late Monday. Later in London, after the release of the trade
figures, it was quoted at 125.70 yen. At the end of the trading day
in New York, the dollar settled at around 125.75 yen, up from
124.92 yen late Monday.
   In London, it cost $1.8630 to buy one pound, far cheaper than
$1.8915 late Monday. The pound fell in New York to $1.8603 from
$1.8890 late Monday.
   The pound was hit by a half-percentage point cut Tuesday in
Britain's leading interest rate.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.7065 West German marks, up from 1.6862; 1.4233
Swiss francs, up from 1.4049; 5.7795 French francs, up from 5.7275;
1,267.00 Italian lire, up from 1,255.50; and 1.2370 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2337.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7045 West German marks, up from 1.6860; 1.4190
Swiss francs, up from 1.4013; 5.7710 French francs, up from 5.7170;
1.9060 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8890; 1,264.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,253.45; 1.2358 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2322.
   Gold bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $453.50 a
troy ounce, compared with late Monday's bid of $455.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, gold was higher, closing at a bid $455
compared with $454 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 57 cents to close at a bid
$454.67.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose to $455.50 a troy ounce from $454.90 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market, where the metal
traded at a late bid price of $6.59 a troy ounce, compared with
Monday's $6.70.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell to $6.540
a troy ounce from $6.583 late Monday.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge; Market Remains Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rose sharply Tuesday, indicating strong
demand despite indications that supplies will be rising soon.
   On other markets, precious metals futures were mixed; orange
juice futures plunged; grains and soybeans, livestock and meat, and
energy futures all were mixed; and stock-index futures fell.
   After reaching an all-time high of $1.46 as pound at the end of
1987, copper futures have traded in a range from about 85 cents a
pound to about $1.05 a pound.
   Copper for May delivery settled 2.7 cents higher Tuesday at
$1.03 a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   ``Every time the market dips, the trade buys it,'' said John
O'Connell, metals analyst in New York with Refco Inc.
   Copper's steep increase last year stemmed from a shortage.
Although the market remains fairly tight, an increase in readily
available supplies now allows for more price elasticity, analysts
said.
   Richard Levine, vice president of precious metals and foreign
exchange at Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said he expected
copper prices to continue hovering within the current range.
   ``Copper above $1 is just too high given the amount of
production capability and below 85 cents is too low to warrant the
production to come out,'' he said. ``But anywhere in the 90 cents
to $1 range is safe territory. It's a reasonable price to pay if
you're a buyer and a reasonable price to receive if you're a
seller.''
   Also on the Commodity Exchange, gold futures finished slightly
higher while silver futures posted modest losses.
   Gold initially fell in reaction to a government report showing a
dramatic narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit, then recovered on
ideas that an increase in manufacturing activity would ultimately
prove inflationary, Levine said.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 60 cents higher with June at $456.40 a
troy ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.5 cents lower with May at $6.54
a troy ounce.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures plunged on the New York
Cotton Exchange on selling inspired by the upcoming expiration of
the May contract, analysts said.
   Reports of an 8 percent wholesale price cut by Florida processor
Winter Garden Citrus Products fueled further selling, said Sandra
Kaul, an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Orange juice futures have climbed from about $1.30 a pound last
fall to around $1.70 a pound. But a recent decline in wholesale
sales of orange juice indicates falling demand due to high prices,
analysts said.
   Orange juice settled 2 cents to 6.5 cents lower with May at
$1.6715 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid conflicting forecasts for Midwestern crop weather.
   Soybean futures, which led a powerful rally Monday, were
restrained by soybean oil, which faced weak cash markets and slack
demand, analysts said.
   But weather-watchers dominated the trade, said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``We had a two-sided affair because rain was being forecast by
some meteorologists'' in contrast to earlier predictions for hot,
dry weather until late in the week, Loewy said. ``But the bulk of
them are still looking hot and dry.''
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower with May at $3.18 a
bushel; corn was } cent to 2 cents higher with May at $2.08 a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $1.61 a
bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 4 cents higher with May at
$7.50{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in a surprisingly weak performance following a
bullish cattle-on-feed report Monday from the USDA.
   The report showed larger-than-expected marketings in April, and
analysts had expected a strong rally in the cattle futures market.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June
at 73.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .85
cent higher with May at 80.85 cents a pound; hogs were .52 cent
lower to .17 cent higher with June at 53.10 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .32 cent lower to .23 cent higher with May at
53.80 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices were mixed in lackluster trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 9
cents higher with June at $17.75 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent
lower to .17 cent higher with June at 47.78 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .09 cent lower to .06 cent higher with June
at 52.74 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 4.45 points lower at 255.10.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Expect Continued Economic Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's purchasing managers have grown more
optimistic in the past six months that the economy will continue to
grow this year, but they also expect higher inflation, a new report
said Tuesday.
   In their latest semiannual forecast, 73 percent of the
purchasing managers predicted the economy would be better in 1988
than it was in 1987, compared with 57 percent in their December
report.
   They said price increases averaged about 3.8 percent since the
end of 1987 and forecast a sharp net average increase of about 5.8
percent for the year, the report said. In the December report, the
purchasing managers forecast a price rise of 3.6 percent for all of
1988.
   The latest survey was released by the National Association of
Purchasing Management, an education and research organization with
nearly 30,000 members.
   ``The number of purchasing managers expressing optimism about
the next 12 months is the highest since May 1984,'' said Robert J.
Bretz, chairman of the group's business survey committee and
director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   ``This reflects their expectations for increased capital
expenditures and sharply higher exports despite
higher-than-expected prices,'' he said.
   Some 53 percent of members forecast their capital expenditures
would be higher in 1988 than last year, compared with 42 percent
making the same forecast in December.
   Eighty-two percent of the purchasers also predicted higher
prices over the last half of 1988, up from 76 percent in December,
while 90 percent said they were paying higher prices at the end of
April than at year-end 1987.
   Among exporting companies, 53 percent said their export business
rose moderately over the first half of this year, while 12 percent
reported substantial increases.
   Fifty-two percent forecast moderate increases in exports for the
second half of this year, the same as in December.

<HEAD>Bank Says It Thwarts $70 Million Computerized Embezzlement Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First National Bank of Chicago announced Tuesday
it had thwarted an employee's attempt to embezzle $70 million
through a computerized wire transfer scheme.
   The nation's 10th-largest bank would release no details, and
stated only that the FBI had taken charge of the investigation and
that neither the bank nor its customers expected to suffer any
losses.
   ``It was really the efficiency and the soundness of our controls
that allowed us to thwart this embezzlement,'' said bank spokesman
Tony Zehnder.
   He said the employee had been identified, but could not say
whether the person had been charged.
   FBI spokesman Jim Kuntzelman refused comment on the case.
   A bank source, who refused to be identified, told the Associated
Press the embezzlement was attempted through wire transfers, or the
computerized movement of money from one account to another.
   The source said three customer accounts, including the
investment firm Merrill Lynch & Co., were affected, but the
embezzlement attempt was discovered before any of the accounts
actually lost money.
   Merrill Lynch reportedly discovered a discrepancy in its account
Monday and alerted the bank to the problem. No one answered the
phone at Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters Tuesday night.
   Zehnder said he could not say whether it was the largest
attempted embezzlement ever at the bank.
   First National Bank, a unit of First Chicago Corp., ranked as
the nation's 10th-largest bank with $27.2 billion in deposits at
year-end 1987.

   Bell & Howell Co. shareholders on Tuesday
approved a $702 million buyout led by Texas financier Robert M.
Bass and members of Bell & Howell's management.
   Shareholder approval cleared the way for completion of the
buyout of the Skokie-based information-services company by Robert
M. Bass Group Inc., Acadia Partners L.P. of Fort Worth, Texas, and
certain Bell & Howell executives including Gerald E. Schultz,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The group will pay each stockholder $64 per share for their
common and preferred stock, Bell & Howell said in a statement.
   Financing arrangements for the deal were consummated shortly
after the shareholder approval, the company said.
   Financing includes $200 in senior subordinated debt, of which
Acadia Partners is buying $30 million; $344 million in bank
financing; $100 million equity participation in the form of cash
and Bell & Howell stock; and $58 million of Bell & Howell's cash on
hand.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Upholds Friday Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. District Court judge on Tuesday ruled
that Allegheny International Inc. could hold its annual meeting
Friday as originally planned, renewing a proxy fight for control of
the troubled company.
   Allegheny said the judge stayed a preliminary injunction issued
Monday by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, which barred the meeting from
taking place for 90 days.
   As a result of the new ruling the meeting is scheduled for
Friday, pending a further hearing on the case in U.S. District
Court.
   Tuesday's federal court ruling will be in place until the judge
conducts another hearing Wednesday on the bankruptcy court's
preliminary injunction.
   The ruling means the proxy contest between a group of dissident
shareholders and the company is again under way.
   The struggle to wrest control of Allegheny International _ which
is reorganizing under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from
creditors _ is led by Spear Leeds & Kellogg, a New York investment
banker that has invested about $30 million in the company's
preferred stock.
   The bankruptcy court had issued its injunction at the request of
Allegheny's unsecured creditors committee. The court ruled the
Pittsburgh-based company could call its annual meeting after it had
submitted its Chapter 11 reorganization plan to shareholders and
creditors, but before they had voted on it.
   Speer Leeds asked U.S. District Judge Alan Bloch to overturn the
bankruptcy court ruling and reinstate the proxy fight.
   Pittsburgh-based Allegheny International manufactures consumer
products, including Sunbeam and Oster appliances.
