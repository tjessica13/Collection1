<HEAD>Honduras Rejects Nicaraguan Demand For Border Inspection</HEAD>

   Honduras on Wednesday rejected a
Nicaraguan demand that it allow inspection of its border region by
an international team for U.S.-supported rebel bases, a foreign
ministry spokesman said.
   Spokesman Eugenio Castro told The Associated Press in an
interview that Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto, made
the request at a seven-hour meeting that also included the foreign
ministers from Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and El Salvador.
   The request, in the form of a draft treaty, called for
inspection of Honduras' border region with Nicaragua by an
international team made up of Canadian and East German observers,
Castro said.
   The foreign ministers met privately first at a hotel and later
at the Foreign Ministry to discuss progress of a regional peace
plan signed in August last year.
   The five countries' presidents signed the peace plan to
negotiate an end to the U.S.-supported insurgency against
Nicaragua's Sandinista regime and leftist guerrilla wars in
U.S.-backed El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Officials at the meeting Wednesday said they would issue a joint
communique when they ended their discussions. But the meeting broke
up suddenly and no communique was issued when Honduras rejected the
Nicaraguan demand.
   Hondura's foreign minister, Carlos Lopez Contreras, demanded at
the meeting that Nicaragua withdraw complaints filed against
Honduras and Costa Rica at the World Court in The Hague, Holland,
claiming the two countries harbored anti-Nicaraguan rebels, Castro
said.
   Castro said D'Escoto rejected the Honduran demand.
   Honduras claims it has none of the rebels, known as Contras,
inside its territory and the Contras claim they operate inside
Nicaragua. But there have been numerous reports the rebels have
maintained supply and staging camps along the southern border since
they started fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista regime in
1982.
   A lesser number of such camps were also reported at one time
along Costa Rica's northeastern border with Nicaragua, but the
reports ceased since one rebel group stopped operating in the area
three years ago.
   The regional peace plan calls for cease-fires, reconciliation
talks between governments and opposition groups, an end to military
aid to insurgents in the region, and reforms to bring greater
democracy to Central America.
   So far, a tenuous cease-fire has been in force since March 23 in
Nicaragua. The conflicts continue in Guatemala and El Salvador.

   A Soviet aviation official in Montreal defected
after giving information on security breaches by 17 Soviets
diplomats and officials who have been expelled or barred from
Canada, the foreign minister said Wednesday.
   The Soviet government retaliated Wednesday for Canada's action
by kicking out two Canadian diplomats and telling three others they
are not welcome.
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported late Wednesday that
some of the Soviets who were expelled had attempted to infiltrate
Paramax Electronics, a U.S.-owned military contractor in Montreal
that has access to highly classified U.S. naval technology.
   The CBC reported on its late-night television program, The
Journal, that Paramax had access to highly classified radar, sonar
and and communications systems.
   The New York Times said in its Thursday edition that the
technology to which Paramax has access included computer-driven
equipment that controls shipboard weapons systems.
   Paramax, a subsidiary of the Detroit-based Unisys Corporation,
has a $1 billion contract with the Canadian government as the
primary subcontractor on a fleet of six newpatrol frigates for the
Canadian navy, the Times reported. Unisys is one of the largest
military contractors in the United States.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark told Parliament that eight
Soviet diplomats were expelled last week and another nine diplomats
and officials who recently left the country have been told they
should not return.
   Clark said there was not one conspiracy but several operations
that formed the object of ``parallel but distinct investigations.''
   He said the Soviets' transgressions included an attempt to
penetrate the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and its
predecessor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service.
   ``We are confident that Canadian security was not compromised,''
Clark said.
   He said the Soviet diplomats also tried to gain access to
classified information and technology with commercial and military
applications.
   Clark said a Soviet official at the International Civil Aviation
Organization headquarters in Montreal, identified as Yuri Smurov,
has defected and asked to remain in Canada with his wife and
daughter after supplying ``useful information'' to Canadian
security. Clark did not elaborate.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said earlier
in Moscow the Canadian action was ``entirely groundless.''
   ``Here we have an apparent provocation planned in advance that
has nothing to do with the activity of Soviet citizens in Canada,''
Gerasimov said. ``The provocation of the Canadian authorities will
naturally not remain without due reply.''
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Bessmertynkh informed Canadian Ambassador Vernon
Turner of the explusion order against the Canadians.
   In a note to Turner, Bessmertynkh called the Canadian
government's move ``a rude antagonistic act.'' The note accused
Canada of trying to spoil relations with the Kremlin at a time when
East-West ties were improving.
   However, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Wednesday:
``There's just no question about what the Soviets were doing here.''
   Clark did not say how long the various diplomats had been under
surveillance or why the government decided to act against them last
week.
   Seven Soviets left Canada last Friday, 48 hours after they were
ordered out. They included a consular official in Ottawa, three
diplomats from the Soviet consulate in Montreal, a trade
representative in Montreal and two officials from the Soviet
delegation to the International Civil Aviation Organization.
   An eighth diplomat, Capt. Boris Tatarintsev, assistant naval
attache at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa, was on the expulsion list
but was outside Canada last week. He will not be allowed to return.
   The nine Soviets who worked in Canada previously and are now
persona non grata include two former Soviet Embassy diplomats in
Ottawa, a journalist based in Ottawa, three members of the Soviet
consulate in Montreal, two civil aviation officials in Montreal and
a former manager of the Aeroflot office there.
   The Canadian Press news agency, quoting unidentified sources in
Ottawa, said the Soviet diplomats were believed to have links to
both the KGB, the Soviet secret police, and the GRU, the Soviet
military intelligence agency.
   Viacheslav Bogdanov, second secretary at the Soviet Embassy,
said there would be no comment on the affair.
   The Tass dispatch said two Canadian diplomats in Moscow _
Raymond Steele, a naval attache, and Evelyn Puxley, a second
secretary _ had three days to leave the Soviet Union. They were
accused of ``engaging in activity which is absolutely
unacceptable'' and which did not correspond to their official
status _ diplomatic language for spying.
   Three Canadians who worked previously at the embassy were
declared persona non grata and forbidden from returning to the
Soviet Union. They were identified as Ann Leahy, a first secretary;
John DiGangi, a second secretary; and Kenneth Moody, an air attache.
   Mulroney disclosed the action against the Soviets on Tuesday at
a news conference concluding the seven-nation economic summit. He
accused the diplomats of ``improper and unacceptable behavior.''
   More than 40 diplomats from the Soviet Union and East European
countries have been ordered out of Canada for alleged espionage
activities since 1945.
   The last expulsion of Western diplomats from the Soviet Union
was in April 1987, when the Kremlin ordered out four French
diplomats and two French businessmen. That move was in retaliation
for the earlier expulsion by France of three Soviet diplomats
accused of spying.

   Patients at a Rome hospital set up barricades and
scuffled with leukemia victims they were trying to prevent from
being transferred to their ward, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported.
   About 70 patients recovering from eye operations at San Giovanni
Hospital threw up a barricade of tables and chairs on Tuesday to
block entrance to their ward, the agency said.
   When the 24 leukemia patients arrived, members of the two groups
began pushing and shoving, it said.
   Police put an end to the scuffle and allowed the leukemia
patients to move into the rooms, ANSA said. They had been
transferred temporarily from another part of the hospital, which
was being renovated.
   ANSA said the hospital refused comment on the incident. Calls to
the hospital were not answered Tuesday evening.
   Leukemia is a cancerous disorder of the blood-forming tissues
characterized by excessive production of lymphocytes, or white
cells.

<HEAD>Tens Of Thousands of Romanians Fled To Hungary In Past Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOENIGSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40,000 Romanians have
fled to neighboring Hungary in the past year because of
``Stalinist-like'' conditions in their homeland, a Roman Catholic
church group says.
   In a telexed statement, the West German-based organization
Church for Needy called the exodus the ``first such case of people
fleeing from one communist state to another'' to better their lot.
   The group said in the statement received Tuesday that most of
the people fleeing are of Hungarian extraction from the
economically hard-hit Siebenbuergen region in northwestern Romania.
   ``Romania, once one of Europe's most prosperous countries, has
become a Stalinist-like state that is robbing its minorities of
property, religion and culture, and permits them to starve and
freeze,'' the statement said.
   It said Church for Needy had made available $50,000 for priests
in Hungary to help resettle between 40,000 and 50,000 Romanians who
have fled from their homeland since 1987.
   Romania's economy has been hard-hit in recent years, with
spiraling food prices and rationing of bread and electricity.
   Observers have blamed President Nicolae Ceausescu's
crash-industrialization program, saying the country's agriculture
is being neglected.
   About 10,000 workers in Brasov, Romania's second largest city,
took to the streets in November to protest wage-cuts and consumer
products shortages. It was the biggest such political rally in the
country since the communists took power in 1947.
   Church for Needy is based in this city about 20 miles north of
Frankfurt.

<HEAD>Guarding the Rich Legacy of Fred Astaire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During their seven-year marriage, Fred
Astaire often told his wife, Robyn: ``People have taken advantage
of me all my life. Try to see that it doesn't happen after I'm
gone.''
   That has been Mrs. Astaire's consuming mission since the dancing
actor's death a year ago.
   ``I didn't realize how difficult it would be,'' she said.
``Everyone wants a piece of Fred now.''
   She cited a Hollywood Boulevard operator who has been selling
life-size cutouts of Astaire to be used in stores and amusement
parks. Companies have tried to merchandise Fred Astaire lines of
tuxedos, jewelry and cologne. Robyn Astaire has hired a lawyer to
try to police such ventures, and she is supported by new laws
protecting the names and images of deceased celebrities.
   Mrs. Astaire is also disturbed by the use of her husband's name
and works by companies or individuals who don't consult her, such
as the sale by MCA to the Disney Channel of the Astaire TV
specials, the only films that he owned. He made his classic
musicals while under contract to studios.
   She doesn't rule out licensing of products that met the Astaire
standards of class.
   ``Fred wanted me to do that,'' she said. ``He was so afraid that
he wouldn't be able to provide for me after he was gone. You see,
when he turned 78, he decided it was time to put his affairs in
order. He never expected to marry again, so he gave most of his
wealth to his family, keeping only what he needed to live on.''
   Then he met Robyn Smith, a lithe, young jockey who had broken
the sex barrier in thoroughbred racing. They were married June 24,
1980, when he was 81 and she was 35. The marriage astonished
Hollywood and appalled Fred's sister, Adele, and daughter, Ava. But
it endured.
   Mrs. Astaire recently talked about her life with Fred at the
hilltop home she shared with him. It is unchanged, as is she; daily
running keeps her 5-foot-7 frame at 106 pounds.
   ``By the time we were married, Fred had done everything in his
life _ more than once,'' she related. ``He was in a mood to relax
and take it easy. That was fine with me. He was such an exciting
person to be around that we didn't have to do a lot. We just always
had a lot of fun _ I know that.
   ``I was happy with my life before that. As with any athlete,
when you get into your 30s, you are forced to retire. Everyone
thinks you're over the hill when you turn 25.
   ``Besides, Fred wanted me to get out of the (racing) business
because it was very dangerous. I was ready to quit anyway. But I
made Fred sell his horses because I wasn't about to let him run
them if I couldn't ride.''
   Fred and Robyn Astaire played some golf together and attended
the latest movies, ``always at 12 o'clock at a neighborhood theater
so he wouldn't be recognized.'' She even had him watch his own
movies at home.
   ``I had never seen a Fred Astaire picture that I can remember,''
she admitted. ``I just wasn't interested in musicals when I was
young. I never realized what I had missed.
   ``Fred never liked watching himself in movies. But I wanted to
see them, and they absolutely blew my mind. At my insistence, he
started watching them with me. He was so cute. When I said, `Oh,
darling, it's so spectacular,' he'd say, `Oh, was it really good?'
Toward the end of his life he enjoyed watching the films, which he
had never allowed himself to do.''
   ``I Won't Dance'' goes the old Astaire tune, and he wouldn't do
so after his last TV show at 70. But on their rare appearances at
Hollywood events, Fred danced with Robyn. And nightly after dinner,
they exited the dining room in a comic tango that convulsed the
servants.
   Astaire was in perfect health until the last six months of his
life, she said. He started losing weight, and that alarmed her. His
doctors could find nothing wrong, but Robyn feared that he might
develop pneumonia, the killer of the aged.
   ``I thought Fred would live into his 90s,'' she said. ``His
mother had died at 96, and he was just like his mother. All of a
sudden when he reached 86 he started to get weaker and weaker. He
wasn't ill; his batteries were draining.''
   Last June, he developed pneumonia. She drove him to Century City
Hospital late at night to avoid public notice, and entered him
under his mother's maiden name. His presence there was kept secret
until his death on June 22.
   For the past year, Mrs. Astaire has devoted herself to
preserving her husband's rich legacy, but she realizes she will
need to start a life of her own. Next month she is enrolling in an
intensive course at the University of California at Los Angeles to
determine what kind of a career she should pursue.
   She grinned: ``I just hope the results don't show that the only
thing I'm qualified for is to be a jockey.''

<HEAD>Group To Open Runaway Shelter in Small City with Big Problem</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David was sleeping on the streets and
working as a prostitute; the 16-year-old's parents had left him
behind when they moved from Alaska.
   Geanne, also 16, got pregnant and ran away from her Athabascan
Indian village. In Anchorage, she turned to prostitution and was
often beaten by her pimp. She died of a drug overdose.
   There are others, enough to give this city of 230,000 residents
one of the nation's highest per-capita rates of runaway and
homeless youths. At least 1,200 teen-agers are reported as runaways
each year in Anchorage, more than three times the number for
comparable cities, a 1986 municipal study found.
   ``We are not a large city, yet we have a very large problem,''
said Marj Hall, director of the Alaska Juvenile Crime Commission,
where David's and Geanne's cases are on file. Confidentiality
restrictions prevented use of their last names.
   The statistics, and the troubled young faces behind them,
grabbed the attention of Covenant House, a nonprofit group that
until now focused on running shelters in larger cities such as New
York and Houston.
   This summer in Anchorage, Covenant House is turning a beat-up
old YMCA building into a 40-bed shelter where runaways can sort out
their lives and perhaps avoid the dead-end world of life on the
street.
   Covenant House's arrival is lauded by local social workers
frustrated by a lack of long-term care for runaways. But some warn
the shelter, expected to open in October, is no panacea.
   They say Anchorage's runaways are part of a greater malaise
arising from Alaska's frontier demographics _ a young, transient
population isolated from stabilizing family and community ties in
the lower 48 states.
   ``Kids don't have the extended family network here,'' Hall said.
``If they get into trouble, they can't go to Uncle Charlie who
they've known since they were a pup.''
   A boom-bust economy contributes to social instability, as does
the cultural upheaval besetting Alaska's 14-percent native
population.
   The result: Alaska consistently places at or near the top of the
charts in per-capita rates of drug and alcohol abuse, rape, child
abuse, divorce, suicide, assault and domestic violence.
   Trouble at home gives some Alaska youths good reason to run. But
once on the street, they face bigger trouble as easy targets for
drug-pushers, pimps and sexual exploiters.
   In the early 1980s, when North Slope oil revenues swelled state
budgets, officials increased funding for social programs, but
social workers say little went toward helping runaway kids. Today,
Anchorage has only 10 beds available for runaways, and now that the
oil boom has busted, government money is hard to come by.
   Enter Covenant House, the group started 19 years ago in New York
City when the Rev. Bruce Ritter, a Franciscan priest, started
letting street kids sleep on his apartment floor. Today, Covenant
House runs shelters in six cities and provides food, clothing,
medical care and counseling to more than 20,000 youths a year.
   Covenant House officials are asked why they're opening shop in
Anchorage when other, larger cities have bigger and more visible
runaway populations.
   ``We were invited,'' answered Brenda Moscarella, the Alaska
project manager. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Anchorage raised
enough money to buy the building and told Ritter it was his if
Covenant House would open a shelter. Ritter took the bait.
   The future Covenant House Alaska is now a ``bombshell of a
building,'' said Fred Ali, the Alaska program's executive director.
In the next few months, workers will transform it into a homey
shelter with bedrooms upstairs and a dining hall, clinic, lounge
and chapel downstairs.
   Ali has begun the search for a 40-member staff of doctors,
child-care workers, cooks and counselors. Operating costs are
expected to run just over $1 million a year, most of which will
come from Covenant House's national fundraising efforts.
   Though the organization has strong religious ties, runaways are
not proselytized, Moscarella said. ``God is one more father figure,
and they ran away from that,'' she said.
   Covenant House Alaska may differ a little from the group's other
operations. Ali said he's looking for staff comfortable with
Alaska's native culture, and Moscarella said the usual 9:30 p.m.
curfew may have to be extended in summer, when even toddlers stay
out to play under the late-night sun.
   But the blend of love and discipline that distinguishes other
Covenant House shelters will apply here, Moscarella said. No
weapons, drugs or violence will be allowed, and kids will have to
do chores and adhere to progress plans mapped out by counselors.
   The goals of those plans may be returning teen-agers home,
helping them land jobs, or sending them to drug counseling.
Nationwide, Covenant House claims a 35 percent success rate in
meeting those goals, Moscarella said.
   Some dispute that success, saying Covenant House actually
encourages runaways.
   ``I don't think it will help,'' said Allen, 17, a runaway and
former drug-pusher who now helps the Alaska Juvenile Crime
Commission counsel youths on the street. ``It's going to make kids
more likely to run away because they'll know they have some place
to stay.''
   And the police who handle runaway reports say many Anchorage
runaways are not in great danger. Investigator Ronald Emmons said
at least 90 percent fit into the ``spoiled brat'' or ``free
spirit'' category _ rebellious kids who run because they're told to
take out the garbage or vacuum the carpet.
   These manipulators generally return home after wearing out their
welcome at friends' houses, and Covenant House may not get through
to them, Emmons said. ``To them, it might just mean a picnic for 30
days,'' he said.
   But Ali and Moscarella said Covenant House is hard-headed enough
to deal with manipulators, and open-minded enough to take all
comers, spoiled brat or not.
   ``That kid may start off as a spoiled brat,'' Ali said. ``But
those kids are at risk just like anybody else. There is child
prostitution in this town, and there are kids running drugs. The
street's not a safe place to be.''

<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee is putting
together a catchall tax bill that includes help for students and
farmers but offsets every penny of relief with higher taxes on
someone else.
   In addition to farmers who buy diesel fuel and students who
receive education aid from an employer, the winners in the
legislation include owners of shares in mutual funds, low-income
workers, first-time homebuyers and corporations with big outlays
for research.
   The losers: defense contractors, purchases of single-premium
life insurance and corporations that own less than a 20 percent
share of other corporations.
   The bill would take away a considerable portion of the tax
benefits associated with single-premium life insurance and other
investment-oriented policies. The income from such policies, whose
purchasers usually have high incomes, is now tax-deferred and
policy loans are tax-free.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, presented his proposal Tuesday to members of the panel
and they immediately began considering it behind closed doors. When
the committee quit for the day, it had not made any decisions,
Rostenkowski said.
   The grab bag of special tax provisions would be added to a bill
designed to correct hundreds of errors that crept into the big 1986
law that overhauled the income tax system.
   In the past, such ``technical corrections'' bills have been the
vehicle for any number of special-interests tax relief. Fewer
special provisions are likely to be accepted this year because of
budget restraints and a requirement that every amendment that cuts
taxes for some group be paid for by raising taxes on another group.
   Rostenkowski's package, which the committee hopes to finish this
week, does just that, according to estimates of the staff of the
Joint Committee on Taxation. The proposal would cut taxes by $6.230
billion from 1988 through 1991 and raise other taxes by $6.232
billion.
   Among the bill's major provisions are those to:
   _Renew for three years, through 1991, an expired provision that
allowed employees to avoid taxes on amounts paid by their employer
(up to $5,250 a year) to further their educations. It would not be
available for post-graduate courses.
   _Make permanent a one-year provision that prevents owners of
mutual fund shares from being taxed on the fund's operating
expenses.
   _Effectively repeal, on July 1, 1988, a provision requiring
farmers and other off-the-road business users of diesel fuel to pay
the federal tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and then apply for a refund.
   _Extend, through 1990, a credit for owners of rental property
used for low-income housing.
   _Modify and extend, through 1990, a tax exemption for mortgage
bonds that are issued to make loans for first-time homebuyers.
   _Renew for two years a tax credit under which the government in
effect pays 40 percent of the first year's wages of poor employees.
   _Extend through 1990 a 20-percent credit for increased research
expenditures. A research expense deduction would be reduced to
reflect the credit.
   _Permit American corporations to allocate 67 percent of their
domestic research expenses against U.S.-source income.
   _Repeal the ``completed contract'' method of accounting under
which defense contractors and other large corporations avoid taxes
on part of their income until a project is completed.
   _Reduce from 70 percent to 50 percent the deduction allowed
certain corporations for portfolio dividends.
   _Eliminate the ability of certain corporations with fluctuating
incomes to reduce the total of taxes paid in advance in a given
year.
   _Repeal a special rule designed to benefit corporations
established by Alaska natives. Rostenkowski said the rule is being
abused, at great loss to the treasury, by outside investors.

   Sen. William Proxmire says Senate support of a
``poison pill'' amendment would weaken his bill to make hostile
takeovers of corporations more difficult and says he is considering
withdrawing the legislation from the Senate floor.
   The amendment, which the Senate refused on Tuesday to set aside,
would curb the ``poison pills.'' The term refers to strategies used
by target companies to make themselves less desirable to raiders,
such as issuing additional shares of stock or incurring new debt.
The vote on the amendment, which was offered by Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., was 57-40.
   Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Banking Committee, temporarily
withdrew the legislation from the floor after that vote. Aides said
that would give him time to examine the support he has to oppose
several amendments by Armstrong and to assess how he should deal
with them.
   Asked if he might remove the bill completely from consideration,
he told a reporter, ``There's a possibility that would happen,
yes.''
   Earlier, the lawmakers approved another amendment limiting
``golden parachutes,'' bonuses that are sometimes paid to corporate
managers ousted after their companies are acquired in hostile
takeovers.
   The golden parachute amendment is aimed at payments, sometimes
amounting to tens of millions of dollars, that can be made to
executives who are fired by new corporate owners. The provision
would require such bonuses to be approved by a majority vote of
shareholders.
   ``There is a point at which these abuses ought to be stopped or
at least made subject to a vote of the stockholders,'' said
Armstrong, R-Colo., the amendment's chief sponsor, shortly before
the 98-1 vote.
   The provision, as is true for many aspects of the corporate
takeover legislation, attracted an unusual coalition of supporters.
One of the Senate's most liberal members, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, joined conservatives Armstrong, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
and Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., in co-sponsoring it.
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., voted against the amendment, saying
that state laws should be allowed to continue to control the
bonuses. Delaware, corporate home of 54 percent of the companies
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has strong anti-takeover
legislation of its own.
   The only senator not voting was Joseph Biden, D-Del., who is
recovering from brain surgery.
   Armstrong argued that his poison pill amendment, which would
require that such strategies receive stockholder approval, was
needed because poison pills diminish shareholders' power. Proxmire
and his allies have argued that poison pills benefit stockholders
by driving up the price raiders must pay, and that there already
are state laws that curb abuses under the procedure.
   ``Obviously, we suffered a serious loss on that amendment,''
Proxmire said.
   Proxmire's bill would reduce from 10 days to five days the time
buyers of 5 percent of company's stock have to report the
transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shorter
window _ and a prohibition on buying additional stock until the
report is completed _ would make it harder for a buyer to quietly
gain control of a company.
   It would require buyers to disclose more information to the SEC,
such as whether they desire to simply make an investment or gain
control of a corporation. Tender offers _ public offers to purchase
stock at a given price _ would have to remain open for 35 days
instead of the current 20 days.
   The legislation would also increase criminal penalties for
insider trading from $100,000 and five years in prison to $1
million and 10 years of imprisonment.
   Proxmire and his supporters say takeovers have become such a
distraction to American business that their threat is causing
corporate managers to focus on them, rather than on improving their
products. In addition, they say, companies are being dismantled and
jobs lost because of the costs of battling would-be buyers, even
when the corporations successfully fend off the buyers.

<HEAD>Female Vietnam Vet Statue Draws Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Memo to politicians: Looking for an
election-year issue as surefire as the flag, baseball or Mom's
apple pie? Maybe a statue honoring American women? Even better,
women veterans of Vietnam?
   Well, think again.
   Although the Senate overwhelmingly approved the idea last week,
96-1, proposed legislation to add a woman's statue to the national
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington ran into all sorts of
trouble in the House on Tuesday.
   Members of the House Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee
on libraries and memorials witnessed a genteel clash between
actress Loretta Swit, who favored the statue, and Maya Lin, the
softspoken designer of the Vietnam memorial, who said it would be a
mistake.
   The panel also cited reports of allegedly extravagant spending
and mismanagement by former officers of the statue's
Minneapolis-based sponsoring group, a possible conflict of interest
by the sculptor of another statue at the Vietnam memorial and
political pressure from former Interior Secretary James Watt.
   Moreover, the Commission on Fine Arts reaffirmed its vote last
October opposing the plan for an eight-foot bronze sculpture of an
Army nurse in battle fatigues at the 2.2-acre Vietnam memorial site
on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial.
   The independent agency's approval is required before any
monument can be built on federal land in Washington, which bothered
Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.
   ``If we're just going to serve it up to them to veto again, why
bother?'' Frenzel asked. ``I don't want to pass a bill and find out
we're firing a blank.''
   Miss Swit, who starred on the popular television series
``M.A.S.H.'' as an Army nurse, made an emotional appeal for
approval of the monument. She called it a belated tribute to the
10,000 American women who served in Vietnam, now that a sculpture
of three combat-weary infantrymen has been placed at the memorial.
   She was backed by several members of Congress and major
veterans' organizations against Ms. Lin, the American Institute of
Architects and others who protested that yet another statue on the
site would distract from and damage the artistic integrity of its
centerpiece _ the black granite wall bearing the names of 58,156
Vietnam War dead, including eight female nurses.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chief sponsor of the House bill,
expressed concern over allegations that led to a high-level shakeup
in the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project Inc., the private sponsors
of the woman's statue.
   Chairwoman Donna-Marie Boulay was replaced after two board
members filed a lawsuit alleging that the organization spent
unreasonable amounts for fund raising and failed to maintain
adequate financial records.
   Gejdenson and Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, the subcommittee
chairwoman, strongly suggested that the project's new managers
avoid further trouble by funneling privately raised money through
an independent federal agency.
   Diane Carlson Evans, a project founder and former Vietnam nurse,
said the board shakeup in May has resulted in ``a complete review
of operating procedures and a total commitment by the current board
to see the memorial completed professionally and expeditiously.''
   Ms. Lin said the addition of a statue of three infantrymen at
the Vietnam memorial in 1984 was ordered by Watt, the former
interior secretary, as his condition for building the main portion
of the memorial according to her design. The memorial was dedicated
in November 1982.
   Retired Air Force nurse Linda Spoonster Schwartz told the panel
that Frederick E. Hart, who sculpted the infantrymen's statue, was
a member of the fine arts commission when it vetoed the woman's
statue last fall. Ms. Schwartz noted that Hart receives a portion
of the royalties from novelties based on his statue.
   ``I do not believe we will ever be given fair treatment as long
as Frederick Hart will be sitting in judgment on a potential
competitor to his royalty income,'' she said.
   Charles Atherton, a commission spokesman, said Hart took part in
the commission's discussion but abstained from voting on the
proposal.
   Gejdenson was undaunted by all the fuss, and predicted the House
will approve the woman's statue by the same overwhelming margin
that it passed the Senate.
   ``The message to the fine arts commission will be: You ought to
buy this deal or maybe we'll appoint a new commission,'' Gejdenson
said.

<HEAD>Drought's Effect on Export Subsidies Weighed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senior Reagan administration officials are
denying that there is a drought-inspired plan to scuttle export
subsidies or impose restrictions on how much U.S. grain can be
purchased by foreign countries.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Tuesday that it's ``a
little bit hard'' now to predict that the Export Enhacement
Program, or EEP, will continue to operate at its recent high level,
in view of the uncertainty about 1988-89 crop supplies and prices.
   But, he said, ``we will definitely, with whatever resources we
have, do whatever we need to do to try to keep our competitive
(export) position ever in front of us.''
   Besides the uncertainties of U.S. crop production this year,
world supply and demand will have to be reviewed, he said.
   ``It's impossible for us to make firm forecasts,'' Lyng said. ``
But I'll tell you this, that we will not neglect our export trade.''
   Under EEP, private exporting companies are subsidized with
``bonuses'' of free government-owned surplus commodities so they
can sell wheat or other designated commodities to specified foreign
countries.
   Wheat exports have soared, for example, largely because of EEP
sales to the Soviet Union, China and about 30 other foreign buyers.
   Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter fielded
questions Tuesday during a telephone news conference with farm
reporters.
   Yeutter had just returned from Japan, which has agreed to open
its doors to more U.S. beef and citrus products. He was asked about
remarks attributed to him in Tokyo on the possibility of a U.S.
clampdown on exports of corn, soybeans and other products because
of the drought's threat to supplies.
   ``I don't happen to believe that we're going to have an embargo,
and certainly I would oppose it, and I believe Secretary Lyng would
as well,'' Yeutter said.
   Lyng said that President Reagan in March 1982 ``came out with a
statement that said we would never, the United States would never,
under any circumstances, put an embargo on the shipment, or
restrict the shipment, of agricultural products because of high
prices.''
   Further, Lyng said, ``we've been telling the Japanese that. We
must maintain their confidence in us as suppliers'' of agricultural
products. ``There will be no embargoes selectively on agriculture
because of prices and scarcity.''
   Restrictions and embargoes in the 1970s, when supplies ran low,
along with a partial ban on grain sales to the Soviet Union in
January 1980 have been sore points with farmers who contend the
restrictions unnecessarily disrupt commodity markets.

   The new pact with Japan on beef and oranges
helps U.S. trade negotiators generally, particularly in dealings
with the European Economic Community, says U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   ``It should provide some additional psychological support for us
in dealing with the Europeans,'' Yeutter said Tuesday. ``In other
words, now that we've been able to strike a deal with the Japanese
on beef and citrus, it puts some additional pressure on the
Europeans to be somewhat more accommodating than they have in the
past.''
   With the Japanese starting to come into line, it could put
European leaders in the position of looking ``like the villains of
the agricultural world'' if they continue holding out, he said.
   Yeutter, who earlier this week returned from Tokyo where the new
agreement was reached after marathon negotiations, said that Japan
agreed to open the door to more American beef and citrus in the
face of further U.S. challenges under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   The agreement could lead to a doubling of U.S. exports of beef
and oranges by 1991 to more than $1 billion a year. In return, the
United States agreed to withdraw its GATT complaint against Japan's
restrictive import quotas.
   Yeutter said the complaint _ and previous success under GATT
rules last year _ helped prod Japan into accepting an expansion of
beef and citrus imports.
   ``In other words, the jig was up,'' he said. ``They'd gotten
away with a continuation of these programs for a lot of years. What
we, the United States, should have done was challenge these things
about 15 years ago instead of now, but better late than never.''
   Yeutter said he did not expect serious problems in ensuring that
Japan lives up to the new agreement, although officials should be
watchful.
   ``I don't see any loopholes there for the government of Japan to
use three years or so in the future,'' he said. ``But one can never
be sure. Governments are very creative on these kinds of things,
and they'll sometimes find loopholes or build loopholes where
they're not around today.''

   Further red tape has been trimmed so that
drought-stricken farmers can cut hay from Conservation Reserve
Program cropland.
   Haying on CRP land will be permitted if the county has been
approved for emergency haying and grazing under regular crop
set-aside programs, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Tuesday. This means that the Agriculture Department no longer will
rely on a complicated ``drought severity'' index to determine if
hay can be cut from CRP land.
   ``The extreme severity of the drought and the remote possibility
of any relief in sight makes this decision necessary,'' Lyng said.
   CRP land was opened for haying last week in about 300 counties
in 13 states and has been expanded gradually since then. The action
announced Tuesday, however, will raise the number of counties
eligible for CRP haying to more than 1,100 in 30 states.

<HEAD>System Causes Loss of Potential Scientists and Engineers, Study
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fundamental changes in the educational system
are needed to attract students to technical fields and assure that
the nation has enough qualified scientists and engineers, according
to a study released today by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment.
   The OTA, a research arm of Congress, found in the study that
though American schools have the capacity to produce the scientists
and engineers needed by the nation, many capable students never
enter the fields because of a lack of money or preparation.
   Some experts, the OTA report said, worry that a decline in
college-age students in the early 1990s and a lessened interest in
the technical fields will cause a decline in the number of
scientists and engineers.
   Despite these trends, said the report, ``shortages of scientists
and engineers are not inevitable.''
   Some adjustments will be made in the labor market, the report
said, causing more students to go into science and engineering, but
``the federal government may need to play a more active role.''
   The problem, the report said, could be attacked in two ways.
   To correct short-term shortages, the government could encourage
students to finish undergraduate and advanced degrees.
   ``If the nation wants more scientists and engineers relatively
quickly, then retaining college and graduate students in science
and engineering is the most useful policy strategy,'' the report
said. It noted that currently only about 30 percent of graduates
with bachelor's degrees enter full-time graduate level studies, and
only about half of doctoral candidates actually earn the doctoral
degree.
   ``Those who leave unwillingly or prematurely are a rich resource
that could be tapped,'' the report said.
   A longer-term solution is to expand and improve the talent pool
of students willing and prepared to go into the science fields.
   ``The years to do this are elementary school through the first
years of college,'' the report said. Increased recruitment into the
technical fields ``might come through full-scale revision of
elementary and secondary curricula, tracking, testing and course
structure,'' the report said, though it noted that such a change
``will be hard to achieve given the scale of American education and
the inertia of the existing system.''
   Among the measures needed, the report said, are methods of
recruiting more women and minorities into technical fields, which
traditionally have been dominated by white males.
   The report said that developing a scientist or engineer requires
20 years of schooling and a social and economic climate that
encourages students to prepare themselves in the lower grades and
to persist in college to the advanced degrees.
   Investing in future scientists and engineers is essential to the
nation, the report said.
   ``Although comprising only 4 percent of American workers,
scientists and engineers have specialized skills that are vital to
the national welfare'' in developing new technology and in keeping
the national industrial machine operating smoothly, the report said.
   ``The nation is well advised, therefore,'' the report said, ``to
seek an adequate supply of people prepared for science and
engineering careers.''

   Congress is expected to act quickly to enact
legislation to strengthen the enforcement of the nation's fair
housing law now that Democrats and the Reagan administration have
worked out a compromise.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., one of the measure's strongest
supporters, called the compromise ``a giant step toward enacting
legislation that will make the promise of fair housing a reality.''
   President Reagan and Vice President George Bush gave their
approval Tuesday to an agreement reached by Democrats and civil
rights groups with Republicans and realtors, permitting someone
charged with housing discrimination to have the accusation
considered in federal court.
   Currently, the Department of Housing and Urban Development can
offer to mediate disputes only if both parties agree to
participate. If they don't, individuals must bring private
lawsuits. The Justice Department can intervene only if government
lawyers detect a pattern of discrimination against a particular
group.
   The bill that came out of the Democratic-controlled House
Judiciary Committee earlier this month would allow those who
believe they have been discriminated against in the sale or rental
of housing to bring complaints before an administrative law judge.
The judge would have the power to levy fines and issue injunctions,
and the decision could then be appealed through the courts.
   Administration officials opposed the measure because, they said,
monetary damages should be assessed only by the courts.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr., R-N.Y., crafted an amendment to the bill
that received support from the opposing parties _ giving the
accused party the opportunity to go into federal court first to
have his case heard.
   ``The fair housing law, enacted two decades ago at a time of
national mourning and strife, stands as a symbol of our national
commitment to the goals of equal housing opportunity for all
Americans,'' Fish said at a news conference. ``Unfortunately,
however, the reality confronting victims of housing discrimination
falls far short of our lofty legal goal.
   ``The proposed bill, together with my amendment, provides
victims a quick and effective means of seeking redress,'' he said.
``Passage of this legislation will boost confidence in the
effectiveness of our fair housing law.''
   Rep. Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., the House minority leader, said
that Reagan, in Toronto for the economic summit, told Michel that
he believes the compromise ``preserves the constitutional right to
jury trials and hopes the Congress will move quickly on the
legislation to strengthen fair housing laws.''
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee-to-be, said the Fish
amendment will strengthen the fair housing law by giving HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce ``the necessary enforcement powers to more
effectively combat housing discrimination.''
   A similar measure is pending in the Senate, which is expected to
act as soon as the House approves the measure.
   The bill also extends anti-discrimination provisions to families
with children and to the disabled, and requires that all new
apartment buildings be constructed to permit access by the
handicapped to some units. It also requires landlords to permit
disabled individuals, at their own expense, to adapt homes to suit
their needs.

   The gulf between the haves and have-nots in
the savings and loan industry is yawning wider as institutions in
Texas continue to bleed red ink.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Tuesday that the 3,118
federally insured savings institutions lost a staggering $3.78
billion in the first three months of this year, down only slightly
from the $3.81 billion post-Depression record set in the last
quarter of 1987.
   Bank board economist James Barth said 2,164 institutions, 69
percent of the industry, posted a $1.3 billion profit in the first
quarter. But that was overwhelmed by the $5.1 billion lost by the
remaining 954 money-losing institutions.
   Barth said three states plagued by moribund oil industries and
depressed real estate prices _ Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana _
accounted for 80 percent of the first-quarter loss.
   Texas alone, where nearly half of the S&Ls _ 133 of 279 _ are
considered insolvent, racked up losses of $3.48 billion.
   The 20 weakest S&Ls accounted for $3 billion of the loss, up
from $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, and the weakest 50
accounted for $3.7 billion. A single institution, Sun Belt Savings
Association in Dallas, lost $1.2 billion.
   ``We do have a bifurcated industry,'' Barth said.
   Last year, savings associations had their worst year since the
Great Depression, losing $7.6 billion. If the first three months
are any indication, 1988 is likely to set another record.
   By comparison, the nation's 13,541 commercial banks earned $3.6
billion in 1987, the smallest profit since the Depression, but
recovered with a $5 billion gain in the first quarter of 1988.
   Still, Barth noted some hopeful signs for the savings industry.
   The number of insolvent S&Ls under generally accepted accounting
rules fell for the first time in two years from 518 to 504.
   Also, earnings at thrifts considered solvent under less-strict
regulatory rules _ about 90 percent of the industry _ totaled $600
million, compared with a $200 million loss in the fourth quarter of
1987.
   And, preliminary data for April indicate the industry as a whole
could turn an operating profit in the second quarter.
   ``There are a lot of things in these numbers to suggest that
while the problem is terrible, it is not getting worse,'' said
Martin A. Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of
Savings Institutions.
   ``It is bottoming out somewhat. I don't mean to put a favorable
light on a $3.8 billion loss, but there are some glimmers out
there,'' he said.
   The question is how many more soured loans, as yet unrecognized
on S&Ls' books, are there. Loan losses accounted for $3.9 billion
of the first quarter loss versus $4 billion the previous quarter.
   ``I would expect they would start tapering off in Texas. We've
had a massive amount of losses ... over the past few years,'' said
William C. Ferguson, an Irving, Texas, S&L consultant. ``I
fervently hope it will taper off soon.''
   But other private analysts say billions more in bad loans are
likely to surface. And they say rising interest rates could cut
into the operating profits of healthy thrifts.
   ``A lot of people would say that losses in the industry total
$55 billion. We're still a long way from recognizing that, plus
there is some risk of short-term interest rates going up and losses
increasing,'' said Richard L. Peterson, professor of finance at
Texas Tech University in Lubbock.
   The question is becoming increasingly critical as regulators and
Congress try to determine how long the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which insures savings deposits up to $100,000, can
continue operating without an infusion of more money.
   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the $20 billion the FSLIC
will have over the next three years is as much as the agency can
efficiently spend and it is too soon to tell if more will be needed
later.
   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing
agency, estimates it will cost $26 billion to $36 billion to clean
up the industry. Private analysts put the price tag at $50 billion
or more.

   The prospects that the Reagan administration
will be able to meet its $146.7 billion budget deficit goal for the
fiscal year are growing dimmer.
   The Treasury Department said Tuesday that personal income-tax
collections picked up in May after the April revenue flow lagged.
But the cumulative deficit of $127.5 billion for the first eight
months of the 1988 fiscal year is still running 6.3 percent higher
than last year.
   ``If we continue the pace we have right now it will come in at
about $159 billion,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial
economist of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Unless they do some funny accounting, they're not going to be
able to hit their goal for the year,'' or even the Congressional
Budget Office's projection of $157 billion, he said.
   The deficit last year totaled $150.2 billion after soaring to a
record $221.1 billion in 1986. The target for the 1989 fiscal year,
beginning Oct. 1, is set at $136 billion by the Gramm-Rudman budget
balancing law.
   The persistent imbalance between what the government spends and
what it takes in is blamed by economists for weakening the dollar,
encouraging a high trade deficit and pressuring interest rates
upward.
   In May, the deficit totaled $22.5 billion, about $5 billion less
than expected by most analysts and down 36.9 percent from $35.6
billion a year ago.
   Personal income tax collection was off by 25.8 percent in April,
$51.3 billion against $71.8 billion a year earlier. But May
collections were nearly double those of last year. They rose from
$9.3 billion in 1987 to $18.0 billion, the Treasury Department said.
   ``Basically the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) got money in May
this year, rather than in April,'' Kahan said.
   Economists trying to determine the 1988 number will be closely
watching quarterly corporate tax collections, which were due June
15.
   ``The question is if corporations, with their sharp pencils, can
reduce some of the bite of the new tax law,'' Kahan said.
   In May, government revenues totaled $59.7 billion, 25.2 percent
stronger than in May 1987. Spending totaled $82.2 billion, down 1.3
percent from a year ago.
   For the first eight months, revenue totaled $581.8 billion, up
4.9 percent over 1987, while spending was $709.3 billion, up 5.2
percent from a year ago.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in March were the
military, followed by Social Security, interest on the national
debt and other programs in the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   Military spending totaled $20.3 billion last month and $188.7
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 4.1 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $18.1 billion last month
and $139.4 billion for the past eight months, up 5.4 percent from
the same period in fiscal 1987.
   The other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent
$11.9 billion in May and $105.1 billion so far this budget year, a
5.5 percent increase over 1987.
   Interest on the $2.5 trillion national debt totaled $17.4
billion last month and $137.5 billion so far this fiscal year, an
increase of 9.5 percent over the same period last year.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Ups Financing For NASA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Senate panel has cleared the way for an $800
million appropriation for the planned U.S. space station, up from a
$200 million package approved last week that officials said was so
small it would derail the project.
   The Senate appropriations defense subcommittee voted Tuesday to
shift $600 million from unspent defense funds to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration budget. The money is intended
for the space station, said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who helped
arrange the transfer.
   ``The big hurdle was the subcommittee,'' Bentsen said. ``We've
crossed the big hurdle.''
   Another Senate appropriations subcommittee, which has
jurisdiction over NASA's budget, voted last week to appropriate
$200 million for the space station. Bentsen said at the time that
amount ``provides only enough for the slow strangulation'' of the
project.
   Bentsen said an $800 million appropriation would be enough to
``reach the level of support that is needed and get it moving ahead
as it should.''
   President Reagan had asked for a $967 million appropriation for
the space station in the next fiscal year's budget, and NASA
officials said $900 million is needed to keep it on schedule.
   Construction of the space station could begin next year if it
stays on schedule, and it is planned to be in orbit around Earth
and occupied by astronauts by the end of 1996, officials say.
   Bentsen said he is optimistic the $800 million will clear the
appropriations committee and the full Senate.
   The House Appropriations Committee, however, says the future of
the project should depend on the next president. The committee
voted last week to appropriate $902 million for the space station,
but the next president would have to agree to go ahead with the
project before the project could receive about half of that amount.

   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley has plenty of
practice answering the question he's most often asked these days:
Would you accept the vice presidential nomination on a ticket with
Michael Dukakis?
   ``No, no, no,'' is Bradley's reply, well rehearsed from the days
_ not too long ago _ when the 44-year-old Democrat was as often
asked if he would run for president.
   Speculation that the former basketball star was himself eyeing
the White House ended in March, when Bradley threw his sought-after
support to the Massachusetts governor.
   Bradley's endorsement answered, for 1988 at least, what Bradley
aides had wistfully come to call ``the `P' question.''
   Yet, the endorsement gave rise to the next query: Would Bradley
seek or accept the No. 2 slot?
   The basketball Hall of Fame member could bring a needed bit of
pizazz to the Dukakis ticket from Bradley's continued celebrity
from his days playing for Princeton and the New York Knicks.
   Also a Rhodes Scholar, the intellectual senator specializes in
economics and foreign affairs, two areas key to a solid Dukakis
platform. Bradley has already traveled to Boston to counsel Dukakis
on the Soviets.
   Most pragmatically, Bradley is New Jersey's most popular
politician and could no doubt deliver the state's 16 Electoral
College votes.
   On the negative side, the Northeastern combination of Bradley
and Dukakis would make a geographically lopsided team.
   ``I think Massachusetts and New Jersey have a lot in common, but
I don't think they go together on a national ticket,'' Bradley says.
   Even more monotonous would be the combination of the two men's
stiff speaking styles. Though a crowd pleaser, Bradley still
struggles with the wooden delivery that labeled him boring since
entering politics 10 years ago.
   As with the presidency, the ever-studious Bradley says he is
unready to be vice president.
   The senator always listens first to himself. When advisers told
him to attend a big-time basketball school, he went to Princeton.
When they said go for the pros, he accepted the Rhodes scholarship.
In 1978, they told him to run for local office. He got elected to
the Senate.
   Last week, Bradley met in private here with Dukakis' campaign
chairman Paul Brountas. Aides made no secret that Brountas, who is
heading the vice presidential search, was seeking the senator's
input.
   But Bradley and his aides insisted the idea of Bradley on the
ticket was not discussed.
   Bradley says he wants to play a role at the Democratic National
Convention next month in Atlanta. He has been mentioned as a
possible keynote speaker, as one of several promising Democrats
with guaranteed roles in the party's future.
   But delivering the keynote speech would invite inevitable and
unenviable comparisons to the impressive 1984 oratory by Gov. Mario
Cuomo of New York. Bradley might be more comfortable with a
lower-profile speech, perhaps nominating Dukakis.
   Still young, Bradley has never ruled out the idea of one day
running for president.
   Aides, meanwhile, say they are preparing for the next question:
Which Cabinet post will the senator want?

<TEXT>
   A defense contractor told federal agents four
years ago that a private consultant routinely provided his company
with secret Pentagon documents and ``every major corporation gets
the same material.''
   The comments of Walter R. Edgington, then vice president of GTE
Government Systems Corp., meshed with remarks by a former Pentagon
investigator Tuesday that the Justice Department had ``substantive
evidence that there was massive fraud'' in military weapons
purchases three years ago.
   Robert L. Segal, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent
who investigated procurement fraud cases at the Pentagon for one
year until his resignation in January 1985, said there was
``extensive evidence'' of wrongdoing even though only a handful of
companies were charged.
   GTE Government Systems was one of the companies against which
criminal charges were brought nearly three years ago after an
investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service for
which Segal worked.
   The widespread Pentagon investigation now under way centers on
allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed
Pentagon officials to obtain inside information that would give
them a competitive advantage in the multimillion dollar procurement
sweepstakes.
   Edgington and Bernie Zettl, a former GTE consultant, were
indicted on charges of espionage and theft of government property,
while Robert R. Carter, a former GTE marketing manager, was charged
with participating in the alleged conspiracy.
   The company agreed to plead guilty and was fined $500,000. But
nearly three years after the indictment, the rest of the case still
has not come to trial, and all charges have been dropped except a
conspiracy count against Zettl.
   Delays have resulted from lengthy legal disputes over the
release of classified material.
   On Feb. 29, 1984, Edgington was interviewed by two Pentagon
investigators, according to a document in the court file. The
defense contractor told the agents that when he first started with
GTE in 1966, ``everyone within the office had unauthorized
classified documents.''
   To get a handle on all of the paper, Edgington said, he got ``a
good sergeant major and put all the documents in the file room so
that they could at least be controlled,'' according to the report
on the interview.
   ``Every major corporation gets the same material,'' Edgington
told the agents, but he declined to reveal names of other companies
with the unauthorized material.
   Edgington did say that Zettl provided the documents to a GTE
employee who routed them to the proper people inside the company.
The GTE vice president said he never asked Zettl how he came upon
the material because he wasn't interested.
   Edgington defended possession of classified documents as a tool
in ``major technical planning.'' The information saves the
government money by cutting down on start-up time for projects, he
said.
   When one agent asked Edgington why he didn't shut the document
trafficking operation down once he knew about it, he replied: ``If
you already have your feet in the mud, why take a shower, you still
can't get rid of past dirt.''
   At his news conference, Segal, now a stockbroker in suburban
Springfield, Va., said he concluded three years ago that bribery
and fraud in Pentagon procurement were common.
   Segal was supposed to testify at a Senate subcommittee Oct. 1,
1985, but was blocked by the Justice Department which claimed his
testimony would have harmed an ongoing criminal case.
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the subcommittee chairman at the
time, contends that the current Pentagon bribery probe could have
started three years ago had the Justice Department not stifled
Segal's allegations.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, has defended the Justice
Department's role.
   In a related development Tuesday, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said
the congressional General Accounting Office estimates that the
Pentagon spent $2.8 billion on consultants in fiscal 1987. The
Pentagon has said it spent $155 million.
   Pryor said the GAO estimate, high as it is, may still be far too
low. He said the GAO estimated that consulting costs might run as
high as $18 billion a year.

   Here is the text of the Economic Declaration
issued Tuesday by the seven major industrialized countries at the
end of their three-day summit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1. We, the heads of state or government of seven major
industrial nations and the president of the commission of the
European Communities, have met in Toronto for the 14th annual
Economic Summit. We have drawn lessons from the past and looked
ahead to the future.
   2. Over the past 14 years, the world economy and economic policy
have undergone profound changes. In particular, the
information-technology revolution and the globalization of markets
have increased economic interdependence, making it essential that
governments consider fully the international dimensions of their
deliberations.
   3. We observed a sharp contrast between the 1970s and the 1980s.
The former was a decade of high and rising inflation, declining
productivity growth, policies dominated by short-term
considerations, and frequently inadequate international policy
cooperation.
   In the 1980s inflation has been brought under control, laying
the basis for sustained strong growth and improved productivity.
The result has been the longet period of economic growth in
post-war history. However, the 1980s have seen the emergence of
large external imbalances in the major industrial economies,
greater exchange rate volatility, and debt-servicing difficulties
in a number of developing countries.
   Our response to these developments has been an increased
commitment to international cooperation, resulting in the
intensified process of policy coordination adopted at the 1986
Tokyo summit and further strengthened at the Venice summit and in
the Group of Seven.
   4. Summits have proven an effective form to address the issues
facing the world economy, promote new ideas and develop a common
sense of purpose. Especially in the 1980s theyhave helped bring
about an increasing recognition that the eradication of inflation
and of inflationary expectations is fundamental to sustained growth
and job creation. That recognition has been underpinned by a shift
from short-term considerations to a medium-term framework for the
development and implementation of economic policies, and a
commitment to improve efficiency and adaptability through greater
reliance on competitive forces and structural reform. Over this
period we have also singled out for concerted attention a number of
other issues of decisive importance:
   _The overriding need to resist protectionism and strengthen the
open, multilateral trading system.
   _To maintain and strengthen an effective strategy to address the
challenge of development and alleviate the burden of debt.
   _And to deal with the serious nature of the world agricultural
problem.
   5. Since we last met, our economies have kept up the momenum of
growth. Employment has continued to expand generally, inflation has
been restrained and progess has been made toward the correction of
major external imbalances. These encouraging developments are cause
for optimism, but not for complacency. To sustain non-inflationary
growth will require a commitment to enhanced cooperation. This is
the key to credibility and confidence.

   6. The Tokyo and Venice summits have developed and strengthened
the process of coordination of our economic policies. Developments
in the wake of the financial strains last October demonstrate the
effectiveness and resilience of the arrangements that have emerged.
The policy, the short-term prospects, and the medium-term
objectives and projections of our economies are being discussed
regularly in the Group of Seven. The policies and performance are
assessed on the basis of economic indicators.
   We welcome the progress made in refining the analytical use of
indicators, as well as the addition to the existing indicators of a
commodity-price indicator. The progress in coordination is
contributing to the process of further improving the functioning of
the international monetary system.
   7. Fiscal, monetary and structural policies have been undertaken
to foster the adjustment to more sustainable economic and financial
positions in the context of non-inflationary growth. Efforts in
those directons, including continued reduction of budgetary
deficits, will continue. We need to maintain vigilance against any
resurgence of inflation.
   We reaffirm our determination to follow and, wherever feasible,
strengthen our agreed strategy of coordinated efforts to reduce the
growth of spending in countries with large external deficits and to
sustain the momentum of domestic demand in those with large
external surpluses. The reduction of large external imbalances,
however, will require not only our cooperative efforts, but also
those of smaller economies, including newly industrializing
economies, with large external surpluses.
   8. The exchange rate changes in the past three years, especially
the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and
the major European currencies, have played a major role in the
adjustment of real trade balances. We endorse the Group of Seven's
conclusion that either excessive fluctuation of exchange rates, a
further decline of the dollar, or a rise in the dollar to an extent
that becomes destabilizing to the adjustment process, could be
counterproductive by damaging growth prospects in the world
economy.

<HEAD>Structural Reforms</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   9. International cooperation involves more than coordination of
macroeconomic policies. Structural reforms complement macroeconomic
policies, enhance their effectiveness, and provide the basis for
more robust growth. We shall collectively review our progress on
structural reforms and shall strive to integrate structural
policies into our economic coordination process.
   10. We will continue to pursue structural reforms by removing
barriers, unnecessary controls and regulations; increasing
competition, while mitigating adverse effects on social groups or
regions; removing disincentives to work, save, and invest, such as
through tax reform; and by improving education and training. The
specific priorities that each of us has identified are outlined in
the attached Annex on Structural Reforms.
   11. We welcome the further development of the OECD's
surveillance of structural reforms. Such surveillance would be
particularly useful in improving public understanding of the
reforms by revealing their impact on government budgets, consumer
prices and international trade.
   12. One of the major structural problems in both developed and
developing countries is in the field of agricultural policies. It
is essential that recent significant policy reform efforts
undertaken by a number of parties be continued through further
positive action by all summit participants. More market-oriented
agricultural policies should assist in the achievement of important
objectives such as preserving rural areas and family farming,
raising quality standards and protecting the environment. We
welcome the OECD's increased emphasis on structural adjustment and
development in the rural economy.
   13. Financial and technological innovations are rapidly
integrating financial markets internationally, contributing to a
better allocation of capital but also increasing the speed and
extent to which disturbances in one country may be transmitted to
other countries. We will continue to cooperate with other countries
in the examination of the functioning of the global financial
system, including securities markets.

<HEAD>Multilateral Trading System-Uruguay Round</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   14. A successful Uruguay Round will assure the integrity of an
open, predictable multilateral trading system based on clear rules
and will lead to trade expansion and enhanced economic growth. At
Punta del Este, ministers committed themsleves to further trade
liberalization across the wide range of goods and services,
including such new areas as trade-related intellectual property and
trade-related investment measures, to strengthen the multilateral
trading system, and to allow for early agreement where appropriate.
Countries must continue to resist protectionism and the temptation
to adopt unilateral measures outside the framework of GATT rules
and to allow for early agreements where appropriate. In order to
preserve a favorable negotiating climate, the participants should
conscientiously implement the commitments to standstill and
rollback that they have taken at Punta del Este and subsequent
international meetings.
   15. We strongly welcome the Free Trade Agreement between Canada
and the USA, and the steady progress towards the target of the
European Community to complete the internal market by 1992. It is
our policy that these developments, together with other moves
towards regional cooperation in which our countries are involved,
should support the open, multilateral trading system and catalyze
the liberalizing impact of the Uruguay Round.
   16. We attach major importance to strengthening the GATT itself.
It is vital that the GATT become a more dynamic and effective
organization, particularly in regard to the surveillance of trade
policies and dispute settlement procedures, with greater
Ministerial involvement, and strengthened linkages with other
international organizations. GATT disciplines must be improved so
that members accept their obligations and ensure that disputes are
resolved speedily, effectively and equitably.
   17. Trade plays a key role in development. We encourage the
developing countries, especially the newly industrializing
economies, to undertake increased commitments and obligations and a
greater role in the GATT, commensurate with their importance in
international trade and in the international adjustment process, as
well as with their respective stages of development. Equally,
developed countries should continue to strive to ensure more open
markets for the exports of developing countries.
   18. In agriculture, continued political impetus is essential to
underpin the politically difficult efforts at domestic policy
reform and to advance the equally difficult and related process of
agricultural trade reform. Although significant progress was made
in 1987 in the Uruguay Round negotiations, with the tabling of
major proposals, it is necessary to ensure that the Mid-Term Review
in Montreal in December, 1988 adds impetus to the negotiations in
this as in other fields. We support efforts to adopt a framework
approach, including short as well as long-term elements which will
promote the reform process as launched last year and relieve
current strains in agricultural markets. This would be facilitated
by a device for the measurement of support and protection. Also,
ways should be developed to take account of food security and
social concerns. To move the issue forward, and noting among other
things the diversity of our agricultural situations, our
negotiators in Geneva must develop a framework approach which
includes short-term options in line with long-term goals concerning
the reduction of all direct and indirect subsidies and other
measures affecting directly or indirectly agricultural trade. The
objective of the framework approach would be to make the
agricultural sector more responsive to market signals.
   19. As the Uruguay Round enters a more difficult phase, it is
vital to ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations. The
Mid-Term Review will provide a unique opportunity to send a
credible political signal to the trading world. The greatest
possible advance must be made in all areas of the negotiations,
including, where appropriate, decisions, so as to reach before the
end of the year the stage where tangible progress can be
registered. To this end, we support efforts to adopt a framework
approach on all issues in the negotiations, i.e. reform of the GATT
system and rules, market access, agriculture and new issues (such
as trade in services, trade-related intellectual property rights,
and trade-related investment measures). For our part, we are
committed to ensure that the Mid-Term Review establishes a solid
base for the full and complete success of the negotiations, in
accordance with the Punta del Este Declaration.
   20. We all recognize the critical and expanding role of
international investment in the world economy aand share a deep
concern that increased protectionism would undermine the benefits
of open investment policies. We resolve to progressively liberalize
international investment policies and urge other countries to do
likewise.

<HEAD>Newly Industrializing Economies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   21. Certain newly-industrializing economies (NIEs) in the
Asia-Pacific region have become increasingly important in world
trade. Although these economies differ in many important respects,
they are all characterized by dynamic, export-led growth which has
allowed them to treble their share of world trade since 1960. Other
outward-oriented Asian countries are also beginning to emerge as
rapidly-growing exporters of manufactures. With increased economic
importance come greater international responsibilities and a strong
mutual interest in improved constructive dialogue and cooperative
efforts in the near term between the industrialized countries and
the Asian NIEs, as well as the other outward-oriented countries in
the region. The dialogue and cooperative efforts could center on
such policy areas as macroeconomic, currency, structural and trade
to achieve the international adjustment necessary for sustained,
balanced growth of the world economy. We encourage the development
of informal processes which would facilitate multilateral
dicussions of issues of mutual concern and foster the necessary
cooperation.

<HEAD>Developing Countries and Debt</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   22. The performance of developing countries is increasingly
important to the world economy. Central to the prospects of the
developing countries are a healthy global economic environment and
an open trading system, adequate financial flows and, most
important, their commitment to appropriate economic reform. The
problems of many heavily-indebted developing countries are a cause
of economic and political concern and can be a threat to political
stability in developing countries. Several countries find
themselves in that situation in various regions of the world: Latin
America, Africa and the Pacific, particularly the Philippines, and
that merits our special attention.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Middle-Income Countries</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   23. A number of highly-indebted middle-income countries continue
to have difficulties serving their external debt and generating the
investment necessary for sustainable growth. The market-oriented,
growth-led strategy based on the case-by-case approach remains the
only viable approach for overcoming their external debt problems.
   24. We are encouraged that many indebted countries have begun
the difficult process of macroeconomic adjustment and structural
reform necessary for sustained progress, encouraging the return of
flight capital and new investment flows. The success of these
efforts is essential for improving the economic performance and
strengthening the creditworthiness of these countries.
   25. Official financing has played a central role in the debt
strategy through the Paris Club ($73 billion of principal and
interest have been consolidated since 1983) and the flexible
policies of export credit agencies. The international financial
institutions will continue to have a pivotal role. We endorse the
recent initiatives taken by the International Monetary Fund to
strengthen its capacity to support medium-term programs of
macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform and to provide
greater protection for adjustment programs from unforeseen external
developments. We strongly support the full implementation of the
World Bank's $75 billion General Capital Increase to strengthen its
capacity to promote adjustment in middle-income countries. We also
support greater awareness by international financial institutions
of the environmental impact of their development programs.
   26. Commercial banks have played an important role in supporting
debtor countries' reform efforts through an expanded menu of
financing options which has facilitated the channelling of
commercial bank lending into productive uses. Their continued
involvement is indispensable to the debt strategy. In this regard,
the World Bank and IMF can play an important catalytic role in
mobilizing additional financing from private (and official) sources
in support of debtor countries' adjustment programs.
   27. We note that in recent years there has been increasing
recourse to innovative financing techniques. The important
characteristics of these techniques are that they are voluntary,
market-oriented, and applied on a case-by-case basis. The ``menu
approach'' has engendered new financial flows and, in some cases,
reduced the existing stock of debt. The flexibility of the present
strategy would be enhanced by the further broadening of the menu
approach and the encouragement of innovative financing techniques
to improve the quality of new lending, but particular initiatives
would have to be carefully considered.
   28. International direct investment plays an important role in
spurring economic growth and structural adjustment in developing
countries. Thus it contributes to alleviating debt problems.
Developing countries should welcome and encourage such investment
by creating a favorable investment climate.

<HEAD>Debt of the Poorest</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   29. An increase in concessional resource flows is necessary to
help the poorest developing countries resume sustained growth,
especially in cases where it is extremely difficult for them to
service their debts. Since Venice, progress in dealing with the
debt burden of these countries has been encouraging. Paris Club
creditors are rescheduling debt at extended grace and repayment
periods. In addition, the recent enhancement of the IMF's
Structural Adjustment Facility; the World Bank and Official
Development Assistance (ODA) agencies' enhanced program of
co-financing; and the fifth replenishment of the African
Development Fund will mobilize a total of more than 18 billion in
favor of the poorest and most indebted countries undertaking
adjustment efforts over the period 1988-90. Out of this total, $15
billion will be channeled to sub-Saharan African countries.

   30. We welcome proposals made by several of us to ease further
the debt service burdens of the poorest countries that are
undertaking internationally-approved adjustment programs. We have
achieved consensus on rescheduling official debt of these countries
within a framework of comparibility that allows official creditors
to choose among concessional interest rates usually on shorter
maturities, longer repayment periods at commercial rates, partial
write-offs of debt service obligations during the consolidation
period, or a combination of these options. This approach allows
official creditors to choose options consistent with their legal or
budgetary constraints. The Paris Club has been urged to work out
necessary technicalities to ensure comparability by the end of the
year at the very latest. This approach will provide benefits over
and above the impressive multilateral agreements to help the
poorest countries over the past year. We also welcome the action
taken by a numbr of creditor governments to write off or otherwise
remove the burden of ODA loans and also urge countries to maintain
a high grant element in their future assistance to the poorest.

<HEAD>Environment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   31. We agree that the protection and enhancement of the
environment is essential. The report of the World Commission on
Environment and Development has stressed that environmental
considerations must be integrated into all areas of economic
policy-making if the globe is to continue to support humankind. We
endorse the concept of sustainable development.
   32. Threats to the environment recognize no boundaries. Their
urgent nature requires strengthened international cooperation among
all countries. Significant progress has been achieved in a number
of environmental areas. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer is a milestone. All countries are
encouraged to sign and ratify it.
   33. Further action is needed. Global climate change, air, sea
and fresh water pollution, acid rain, hazardous substances,
deforestation, and endangered species require priority attention.
It is, therefore, timely that negotiations on a protocol on
emissions of nitrogen oxides within the framework of the Geneva
Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution be pursued
energetically. The efforts of the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) for an agreement on the transfrontier shipment of
hazardous wastes should also be encouraged as well as the
establishment of an inter-governmental panel on global climate
change under the auspices of UNEP and the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO). We also recognize the potential impact of
agriculture on the environment, whether negative through
over-intensive use of resources or positive in preventing
desertification. We welcome the Conference on the Changing
Atmosphere to be held in Toronto next week.

   34. We, the heads of state or government, and the
representatives of the European Community, believe that the
Economic Summits have strengthened the ties of solidarity, both
political and economic, that exist between our countries and that
thereby they have helped to sustain the values of democracy that
underlie our economic and political systems. Our annual meetings
have provided the principal opportunity each year for the
governments of the major industrialized countries to reflect, in an
informal and flexible manner, upon their common responsibility for
the progress of the world economy and to resolve how that
responsibility should have practical manifestation in the year
ahead. We believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our
meetings has benefited both our own countries and the wider world
community. We believe, too, that the opportunities afforded by our
meetings are becoming even more valuable in today's world of
increasing interdependence and increasing technological change. We
have therefore agreed to institute a further cycle of summits by
accepting the invitation of the President of the French Republic to
meet in France, July 14-16, 1989.

<HEAD>ANNEX ON STRUCTURAL REFORMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Europe is pursuing structural reforms to complement
macroeconomic policies in order to spur job creation, enhance
growth potential, and achieve a sustainable pattern of external
balances. Structural reform measures are being put into place in
the framework of the Communities' program for a unified internal
market by 1992; including full liberalization of capital movements;
removal of physical, administrative and technical barriers to allow
the full mobility of persons, goods and services and an improvement
of competition policy. However, full achievement will depend on
complete and timely implementation of the measures and on
complementary policies including those in the fields of regional,
social and environmental policies and of technological cooperation.
   _The main elements of Germany's structural reforms are tax
reform and reduction, deregulation and privatization, reform of the
postal and telecommunications system, increased flexibility in the
labor market and reform of the social security system.
   _In France, the main structural reforms will deal with improving
the level of education and professional training and development
for workers, and with major improvements in the functioning of
financial markets in order to facilitate the financing of the
economy at the lowest possible cost.
   _Italy will seek to promote training and education, increase the
flexibility of the labor market to spur employment, improve the
functioning of financial markets, revise the tax system to promote
efficiency and eliminate distortions, enhance public sector
efficiency.
   _In the United Kingdom, there has already been a substantial
program of tax reform, trade union law reform, deregulation,
opening up of markets and privatization of state industries. This
will continue. Further measures are being introduced to improve
both the quality of education and the flexibility of the housing
market.
   _Japan will pursue further structural reforms to support and
sustain the greater reliance on domestic demand-led growth which
has quickened remarkably. Japan will promote reform of government
regulations in key sectors including land use policies and the
distribution system and reform of the tax system.
   _For the United States, where recent indications that the
declining trend in private savings may have bottomed out are
encouraging, it is nonetheless a priority to increase incentives to
save. Also the United States will strengthen the international
competitiveness of its industrial sector.
   _The most promising areas of structural reform in Canada are
implementation of the second stage of tax reform, the proposed
liberalization of the financial services sector, and, most
important, templementation of the Free Trade Agreement with the
United States.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's news
conference Tuesday.
   Well, please be seated.
   I have a little statement here first I'd like to impose on you.
   I'll _ this will be before taking questions.
   Today's ceremonies, as you know, marked the end of my eighth
economic summit.
   And over the years, I have come to regard the summit process as
extremely important in forging a coordinated economic approach for
the United States and the other industrialized democracies.
   It's helped return the nations represented here to steady
growth, and helped to establish a consensus among us that only free
and open markets and only free and open societies foster economic
progress and opportunity.
   Maybe one of the best ways to view these economic summits is to
compare discussions at them, whether heralded in our communiques or
not, with later results.
   For example, our 1981 communique from Ottawa said: The primary
challenge we addressed at this meeting was the need to revitalize
the economies of the industrial democracies.
   Revitalization, of course, has been achieved, in part, because
the common commitment at Ottawa inaugurated a search for consensus
on how to work together to release the productive energies of our
peoples.
   And today, gross national products are growing, as are
employment numbers and real personal incomes.
   Our economic expansion in the United States got the ball rolling
and helped crystalize the new consensus.
   And now, everyone is part of the act.
   To take another example, in our 1986 Tokyo economic communique,
we said: There should be close and continuous coordination of
economic policy among the seven summit countries.
   Today, policy coordination is a major pillar of the economic
policies of all our countries.
   It's a significant reason why the world market in stabilizes of
last October _ or instabilities, I should say _ of last October had
so little impact on our underlying economies.
   The summit in Tokyo gave the political push that ensured that
the fledgling process of coordination grew strong and robust.
   So here we are, celebrating this summit with a measure of pride.
   Some significant items are still in need of attention, but all
in all, how things have changed over the years.
   The economies of the summit countries have come roaring back,
driven by a common commitment to replace government control with
market-oriented policies.
   These summits are building blocks for tomorrow.
   Goals we set in earlier years have borne fruit.
   I believe that the goals we're setting now will become the
landmarks for the future.

   Shortly before 10 a.m., Toni Kurasch spread her
blanket on the Great Lawn in Central Park and plopped a
hand-lettered sign on it reading ``Beware of Dog.''
   Nine hours later, no dog had appeared, but Ms. Kurasch's sign
had served its purpose _ safeguarding her spot in front of an
estimated 150,000 other picnicking music lovers who thronged to
Tuesday night's free concert by the Metropolitan Opera.
   The work being performed, Donizetti's ``Elixir of Love,'' seemed
incidental for most of the crowd to the main attraction, a chance
to hear tenor Luciano Pavarotti and soprano Kathleen Battle.
   Luckily, both were in top form, which means they sang about as
well as any two singers alive are capable of singing.
   ``It's great they've managed to assemble such an array of
talent,'' said Jane Sternsnyder, who came from Philadelphia for the
event. ``One doesn't sit in this heat for no reason.''
   That was at noon, nearly three hours before the temperature
peaked at a withering 97 degrees. At performance time, the sun was
still blazing enough for Parks Commissioner Henry Stern to joke
that the audience could get ``both an opera and a suntan.''
   But as the sun went down, the music took hold of the crowd,
which spread back the length of several football fields from the
portable stage and two 40-foot amplifiers. Even from the far edge
of the lawn, the singers came through clearly, though they looked
no bigger than ants.
   Up close, Pavarotti & Co. were almost as much fun to watch as to
hear, using broad gestures and facial expressions to get across the
comic action. Outstanding in this respect was baritone Giuseppe
Taddei, whose infectious enthusiasm brought Dr. Dulcamara, the love
potion peddler, vividly to life.
   Pavarotti has always had a special fondness for the part of the
bumbling, lovestruck Nemorino, and he sang with more ease and
elegance than he sometimes musters these days. His rendition of the
famous aria ``Una furtiva lagrima'' brought such an ovation that he
responded with an encore, something that's strictly taboo at the
indoor Met.
   As for Miss Battle in the role of Adina, she poured out delicate
tones of unmatched beauty all night, earning an encore of her own
near the finale.
   Paolo Coni, a baritone who will make his official debut with the
Met next season, displayed a vibrant, powerful sound as Sergeant
Belcore, and soprano Dawn Kotoski was excellent in the small part
of Giannetta. Conductor Marcello Panni led a spirited performance
in his American debut.
   Crowd estimates are notoriously unreliable, but Met spokeswoman
Johanna Fiedler said she figured the attendance at about 150,000,
compared with the previous record of 100,000 for an opera in the
park.
   The performance kicked off the Met's 22nd season of free opera
in the park, a nearly $2 million endeavor whose major sponsor is
Chemical Bank. The opera company visits each of New York City's
five boroughs, Long Island and New Jersey, though the all-star cast
sang only on opening night.
   Opera lovers who missed Pavarotti and Miss Battle can catch them
in ``Elixir'' at the Met next season. The acoustics will be better,
but you'll pay for it _ up to $90 for the best orchestra seats.

<HEAD>TORONTO: the future.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Looking back at how much has been achieved since the last time
the summit was in Canada, is it any wonder that our seven free,
democratic, industrialized nations are turning with confidence to
the future, to the challenges and opportunities that new
technology, more closely-knit global markets, and a free world will
bring on, and are working together?
   During our meetings here, we discussed the international
economic and political situation.
   We reviewed the economic policy coordination process; the world
debt situation, particularly that of the poorer countries; the
state of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, particularly in
agriculture; and international cooperation to stop the production
and flow of illegal drugs.
   We also had a fruitful exchange of views on East-West relations,
terrorism, and regional political issues.
   Yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Mulroney organized an
informal session where leaders shared their thoughts on the
economic future of the summit countries.
   In that session, I said that I believed that the expansion of
global markets, and the enormous technological advances that are
coming in the years ahead, will demand even closer coordination of
economic policies.
   All of our economies must be flexible and open, not burdened by
excessive regulations, high taxes, and all the other rigidities
that too many economies have known too well.
   Last night, my colleagues and I spoke of the future, of the
education of our children, of assisting those displaced by the
rapid pace of economic change _ most notably our farmers _ of
removing structural impediments in our economies so that we're all
flexible enough to meet the challenges of the rapid technological
changes and economic integration that is the hallmark of the future.
   The summit nations can be partners in a great venture to
progress.
   Yes, we can seize our opportunities or we can watch the world go
by.
   I'm confident which path our nations will choose.
   As I said before leaving Washington, the future belongs to the
flexible.
   Eight years ago, you'd have heard arguments about that; today it
defines the consensus among the seven nations that meet at these
economic summits.
   And finally, in closing, let me say thank you to the people of
Toronto, and to Prime Minister Mulroney for hosting us with such
courtesy and enthusiasm.
   They made all of us in the American delegation _ and I'm
confident those in other delegations as well _ feel right at home.
   After just three days here, we share one common sentiment: We
love Canada.
   So thank you.
   And Terry, tee-off.

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President, I want to ask you about the investigation of
corruption at the Pentagon. Caspar Weinberger, your former defense
secretary, says that perhaps the Defense Department wasn't as
vigilant as it should have been. Do you share any responsibility
for that, sir, or feel any sense of failure or disappointment?
   A. Well, I think all of us are disappointed and upset that such
a thing could happen.
   I think that Cap Weinberger was just being _ or trying to join
in here.
   I think he was one of the finest secretaries of defense this
country has had, and I think he was doing all that he could to
bring a national security out of chaos, the kind that we inherited.
   For him to take some responsibility _ of course he was heading
up there, and I suppose I could do the same thing _ except that you
have to look at what is being unveiled here, that one tip came from
one individual, and immediately the naval intelligence _ or
investigative unit began an investigation based on that single tip,
and then called for help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
   They joined in, and for two years they've been tracking this
down to finally the place where they have come to the point in
which they feel they can serve indictments.
   And I have to say that I think that it should be understandable
how such things can happen in something as big as our government is.
   But I think we also ought to recognize that within our
government _ and the minute there was one tip of something of that
nature was going on, it was the units to which we entrust such
things _ the _ this naval unit and the FBI that set to work, and
now is ready to act.
   Q. But how much ammunition do you think that this gives Michael
Dukakis on the so-called sleaze factor?
   A. I don't think it really gives him any at all.
   I don't think this is a case at _ apparently at high levels.
   I think the very fact that it was investigated _ let me just
point something out _ there's almost an accusation in the fact of
why didn't some of us know?
   I think the tip that came, and the investigation that was
started, reflected that there wasn't anyone, up to and including
me, that the investigators could feel free to inform of this.
   They had no idea where this leveled off, or how far it went, or
how high it went.
   So they set out keeping their own decisions to themselves and
investigated.
   And now they have come forth with this and some of us have been
notified now about what was going on, but I think they were proper,
the danger of leaks and everything else, and not knowing where this
investigation might take them, to do just as they did.

   Q. Mr. President, you didn't know about the diversion of funds,
you say, in the Iran-Contra scandal. Weinberger doesn't know about
all of this alleged rampant bribery, fraud. Who is in charge? I
mean, where does the buck stop? Why aren't you accountable to the
public trust? And I'd like to follow up.
   A. We are accountable.
   On the other hand, I think there's some things that you can see
in something as complex as that whole process and the number of
corporations and all.
   Corporate heads probably are surprised at what they're learning
also.
   Because you can't be down there watching several million people
in the total of all of the companies and of the Defense Department
every day and what they're doing, or what phone calls they're
making.
   And I'm quite sure that no one would think that we should be
tapping all of those phones and listening in on conversations of
everybody just on the suspicion that someone might be out of line.
   Q. Mr. President, in terms of the scandals, Senator Mitchell has
asked that _ specifically that you not pardon Colonel North and
Admiral Poindexter before they are tried, because he said that
otherwise there might be a perception of purchasing silence. Are
you willing to give that commitment?
   A. Well, I have said already that while I don't think that those
men were guilty of any law-breaking of any kind, but, of course,
the case should _ has to go forward, or they would live the rest of
their lives under a shadow of guilt.
   So I have no intention of _
   Now, wait a minute.
   Let me move back for some of our visitors.
   Q. Mr. President, do you plan a visit to the areas of the
country that have been afflicted by the drought and recognize _
this is about the drought. Do you plan a visit to the drought area
of the country, Sir? And recognizing that your interagency
committee on the drought has not made its report, could you give us
an idea of what specific steps you are considering to help the
farmers in view of the drought?
   A. Oh. Well, here we _ secretary of agriculture has taken his
place and we have a task force out there taking a look, a firsthand
look at the situation.
   And we're going to have to see what we can do.
   We don't underestimate the seriousness of this at all.
   And I'm here in this summit.
   They're out there finding out.
   And outside of praying for rain, there isn't anything I can do
until we here from them.
   Q. Mr. President, if I may follow up, sir. Are you planning to
visit the drought area yourself and take a firsthand look yourself?

   A. That's going to depend on whether the task force sees that
there might be any value in doing that.
   Chris?
   Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You suggested the other day, and
you seem to be suggesting today, that the Pentagon scandal is just
a case of a few people gone wrong. But in fact, there are 200
subpoenas out on this case, a number of the top procurement
officers at the Pentagon are under investigation, and so are almost
all of the top defense contractors. Isn't the greater likelihood
that this is a very widespread scandal?
   A. Oh, listen!
   I'm aware of the numbers, and I _ if I gave that impression that
this is minor in some way, not at all.
   I don't feel that way at all.
   As a matter of fact, I'm very upset.
   The only thing I'm calling attention to is that that same _ that
same department, the Department of Defense, is the one that
uncovered and then proceeded to investigate and pin down where
there was guilt.
   But we now have to wait and find out under the due process of
law that it definitely is guilt on individuals' part.
   There may be some people that are falsely suspected, and we
should know that, too.
   But no, I'm not taking this lightly at all, but I do think that
you all ought to call _ you all ought to pay attention to the fact
that it wasn't an outside investigation.
   Q. If I may follow up, sir, it's been suggested that contracts
with some of these defense contractors may have to be suspended
until the investigation proves out. Are you concerned about the
impact on the national security, either in terms of slowing down
the defense build-up or the further erosion of support for your
defense build-up?
   A. Well, I'm concerned about any _ or anything that affects our
national security.
   At the same time, however, I recognize that we have established
a national security system that we didn't have a few years ago, and
that we have produced enough strength that resulted in things like
the INF treaty with a potential adversary, the Soviet Union, and
that has to be taken into account, too.
   But I haven't seen any _ we can't judge yet whether there's
something specific in all of these things that might have in some
way lessened our _ the recovery of our defensive strength.
   I'm looking for somebody from the local press, and then I'll
come back down front.
   Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the savings and loan
industry. This year, there were record losses in the industry.
Close to $4 billion has been spent bailing out savings and loans.
It's estimated that it will take $75 billion to get it on its feet.
Is there a crisis in the savings and loan industry, and will the
American taxpayer have to bail it out?

   A. Well, I certainly hope not, and I don't think so, and I don't
believe there's a crisis.
   The market today went up 25 points, and our growth is still
continuing, and there's no sign of inflation, and things of that
kind or panic.
   But yes, there is a problem there and we're trying to deal with
the problem.
   Sam?
   Q. Mr. President, recently Washington columnist Carl Rowan
beieved he was threatened by people in his backyard. He took a gun,
which was unregistered, and he shot _ he said, as a warning shot. A
young man was nicked in the wrist. Do you think it's a good idea
for citizens to have guns in their home, and to go out and use them
if they feel threatened?
   A. Well, Sam, as I understand it, what Carl was saying was that
his son, who was entitled to have a gun, left that gun there, and
it was a registered gun with regard to his son.
   On the other hand, I try to keep thinking this was 2 o'clock in
the morning, someone is coming toward him.
   He had that _ but you asked a question in general, not just
about him.
   You asked whether people should have _
   Sam, I going to answer by way of a letter, a very interesting
letter that I received when I was governor of California.
   It came from a burglar who was serving time in San Quentin
Prison.
   And there was a big movement on in California at that time, as
there continually is every place to eliminate the citizens having
weapons.
   And this burglar _ prisoner wrote to me and said, ``I just want
to tell that if that goes through _ that law, there will be
hundreds of very happy people here in San Quentin.''
   He said, ``We case a place that we've planned for robbery or
burglary. We get to know the habits of the people, and their
comings and goings, and so forth.''
   But he said, ``The one thing we never can know in advance is in
that household, in a drawer by the bed, does the householder have a
gun.''
   And he said, ``If you can ever tell us that none of them do _
that they don't have them, then I can assure you that all of us
burglars are going to be very happy.''
   I think we ought to pay heed to that.
   Q. But, sir, is it worth it? Statistics show that when
homeowners or citizens use handguns, normally they shoot
themselves, their loved ones, or strangers who are not engaged in a
criminal act, by mistake. Is it worth all these lives in order to
attempt to try to shoot one burglar?

<HEAD>TORONTO: one burglar?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. Well, Sam, I'll tell you.
   There's some certain things that I would go for.
   For example, in California, for a citizen to buy a gun, that
citizen has to come in, lay down the money of course, name,
address, and so forth.
   And then doesn't get the gun.
   And this goes to an agency in the state government that looks
into that person's entire background as to who and what they are.
   And then they come back, after that investigation, and if they
don't have a record of any crimes or mental problems, or anything
of that kind, they are allowed to take their gun home.
   Now, I would like to see that generally _ I think that all
states ought to take a look at that system.
   But, in addition, I think that maybe we could tie to that,
making sure that they aren't just totally absent of any knowledge
of weapons.
   I taught my entire family out at the ranch how to shoot a gun in
case they ever had to.
   And I think maybe there could be some restrictions that there
had to be a certain amount of training taken.
   Now let me _ no, no, here, and then back to you. No, no _ you
get up _ yes, and then yes, and then I'll take him.
   Q. My name is Jerry O'Leary and I'm _
   A. I know Jerry.
   Q. Mr. President, have you give up on doing anything forceful
about the continuing chaos in Panama and Nicaragua, and now, once
again, in Haiti, since you have not used up all of your options,
including the option of military force? And is there any prospect
at all in the rest of your administration for resuming military
assistance to the resistance fighters?
   A. Well, Jerry, on the first thing _ of Panama, I have to say to
you that there are many things I can't comment _ we still have some
of our economic measures in place.
   We still feel, as we always did, that a military dictatorship in
Panama under General Noriega is not what we want to see continue.
   But I can't speculate or even hint at what might be options that
are being considered or anything of that kind, because I just don't
_ I don't think it would be suitable and I don't think it would be
helpful.
   But we have not changed our minds about the fact that Panama
should return to a civilian democracy.
   Q. This is very short indeed. What did you mean when you said
today, when you were asked if Mr. Dukakis would win, and you said,
``over my live body?''
   A. Well, because the old expression is, ``my dead body,'' and I
wouldn't somebody to take me up on that.
   The gentleman back there.
   Q. If I could ask briefly about the economic summit _ the
communique _
   A. I was all set for that, too.

<TEXT>
   Q. The communique praises the Canadian-American free trade deal.
If, for whatever reason, the deal doesn't go through, what would
that do to Canadian-American relations?
   A. Well, I certainly don't think it would change the
relationship that the prime minister and I have, and I also don't
think that it would do away with the friendship that exists between
Americans and Canadians.
   We're pretty unique in the world, there's no place quite like _
well, there isn't any place like this. Five thousand miles of
border, as your prime minister has said, without a loaded gun along
that border.
   I think we're very, very proud of that.
   And I've had an idea here, I know that in your Parliament there
are critics, there are in our Congress, and I've had it figured out
that if I could get what the critics in the Parliament are saying
about maybe this bill favoring the United States and take it down
and show it to our Congress, and in turn send what our Congress are
saying about this favoring Canada up here to the Parliament, I
think it would be passed in a minute and a half.
   And _ I'm not going to do that, but I'm optimistic, I'm
optimistic that we can get it.
   And it will be, I think, it will have an effect on the entire
trade of the world.
   We are the two biggest trading partners in the world.
   And for us to establish the biggest free trading area in the
world is right in keeping with all the things that we've been doing.
   Bill?
   Q. Mr. President, during the Iran-Contra scandal, America
learned that there were people in the White House making foreign
policy, in effect, without your knowledge and that of some of your
other senior officials. Now we have the situation in the Pentagon,
sir, where there is apparently a burgeoning scandal which happened
without the knowledge of you or your secretary of defense.
Reflecting on this, sir, have you thought that you might have
changed your style of management? Would you wish to have had a more
hands-on approach now that you're at the end of your term? Would
that have changed things? Would it have helped?
   A. I don't think it would have changed anything in this present
situation at all.
   I don't think there's any way that anyone at higher levels could
have had access to this information or what was going on.
   With regard to the Iran and Contra _ Contra affair, I would just
like _ I haven't had a chance to do this for a long time, I'd like
to remind you all that I'm the one who told all of you of what had
just been discovered.
   And it was discovered after the leak came out of a newspaper in
Lebanon, charging the trading of hostages for arms, and that I was
dealing with the ayatollah.

<HEAD>TORONTO: the ayatollah.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Let me say with great emphasis and to all the rest of you who
aren't as close to Washington as some of the people here, there's
no scandal, we were not doing business with the ayatollah.
   We were keeping the operation covert because, by way of a third
country, some individuals from Iran who were heeding the warnings
that we were being given at about that time that the ayatollah
might not live out the week, and there was factionalism rising as
to who was going to have to do with the new government.
   These individuals were _ we were assured, were pretty
responsible by that third country, which was much closer to the
situation _ and they wanted to meet to discuss with us what might
be the future relations between our two countries when the
ayatollah was gone, and I sent a team.
   Now, you couldn't send the secretary of state or people of that
kind there because it wouldn't be covert any longer _ they're
recognizable.
   I don't mean that he'd tell _ he's just _ you know, he can't be
anonymous anymore, or people like him.
   But anyway, we sent them there to make contact.
   And now, back came this request from them, that what it would do
for them in the event of forming a new government and so forth, a
more or less ``token shipment'' of a type of weapon.
   We _ I sent word back that we didn't do business with countries
that supported terrorism.
   Well, they sent back reminding us that they weren't representing
the country, they weren't that government, and they wouldn't if
they were to be a government, they wouldn't do these things.
   And so, then was when I sent word back and said, ``Well, all
right. But, I know that there are connections in Iran with the
Hezbollah who are holding American hostages. Now, we'll do this if
you will use your influence, if you have any, to see if you can get
our hostages back.''
   And they said, ``Yes.''
   Well, they got two of them back, and we were supposed to get two
more within 48 hours.
   Now, all of this I told to you when, after it broke and the news
had broken that we were doing this, the _ our own investigation
began and we found one memorandum that indicated that there was
more money than we had received for our weapons.
   We got the money that we had coming to us, but suddenly, we had
_ and I told you that, and that we were trying to find out, and
that I was appointing a commission under secretary _ or under
Senator Tower, to find out how could there be additional money
there.
   And after all the months of investigation by the Congress, I
still haven't found out how there was extra money.

<TEXT>
   Q. Well, sir, if you had kept a tighter rein on what was going
on, and inquired more closely into what was happening in this and
in other situations, might it not have happened?
   A. I don't see how I could have, without endangering the people
we were doing business with.
   If they were identified, they were, they could be executed.
   They weren't representing the government.
   And to tell you the truth, I don't know whether they're alive
today.
   And as a matter of fact, when this all broke, one of our
hostages had just been released _ Jacobsen.
   And he pled with you one day out in the Rose Garden at that time
to please not talk about this because we could get some people
killed.
   Q. Mr. President, but in this case, you have said that Cap
Weinberger helped take the national security out of chaos. Can you
really disagree with both Republicans and Democrats who are saying
that your administration threw so much money at the Pentagon, and
hired people to manage it who were hired for their conservative
values rather than their management skills. And that in this
administration, there was a different structural approach to
controlling the spending of these billions of dollars?
   A. No, I don't believe that or agree with it, and they were
appointed because of their business skill.
   I'd made statements many times during the campaign that I didn't
want people that were out looking for a job in government.
   I wanted people that would make a sacrifice to work for
government, and I'd then take them for as long as they _ as they
could stay there.
   And this, we did.
   But with regard to throwing this money at the Pentagon, I'd like
to call your attention to something.
   When I took office, on any given day, 50 percent of our military
planes couldn't take off for lack of spare parts and fuel, half of
our naval vessels couldn't leave port for the same reason or, in
addition, a lack of crew.
   I had promised during the campaign, in answer to questions from
just people in audiences over and over again, that with regard to
deficit spending and all, where did this figure, the military thing.
   And I said if it comes to a choice, the prime responsibility of
government is the defense of the nation.
   I have to do that.
   But I would like to call attention to this fact.

<HEAD>PACs Building Up Warchests For Fall Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political action committees bankrolled by
members of special interest groups are building up their war chests
for the fall elections, with the Teamsters' and Realtors' PACs each
contributing close to $1 million to federal candidates so far.
   Five of the more than 4,000 PACs registered with the Federal
Election Commission each had more than $2 million in cash on hand
at the beginning of April, an FEC summary released Tuesday showed.
   Together, the registered PACs raised more than $213 million in
the 15 months ending March 31, up 7 percent from the same period in
1986. They had spent $162 million, up 8.4 percent from spending at
that point in the last election cycle, the FEC said.
   Labor unions and corporations are prohibited by law from giving
money to federal campaigns, so many set up PACs to which their
employees and others can give money voluntarily. Politicians and
interest groups also form PACs to promote their own interests.
   The Teamsters PAC, called Democratic Republican Independent
Voter Education Committee, raised the most during the 15-month
period, $5.5 million, followed by the American Medical Association
PAC at just under $4 million, and the Realtors Political Action
Committee at $3.7 million.
   Federal law allows PACs to give no more than $5,000 to each
candidate per election, compared to the $1,000 limit on
contributions by individuals.
   The Teamsters and Realtors PACs each reported giving close to $1
million to federal candidates, but the AMA PAC was 10th on the list
of most contributions, giving $585,946, the summary said.
   In cash on hand, the Teamster PAC had the most, $4.5 million,
followed by: the International Longshoremen's Association AFL-CIO
PAC, $2.7 million; the National Education Association PAC, at $2.3
million; the Auto Dealers and Drivers For Free Trade PAC, $2.3
million; and the Realtors PAC, $2.1 million.
   The PACs that raise the most do not necessarily give the most
donations to candidates, with money often going to a variety of
fund-raising and overhead costs.
   The FEC summary did not reflect any money the PACs might have
spent on so-called independent expenditures. Such expenditures do
not come under the $5,000 limit as long as the money is spent to
support or oppose a candidate but without coordination with the
candidate's campaign.
   Besides the Teamsters, AMA and Realtors PACs, those that raised
the most through March 31, followed by the sums they have
contributed to candidates were:
   _The National Congressional Club, founded by supporters of
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in North Carolina, $2.7 million raised,
$47,032 in contributions.
   _Auto Dealers and Drivers For Free Trade PAC, a Jamaica,
N.Y.-based committee funded significantly with money from imported
and domestic car dealers, $2.7 million, $377,650.
   _Campaign America, founded by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., $2.6
million, $59,350.
   _American Citizens for Political Action, a committee founded by
former Young Americans For Freedom chairman Robert Dolan which has
given to a variety of conservative candidates, $2.4 million,
$35,650.
   _League of Conservation Voters, an environmentally oriented
group, $2.4 million, less than $30,000.
   _National Education Association Political Action Committee, $2.3
million, $697,587.
   _Association of Trial Lawyers Political Action Committee, $2.2
million, $722,658.
   The PAC founded by Vice President George Bush, Fund For
America's Future, raised $1.7 million, and spent a total of $1.5
million, but less than $20,000 of that went to federal campaigns.
   Critics of the PAC system contend that PAC spending allows for
too much special interest influence in politics. The Center For
Responsive Politics conducted a survey that found PACs give money
expecting that it will buy them access to politicians.

<TEXT>
   President Carter evidently realized the situation before he left
office.
   And, as you know, a president leaving office gives you a
five-year projection of his plan _ what his budget _ my _ the first
budget when I came in was passed by the previous president _ but
then, where it goes.
   We have not yet spent as much money on defense as he had
advocated should be spent for the next five years.
   Q. Sir, how do you feel about the fact that, even though you
pride yourself on cutting government spending and regulations, that
the legacy you may well leave is a counterreaction, where there is
an erosion of public support for defense spending, and a public
reaction that actually hurts, rather than helps, national security?
   A. Well, you're just saying some things that _ I don't know how
I would answer that, but I think, if people will listen and get the
explanation and exactly what the situation was and wait until all
the facts are in, for example, on this particular investigation,
that _ I don't think that they will find that we were derelict in
our duty.
   No, there's a young lady _ there.
   Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Was there any concern when you met
with summit leaders this week, that higher interest rates in the
United States would push the dollar too high?
   A. I don't recall any conversation of that kind.
   We were _ we _ all of us have been feeling pretty confident of
what we're doing and the stability we have. And _
   Q. The dollar is on the right track?
   A. I think we have stability right now.
   And I'm afraid to look at Jim Baker because I might find myself
asking him to answer the question for you.
   Q. Mr. President, what do you really think you've achieved, in
terms of drug interdiction here? How many drug traffickers are
going to be apprehended as a result of these deliberations?
   A. Well, more have been apprehended in this past year or so than
ever before.
   And more thousands of _ literally tons of illegal drugs seized,
more airplanes, more ships, more trucks and automobiles, and more
money has been seized than ever before.
   But we have come to the conclusion, with boundaries like ours
and coastlines like ours, the only answer that is ever going to win
this war for us _ we keep this up, we keep doing that, of course.
   But, the real answer is going to be a bigger effort at taking
the customer away from the drugs.
   That's why we're going to implement all the programs we can
about appealing to the people and getting former drugs addicts who
are _ many of them in the entertainment world and the athletic
world, are doing more than their duty to speak to young people
about their ex- _ they're ex-addicts and about this.
   But that is going to be the only way we can really succeed.
   But we have stepped up this interception thing, and I think more
than has ever been intercepted before.

   Q. Is the course a bit bilateral arrangements rather than
multinational, do you think?
   A. Oh! Well _ oh, you were talking about the summit and our _
all the _ listen, we are all in agreement here.
   And I think we've _ we've discussed this today and we thought of
a number things.
   And they're going to be _ we're going to be working on this and

to do such things as tracking money and interfering with the
laundering of illegal drug money, and so forth.

   There's no question about that.

   A. But wait a minute, before all the hands _
   Helen is in charge, and she tells me I've used up all my time.
   I can't do it.
   So, I'm sorry.

   Q. But _ (inaudible) _ talk to you about Haiti yet this week _
(inaudible) _
   Q. Have you found our anything more about the situation there?

<HEAD>REAGAN NEWS CONFERENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In a prepared statement, Reagan retraced the eight summits, said
he was satisfied with the economic prosperity and revitalization
that has been achieved through cooperation in the Western states.
He said however, some ``items are still in needs of attention.''
   Answering questions from reporters, primarily on domestic issues:
   He said he was ``very upset'' about alleged widespread bribery
and fraud in the Defense Department's procurement process but said
it would be ``understandable'' considering the size of the
government. He praised former Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger as ``one of the finest secretaries of defense this
country has had'' who ``was doing all that he cold to bring our
national security out of the kind of chaos that we inherited.''
   On the Iran-Contra situation and possible pardons for former
administration officials he said, ``Of course the case has to go
forward.'' He also defended his management style and the
administration's handling of the situation.
   On gun control he said he had taught everyone in his family to
how to use a gun ``in case they need to.'' He also proposed state
governments conduct background checks on all gun purchasers.
   On the drought plaguing much of the country, he said ``Outside
of praying for rain, there isn't anything I can do.''

   Western leaders praised Reagan throughout the 3-day meeting.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, speaking on behalf of
the leaders said, ``Ronald Reagan has been for all of us at this
table a gracious friend and a trusted ally. We shall all miss his
warmth and his wisdom.''
   Mulroney said the Reagan's ``leadership has been strong, his
accomplishments substantial and his place in history secure.''
   The summit host said the leaders wished ``for good health and
every happiness for Nancy and himself.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared she had only
``kind words'' for Reagan, adding, ``He's been marvelous.''
   She echoed Mulroney's tribute saying each of the leaders had
``the whole-hearted support and affection for President Reagan and
what he has done.''

<BYLINE>REAGAN'S FAREWELL SPEECH TO SUMMIT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan's farewell to the leaders of the Western democracies came
in a speech to a group of Canadian businessmen.
   He warned them that ``protectionist storms'' are brewing around
the world.
   He told them they had a choice ``between moving toward freer
trade, or backward toward the protection and isolation that are
relics of another age'' and urged them to follow the example set by
the United States and Canada. ``We North Americans never have. We
have always risen to meet a challenge. Our hearts quicken to the
call, our eyes brighten, our pace picks up,'' he said.
   Reagan praised the economic progress he had seen take place in
the Western states during his tenure. ``Inflation, stagnation,
decline and despair characterized, in one measure or another, the
economies of nearly all the summit nations. Today, we live in a
time of hope.''
   He also said there was hope for the reform going on in the
Soviet Union, calling Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``a
serious man seeking serious reform.''

   A disinfectant used to temper a strong odor
of spilled ant repellant unleashed noxious fumes that forced the
evacuation Tuesday of a shopping center, authorities said.
   At least 50 employees and customers of the Jamesway department
store in Greenport were treated and released at Columbia-Greene
Medical Center and one person was admitted, said Deputy Reggie
Crowley of the Columbia County Sheriff's Department.
   Most of the people were treated for minor breathing problems and
eye irritation, said Anne Grebert, a hospital spokeswoman. One
person was held overnight for observation, she said.
   After an 8-ounce bottle of ant repellant was spilled in the
store, employees sprayed about a half-dozen cans of Lysol
disinfectant to mask the strong odor, Crowley said.
   The mixture produced fumes that forced the evacuation of the
store and later the Jamesway shopping plaza, including about 12
other stores, Crowley said.
   He said that a hazardous waste cleanup team would inspect the
site, about 30 miles south of Albany, before the stores reopened.

   Likely Republican presidential nominee
George Bush faces a ``political dust bowl'' in the Midwest that is
worsening with this year's drought, some Democratic and GOP
observers say.
   ``It's true that farmers, when they're out of sorts for any
reason, vote against the party in power,'' said Lawrence Pope, a
Drake University law professor and GOP strategist.
   ``I think that what Republican legislative and congressional
candidates are worried about right now is that does begin to affect
those other races,'' Pope said Tuesday. ``Republicans are going to
be nervous about a Bush candidacy in Iowa right now.''
   Phil Roeder, spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party, pointed to
growing Democratic strength in the region, demonstrated by the
party's capture of Senate seats in Iowa and Illinois in 1984 and in
the Dakotas in 1986.
   ``There's clearly a Democratic seed growing out here,'' Roeder
said. ``With that on top of drought, it's not only going to be a
literal dust bowl, it's going to be a political dust bowl for
Bush.''
   Republican politicians have been nervous about the impact Bush
will have on other races, and their confidence wasn't helped by a
poll in Sunday's Des Moines Register showing him trailing likely
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis by a 60 percent to 28 percent
margin.
   ``When you're down that bad, you don't need more bad news,''
Pope said.
   Also reflecting the GOP nervousness was David Roederer, a
political aide to Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   ``If you have weak candidates at the presidential level, it's
bound to hurt,'' Roederer said. ``We're a long way from writing the
final chapter but this doesn't help.''
   Iowa Republican Chairman Michael Mahaffey put a better face on
the issue.
   ``I think Iowans are smart enough to realize that those are
things beyond a politician's control,'' he said. ``You can make an
argument that it's going to make people nervous.''
   Mahaffey said the GOP can recover even if the drought worsens if
the Reagan administration moves quickly with emergency aid programs.

   Michael Dukakis came away from a private
discussion with Jesse Jackson saying he has no short, medium or
long list of potential running mates but that the search is on for
someone ``first-rate.''
   Neither of the Democratic rivals would say whether Jackson asked
for the vice presidential slot during the 40-minute meeting Tuesday.
   Dukakis said he wouldn't discuss his private conversation with
Jackson, but added that ``there's no understanding'' with Jackson
over the selection of a running mate.
   ``The process has now begun. But it's open,'' Dukakis said.
``There's no short list, or medium list or long list.''
   Meanwhile, sources in Washington who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Tuesday that Dukakis' campaign has requested
background information from Jackson and at least one other possible
running-mate, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida.
   Dukakis also is conducting public polling to assess the strength
of potential Democratic vice presidential candidates, the sources
said.
   Dukakis, who has more than enough delegates to clinch the
presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention next
month, replied indirectly when asked if he were using polling to
help him pick a running mate.
   ``I don't think this is a decision that is helped particularly
by a lot of polling,'' he said.
   ``This is one where you're looking for presidential qualities,
for a person to be a first-rate president, who can bring real
strength not only to the ticket but to government and the nation.
And those are things you really don't poll for,'' he added.
   At a news conference following the Dukakis-Jackson meeting,
Jackson repeated his assertion that his ``constituency deserves
consideration'' in the selection of the Democratic vice
presidential nominee.
   ``Our constituency represents hope for our party. It represents
a commitment to make room for all Democrats,'' Jackson said.
   But asked whether he told Dukakis that he wanted to be on the
ticket, Jackson said, ``I'm not going to characterize exactly what
we discussed.''
   Jackson said that during the meeting, the two discussed the vice
presidency ``more than we have talked about it (before) person to
person.''
   Dukakis and Jackson met following Dukakis' address to more than
3,500 members of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees. Jackson was to address the same group today.
   Dukakis used his appearance before the group to renew his call
for a national health insurance program, patterned after
legislation he signed in Massachusetts.
   Affordable health care ``is the birthright of every family and
every citizen of the United States of America,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Two months ago, ... I became the first governor in America to
sign a bill that will guarantee health insurance for every single
citizen in my state,'' Dukakis said. ``And I look forward to the
day I can sign the same kind of bill into law for all Americans _
as president of the United States.''

<HEAD>Contras To Lay Off Staff, Cut Expenses, Spokeswoman Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Contras will lay off administrative staff and
sharply cut expenses at the end of June, a spokeswoman for the
Nicaraguan rebels said late Tuesday.
   But the budget squeeze will not affect troops in the field or
support received by their families, said spokeswoman Marta Sacasa.
   ``We are not closing _ it's just a matter of trying to function
with less cost,'' she said.
   Deep cuts are expected in the staff at the Miami headquarters
and other Contra political offices around the world, although some
employees may continue as unpaid volunteers.
   ``By the 30th, I understand nobody is sure who will continue
working,'' Ms. Sacasa said, adding that the directors have not
announced the extent of the layoffs or the ``restructuring'' that
will accompany them.
   The New York Times in Wednesday's editions quoted Silvio
Arguello Cardenal, vice president of the Contra legislative
assembly, as saying layoff notices have already been mailed to 350
to 400 employees in the Contra offices in Miami, Washington, Latin
America and Europe.
   Ms. Sacasa said that to her knowledge none of the employees had
received the official notice by Tuesday. She said directors would
do their best to ensure none of the employees would be ``out on the
street.''
   The layoffs are part of a top-to-bottom reorganization, she said.
   ``We're giving the directors the freedom to do what has to be
done to be more productive,'' she said.
   She denied the cutbacks were directly related to Congress'
refusal to back the administration's full budget request for the
Contras this year.
   The rebel political staff has had exceptionally high expenses so
far this year, in part because of trips back and forth to Central
America to negotiate a truce with Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   In March, Congress approved $47.9 million in Contra aid but
limited it to humanitarian applications, and although the Reagan
administration is expected to ask for more money, legislative
leaders give new funding little chance.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Summit Brings Reagan to Twilight of His
Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, his last economic summit not
quite the success he had hoped for, heads into the twilight of his
administration with only the slim prospect of another session with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to keep him on center stage in
the international arena.
   There was considerable praise for Reagan in Toronto, most of it
in the form of a personal tribute. In his best aw-shucks manner,
Reagan admitted he would miss the glitter and ceremony ``in a way.''
   With only seven months to go, and a long summer vacation ahead,
Reagan is entering lame-duck status and his foreign policy
objectives are nearing a dead end.
   Negotiations with the Soviet Union to sharply reduce long-range
nuclear weapons have encountered problems with verification and the
Kremlin's continued objections to his search for a space-based
defense against ballistic missiles.
   But talks are continuing in Geneva, and neither Reagan nor
Gorbachev has ruled out the possibility of a fifth superpower
summit if a deal is struck. Most analysts, however, believe the
chances of that happening are remote.
   In the Middle East, where Reagan's economic summit partners
called for a peace conference, his envoy, Secretary of State George
P. Shultz, has been unable to nudge Jordan's King Hussein and
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to the negotiating table.
   On Reagan's agenda in the coming months are vacations at his
California ranch in both July and August and campaign forays on
behalf of his vice president, George Bush.
   And so for Reagan, the three-day Toronto meeting might just be
his last hurrah.
   ``The summit punctuated the success of the president's economic
program over the last seven years,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White
House spokesman, enthused in a windup statement.
   The facts, however, suggested a more mixed performance.
   For instance, Reagan's proposal to end all agricultural
subsidies by the year 2000 fell on deaf ears.
   France's Socialist President Francois Mitterrand challenged
Reagan's unfettered faith in the free market. And on helping
debt-ridden countries, the best Reagan could manage was a
compromise formula that really was no decision at all.
   And then there were those persistent Washington reporters who
peppered Reagan with questions at a pre-departure news conference
about a spreading Pentagon bribery investigation and the
Iran-Contra affair.
   These are not the kind of topics Reagan likes to discuss _ at
home or away.
   In fact, Reagan fielded only a few questions about the economic
meeting.
   He did receive a rousing tribute from the summit host, Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Reagan's closest ally, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. But even that was tempered
by Mitterrand.
   ``For someone who played a great role in contemporary history,
it's normal to salute him and wish that his retirement be happy and
long,'' the French president said. ``It's a courtesy. It has
nothing to do, I suppose, with politics.''

   David Cassidy, the squeaky-clean rocker of
``Partridge Family'' fame, has been sued by a woman who says the
actor fathered her 18-month-old daughter and refuses to pay child
support.
   Model-actress Sherry Williams, 35, says Cassidy, 38, is the
father of her daughter Katherine Evelyn Cassidy, according to the
paternity suit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. Lawyer
Marvin Mitchelson, best known for claiming ``palimony'' rights for
the live-in lovers of Hollywood celebrities, filed the lawsuit.
   The complaint seeks to establish paternity and asks for $5,000 a
month in child support and medical care.
   Cassidy, who is divorced, was in Europe and couldn't be reached
for comment, said his manager Melanie Green.
   Cassidy was 20 when he starred as the teen heartthrob on
``Partridge Family,'' which also starred his stepmother Shirley
Jones. He also turned out several records before returning to
acting on stage a decade later.

   A man who organized a protest against the
use of animal furs in the Miss USA contest says TV host Alan Thicke
reneged on an agreement to allow him to appear on Thicke's
children's show about animals.
   Bob Young, director of the Las Cruces, N.M., chapter of Sangre
de Cristo Animal Protection Inc., said he is disappointed that the
producers of ``Animal Crack-Ups'' decided not to invite him because
it could have been to controversial for the young audience.
   However, Thicke's spokesman, Steven Shorem, said Tuesday the
animal activist was trying to stir up waters that had just settled.
   ``This was resolved at the Miss USA pageant and unfortunately,
they're the ones who retracted the agreement,'' Shore said.
   Young later acknowledged that the producers' decision was moot,
because he had already been ordered by Sangre de Cristo not to
appear on the Saturday morning children's show.
   Sangre de Cristo protested the awarding of two mink coats to the
winner of the March 1 pageant and appealed to Thicke to pull out of
the nationally televised pageant. They pointed out that Thicke ends
each ``Animal Crack-Ups'' with the admonition to be kind to animals.

   Singer Mel Torme says it doesn't
bother him in the least that his new popularity is due in part to
the NBC comedy ``Night Court.''
   ``It is ironic that the younger people have learned about me
that way, but I'm grateful for it,'' said Torme, who is depicted as
the musical hero of the show's main character, Judge Harold T.
Stone, played by Harry Anderson.
   ``Any way you can be remembered, if it works, then it's
terrific. I'm delighted for what ``Night Court'' has done for me,''
he said recently.
   The 62-year-old entertainer, who has been performing since he
was 4, is preparing to release his autobiography, ``It Wasn't All
Velvet,'' and is working on a biography of the late jazz drummer
Buddy Rich.

<HEAD>Washington-to-Moscow Hotline Celebrates 25th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington-to-Moscow hotline has
helped cool tensions between the superpowers since its creation 25
years ago this week after the Cuban missile crisis put the United
States and Soviet Union on the brink of nuclear war.
   ``The best quote I've seen about it called it `an insurance
policy for peace,''' Norm Covert, a spokesman for Fort Detrick,
said Tuesday. ``I think it's the best description of the system and
why we have it.''
   Fort Detrick, an Army installation just north of Washington, was
made part of the hotline system in 1978. The communications line
was established June 20, 1963.
   The president has access to other forms of communication with
the Soviet Union, but the hotline provides a direct link between
the two heads of state, Covert said. The hotline, often used when
either country is planning military action in some part of the
world, provides a way for the leaders to communicate without going
through diplomatic channels.
   The hotline was established less than a year after tensions
mounted between the superpowers during the Cuban missile crisis.
   After learning the Soviet Union had missiles in Cuba capable of
striking U.S. cities, President John F. Kennedy set up a blockade
and ordered Navy ships to turn back all vessels delivering Soviet
missiles to Cuba. War seemed imminent for about a week, but the
Soviets eventually ordered offensive missiles removed and Kennedy
lifted the blockade.
   Soon after, Jess Gorkin, a senior editor for Parade Magazine,
wrote an open letter to Kennedy, suggesting that a communication
line be opened, allowing the two leaders to communicate directly,
without the chance for misinterpretation, Covert said. Kennedy
embraced the idea and the hotline was established in 1963.
   ``We don't know that he (President Reagan) uses it unless he
tells us,'' Covert said. ``I believe he said he used it just before
we invaded Grenada.''
   Unlike fictional descriptions of the hotline, a red telephone is
not part of the system. ``The only telephone there is the one the
technicians use,'' Covert said.
   Fort Detrick is one of two independent satellite stations in the
hotline network. The other is in Etam, W.Va., he said, adding that
communications technicians check the line with Moscow every hour.
The Soviet Union's satellite earth station is just south of Moscow.

   CBS slam-dunked two NBA finals games into the
top 10 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings last week and broke NBC's
six-week winning streak.
   But ``NBC Nightly News'' got out of third place in the news
ratings by eking out a tie for second in a dead heat that saw only
a tenth of a rating point separate the three network newscasts.
   For the week that ended Friday, the ``CBS Evening News'' had an
average rating of 8.5, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and NBC had 8.4
each. Each had a 19 share.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   Game five Thursday night in the National Basketball Association
championship series between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Detroit
Pistons was the week's fourth highest-ranked prime-time program,
with a rating of 16.0. Game four last Tuesday ranked ninth with a
14.8.
   CBS' rerun Sunday night of ``Intimate Strangers,'' starring Teri
Garr as a a female prisoner of war who returns home, won the night
and ranked seventh, even though it was up against an original
made-for-TV movie, ``A Father's Homecoming,'' on NBC.
   CBS' cult hit ``Wiseguy,'' was off to a good start in summer
reruns. The two-hour introductory episode ranked 20th.
   ABC's ``20-20'' tied for 20th with an installment that featured
Jane Fonda apologizing to Vietnam veterans for her trip to Hanoi to
protest the war.
   For the week that ended Sunday, CBS had an average, prime-time
rating of 11.8, NBC 11.0, and ABC 8.7. CBS pulled into a tie with
ABC for second place in season-to-date ratings, which stand at: NBC
15.4, CBS and ABC 13.0 each.
   The last time CBS won a week was the first week of May, when the
``Magnum, P.I.'' finale was the No. 1 show. CBS has also tied with
NBC for first one week.
   The top 10 prime-time shows of the week were: ``Night Court,''
``A Different World'' and ``Cheers,'' NBC; game five of the NBA
finals, CBS; ``Golden Girls,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``Intimate
Strangers,'' ``60 Minutes,'' game four of the NBA finals, CBS;
``L.A. Law,'' NBC.
   The lowest-rated shows were: ``TV's Bloopers and Practical
Jokes,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Charlie Brown Special,'' ``Highway to
Heaven,'' ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' ``Ohara,''
``Sledge Hammer!'' ``Our House,'' ``Double Agent, Part 1'' and
``Probe.''

   Rudolf Nureyev's version of ``Swan Lake,'' which
opened the Paris Opera Ballet's three-week season at the
Metropolitan Opera, is not the finest production of the well-known
ballet. Nor was Tuesday night's performance the best presentation.
   The two stars danced very well but didn't dazzle with
personality. Laurent Hilaire was the most impassive prince we've
seen. Isabelle Guerin rippled her arms and looked appropriately
swan-like, but did not convey the aspects of the woman she was
before evil sorcerer Rothbart changed her into a swan.
   When she danced the black swan, Miss Guerin switched on
vitality, which the ballet needed badly.
   Hilaire has impressive height to his jumps and beats in air. The
prince and black swan, when they traded variations, did build
excitement, though not as much as usual in that scene.
   We recall both dancers putting more oomph into their
performances when the company presented the same ballet here two
years ago. Maybe the June 14 to 19 season in Costa Mesa, Calif.,
was exhausting.
   Nureyev, whose choreography is ``after'' the early work of
Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, emphasizes the men more than those
choreographers did. He has one dance for four groups of four men,
one group of which couldn't stay together on Tuesday.
   John Lanchbery conducted the Tchaikovsky music with elegance.
Franca Squarciapino designed costumes and unusually effective swan
headdresses.
   From July 12 to 14, the company will dance in Vienna, Va.

<HEAD>Reagan: Pentagon Fraud Case `Understandable' But Upsetting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says bribery and fraud are
``understandable'' within the huge bureaucracy of the Pentagon and
that no one can keep track of all the defense employees and
military contractors.
   Nevertheless, Reagan, who came to office pledging to crack down
on waste, fraud and abuse, said Tuesday ``all of us are
disappointed and upset that such things happen.''
   But he appeared to excuse himself of any responsibility.
   The president commented at a news conference in Toronto at the
end of the three-day economic summit of major industrial
democracies. Later, he delivered a speech urging economic allies to
expand free trade and resist protectionism.
   After celebrating his last summit with what he said was a
``measure of pride,'' Reagan returned to Washington, where the
mushrooming Pentagon case and lingering fallout from the
Iran-Contra scandal are likely to occupy much of the seven months
that remain of his term.
   At the news conference, his second this month, Reagan fielded
only a few questions about economics. Instead, the focus was on
other issues.
   About the drought now plaguing much of the United States, Reagan
said it was too early to say what the government could do to help
farmers recover.
   ``Outside of praying for rain, there isn't anything I can do''
until a government task force submits a report on the problem next
week.
   The president also suggested he favors restrictions on handgun
purchases, so that buyers would be required to take some training
before they can buy a weapon.
   Reagan said he would like to see states adopt a system in which
people have to have a background check ``of any crimes or any
mental problems'' before they can buy guns.
   The gun ownership issue arose in response to a question about an
incident in which columnist Carl Rowan shot a teen-ager who
allegedly was trespassing in his swimming pool late at night.
   Speaking about the allegations of scandal at the Pentagon,
Reagan said, ``I have to say that I think it should be
understandable how such things can happen in something as big as
our government is.''
   Federal prosecutors this week revealed a widespread
investigation into corruption in the Pentagon weapons purchasing
system and disclosed that wiretaps had been used to record more
than 4,700 telephone conversations.
   Reagan said that in something as complex as Pentagon buying,
``you can't be down there watching several million people and the
total of all of the companies and the Defense Department every day
and what they're doing, or what phone calls they're making.
   ``And I'm quite sure that no one would think that we should be
tapping all of those phones and listening in on conversations of
everybody just on the suspicion that someone might be out of
line,'' Reagan said.
   The president largely excused former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger for any problem that occurred in his seven years at the
Pentagon.
   ``For him to take some responsibility _ of course he was heading
up there, and I suppose I could do the same thing,'' Reagan said.
   However, he said the whole affair was uncovered by the
government, and that ``they've been tracking this down to finally
the place where they have come to the point in which they feel they
can serve indictments.''
   On other matters:
   _Reagan said he doubted that huge losses in the savings and loan
industry would add up to a crisis. ``I certainly hope not and I
don't think so,'' Reagan said. However, he acknowledged ``there is
a problem there and we're trying'' to deal with it.
   _The president said ``there's no scandal'' in the Iran-Contra
affair which has resulted in several indictments, including those
of former White House aides Oliver North and John Poindexter. The
federal judge in the case has indicated he wants to begin the
trials shortly, starting with North.
   Asked if he would pardon North and Poindexter before their
trials, Reagan said their case in court ``has to go forward or they
would live the rest of their lives under a shadow of guilt. So I
have no intention of''... . He did not finish the sentence.
   _Reagan, discussing the American hostages in Lebanon, said, ``to
tell you the truth, I don't know whether they're alive today.''

<HEAD>Bicentennial Fireworks, New U.S. President At Next Summit in
France</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next year's summit of the seven most powerful
democracies will feature a new U.S. president on the world stage
and a backdrop of fireworks marking the bicentennial of the French
Revolution.
   The meeting may also show whether Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand of France, who will become the first leader ever to
repeat as summit host, can shift the theme of the gathering away
from the free-market philosophy so dear to President Reagan and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Reagan will be gone _ replaced most likely by George Bush or
Michael Dukakis _ but most of the other leaders who finished their
three-day meeting Tuesday in Canada's largest city probably will be
on hand again next year.
   Reagan's retirement is sure to shine the spotlight all the more
brightly on Mrs. Thatcher, a vigorous proponent of the policy that
less government is good government.
   Like Mrs. Thatcher and Mitterrand, West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has won re-election in the past 18 months and can expect to be
in office next year. Prime Ministers Noboru Takeshita of Japan and
Ciriaco De Mita of Italy are new in office, but the Italian cannot
count on staying around long enough to see his second summit.
   The leader in the shakiest position is this year's host,
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose Progressive
Conservative party is trailing well behind the opposition Liberals
in public opinion polls with an election expected within the next
year.
   But Mitterrand may well be the only Socialist in the next group,
as he was this year. His views, eccentric in a group of free-market
conservatives, brought him into repeated clashes with Reagan over
contents of the final communique.
   The host leader has a strong role in shaping the summit agenda,
and the 71-year-old Mitterrand is known as a wily strategist. But
he will have a difficult task if he wants to stamp the meeting with
his leftist policies.
   He told a news conference on Tuesday that he was sure that farm
subsidies and Third World debt _ the two biggest issues at the
Toronto summit _ will still be major items for the leaders to
attack next year.
   When Mitterrand convenes the economic summit on July 14, 1989,
France will be marking exactly 200 years since a Parisian throng
stormed the Bastille prison, launching the French Revolution and _
in a sense _ the modern era.
   Preparing the bicentennial was one of Mitterrand's priorities in
his first term, and his re-election last month to another seven
years in office assures that he will be able to preside over the
fireworks displays, concerts and other events planned for the
occasion.
   Mitterrand said Tuesday that it was fitting that the seven
leaders would be on hand ``for the celebration of one of the great
events of our history, which is also theirs.''
   He said the date chosen for the summit ``will have an undeniable
symbolic force.''
   Next year's meeting will start a third ``cycle,'' now that each
of the seven countries has been host twice since the summits
started in 1975, when President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France
invited his peers to the Renaissance chateau at Rambouillet.
   When Mitterrand started the second cycle in 1982, he chose
another grand palace _ the chateau of Louis XIV at Versailles _ but
officials said next year's site would more likely be a modern
office complex in Paris.
   In their closing statement Tuesday, the leaders said their
meetings ``have helped to sustain the values of democracy that
underlie our economic and political system,'' and were worth
continuing for the next seven years, ending with another meeting in
Canada in 1995.
   ``We believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our
meetings has benefited both our own countries and the wider world
community,'' they said.

   The United States' summit allies left Toronto
with much of what they wanted. They won more debt relief for the
world's poorest countries and fought off an American attempt to
eliminate agricultural subsidies.
   From French President Francois Mitterrand to Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, the allies expressed satisfaction with
the outcome of the 14th annual economic summit of seven leading
industrialized nations.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the summit,
which wound up Tuesday, ``highly successful,'' and Takeshita said
through a spokesman that he was ``finishing this summit meeting
with a sense of fulfillment.''
   With the economies of the major industrialized nations on track,
the leaders turned their attention to the sticky question of
agricultural subsidies and the desperate plight of the world's
poorest countries.
   In advance of the summit, Mitterrand proposed that the leaders
fashion a plan to ease the foreign debt burdens of the poorest of
the poor countries, those in vast sub-Saharan Africa.
   At the end of the meeting, Mitterrand said his suggestions were
adopted in the leaders' final communique.
   ``So,'' he told reporters, ``I'm satisfied.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also praised the plan, which
offers a variety of options, including slashing interest rates and
forgiving some loans, for easing the poor countries' debt burden.
   Willy De Clercq, commissioner for external relations of the
European Community, called the measure ``a big step forward.'' The
12-nation trading bloc is represented at the summit.
   The United States earlier this month backed off from its
previous refusal to go along with concessions, paving the way for
the agreement.
   Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, offered a sweeping
proposal that would help such big-debt countries as Brazil and
Mexico. The two Latin American countries are the developing world's
largest debtors, with a combined foreign debt of $220 billion. The
total for all the developing world is an estimated $1 trillion.
   Summiteers complained the Japanese plan was so complicated and
offered on such short notice that they did not have time to study
it.
   They renewed their support, instead, for the current
case-by-case approach drawn up in recent years to handle
individually the money woes of the large debtors.
   The Japanese seem unfazed by the cool response to their plan,
which will no doubt be discussed at future international meetings.
   Takeshita was ``particularly pleased at the great deal of
attention that was paid to the problems of developing countries,''
according to Michihiko Kunihiro, chief Cabinet counselor for
external affairs.
   The Europeans and the Japanese tangled with the Americans and
Canadians over what has become a bitterly disputed issue, that of
agricultural subsidies.
   Reagan has proposed, as part of his free-market philosophy, that
farm subsidies be scrapped by the year 2000.
   American officials argue that European subsidies have made the
European Community a major agricultural supplier at a time of
excess world capacity.
   The Europeans respond that they have begun the politically
sensitive process of limiting European Community subsidies to
farmers but don't want to be pushed to meet a deadline.
   The final statement offers vaguely worded language that called
for a ``framework approach, including short as well as long-term
elements'' to promote reforms, relieve strains in agricultural
markets and which would be in line with goals ``concerning the
reduction of all direct and indirect subsidies and other measures
affecting ... agricultural trade.''
   De Clercq expressed satisfaction with what he said was a
compromise among the leaders.
   ``Agriculture is a bone of contention ... We succeeded in
avoiding a row,'' he told reporters.
   The final wording, he said, ``underlines the reality ... the
diversity of agriculture situations in the world, a fact we had to
take into account.'' Small family farms, not large agribusinesses,
are common in Europe.
   Kohl said the leaders were ``moving completely on a similar
track.''
   ``The long-term goal must be a strong market-orientation of
agriculture production,'' he said. ``For this, realism and
perspective are necessary.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had hoped for firm
action to end the global subsidy war, said, ``It is not a perfect
statement but it represents progress.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has fought in the European Community for
curbing the subsidies, said, ``There is a specific commitment to
try first to freeze and then to roll back the subsidies and various
other kinds of support for agriculture in an ordered and
substantial way.''
   ``We have made a start,'' she said..

   Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
suffering from terminal cancer, has been released from Walter Reed
Army Medical Center but is staying in residential quarters on
hospital grounds, a spokesman for the Salvadoran Embassy says.
   Duarte, one of the United States' closes allies in Latin
America, was released from the hospital on Monday and moved to
nearby quarters, said Alfredo Milian, El Salvador's deputy
ambassador to the United States.
   Duarte, who was admitted to Walter Reed on May 31, underwent
three hours of cancer surgery on June 7. During the surgery,
doctors removed a portion of his stomach but left his cancerous
liver alone.
   A spokesman for Walter Reed, Peter Esker, said late Tuesday that
Duarte, 62, had been released from the hospital because ``he's
recovered from his abdominal surgery.'' Esker said he expected
Duarte would be ``back (in the hospital) in about a week for
re-evaluation of his condition.''
   Following Duarte's surgery, his personal physician, Dr. Benjamin
Interiano, said the average life expectancy of someone in Duarte's
condition is six months.
   Duarte's son, Alejandro Duarte, said Monday that chemotherapy
could extend his father's life well into next year. Alejandro
Duarte said his father probably would return to El Salvador between
July 5 and July 8 and would resume the presidency immediately.
   Duarte's five-year term expires June 1, 1989. Serving as acting
president in Duarte's absence is Vice President Rodolfo Castillo
Claramount.

<HEAD>Ortega Says Shultz Will Seek Regional Unity Against Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega charged that
Secretary of State George P. Shultz plans to seek support for U.S.
aggression against Nicaragua when he visits Central America next
week.
   Shultz will visit El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa
Rica from June 29 to July 1 to discuss the collapse of Nicaraguan
peace talks.
   Ortega on Tuesday noted that Shultz would not visit Nicaragua.
   ``What does this mean?'' he said. ``The United States doesn't
have any interest in a negotiated solution to the problems with
Nicaragua.''
   Negotiations between Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government
and the U.S.-supported Contra rebels broke off June 9.
   On Monday, rebel leaders rejected a government proposal to
resume the talks, saying the offer was aimed at discouraging a
renewal of U.S. military aid.
   Ortega told a group of more than 100 Americans, representatives
of sister cities programs, that while President Reagan recently
visited the Soviet Union, ``he doesn't have the desire to negotiate
with Nicaragua.''
   He said the purpose of the Shultz visit was to seek regional
support for American ``war policies against Nicaragua.''
   The United States has supported the Contra rebels since they
began their war to topple the Sandinistas in 1981.
   Managua and Washington maintain diplomatic relations. But the
United States cut off all aid in 1981 and imposed an economic
boycott in 1985.
   Bilateral talks between the Sandinistas and the Reagan
administration broke off in 1985.
   In other developments, a group of Atlantic Coast Indian rebels
declared they were renewing their warfare against the leftist
Sandinista government, according to a statement published Tuesday
night in the opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   The communique of the Yatama Indian rebel organization rejected
peace negotiations with the Sandinistas and said the government
would have ``to revise its dictatorial policies to implant the
conditions for a true democracy in our country.''
   Yatama seeks a form of self-government for the indigenous tribes
along the so-called Mosquito Coast of the Atlantic. The Sandinistas
have reached agreements with other Indian rebel groups to lay down
their arms.
   Yatama organizers claim to have 2,000 combatants. At least 1,000
have surrendered since last year and the Indian war had stopped for
the most part.
   The statement, signed by Yatama general coordinator Wicliff
Diego, said the Sandinistas refused to accede to their demands for
autonomous rule.
   Cease-fire talks with the Indians began in May, little more than
a month after the mainstream Contras reached a temporary truce with
the Sandinistas. The Indians received a small part of the millions
of dollars in military and economic aid supplied by the U.S.
government.

   A Marine officer infected with the AIDS virus has
sued the federal government for $55 million, alleging that Navy
doctors gave his wife an AIDS-tainted blood transfusion that
eventually killed her and their son.
   Martin Gaffney, 39, filed the negligence lawsuit Tuesday in U.S.
District Court, claiming the Navymishandled his wife's pregnancy by
causing their baby to be stillborn, then giving her a transfusion
that transmitted the deadly virus to him, his wife and a son born
later.
   ``I've asked for an apology,'' said Gaffney, a chief warrant
officer in the Marine Corps. ``Even the Soviet Union has apologized
for killing an American soldier. But my own government won't
apologize for being responsible for the deaths of my wife and son
even though I serve them.''
   Gaffney said he filed the lawsuit because he wants to provide
for his 4-year-old daughter, Maureene. She is the only member of
the family to escape infection and will likely become an orphan,
Gaffney said.
   He said he also decided to sue after the Navy responded with an
``insulting'' settlement offer of less than $1 million to a
complaint he had filed internally.
   ``It's been a very long, frustrating time waiting for the Navy
to act,'' Gaffney said in an interview Tuesday. ``I realized I
wasted six months of my life waiting for the Navy to act.''
   Gaffney's wife, Mutsuko, 38, a Japanese national, died in May
1987. The couple's 13-month-old son, John, died in 1986. Gaffney
lives with his daughter on a Navy base in South Weymouth, about 15
miles south of Boston.
   Though Gaffney's health is still good, he said he has made
provisions for his daughter to live with his brother when he dies.
   The Gaffneys were married in 1981, three years after meeting in
Okinawa, and their first child was due that August.
   The lawsuit claims Mrs. Gaffney went into the Navy Regional
Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif., one Saturday certain she
about to give birth and a nurse sent her home.
   Two days later, doctors discovered the baby had died. During a
subsequent Caesarean section, Mrs. Gaffney was given two units of
blood, one of which was contaminated with the AIDS virus, the
lawsuit says.
   Navy officials traced the two donors, and one tested negative
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Gaffney said. The other
refused to be tested and it was learned he had been discharged from
the Navy for homosexual activity, Gaffney said.
   Gaffney's claimed Navy officials have lied to him on several
occasions and never apologized to him for what has happened to his
family.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Ken Ross declined to comment on the lawsuit
or Gaffney's charges of bad treatment.
   Gaffney said his life has worsened since he filed the internal
claim against the Navy last year.
   ``There are so many things I have to put up with every day,''
Gaffney said. ``It's hard to put on that uniform every day. And I'm
afraid every time I get my hair cut. I'm afraid that if I'm nicked

<HEAD>Summit Leaders Hand Reagan Series of Defeats at His Final Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's major allies had effusive words of
praise for Ronald Reagan in public, but in private some weren't as
kind, handing the president a series of defeats at his eighth and
final economic summit.
   The bickering got so intense on Tuesday, the last day, that the
final negotiating session ran an hour longer than scheduled as the
world leaders tried to settle their differences.
   The 14th annual economic summit between the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada was not a
total disaster for Reagan.
   The allies did voice approval for his favorite free-market
economic themes and the economic coordination process the United
States has championed since the 1986 Tokyo summit.
   But in the area of farm subsidies, Third World debt, aid to the
Philippines and drug trafficking, the United States either suffered
defeats or had to accept less than it wanted, reflecting perhaps
the waning influence of a lame-duck president with only seven
months left in office.
   Little of this was visible on the surface. The leaders used the
occasion of the public reading of the final communique to salute
Reagan on his last foray into economic summitry.
   ``His leadership has been strong, his accomplishments
substantial and his place in history secure,'' Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said on behalf of the other world leaders.
``We shall all miss his warmth and wisdom.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a philosophical
soulmate of Reagan's, called the president ``marvelous,'' even
though Mrs. Thatcher was one of the leaders who pushed Reagan to
relent on his insistence for the complete phase-out of all
agricultural subsidies.
   On that issue, the United States was forced to settle for vague
language in which the countries promised to seek ways to reduce
subsidies, instead of the U.S. goal of eliminating them.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist who has often
clashed with Reagan, was even more of a problem for the president
during the three-day meeting.
   Mitterrand objected to a Reagan initiative to have the countries
cooperate more closely on the problem of drug trafficking,
contending the seven summit nations did not have the authority to
set up another international body.
   ``In whose names do these seven countries decide for the rest of
the world?'' Mitterrand grumbled. America settled for a call for an
international study group with the participating countries to be
chosen later.
   Mitterrand also blocked Reagan's effort to single out the
Philippines for multilateral foreign aid, a dispute that took up
much of the final hour and was resolved when the leaders decided to
add all heavily indebted developing contries to the list of those
deserving attention.
   On the question of debt for the poorest countries in sub-Saharan
Africa, the United States knew coming into the session that it
would have to accept a debt relief package because of heavy
pressure from other countries to do so.
   Reagan and other administration officials tried to paint the
summit in the best light, saying that no disharmony existed in the
critical areas of currency stabilization and overall coordination.
Disputes in these areas last fall were cited as reasons for the
October stock market collapse.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said that it was wrong to
characterize the summit as a do-nothing affair because no major
initiatives were started.
   ``There are a number of things that may not be news, but
represent action,'' he said. ``We all know there is still a job to
do out there, that there are still problems to be faced. But we
feel very fortunate in light of what happened to the economy last
October.''
   Financial markets treated the three-day summit as basically a
non-event, with analysts saying that since little was expected, the
markets weren't disappointed.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., an investment
firm, said financial markets were reassured by the final language
because it signaled that the coordination process that has
stabilized the dollar's value can be expected to continue.
   ``The communique itself offers little that is new, but it is a
capstone on what has been an extraordinary amount of coordination
among countries, beginning in 1985,'' he said. ``It also offers the
promise that this coordination will continue.''
   To further the coordination process, the summit countries did
agree to a U.S. proposal to adopt two commodity indexes, both
including gold, to monitor whether inflationary pressures are
building.
   The index was an idea first proposed by Baker last September. He
has insisted that the proposal is not a first step to returning the
world monetary system to a gold standard.
   Baker told reporters that the two indexes would differ in the
weight they gave gold. Also one of the indexes would include oil
while the other would not. But he refused to disclose what weight
gold would have in each of the indexes other than to say that ``a
significant weight would be attached to gold.''

<TEXT>
   For a moment, only Henny Youngman stood between
Gloria Allred and her destiny. But Ms. Allred brushed past the
irate comedian and stepped into the masculine confines of the
Friar's Club, becoming the first woman admitted for lunch there in
its 84 years.
   ``I'm literally walking on air,'' Ms. Allred, a Los Angeles
lawyer, said after a lunch of poached salmon and zucchini.
   Ms. Allred, who specializes in sex discrimination law, took a
midnight flight to New York on Monday night after hearing that the
U.S. Supreme Court had upheld a New York City law that bans sex
discrimination in private clubs.
   She has been a member of the Beverly Hills Friar's Club since
May 1987, but her previous attempts to gain entry to the New York
club, which has a reciprocal agreement with its California
offshoot, have been rebuffed.
   Until Tuesday, the New York club's policy was to admit women
only after 4 p.m. or for Saturday lunch.
   Ms. Allred was readily admitted this time, although not without
vocal objections from some members, including Youngman.
   ``I don't think they ought to butt in in our business,'' the
comedian said. ``If we want privacy, we ought to have privacy. ...
There's a million clubs in New York. Why do they want to get in? We
have fun here.''
   When Ms. Allred tried to argue, Youngman brushed her off,
saying, ``I don't know who you are.''
   She finally slipped past him and into the club, saying, ``Nice
to have met you, sir. You're entitled to be wrong.''
   ``Some people bring happiness wherever they go; she brings
happiness whenever she goes,'' Youngman grumbled.
   Once inside, she said she was treated with hospitality by the
executive director, Jean Pierre Trebot, and other members.
   ``It went very well,'' she said after dining with Trebot. ``I
enjoyed the lunch very much.''
   The decision to admit Ms. Allred was based on the U.S. Supreme
Court ruling, Trebot said. The Friar's Board of Governors plans to
vote soon on whether to admit women as members. ``We expect it will
be affirmative,'' he said.
   The Friar's Club, founded in 1904, has 1,360 members in New
York, two-thirds of whom are active in the performing arts. Its top
officer, called the abbot, is Frank Sinatra; other members include
George Burns and Irving Berlin.

<HEAD>Disputed Region's Legislature Asks Temporary Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh has asked that
the disputed region be declared independent until Moscow decides
whether to transfer its control from the Azerbaijan republic to
Armenia, a dissident said.
   The body also asked the federal parliament, or Supreme Soviet,
to disregard an earlier decision by Azerbaijan's legislature to
oppose the region's transfer to Armenia, added Koryun Nahabidyan, a
Moscow-based Armenian activist.
   He said he had spoken with Nagorno-Karabakh residents familiar
with the regional legislature's Tuesday decision.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has a population of about 160,000 people. Most
are ethnic Armenians, a mainly Christian ethnic group, but the
region was assigned in 1923 to the predominantly Moslem neighboring
republic of Azerbaijan.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature voted Feb. 20 to request
annexation to Armenia and the legislature of that southern republic
supported it.
   But Azerbaijan has refused to cede the territory and Moscow has
not said whether it will decide the question.
   Nahabidyan, who has led several Armenian demonstrations in
Moscow, said Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature also asked the federal
Supreme Court to take over legal action against rioters responsible
for killing 32 people, most of them Armenians, on Feb. 28 in the
Azerbaijan city of Sumgait.
   Armenians have said the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan, which is
handling the case, is not dealing harshly enough with those
responsible.
   A resident of Stepanakert, the territorial capital, said the
``whole city'' of 60,000 people had gathered outside government
buildings to await the legislature's decision.
   The resident, speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity,
said the members rejected a proposal to secede outright from
Azerbaijan.
   The legislature also reportedly asked residents to return to
their jobs. They have been striking since May 23, stopping nearly
all commercial activity in the region except for retailing and
agriculture, according to reports from the area.

   A federal appeals court says investment tip
sheets can be forced to tell readers that financial inducements
were given by a company to write a favorable article.
   The ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here on Tuesday
revived a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission to make
Stock Market Magazine tell readers that features about companies
were carried as a result of financial inducements
   But the court rejected the SEC's contention such publications
must tell readers that a featured company provided the article or
paid the writer who composed it.
   Deciding whether the text of a particular article was
``substantially provided'' by the company would be an intrusion in
the editorial process that is prohibited by the First Amendment,
the court said.

   Conservationists hoping to preserve Texas'
Matagorda Island, habitat for wintering whooping cranes and other
endangered bird species, got a boost from a Senate panel that
approved plans to buy the last parcel of privately held land on the
barrier island.
   A Senate appropriations subcommittee approved late Monday
legislation to spend $5.5 million to purchase 5,017 acres at the
southern tip of the Texas Gulf Coast island.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will buy the land from the
Texas Nature Conservancy, putting all the land on the island under
either federal or state ownership, according to the office of Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``This is important not only for whooping cranes, but for water
fowl, shore birds, and herons, egrets and song birds,'' Brent
Giezentanner, manager of the nearby Aransas Pass National Wildlife
Refuge, said Tuesday.
   ``This is going to preserve and protect their habitat from
development,'' said Giezentanner. ``There are only two barrier
islands in Texas that are not developed to some degree _ Matagorda
and (adjacent) San Jose.''

<HEAD>After 13 Years Of War, Lebanese Jumpy At New Threat</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lebanese, bruised by 13 years of
civil war, are jumpy over a new threat _ shipments of toxic waste
and contaminated meat imported by men the media calls ``Merchants
of Death.''
   In the past few weeks, merchants have imported 2,400 tons of
chemical wastes from Italy, 23 tons of spoiled frozen meat from
Europe and hundreds of tons of spoiled tobacco from Greece.
   In addition, about 40 barrels inscribed ``Cairo Oil'' and
containing suspicious-looking pink and gold powder were discovered
in the Mediterranean off the coast of Tyre in southern Lebanon and
Tabarjah in the north.
   It was not clear where the barrels came from.
   The discovery of the mystery barrels sent shock waves through
much of seaside Lebanon, prompting residents to desert beaches and
forgo seafood.
   Health Ministry sources said 72 people contracted skin ailments
after swimming in the sea.
   On Tuesday, an Italian toxic waste expert, Umberto Fortunato,
met with Health Minister Joseph Hashem to discuss the 2,400 tons of
toxic wastes sent from Italy.
   Afterward, Hashem told reporters the waste was not radioactive
but was poisonous and harmful to man, land and sea. He said the
chemicals had been shipped to Lebanon early in June.
   Hashem said an agreement was reached with the Italian expert to
gather the waste and ship it to an incinerator in the Pacific
Ocean. Italy will help pay for the operation, he said.
   The case is one of several in the past two weeks in which
European firms contracted to get rid of toxic wastes and shipped
them to Africa or the Middle East. Nigeria accused an Italian firm
of dumping toxic chemicals on its beaches, and a Norwegian firm was
forced to reclaim waste from the United States that it sent to
Guinea in West Africa.
   In Lebanon, efforts by the Christian Lebanese Forces militia to
return the chemical waste to Italy failed. The Italians told them
that moving the waste was risky without prior examination by an
expert.
   Some of the waste was dumped in the Kesrouan coastal strip in
the Christian-controlled heartland, about 20 miles north of the
capital. The rest, according to unconfirmed press reports, was
buried in the same region.
   The chemicals found their way to Lebanon through a local
importer, Roger Haddad, who is being interrogated by Lebanese
officials.
   Haddad is the head of maritime operations in a shipping company
based in Christian East Beirut.
   The barrels of ``Cairo Oil'' triggered a strong reaction among
the thousands of swimmers along the Lebanese coast.
   Beaches, usually packed on Sunday, were all but deserted last
weekend.
   ``People did not even dip a finger in the sea but rather swam in
the overcrowded pools,'' said Mona Chahin, a swimmers at the plush
Coral Beach Hotel in Moslem West Beirut.
   Another health threat to the Lebanese is the shipment of spoiled
meat confiscated by the Ministry of Health. It was imported by
Antoine Khoury, who was arrested by Lebanese police but later freed
for lack of evidence.
   People are worried that part of it has reached local merchants
and have stopped ordering meat in restaurants. Supermarkets are
advertising in local newspapers that the meat they are selling is
fresh and not radioactive.
   The meat, refused entry into Jordan in late May, arrived in
Lebanon in early June. Jordan has not said why the meat was refused.
   As for the shipment of spoiled tobacco, Hashem said it did not
contain any radioactive or poisonous substance. But it contained
500 tons of nicotine and was stored in unsecured buildings in the
Lebanese mountains.
   The springs much of Lebanon depends on for water are located in
the mountains and if the nicotine leaks it could contaminate the
country's water supply, the minister said.
   He said that the tobacco will be moved to special storehouses to
prevent leaks.
   The importer of the tobacco was not identified.
   For the past 13 years, Lebanon has been wracked by a civil war
that pits Israeli-backed Christians against Moslems and Moslem
factions against each other. Thousands of people have died in the
conflict, which has left Lebanon's government and economy in
shambles.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement on boosting sales of American
beef and oranges in Japan could set the stage for settling similar
agricultural issues with European nations, says the chief U.S.
trade negotiator.
   ``Now that we've been able to strike a deal with the Japanese on
beef and citrus, it puts some additional pressure on the Europeans
to be somewhat more accommodating than they have in the past,''
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Tuesday.
   Yeutter told reporters the accord signed this week in Tokyo
after prolonged dispute was the result of a fundamental change in
the attitude of Japanese leaders who showed new willingness to
settle the issue.
   The agreement calls for Japan to phase out quotas on imported
beef and fresh oranges within three years and orange juice in four
years, with the blow to Japanese domestic producers cushioned by
declining tariffs.
   The settlement was ``obviously very attractive'' for the United
States and its exporters and shows Japan has ``bitten the bullet''
and decided to begin to open its markets, Yeutter said.
   Yeutter conceded to reporters Tuesday that the original U.S.
demand for total and immediate removal of the quotas last March was
a negotiating tactic impossible for the Japanese government to
agree to.
   ``It would have been impossible for the (Japanese) government to
make that agreement and survive. So we had to work out a way to
achieve full market liberalization as quickly as possible,''
Yeutter said.
   Yeutter said the next step for the U.S. will be to press
European leaders to eliminate agricultural trade barriers there
within the next decade.
   ``It doesn't seem to us that a 10-year phase-out is unrealistic
or irrational,'' he said.
   ``It ought to be faster,'' he said. ``The world would be better
off and the European community would be better off if it were,
because the community just as much as the rest of the world'' is
hurt by farm trade barriers.
   There was no agreement over the agricultural issue at this
week's summit in Toronto between the leaders of the world's seven
leading industrialized nations, but Yeutter said the U.S. will
press for an end to barriers at the next round global trade talks
next December in Montreal.

   The project is part of a massive development plan to better
accomodate the estimated two million Moslems who converge on Mecca
and neighboring Medina during July for the annual hajj to Islam's
holiest shrines.
   The kingdom, which claims to be the world's largest producer of
desalinated water, currently has 22 plants with a total capacity of
550 million gallons of water per day.
   Four projects, including a $640 million plant in the mountainous
Asir region, are under construction. They will supply the desert
kingdom with 30 million gallons of water daily.

   A self-styled minister who enslaved four
women and killed two others in his basement torture chamber
believed society owed him a wife and a family, one of the survivors
testified at his murder trial.
   The four women spoke Tuesday about the horrors they encountered
while chained to pipes, some for months, and said Gary Heidnik
tortured and raped them repeatedly and fed them dog food mixed with
the human remains of one of his victims.
   Two survivors testified that they saw Heidnik hang Sandra
Lindsay, 24, from a pipe until she died Feb. 7, 1987, and
electrocute Deborah Dudley, 23, also known as Debbie Johnson, in a
water-filled pit in the basement.
   Heidnik's attorney describes the 44-year-old Army veteran and
financial whiz as ``very, very guilty'' but insane. He could face
the death penalty if convicted.
   During the grisly testimony, Heidnik seemed to pay no attention.
He sat in the courtroom staring straight ahead and wearing the same
flowered black Hawaiian shirt and baggy trousers he has worn to
court appearances for months.
   Josefina Rivera, who was held four months before she escaped,
told jurors that the black comedy film ``Eating Raoul,'' in which a
couple disposes of a body by mixing the flesh with food, gave
Heidnik the idea to chop up Ms. Lindsay's body, grinding parts in a
food processor and mixing it with dog food he fed his captives.
   ``He was mixing the body parts in with the dog food, because
that's the only way he could get rid of Sandra,'' Ms. Rivera said.
Heidnik first tried to dispose of the body by cooking it but
stopped after neighbors complained of the odor, she said.
   Heidnik once took a protesting Ms. Dudley upstairs and when she
was brought down, ``I asked Debbie what Gary had done,'' Ms. Rivera
testified.
   ``She said he had taken her upstairs and shown her Sandra's head
in a pot and her ribs in a roasting pan on the stove and her legs
and arms in the freezer, and that if she kept it up that's what was
going to happen to her,'' Ms. Rivera testified.
   Heidnik wanted his captives to have his children, the women
testified.
   Heidnik, who spent four years in jail for kidnapping and raping
a woman, ``felt as though society had owed him a wife and a
family,'' Ms. Rivera said.
   Lisa Thomas, who was 19 when police freed her from Heidnik's
north Philadelphia house, said she was abducted when she accepted a
ride from Heidnik and returned to his house to have sex.
   When she wanted to leave, he tried to strangle her, she
testified.
   She was taken to the basement, where Ms. Thomas said two other
women, naked from the waist down, were chained.
   Heidnik once pretended to be a police officer coming to the
women's rescue, then beat his captives when they screamed for help,
Ms. Thomas said.
   Jacquelyn Askins testified that she once heard what sounded like
a chain saw upstairs after Heidnik removed Ms. Lindsay's body from
the basement. She said she smelled the burning odor later.
   ``It was in his hair,'' Ms. Askins said of the smell. ``It was
all over him.''

   The U.S. State Department told a refusenik family
that waited in vain for a presidential visit last month that Soviet
officials will let them emigrate after 11 years of denials, a
family member said today.
   Tanya Zieman said her daughter, who was permitted to leave the
Soviet Union last year and now lives in Boston, was informed of the
decision by Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for
human rights and humanitarian affairs.
   The daughter, Galina Khatutsky, telephoned early today to tell
her family the news, Mrs. Zieman said. The word reportedly was
conveyed to Secretary of State George P. Shultz by Soviet
Ambassador Yuri Dubynin.
   Mrs. Zieman said she was told it would take about two weeks for
the Soviet Union to formally notify her that she, her husband,
Yuri, and their 12-year-old daughter, Vera, may leave the Soviet
Union.
   The family spent much of the previous two days seeing off best
friends who received permission to emigrate to Israel just before
the Moscow summit.
   The first indications the matter was about to be resolved came
Tuesday, when Soviet officials informally notified U.S. and other
Western diplomats that the Ziemans would soon be granted exit visas.
   Last week, the Ziemans were officially informed that their
latest appeal had been rejected by a special review commission of
the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament.
   Vera Zieman had written President and Mrs. Reagan appealing for
their help and the Reagans considered going to her home when they
arrived in Moscow May 29 for the U.S.-Soviet summit.
   But sources said they passed up the visit after U.S. officials
were warned such a presidential stop would doom the family's
chances to emigrate.
   The Ziemans did attend a tea the Reagans gave for people
Washington considers victims of Soviet human rights abuses and
Vera, a pianist, recently received a gift of several classical
music tapes from the first family.
   The gift wrapping from the present, with the gold presidential
seal, was on Vera's piano today in the family's tiny three-room
apartment in southwest Moscow. In a note the Ziemans received after
the summit, Reagan said he hoped one day to be able to visit them
in Boston.
   Yuri Zieman, a computer specialist who lost his job when he
applied to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until stricken
several months ago by a mysterious brain ailment that left him with
double vision and a loss of balance.
   The condition, diagnosed by some Soviet physicians as a
potentially deadly aneurysm, or bulge in a cerebral artery, made
the family's quest more urgent because Zieman was warned by his
doctors not to undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the
Soviet Union.
   Zieman has been told he is not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons, though he contends he never had access to
state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet
security.

<TEXT>
   The dollar moved back to the 127-yen level today in
Tokyo for the first time in nearly three months, while share prices
declined slightly.
   After opening at 126.70, up 0.37 yen from Tuesday's finish, the
dollar continued to climb against the Japanese currency and closed
the day's trading at 127.60 yen, up a sharp 1.27 yen.
   ``Active dollar buying by Japanese institutional investors
boosted the dollar,'' said a foreign exchange dealer at a major
commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Traders said the dollar's rise was fueled in part by a statement
by President Reagan that he thought the currency had stabilized.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a big 213.46-point loser Tuesday, shed another
64.79 points, or 0.23 percent, and ended the day at 27,860.78.
   It was the Nikkei's third consecutive decline since the
beginning of the week.
   ``A sense that the market was rising too high prompted selling
among large-capital issues during the afternoon session, which
pulled back share prices,'' said a stock analyst with a major Tokyo
securities house, who also demanded anonymity.
   Mirroring the overnight advance on Wall Street, the Tokyo stock
market's main barometer reached 28,056.40, up 130.83 points, at the
end of the morning session, then fell back later in the day.
   Trading was moderate with volume on the first section trade
standing at 1.2 billion shares, up from 1.1 billion shares Tuesday.
   Losers included non-ferrous metals, shipbuildings, and
chemicals. Among the gainers were heavy electricals and precision
machineries.

   Staffers from Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign and party chairmen from 13 states will
gather in Charleston this week to plan Bush's strategy in the
South, officials said.
   ``We'll go down the line state-by-state to see what needs to be

who is hosting the meeting Wednesday and Thursday.
   Among those participating will be South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, who is the vice president's Southern campaign chairman,
and Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater.
   Michael Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, has
shown some strength in polls in southern states and Hipp said GOP
strategists will try to forestall any inroads the Massachusetts
governor may make in the region.
   ``Bush has got to carry the South. This is where his base has to
be, along with the West,'' Hipp said.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose keynote
address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention propelled him to
national prominence, says he expects to have no formal role at this
year's gathering.
   ``I don't see any role at the convention for a very good

governor at the convention.''
   Cuomo said Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden was his top choice to be
keynote speaker to the convention ``if he were in shape to do it.''
Biden underwent brain surgery this year.
   Cuomo, who was once considered a potential 1988 Democratic

   Vice President George Bush's Iowa
campaign manager, working to put the best face on sagging poll
numbers and reassure nervous activists, says Republican activists
will soon begin an assault on likely Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   ``Most Iowans haven't begun to focus seriously at the moment,''

begin in Iowa until after Labor Day.''
   Wittgraf met with reporters in the wake of a new poll published
Sunday showing Bush trailing Dukakis in the state by a 60-28 margin
and increased nervousness among GOP activists that Bush will be a
liability in the fall elections.
   Dukakis, Wittgraf said, is little known in Iowa, despite months
of campaigning prior to the Feb. 8 precinct caucuses and Bush
backers will work to ``give definition'' to the Massachusetts

<HEAD>Reagan Speaks Favorably of Handgun Purchase Waiting Periods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's support of a waiting period
for would-be buyers of handguns runs counter to the traditional
views of many of his conservative supporters that there be little
or no restrictions on individual access to weapons.
   But Reagan's comments Tuesday won immediate praise from Sarah
Brady, whose husband, White House Press Secretary James Brady, was
wounded by presidential assailant John Hinckley. Reagan also was
injured in the March 1981 attack but recovered completely.
   The president, answering a question at a news conference in
Toronto, expressed support for the waiting period as well as for
instruction of new gun buyers.
   ``In California, for a citizen to buy a gun, that citizen has to
come in, lay down the money of course, name, address, and so
forth,'' Reagan said. ``And this goes to an agency in the state
government that looks into that person's entire background as to
who and what they are.
   ``And then they come back, after that investigation, and if they
don't have a record of any crimes or mental problems, or anything
of that kind, they are allowed to take their gun home,'' Reagan
continued, adding, ``Now, I would like to see that generally _ I
think that all states ought to take a look at that system.''
   Reagan did not say whether he supports federal legislation
pending in Congress that would require a seven-day waiting period
for handgun purchases.
   The National Rifle Association opposes the bill, arguing that
such waiting periods, aside from not preventing serious criminals
from getting handguns, are unconstitutional and divert police
resources to looking into the private lives of law-abiding citizens.
   One NRA lobbyist, James Jay Baker, told a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee earlier this month that even with the waiting period,
Hinckley would have qualified for the weapons he obtained.
   But Mrs. Brady, who became a strong gun control advocate
following the wounding of her husband, issued a statement Tuesday
night saying that she was ``delighted that the president has given
his vital support to a waiting period and background check for
handgun buyers.''
   ``I hope the president's leadership will encourage Republicans
and Democrats alike to join together and pass'' the federal
legislation, she added.
   Reagan also said that he thought instructions on gun use should
be required for gun purchasers.
   ``I taught my entire family out at the ranch how to shoot a gun
in case they ever had to,'' Reagan said. ``And I think maybe there
could be some restrictions that there had to be a certain amount of
training taken.''

   Pope John Paul II's second trip to
Austria will provide the pontiff with a platform from which he can
address the faithful in bordering Communist-ruled countries he has
been kept from visiting.
   Tens of thousands of Hungarian Catholics are expected for a Mass
on Friday at Trausdorf, less than 10 miles from the frontier.
   And Catholics from Yugoslavia's northern republics of Slovenia
and Croatia will probably flock to a Mass on Saturday at Gurk,
about 90 minutes by car from the border.
   About 60 percent of the 15.5 million Czechoslovaks are
Catholics, according to Vatican estimates, but their government's
travel restrictions are much tougher and they probably will have to
rely on television.
   The pope's tour begins Thursday and ends Monday. Austrian
television will broadcast 40 hours of the trip.
   A native of Poland, John Paul has been allowed to visit his
homeland three times since being elected in 1978 to head the
church. He has not, however, been welcome in the rest of the Soviet
bloc or non-aligned Yugoslavia.
   Cardinal Franz Koenig of Austria, who built relationships with
the Catholics of Eastern Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, predicted
the pope will reach out to the Soviet-bloc and Yugoslavia during
his Masses in Austria.
   In recent months, the Vatican has been pressuring Prague to
liberalize its treatment of the church. Catholic activists recently
got 600,000 signatures on a petition for religious freedom there.
And this month, Czechoslovakia held its first consecrations of
bishops since 1973.
   The Prague government, perhaps influenced by recent official
overtures by the Kremlin to the Russian Orthodox Church, also
allowed brief excerpts of the ceremonies to be shown on television.
Names of bishops barred from performing their duties for decades
suddenly appeared in the state-run media.
   Vatican efforts against restrictions on religion appear even
more successful in Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, Vatican secretary of state, this
month attended celebrations of 1,000 years of Christianity in
Russia and gave Mikhail S. Gorbachev the first letter ever sent by
a pope to a Kremlin leader.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union and the Vatican have a basis for
further talks in the common struggle for peace, and did not exclude
eventual diplomatic relations.
   In Hungary, where an estimated 5 million of the 10.6 million
people are Roman Catholics, the church may be able to improve its
legal standing in a current revision of religious laws.
   Cardinal Laszlo Paskai, who has criticized predecessors for not
standing up to curbs on religion, is said to have a good
relationship with Imre Miklos, head of the government office on
church affairs.
   In Yugoslavia, relations between the Communists of Slovenia and
Croatia and their Catholic churches are far from easy.
   One major obstacles to a papal visit there is a reported wish by
John Paul to visit the grave of Cardinal Aloisius Stepanac in
Zagreb Cathedral. The Communists call Stepanac a war criminal who
collaborated with the Nazi puppet regime in Croatia during World
War II.

   Rep. John Duncan, who served 24 years in
Congress and was the Ways and Means Committee's ranking Republican,
has died at age 69 after a long battle with cancer.
   Duncan died suddenly late Tuesday at St. Mary's Medical Center,
five days after being admitted for chemotherapy, said Mary Sharp, a
hospital spokeswoman.
   ``He had been listed in satisfactory condition up to tonight,
his condition deteriorated this evening,'' she said.
   Family members were at his side when he died and were shocked by
the death, Ms. Sharp said.
   Duncan, who consistently won re-election by large margins, had
planned to run again to represent the 2nd District. But Duncan, who
suffered from cancer of the prostate and upper body, announced May
27 that he would not seek another term because of his poor health.
   ``Ever since my prostate cancer was discovered in 1980 I have
considered the cancer just like any other illness,'' Duncan said in
his announcement. ``You hope and pray that it will go away so you
can continue to work and enjoy life. I truly wanted to run for a
13th term.''
   He had kept in touch with other Congress members who were
battling cancer while continuing to work, and said those
relationships helped him as he struggled with the disease.
   His 40-year-old son, John ``Jimmy'' Duncan Jr., stepped down as
a Knox County criminal court judge to run in August's GOP primary
for the congressional seat.
   Duncan was considered a quiet lawmaker who concentrated on
technical aspects of congressional matters, often focusing on
closing loopholes and polishing sloppy legislation.
   During election years he sometimes came under fire by anti-PAC
groups for receiving large contributions from political action
committees, including those representing trial lawyers, podiatrists
and real estate agents.
   Duncan, who was one of 10 children, served in the Army from
1942-45 and received a law degree in 1948.
   From then until 1956 he was an assistant state attorney general.
In 1959, he was elected mayor of Knoxville, serving until elected
to Congress in 1964.
   He became the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee
after his 1984 re-election, and was one of two Republicans on the
Joint Taxation Committee.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.
   Survivors include his wife, Lois, and four children.

   The Supreme Court today sentenced a
former deputy interior minister to four years in prison for
insulting the monarchy, a provincial court official said today.
   The Supreme Court agreed with a lower court decision that
remarks made by former minister Veera Musikapong during a political
campaign were intended to insult King Bhumibol Adulyadej,
Thailand's constitutional ruler.
   But the court reduced the original sentence of six years because
of Veera's past services to the country, said Chamnong
Kerdsoongneon, the court official.
   Veera, 40, was accused of making the allegedly insulting remarks
on July 13, 1986 while campaigning for a seat in the lower house of
Parliament.
   Veera's remarks contrasted the life of the peasant to life in
the Royal Palace. Media directly reproducing remarks deemed
insulting to the monarchy may face the same lese majeste charges.
   Lese majeste in Thailand carries a maximum pealty of 15 years
imprisonment.

   A train struck a station wagon at a rural
railroad crossing that lacked warning signals, killing all seven in
the car, and an ambulance worker collapsed and died trying to save
one of the victims.
   The driver, who was accompanied by her sister and their five
children, apparently did not see the train as she crossed the
tracks Tuesday afternoon, said Crawford County Sheriff Lynn Fields.
   The crossing in southeast Kansas does not have signals, lights
or arms, but it is a clear intersection, Fields said. Other
car-train collisions have occurred there.
   The station wagon was crossing the tracks on a country road two
miles northeast of Cherokee when it was struck on the passenger
side by a Burlington Northern engine pulling seven cars, Fields
said. The car burst into flames.
   ``What we've found out so far is that the driver didn't even
look up,'' Fields said.
   The engineer of the freight train was following standard
procedures when approaching a crossing, said Pat Hiatte, a
Burlington Northern spokesman in Overland Park.
   ``The headlight was on, the whistle was blowing and the bell was
ringing,'' Hiatte said. ``The stopping distance is such that
there's not a lot the engineer can do.''
   The children were thrown from the station wagon. One child was
declared dead on arrival at a hospital and one died in the
emergency room. The others died at the scene.
   The driver, Kathy Hastings, 31, was pinned inside the burning
wreckage along with her 26-year-old sister, Lisa Maxwell,
authorities said.
   Joe Cobb, the director of county's ambulance service, died of an
apparent heart attack at a hospital while trying to help one of the
children.
   Cobb, 48, apparently went to the accident scene, where the
temperature was in the mid-90s, and returned to the hospital with
one of the victims, said Collin Hermreck, spokeswoman for Mount
Carmel Medical Center in Pittsburg, 120 miles south of Kansas City.
   The Kansas Highway Patrol identified Mrs. Hastings' children as
Kara, 8, Erik, 5, and Reuben, 3; and Mrs. Maxwell's children as
Joel, 5, and Avery, 2.
   The women and their children had gone to Cherokee on Monday from
their home in Iola to visit a relative.
   ``They had just left the residence, which was about three miles
from the accident scene,'' Fields said. ``They were heading back
home to Iola.''

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities are ordering China's
rambunctious students to sit through special summer school classes
geared toward ridding them of yearnings for democracy and a better
life for intellectuals.
   Official reports today said the government ordered universities
to use summer school to teach students to support state policies
and to ``enhance students' consciousness'' about the difficulties
of implementing them.
   In China, students every summer are sent for several weeks to
farms, factories and businesses to ``learn from the masses.''
   The People's Daily said this year's program would push the party
line.
   The order came down in a government directive, issued by the
Communist Party Propaganda Department, State Education Commission
and Communist Youth League. It appeared part of official efforts to
control China's restive college students and lessen their
widespread alienation from the party line.
   The directive came two weeks after students at Beijing
University put up dozens of posters demanding democracy and
criticizing the government's ongoing political and economic reforms
as inadequate.
   ``The directive expressed the hope that the students will be led
to the frontline of the reforms to understand the great
achievements of the past 10 years of reform and increase their
confidence in it,'' the People's Daily said.
   The Xinhua News Agency's English service said the students
``should be educated to support reform programs drawn up by the
party and the government and take part in overcoming difficulties
in the reform.''
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping launched the reform program in 1978
in an effort to develop China's backward economy by replacing
central planning with elements of free-market economies.
   He also sought to make the sluggish bureaucracy more efficient.
   Many students believe the reforms do not go far enough and want
sweeping political changes, including introduction of Western-style
democracy.
   The posters that went up this month at Beijing University took
pokes at top leaders and demanded democracy, respect for human
rights, a freer press, more funds for education and better pay for
intellectuals.
   Police appeared in force to head off a march students had
planned to dramatize their demands. Authorities warned against
illegal protests and emphasized the need for stability if China is
to modernize.
   The official China Daily today quoted the head of the party
Propaganda Department, Wang Renzhi, as telling a meeting of
ideological workers in Beijing they must be careful in exposing
students to foreign ideas.
   Wang said China must introduce foreign ideas that are good for
its development, but should not embrace all Western culture and
ideology. He especially warned against teaching nihilist, egoist
and non-rationalist philosophies.

   South Korean workers at the French
Embassy in Seoul said today they would strike unless the embassy
allows them to form a union and changes what they call an unfair
pay system.
   The threat comes during a wave of strikes at Korean companies in
recent months by workers who demand better pay and working
conditions. Strikes also have hit some foreign firms.
   On Tuesday, Korean workers at the French Embassy began a sit-in
inside the embassy compound, shouting slogans, during their lunch
hour. They worked normally during office hours.
   The workers said the job action would begin on June 30.
   They said French Embassy officials refused to allow them to form
a union on the grounds foreign embassies have extraterritorial
rights. They also accused the embassy of basing pay on an unfair
system of rating worker performance.
   Foreign Ministry officials said they were studying international
practices to see whether the formation of labor unions would be
possible at foreign legations, which don't come under South Korean
jurisdiction.
   ``We are afraid it would cause diplomatic disputes,'' said a
ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Korean workers at other embassies, including those of Canada,
West Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, are also seeking to form
labor unions.
   Meanwhile, about 400 union leaders at 37 foreign bank branches
in Seoul held a peaceful joint rally Tuesday night at a downtown
park to support striking workers at the Seoul branch of Australia's
Westpac Banking Corp.
   ``Respect our national pride'' and ``Expel white supremacy,''
they shouted as a Korean union leader from Bank of America accused
some foreign firms of suppressing union activity. The union leaders
vowed to take collective action, contending that Westpac had
unfairly treated 17 Korean workers who began a wildcat strike May
27 for more money.
   Speakers at the rally maintained that foreign firms, banks and
embassies have ignored demands by Korean workers.
   At the Seoul branch of Japan's Mitsui and Co., 82 Korean workers
began an indefinite strike Monday, demanding an end to what they
called unfavorable regulations and suppression of union activities.
   The strikers drove Japanese employees out of their office and
barricaded the office doors with tables.

   Nicaraguan Contra troops in the field will not be
affected by deep cuts in administrative staff and expenses planned
for the end of the month, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-backed rebels
says.
   ``We are not closing _ it's just a matter of trying to function
with less cost,'' spokeswoman Marta Sacasa said late Tuesday.
   Layoffs are expected at the Miami headquarters and at other
Contra political offices, although some employees may continue as
unpaid volunteers.
   ``By the 30th (of June), I understand nobody is sure who will
continue working,'' Ms. Sacasa said, adding that the Contra
directors have not announced the extent of the layoffs or the
top-to-bottom ``restructuring'' that will accompany them.
   She denied cutbacks were directly related to Congress' refusal
to back the Reagan administration's full budget request for the
Contras this year.
   In March, Congress adopted a limited $47.9 million budget
limited to humanitarian aid, and although the administration is
expected to ask for more money, legislative leaders give new
funding little chance.
   The rebel political staff also has had exceptionally high
expenses so far this year, in part because of trips to and from
Central America to negotiate a truce with Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   The New York Times today quoted Silvio Arguello Cardenal, vice
president of the Contra legislative assembly, as saying layoff
notices have been mailed to 350 to 400 employees in Contra offices
in Miami, Washington, Latin America and Europe.
   Ms. Sacasa said that as far as she knew no employees had
received the official notice by Tuesday. She added that directors
would do their best to ensure that no employees would be ``out on
the street.''
   ``We're giving the directors the freedom to do what has to be
done to be more productive,'' she said.

   Trainees in the Navy's rescue swimmer
school plunged into the pool under less stringent demands as the
program resumed for the first time since a recruit drowned last
March from ``sheer terror.''
   The rescue swimmer school was closed March 29 because of the
death four weeks earlier of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of
Appleton, Wis., who was allegedly forced back into a swimming pool
after he climbed out saying that he wanted to quit the course.
   Officials have since revised the curriculum and eliminated the
drill being conducted at the time of Mirecki's death. The school
reopened Monday and students, grunting and shouting encouragement
to each other, went into the pool for the first time Tuesday.
   ``They are a highly motivated group and they are pretty
enthusiastic about getting started,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Dennis
Hessler, public affairs officer for the Naval Education and
Training Command.
   As a result of Mirecki's death, five instructors have been
accused of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit
battery. The officer in charge of the school, Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, has been relieved and charged with dereliction of duty.
All six may face court-martial.
   The 22 Navy and two Coast Guard students will serve to validate
the new training regimen. No other classes will begin until their
four weeks of training is completed, Hessler said.
   The class is being monitored by experienced rescue swimmers and
representatives of the Naval Education and Training Command and the
Coast Guard.
   ``Basically they are watching to see how this curriculum works
... and then to make any fine tuning or tweaking if necessary,''
Hessler said.
   After Mirecki was forced into the pool, one instructor allegedly
held him under water in a head-hold used during a drill called
``sharks and daisies'' just before he collapsed.
   The drill, in which instructors grabbed swimming students to
simulate a panicked air crash survivor, has been dropped from the
curriculum, and students now will practice rescue drills on each
other.
   Other changes call for training to stop immediately for students
who ask to quit or show signs of panic, fear or extreme fatigue.
   Mirecki had a phobia about being dragged under water that
triggered heart failure caused by ``sheer terror,'' followed by
drowning, a pathologist testified during an investigative hearing
two weeks ago.

<HEAD>Songbird Decline May Be Due to Tropical Deforestation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer songbirds live in many North
American forests, scientists say, a probable outcome of the cutting
of tropical rainforests where the birds winter and the loss of
other forests to suburban sprawl.
   An article in the July-August issue of the Vermont-based
Harrowsmith magazine cites a growing body of evidence that
deforestation of tropical rainforests in Central and South America
is harming a long list of songbird species by depriving them of
their winter nesting grounds.
   Other researchers, however, say that the decline in the songbird
population may be more a result of the carving up of large forest
tracts in North America by housing developments, shopping malls or
highways.
   Songbirds, which winter in the south and migrate north for the
breeding season, include more than 100 species of warblers,
flycatchers, thrushes and vireos.
   Several experts contacted Tuesday by The Associated Press said
it is too early to make a definitive connection between lower
populations of songbirds and deforestation in the tropics.
   But some said even the preliminary evidence available is cause
for concern.
   ``We're most likely going to see documentable declines within
the next few years,'' said David Capen, associate professor of
wildlife biology at the University of Vermont.
   About 40,000 square miles of tropical forest _ an area the size
of Virginia _ are cleared annually for cattle grazing, farmland,
timber and other uses, according the Nature Conservancy
environmental group cited by Harrowsmith.
   At least one species' decline and its connection with
deforestation in the tropics has been documented, said John
Terborgh, professor of biology at Princeton University.
   Terborgh said Bachman's warbler, a songbird that formerly lived
in the Southeast, hasn't been seen for 10 or 15 years. Most of that
bird's old winter habitat, in Cuba, has been cleared for sugar cane
fields.
   A study of songbird nest sites in central Illinois also provides
evidence that the population has been hurt by the fragmentation of
forests in North America, creating habitats where predators or
parasitical bird species can thrive at the expense of songbirds.
   In a report to published in October, Scott Robinson of the
Illinois Natural History Survey says that about 80 percent of all
songbird nests were preyed upon in fragmented wood lots he studied,
The New York Times reported this week.
   ``It was really impressive just how much trouble these birds
were having,'' he said.
   Terborgh said a major cause of songbird decline in North America
is the growing population of the parasitic cowbird, which invades
songbirds' nests and often deprives their young of food.
   Some of the decline of the species that spend their summers in
upper elevations in Vermont and elsewhere in the eastern United
States may be due to forest decline caused by acid rain, Capen said.
   The scientists agreed that more study is needed, and lamented
the lack of accurate and thorough data tying individual bird
species to specific migratory routes.
   ``We do not now have a good way to determine which factor has
the most effect,'' said Chandler Robbins, a wildlife bioligist with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``There are problems down there
and problems up here. It's tough on birds all over.''

<HEAD>Los Angeles Lakers Repeat As National Basketball Champs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Worthy's 36 points led Los
Angeles as the Lakers held off the Detroit Pistons 108-105 to
become the first team in 19 years to win back-to-back NBA
championships.
   Tuesday night's victory in the deciding game of the
best-of-seven series also gave the Lakers their fifth National
Basketball Association title in this decade and 11th overall.
   The Lakers, who trailed 52-47 at halftime, hit their first 10
shots of the third quarter on the way to a 15-point lead, then held
off a furious rally by the Pistons in the final 12 minutes.
   Led by Worthy, the series' Most Valuable Player, the Lakers
became the first repeat champions in the NBA since the Boston
Celtics did it in 1969.
   By successfully defending last year's crown in the seven-game
championship, the Lakers fulfilled a guarantee by Coach Pat Riley.
They did so despite just four points and three rebounds from Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA's all-time leading scorer.
   ``I'm going to guarantee everyone we're going to repeat,'' Riley
said minutes after the Lakers beat the Celtics a year ago.
   The sellout Forum crowd of 17,505 screamed ``Repeat, repeat''
during every timeout and swarmed the court after the game.
   The Pistons, making their first appearance in the championship
series since moving to Detroit 31 years ago, became the first team
since Seattle in 1978 to lose the finals after taking a 3-2 lead.

   A house had to drop on a witch before Dorothy
could get the magic ruby slippers, but $165,000 did the trick for a
man bidding on the shimmering shoes that Judy Garland wore skipping
down the Yellow Brick Road.
   The auction room at Christie's East, which seats about 400
people, was standing-room-only Tuesday as a bidding war drove up
the price to more than eight times the presale estimate of $15,000
to $20,000.
   ``When our expert asked him (the anonymous buyer) what he'd do
with them, he said, `Treasure them,''' said Lee Anne Fahey,
spokeswoman for Christie's East.
   Later in the auction of movie memorabilia and other
collectibles, $53,955 was paid for 96 unpublished color slides of a
young Marilyn Monroe taken in Los Angeles in 1945 by William
Carroll.
   The slides were sold in 16 lots, all to anonymous buyers. The
most expensive, for $6,380, featured eight color studies of Miss
Monroe, seated on a seaside boulder and wearing white suspender
shorts and a red and white T-shirt.
   Carroll, who owned a film processing laboratory, hired the
19-year-old model, then known as Norma Jean Dougherty, to pose for
advertising cards that he displayed on counter tops at photo
stores. None of the counter cards are known to remain in existence,
Christie's said.
   The size 6B ``Wizard of Oz'' slippers _ topped with 2,300
crimson-dyed sequins and soled with orange felt to muffle footsteps
on the sound stage _ were among seven or eight pairs worn by Miss
Garland while filming the 1939 MGM classic. Only five sets are
known to exist today. Roberta Jeffries Bauman of Memphis, Tenn.,
had won this pair in a contest in February 1940 when she was 16.
   ``They are considered the `purest' by those who believe in their
magic, and are the best known to Oz fanciers, having been in
private hands 30 years longer than any other pair,'' the auction
catalog said.
   The price, which included a 10 percent commission to Christie's,
was a record for any type of shoes sold at auction and for a single
movie property, Ms. Fahey said.
   Other big sellers included:
   _An Elvis Presley Army uniform from the 1960 movie, ``GI
Blues,'' which eclipsed its presale estimate of $1,000 to $1,500 to
command $12,100;
   _A set of 14 lithographs by John Lennon, depicting his marriage
and honeymoon with Yoko Ono, $6,600;
   _A portrait by Richard Bernstein of the late actor Harris Glenn
Milstead, better known as Divine, $2,200;
   _A Cecil Beaton photographic study of Marilyn Monroe, $2,090;
   _A pair of black, western boots, appliqued with a grand piano
motif for Liberace, $1,045.

   Three Canadians who smuggled a bomb into
the United States were bunglers who got caught, not members of a
Syrian terrorist group that assassinated Bashir Gemayel in Lebanon,
a defense attorney says.
   Georges Younan, Walid Mourad and Walid Kabbani faced sentencing
today in U.S. District Court. Younan faces up to 35 years in
prison, Kabbani faces 30 years and six months and Mourad faces 10
years.
   ``I think the government's attempt to say they're part of a
terrorist group is greatly exaggerated,'' said Art Anderson,
Younan's attorney. ``I think it should be kept in perspective.''
   The men, who were born in Lebanon, were arrested last Oct. 23
after crossing the border at Richford.
   Mourad pleaded guilty Jan. 26 to conspiring to transport
explosives and an immigration violation. A jury convicted Younan
and Kabbani on several charges of explosives violations and an
immigration violation.
   U.S. Attorney George Terwilliger III and the FBI said the men
are members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. The party was
founded in the fascist era of the 1930s and devoted to the
formation of ``Greater Syria,'' would have united Lebanon and what
was then Palestine under Syrian hegemony.
   Members of the group have claimed responsibility for the 1982
assasination of Lebanese President-elect Gemayel, according to
Floyd Clarke, an assistant director of the FBI's criminal
investigative division.
   The trio's offenses represent ``an attempt to import those
techniques (of violence) into the United States,'' Terwilliger said.
   The three were arrested in Richford after the police chief
spotted them behaving suspiciously near the international border. A
search of their van turned up explosives, authorities said.
   Since their arrest, the three have been held at the Northwest
State Correctional Facility in St. Albans.

<TEXT>
   A state Supreme Court justice says he will
step down to look for a better-paying job, making him the third
justice to resign in less than a year.
   ``I'm tired of being the lowest-paid lawyer in the courtroom,''
Justice James Wallace said Tuesday. Justices are paid $79,000 a
year.
   Wallace said he would resign Sept. 1, a move that would put the
seat on the November ballot and allow Democratic and Republican
officials to pick candidates. Republican Gov. Bill Clements will
appoint an interim justice to serve until the November election
results are certified.
   Wallace was elected to the court in 1980 and re-elected in 1986.
His current term ends in 1993. He said he would practice law in
Austin or Houston.
   Chief Justice John L. Hill and Justice Robert Campbell, both
Democrats, submitted their resignations late last year. Hill quit
to devote time to his push for appointed, instead of elected, state
judges. Campbell quit to campaign in favor of keeping the elected
system.

<HEAD>Heat Bakes Central United States; Thunderstorms Sweep South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A persistent heat wave baked several spots around the country
today while thunderstorms struck the central Plains and South after
whipping up destructive winds in Arkansas and Alabama.
   Tuesday's high temperatures in the central United States were
the hottest in some spots that have been observed during the month
of June. Afternoon highs soared to 109 at Huron, S.D., 108 at Sioux
City, Iowa, 103 at Des Moines, Iowa, 102 at Fort Wayne, Ind., and
101 at South Bend, Ind.
   The high temperature of 110 degrees at Sioux Falls, S.D.,
equaled its all-time record.
   A cold front in the north central United States offered some
relief from the heat but not much hope for rain.
   A thunderstorm Tuesday night in Arkansas produced high winds at
Black Oak that damaged four homes and a trailer home, injuring two
people. A thunderstorm in Alabama stirred high winds north of
Hamilton, destroying a house, ripping the roofs off three barns and
downing many trees and power lines.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms swept through the
central Plains and the Great Lakes region early this morning.
Strong thunderstorms also hit parts of Wisconsin and Michigan. A
cold front brought showers to the northern Pacific coast. Dry
weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with clear skies
in the south central nation.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from northern New England across the Great Lakes region to Iowa, as
well as from southeast Texas to the southern half of the Atlantic
coast; and afternoon thunderstorms widely scattered from the
Plateau region and the Rockies.
   Temperatures were forecast in the upper 80s or 90s across much
of the nation; in the 70s along the Pacific coast; in the 70s to
mid-80s from Minnesota into upper Michigan and from the eastern
Great Lakes into northern New England; reaching 100 to 110 degrees
across the desert Southwest; and around 100 degrees from Kansas to
Indiana and over the northern High Plains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 94 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<DATELINE>POOLE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police allowed more than 2,000 people to
return home today after a series of explosions and a massive fire
at a chemical processing plant forced the evacuation of a
picturesque area of this southern seaport.
   Dorset County police Supt. Bill Hanson said 14 people were
treated and released from a hospital after inhaling fumes following
the explosions Tuesday afternoon.
   An investigation began today to determine what caused the
explosions at BDH Chemicals, which witnesses said hurled chemical
drums into the air, shattered windows of nearby houses and sent up
a fireball and a 200-foot column of smoke.
   The blasts, which could be heard miles away, destroyed the plant
and severely damaged a nearby pub.
   More than 2,000 people, many of them elderly, were evacuated
from picturesque Poole Old Town, which dates to Roman times, when a
chemical cloud passed over the district as it drifted out to sea.
   Police said the chemical cloud was not dangerous.
   ``There were some methylated spirits, but suggestions that
cyanide was involved is not so. It was on the premises but
fortunately was not affected by the explosion,'' said a Dorset
police spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not identified.
   About 120 firefighters brought the blaze under control within
one hour and reported all workers safe.
   Eric Week, a Dorset county councilor, called for an
investigation into the cause and whether storage of potentially
dangerous chemicals should be allowed in a plant in the center of
Poole.
   ``I don't think there's any indication at the moment that our
operations were unsafe,'' John Vass, manager of BDH Chemicals, said
in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
   Some elderly local residents described the blasts as worse than
during the German bombing blitz in World War II.
   Beatrice Edwards, 79, whose home is 200 yards from the chemical
works, said: ``I've never heard anything like it, even when a bomb
dropped down here during the war. This was 10 times worse.
   ``There was an enormous explosion and then we kept getting
explosions after that.''

   The dollar rose in early European trading today
with the piercing of two significant chart levels spurring on a
bullish, moderately active market.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said large institutional investors in
the Far East were heavy buyers of dollars after the U.S. currency
rose above a significant chart level of 126.50 yen.
   Although the dollar was stable in early European trading,
dealers said it spurted higher once it pierced the technical
resistance level of around 1.7625 deutsche marks.
   ``The story is still the same; the market is buying dollars''
because of strong underlying bullish sentiments, said one senior
trader with an Italian bank in Rome. ``The market is all on one
side.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 1.27 yen to a closing 127.60 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 128.15 yen.
   In London, the dollar edged up against the British pound, which
was quoted at $1.7770, compared with $1.7855 on Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _ 1.7627 West German marks, up from 1.7548
   _ 1.4645 Swiss francs, up from 1.4623
   _ 5.9395 French francs, up from 5.9245
   _ 1.9822 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9755
   _ 1,307.75 Italian lire, up from 1,304.00
   _ 1.2075 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2079
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $449.50 a troy ounce,
down from late Tuesday's $451.00. At mid-morning Tuesday, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$449.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $449.95 down from $451.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at a bid $451.46.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London today at a bid price of
$7.12 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $7.19.

<TEXT>
   Joan B. Kroc, widow of the McDonald's fast-food
magnate, has donated $1 million to the mayor's campaign to attract
a monthlong Soviet Arts festival that the city hopes will boost its
cultural reputation.
   Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who announced the gift Tuesday at a news
conference, is scheduled to leave Friday for the Soviet Union to
discuss the proposed 1990 event with Soviet officials and to
recruit performers.
   ``We are well on our way to having a very successful festival,
if we can get the Soviet Union's permission and cooperation, which
I think we can if we go to the Soviet Union with $1 million in the
bank,'' O'Connor said.
   The City Council will formally accept the donation today, which
comes in the form of McDonald's stock and will remain in an
interest-bearing account until it is spent, City Attorney John Witt
said. The event could cost as much as $4 million.
   Kroc, widow of Ray Kroc and owner of the San Diego Padres, was
out of town Tuesday.
   ``I am proud to be part of this effort to promote international
understanding through cultural exchange,'' she said through a
spokeswoman.
   Kroc reserved the right to take back the money if it is not
spent by 1990, but could grant an extension of that deadline,
O'Connor said.

<HEAD>AG Sues Adoption Agency He Says Sold Babies To Highest Bidder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has filed a civil lawsuit against the
operators of an illegal adoption agency that amounted to ``a
large-scale baby selling business,'' State Attorney General Bob
Abrams said.
   The agency, based in New York City and in Scranton, Pa., sold
babies to the highest bidder for prices of up to $36,000, Abrams
charged Tuesday.
   The agency, Childhaven of Northeastern Pennsylvania, exploited
both the biological mothers and the adoptive parents, he said.
   Abrams did not file criminal charges against the operators of
the business, identified as Harriet and Lawrence Lauer of Brooklyn
and their attorney, Seymour Fenichel of Manhattan.
   The Lauers operated a similar business in Florida until 1982,
when a Dade County Circuit Court judge ordered them to stop,
according to Lanie Accles, a spokeswoman for the attorney general.
   ``We're looking for restitution for people who we feel were
charged unconscionable sums of money,'' Ms. Accles said.
   Ms. Accles would not identify the evidence found during a Monday
night search of the Lauer's home and could not say whether criminal
charges would be filed.
   Mrs. Lauer and Fenichel did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
   State Supreme Court Judge Leonard Cohen signed a temporary
restraining order barring Childhaven from continuing any illegal
adoption activities and freezing its assets, Abrams said.
   The Lauers have never been licensed by New York state to place
children for adoption and are no longer licensed in Pennsylvania,
Abrams said.

<HEAD>Verdict Set Aside in Audi Suit; Settlement Reached</HEAD>

   A judge has set aside a jury verdict
that the American importer of Audi automobiles was liable in a 1985
car accident, saying the jury had been influenced by media reports.
   Attorneys for both sides reached an agreement to settle the $3
million suit after Judge Matthew Coppola's action on Tuesday.
   Coppola's ruling came during the second trial stemming from the
accident. The first trial dealt with liability while the second
would have assessed damages.
   The judge issued an order of confidentiality barring discussion
of the case, but Thomas De Caro, the attorney for the plaintiff,
Marie Lynette Ruston, said, ``We're happy with the result.''
   Last Thursday, a jury found Volkswagen of America, Audi's
importer, liable for a 1985 three-car accident in which Ms. Ruston,
38, suffered back injuries that forced her to give up her nursing
career, according to testimony.
   Tuesday morning, Volkswagen of America attorney Edward Birnbaum
entered a motion to set aside the verdict, according to Joe
Bennett, a spokesman for Audi in Detroit.
   Bennett, quoting from court documents, said the judge granted
the motion ``for legal reasons,'' among them ``the exposure of the
jury to television and newspaper articles and the jury's
unauthorized discussion'' of the case and the reports.
   Bennett said it was learned that the jurors had been talking
among themselves about the case since the second day of the trial a
few weeks ago.
   However, he said he did not know if the jury had been made aware
of a jury verdict on June 14 _ two days before this panel's verdict
_ exonerating Audi from any liability in the 1986 death of a
6-year-old Canton boy.
   The boy was killed when his mother's Audi 5000 lunged forward
while she shifted gears and pinned him between the car and a garage
door. His parents had sued for $48 million.
   Ms. Ruston's accident happened on Jan. 24, 1985, at the drive-in
window of the Bank of New York in White Plains. A 1979 Audi driven
by Sally Mears of Scarsdale accelerated suddenly and struck one
car, which then hit Ms. Ruston's. The jury exonerated Ms. Mears and
blamed the accident on a defective transmission.

   A fireman was seriously burned by a
Molotov cocktail and 23 protesters were arrested during a night of
riots after police shut down an alternative culture center,
authorities said today.
   Basel police used tear gas and rubber bullets Tuesday night to
disperse about 1,000 demonstrators, some of whom threw stones and
Molotov cocktails, smashed windows of city buildings and set
garbage on fire.
   A city square near the culture center ressembled the remnants of
``a bomb attack,'' police chief Robert Heuss said.
   One fireman who was hit by a Molotov cocktail suffered
third-degree burns on his face and hands, police said. No injuries
were reported among the protesters.
   The violence came after police evicted about 60 squatters before
dawn Tuesday from an old city greenhouse complex housing the
center. The occupants had defied an official ultimatum to vacate
the site, which Basel residents decided in a May referendum to turn
into a park.

<HEAD>Spokesman Offers To Confront Radio Free Europe Staff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban has
offered to travel to Munich, West Germany, to confront the staff of
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe about what he calls distortions in
its Polish-language broadcasts.
   The president of Radio Free Europe, Gene Pell, said the station
accepts Urban's challenge and will accept an invitation to send
members of its staff to Poland.
   ``I am hereby announcing a proposal which I am addressing to ..
. the head of Radio Free Europe in Munich,'' Urban told a news
conference Tuesday.
   ``If you are not afraid of discussion about the role of Radio
Free Europe against the backdrop of the situation in Poland, then I
declare my readiness to come to Munich.''
   Urban added that staff members of the station could also come to
Poland.
   Pell issued a statement Tuesday night saying he welcomed Urban's
offer and planned to forward a formal invitation to Urban today.
   Pell said the station also would accept the offer to send staff
members to Warsaw.
   A secretary to Urban said today that he was not in the office so
could not comment immediately on Pell's reply.
   Jamming of Polish-language broadcasts of Radio Free Europe,
Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corp. ended Jan. 1.
The end of jamming was accompanied by a stepped-up Polish media
campaign against the stations, particularly Radio Free Europe.
   The station broadcasts uncensored news and commentary to Poland.
   Urban and the official press have accused it of inaccuracies and
waging psychological warfare against Poland. Specifically attacked
have been the station's reports after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, its coverage of price increases earlier this year and its
reports on strikes in Poland in April and May.
   In general, the station is accused of exaggerating Poland's
problems and inciting unrest.
   ``As a relic of the Cold War, Radio Free Europe is an obvious
anachronism,'' said a commentary today on the state-run news
service PAP. It ``misses the spirit of our times, new political ..
. thinking and the current trend in East-West relations.''
   In addition to direct attacks on the station, the government has
taken steps to demonstrate that it does not fear the broadcasts.
   For instance, Polish state radio has a weekly program in which
it repeats without comment excerpts of Western broadcasts. And the
communist party newspaper Trybuna Ludu has a new column in which it
reprints three or four quotes from government critics interviewed
on Western stations, followed by a pithy response in italics.
   Two emigre Poles employed by Radio Free Europe who moved back to
Poland were given highly publicized television interviews last week
in which they described the station's work.
   Estimates for the number of listeners vary. The government says
16 percent of Poles listen to Radio Free Europe at least
occasionally. Radio Free Europe puts the number at 59 percent.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Juno and the Paycock' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other reviews.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than six decades after it was written, Sean
O'Casey's ``Juno and the Paycock'' still has the power to move an
audience to laughter and tears.
   Both are present in the extraordinary yet remarkably
unsentimental revival which opened Tuesday at Broadway's Golden
Theater as part of the First New York International Festival of the
Arts.
   This straightforward production, from the Gate Theater in
Dublin, is tough and unrelenting as it tells the sad tale of the
bibulous Capt. Jack Boyle and his long-suffering wife Juno, who eke
out their lives in a Dublin tenement.
   The Boyle home _ a wonderful decrepit design by Frank Hallinan
Flood _ doesn't radiate warmth. It's a dismal place where shatterx ty.
He's a
foolish Everyman, evading employment and responsibility for his
wife and children.
   The florid-faced Donal McCann beautifully captures Boyle's
childish dreams, particularly after the character learns he has
inherited a great deal of money from a distant relative. It's the
salvation Boyle has been dreaming about but unwilling to work for.
Only after the inheritance has turned to dust does his foolishness
take on a poignant quality that turns to despair by the end of the
play.
   Boyle spends much of his time in the company of Joxer Daly, a
spectral figure who, in the Gate revival, resembles one of
Beckett's alienated creatures. The Beckett analogy is particularly
apt because of the startling performance by John Kavanagh, a crone
of a man who's as much of a scavanger as he is a lost soul.
   Still, there is a lot of humor in these characters' daily lives.
Boyle and Joxer have a long breakfast reverie in Act 1 that is one
of the comic highlights of the play. They rail against the world's
problems without coming up with any solutions.
   The captain stands in contrast to Juno, a sad, sensible woman
who worries about her daughter Mary, on strike from her job, and
son Johnny, a morose homebody whose arm was blown off during the
war for independence.
   Geraldine Plunkett has the resilience needed to convey Juno's
sense of survival and duty, while Rosemary Fine and Joe Savino
capture the unhappy, defeated lives of the Boyle children. Another
standout in the large cast is Maureen Potter as the boisterous
neighbor Maisie Madigan.
   Director Joe Dowling keeps the high spirits under control and
avoids the maudlin as the play builds toward its inevitable tragic
finale.
   ``Th' whole worl's in a terrible state o' chassis!'' says a
sodden Boyle who never could pronounce the word `chaos.' It's one
of his favorite refrains and reappears often during the play.
   Boyle mutters it as the curtain falls on the final act. It's to
the credit of this production that audiences can see the statement
not just as a metaphor for Ireland, but for a family whose center
no longer holds.
   In other reviews:
   Frank Rich of The New York Times called the production ``alive
at every level _ as boisterous comedy, as wrenching tragedy, as
blistering social commentary.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel writes that ``few plays capture
the soul of a nation as powerfully as `Juno and the Paycock.''' He
praises McCann as ``memorable'' and Kavanaugh as ``masterly,'' but
writes that ``the women are less strong.''
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post said the production is ``one
of the greatest nights the New York theater has seen in years. ...
the ironic mingling of tragedy and comedy _ and here O'Casey
demands comparison with Shakespeare _ has never been so much to the
life before.''

<TEXT>
   A woman whose campaign to raise
money for her son's liver transplants drew support from President
Reagan says the dismissal of a fine for improperly using the
donations has cleared her name.
   But a hearing officer's report says legal challenges remain open
to Maria DeSillers' use of the donated money.
   ``The decision means I have not done anything wrong,'' Ms.
DeSillers said at a news conference Tuesday after the civil fine
was dismissed.
   Florida's secretary of state had charged Ms. DeSillers in an
administrative complaint with using donations for personal expenses
and failing to register her 7-year-old son Ronnie's fund as a
charity.
   But Administrative Hearing Officer Donald Alexander on Tuesday
dropped the $1,000 fine, ruling the money was exempt from the
state's charity law because the money remaining in Ronnie's
accounts became part of his estate when he died April 29, 1987,
while awaiting a fourth liver transplant.
   Alexander emphasized he was not ruling on whether Ms. DeSillers
received or used the money legitimately, but only whether she was
required to register as a charity. He noted other court remedies
are available for those challenging her use of the money.
   The Miami woman is being sued by Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh, which is seeking $262,000 in unpaid hospital bills. She
contends she was not legally bound to pay the bill and that her son
received inadequate medical care.
   Ms. DeSillers also faces a criminal investigation by the Dade
County state attorney's office over her use of the donated money.
No charges have been filed in that case.
   A Dade County judge froze Ronnie's estate three months ago and
appointed an attorney to oversee the remaining money in the child's
accounts.
   Judge Francis J. Christie took the action after state
investigators reported Ms. DeSillers withrew at least $47,000 in
donations to buy jewelry, clothing and furniture and spent $270,624
without a judge's permission or authority.
   Ms. DeSillers dismissed questions Tuesday about jewelry she
bought with donated money, saying funds collected for Ronnie and
funds collected for the Ronnie DeSillers Foundation, which paid her
a salary, were different.
   ``The state has nothing to show my side of it. I will be
vindicated in the end,'' she said.
   Fund-raising for Ronnie attracted $660,000 in donations,
including $1,000 from President Reagan.

<HEAD>Sentenced Pilot Key Witness Against Noriega, Prosecutors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot sentenced to nine years in prison on
drug-smuggling charges would be the major witness against Manuel
Antonio Noriega if the Panamanian general ever comes here to face a
federal drug indictment.
   Floyd Carlton Caceres was sentenced after pleading guilty to one
count of conspiracy to import cocaine, Chief Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Gregorie said Tuesday.
   ``If Gen. Noriega comes to trial at some future time, this
defendant will be the key witness against him,'' Gregorie said.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney Aronovitz sentenced Carlton late
Monday to the 9-year term, but Carlton could be released on parole
after serving three years.
   The prosecutor reviewed for the judge Carlton's role in the
Noriega indictment. Carlton has been held at the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami since his
extradition from Costa Rica.
   Carlton's testimony before a Miami grand jury was crucial in
indicting Noriega in February, and he even donned a black hood to
tell a U.S. Senate panel how Noriega protected Colombian drug lords.
   Carlton told authorities he personally flew arms to Central
American leftists for Noriega and brought cocaine shipments into
Panama.
   In February, the Panamanian-born Carlton told the Senate
committee that Noriega contracted in 1982 to protect drug flights
of the notorious Colombia-based Medellin cartel, responsible for up
to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports.
   ``We did nothing without his approval,'' Carlton said of Noriega
during the hearing.
   Carlton said he acted as a go-between for the cartel and
Noriega, even recounting how the general laughed off the smugglers'
original $30,000 offer for landing rights in Panama.
   ``He told me that if these people thought he was begging, they
were wrong,'' the Spanish-speaking Carlton testified through a
translator.
   Noriega eventually received up to $200,000 a flight, said the
pilot, who said he personally flew several flights from Colombia to
Panama.
   Carlton also told Congress that Noriega personally authorized
air shipments of weapons to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador and
the rebel Sandinistas in Nicaragua before they overthrew the
government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979. Carlton said he
also made some of those flights.
   The pilot was eventually accused by the cartel of stealing a
cocaine shipment; at the same time drug agents in Florida
intercepted a flight by an associate, who named him as a fellow
smuggler.
   Carlton tried to make a deal with U.S. authorities without
surrendering, but was eventually lured to Costa Rica, where he was
arrested and extradited.

   Israeli troops captured four Palestinian
guerrillas trying to sneak into Israel before dawn today to attack
a northern civilian settlement, the army said.
   It was the 15th infiltration or attempted infiltration since an
Arab uprising began in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip on Dec.8.
   Three of the Palestinians were wounded in a brief firefight
before the squad surrendered, but the Israeli troops suffered no
casualties, an army spokesman said.
   The guerrillas belonged to the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine headed by George Habash, Israel radio said.
   They were captured in southern Lebanon, north of Israel's
self-declared ``security zone'' and opposite the Israeli border
settlement of Kfar Yuval, three miles northeast of Kiryat Shmona,
the army said.
   In a brief communique, the army said its troops ``foiled an
attempt by a guerrilla squad which tried to infiltrate Israel and
launch a terror attack against one of the civilian settlements in
the north.''
   The attempted penetration came on a day of general strikes in
the occupied territories and a call by Palestinian underground
leaders to set fires to Israeli factories and farmlands.
   The guerrillas were armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled
grenades, hand grenades and explosives, the army spokesman said,
adding that they also carried food supplies.
   Israel established the ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon in
the summer of 1985. About 1,000 Israeli troops currently patrol the
mostly Moslem area along with Israel's Lebanese ally, the
predominantly Christian South Lebanon Army.

<HEAD>Greenpeace Ship Returns After Clash With Incinerator Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greenpeace ship headed back to port today after
its radar and radio were damaged in a clash with a vessel that had
been burning Spanish toxic waste in the North Sea, the organization
said.
   The environmental group said that although it failed to stop the
vessel, it had succeeded in publicizing the problem of burning
toxic waste.
   ``We have highlighted what is being attempted here _ the burning
off in the North Sea only 100 miles from the coast of Britain and
the Netherlands waste which the Spanish firmly believe is too
damaging to burn off their coast,'' said Andy Booth, Greenpeace's
North Sea campaigner.
   He spoke from aboard the Moby Dick.
   The confrontation came in the North Sea about 100 miles off
England's eastern coast Tuesday after two Greenpeace activists
tried to climb aboard the Liberia-registered incinerator ship
Vulcanus II.
   Booth said that as Phillip Cade and Hugh Stirling tried to board
the ship, crew members released high-pressure water hoses on them.
Cade and Stirling were pushed into the sea and the Moby Dick's
electrical equipment and bridge were damaged.
   The two men were not seriously hurt.
   Booth said the Moby Dick was headed for Great Yarmouth, England.
He said his group would try to repair the ship as soon as possible
to return to the area.

<TEXT>
   Government troops battled communist
rebels near Clark Air Base and killed the guerrilla who allegedly
masterminded an attack against U.S. servicemen last year, the
government news agency reported today.
   The agency said shooting continued sporadically for nine hours
as soldiers chased an unknown number of New People's Army
guerrillas through a sugar cane field about five miles from the
base Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, suspected communist rebels killed a policeman in a
Manila suburb today, police said. On Tuesday, unidentified men
killed the mayor of a nearby town as he arrived at a suburban
hospital to seek medication for his arthritic wife, police said.
   In a separate development, Vice President Salvador Laurel asked
President Corazon Aquino today to convene the National Security
Council to formulate an official stand on the future of U.S.
military bases in the Philippines.
   ``We should close ranks on this issue because the stakes
involved are crucial and they affect the very future of our
people,'' Laurel said in a letter to Mrs. Aquino. Copies of the
letter were distributed to reporters by Laurel's office.
   Laurel said convening the council, the country's highest
advisory group on security matters, was necessary because of
conflicting statements by government officials on the future of
Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and four smaller installations.
   Some officials have said they are against renewing the 1947
lease on the bases when it expires in 1991, while others say they
favor extending the lease provided the United States increases
military and economic aid.
   Mrs. Aquino has said she will respect the agreement until 1991
but is keeping her options open on what to do afterward.
   Officials at the central Luzon regional military command said
initially that two rebels were killed in the fighting near Clark
but reported later that only one rebel was slain. They said the
oTher dead person was a girl caught in the crossfire.
   A statement from the command identified the slain rebel only by
his alias, ``Ka (Comrade) Aries.'' It said he was allegedly one of
the hitmen who killed three Americans and a Filipino in attacks in
October near Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.
   The Philippine News Agency later quoted Lt. Col. Amado Espino,
chief of the Philippine Constabulary command in Angeles city, as
saying that a captured rebel had identified Ka Aries as ``the one
who masterminded'' the Oct. 28 attacks.
   The rebels have claimed responsibility for the killings and have
threatened more attacks on American targets because of continued
U.S. military assistance to the Aquino government.
   Military officials said Tuesday's clash began when troops
arrived at the cane field after being tipped off about the rebels'
presence in the area. They said a helicopter and an armored
personnel carrier were brought in three hours later.
   Police in the Manila suburb of Las Pinas said Angelito Miranda
died immediately when five unidentified men sprayed him with
automatic rifle fire in the lobby of the Perpetual Help Medical
Center. He suffered 21 bullet wounds, police said.
   Miranda was mayor of the town of Bacoor in nearby Cavite
province. His wife escaped unhurt, but a hospital security guard
was wounded in the shooting, police said.
   The assailants escaped in a waiting car.
   Gonzales said police have ruled out the possibility that
communist rebels killed Miranda. He reported members of Miranda's
family as saying they suspected personal motives behind the
slaying, but he did not elaborate.
   In neighboring Pasay City, five suspected communist gunmen
killed Patrolman Danilo Laberez today at a busy intersection near
the domestic airport terminal, police said.
   Communist guerrillas have been blamed for the slayings of about
200 people in the Manila area since January 1987.

<HEAD>Fire Near Coptic Monastery Kills 47 Pilgrims, Mostly Children</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASSIUT, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire set off by sparks from a cooking
booth swept through a city of tents housing thousands of Coptic
Christians attending a religious festival, police said. Forty-seven
people were killed.
   The victims, most of them children, either died in the blaze or
were trampled to death in the rush to escape, a senior police
official said.
   The fire broke out late Tuesday in the tent city at the foot of
the al-Muharraq Monastery in al-Qusiyyah, north of this southern
provincial capital, authorities said.
   The fire began when sparks from a makeshift food booth touched
some tents, igniting them and setting off a chain reaction in which
about three dozen butane lamps exploded, the police official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the booth's two owners,
both Copts, were arrested.
   Witnesses said monks quickly closed the monastery's massive door
when the fire broke out. This caused panic-stricken pilgrims, who
initially dashed to the building for refuge, to turn back and rush
to the gate of the fenced tent city.
   ``There was was a big rush from the pilgrims towards the main
gate of the camp. Some children fell and were trampled to death,''
the police official said.
   The police official said 26 children, 15 men and six women died
in the blaze. He said 15 people were injured trying to escape.
   The monastery, a 10-acre compound with 70 to 80 monks in
residence, was not damaged.
   Foul play was not suspected in the fire.
   The police official said authorities had authorized burial of
the dead, which in Egypt is allowed only when the cause of death is
not in question and a corpse is not required for criminal
investigation.
   ``The fire caught us by surprise,'' said a survivor, one of the
pilgrims. The man appeared dazed and refused to give his name.
   ``There wasn't enough water in the tent city to extinguish the
fire. Apparently there was no fire-fighting equipment at the
monastery,'' said the survivor.
   Fire engines were summoned from nearby villages and eight of
them arrived on the scene ``a full hour after the fire started,''
he said.
   A preliminary police report estimated damage at $420,000.
   The monastery is built at the site of a cave where tradition
says Joseph, Mary and the infant Jesus took shelter on their flight
into Egypt. The Holy Family left Palestine after King Herod ordered
all male children killed.
   The church, inside the monastery, is among the oldest in Egypt,
although its exact origins are unknown. The name of the monastery
means ``The Burnt Monastery.''
   The pilgrims were at an annual festival dedicated to the Virgin
Mary.
   About 50,000 people customarily celebrate the Feast of the
Consecration of the Church of the Virgin held every June 21-28. But
Tuesday, only about 5,000 pilgrims were inside the tent city near
the monastery.
   Formerly a Christian stronghold, the Assiut area has become in
recent years a hotbed of Moslem fundamentalist militancy. Several
times, Moslem extremists have attacked Coptic Christian shops.
   Unlike many early Coptic monasteries built in desert isolation,
al-Muharraq is along a relatively well-traveled route near the Nile
River about 35 miles north of Assiut. The provincial capital is 240
miles south of Cairo.
   The Coptic Orthodox church is reputed to be the oldest community
in Christendom. It traces its origins to the disciple St. Mark, who
tradition says founded a congregation in Alexandria in the first
century.

<HEAD>Neighbor Arrested In Tree Chopping To Clear Up Satellite Reception</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDDING, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An admitted television addict has been
charged with cutting down a neighbor's tree that apparently stood
between his satellite dish and clear reception of the Disney
Channel.
   Arthur Anderson, a 59-year-old construction worker, has been
charged with second-degree criminal mischief and third-degree
criminal trespassing in the June 12 incident, according to Redding
police officer Brian T. Jones.
   He's scheduled to appear in court July 1.
   Charles Marriner, a 62-year-old financial analyst, awoke that
Sunday morning to discover the 50-foot tall oak tree lying on its
side on his wooded property.
   ``It's very unfortunate to think that someone can walk on your
property and cut something down that took 80 or 90 years to grow,''
Marriner said.
   ``I've heard of people who have satellite dishes around here but
cutting down somebody's tree for better reception goes a little
above and beyond,'' said Patrolman John Leonard.
   Anderson claimed that the tree felling, spotted by several
children playing nearby, was a mistake.
   ``I didn't know whose property I was on,'' Anderson said.
   He also said the lure of distant television signals via the
satellite dish is all-consuming.
   ``That dish has caused me more problems. We're TV addicts. Me
and my wife watch it all the time. Disney, baseball, the Yankees,
we pick it all up. I got bicycle races on now. You've never seen
anything like it,'' Anderson said.
   He said he has gotten telephone calls from supporters who have
asked him to cut down trees that are blocking their satellite
signals.
   ``I got one from a girl who said she wanted to be able to get
the Disney Channel, too,'' he said.
   Anderson said he has offered to pay Marriner $500 in damages and
to haul away the dead tree in exchange for his neighbor dropping
the charges. Marriner has refused.
   ``The scoundrel. He knew what he was doing. We're all just lucky
it didn't fall on somebody,'' Marriner said.

<TEXT>
   New Jersey Democrats defused a
growing party dispute by increasing Jesse Jackson's delegation at
the Democratic National Convention next month in Atlanta.
   The compromise reached Tuesday night between supporters of
Jackson and Michael Dukakis gives Jackson eight more delegates, in
addition to the nine delegates he won in the June 7 primary.
   Jackson's supporters felt he deserved more than nine delegates
because he won 33 percent of the popular vote.
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who was elected as one of the Jackson
delegates, said he was confident his candidate's voice will be
heard at the convention.
   ``Those of us who support and worked hard for Jesse Jackson go
to the Democratic Convention in Atlanta next month are optimistic
that many of the goals and principles of the Jackson campaign will
be embodied within the Democratic party platform,'' James said.
   He said state Democrats must work after the convention to change
New Jersey's winner-take-all delegate system that left Jackson with
33 percent of the popular vote but only 12 percent of the delegates.
   ``We need to restructure our delegate districts more fairly so
that the strength of urban voters is not diluted,'' James said.
   State Democratic leaders also voted to send Acadamy
Award-winning actress Olympia Dukakis to the convention next month
in Atlanta as an at-large delegate for Dukakis, her cousin.

   A funeral home director said customers
who didn't pay for funerals they ordered were to blame for his
failure to bury 44 bodies found in his funeral home earlier this
month.
   Investigators discovered the decomposing remains stashed in
closets, hearses and storage rooms at the closed Howell Morning
Glory Chapel.
   Lewis J. Howell was charged Tuesday with 42 criminal counts,
including six felony counts alleging he accepted money from
individuals for burial services that were never performed.
   He was also charged with 36 misdemeanor counts alleging fraud
and failure to perform the duties of a licensed funeral home
director. Virgil Green, city Welfare Division chief, said officials
have evidence that Howell billed the city $100 each for four
cremations that he didn't perform.
   Howell wasn't charged in some cases because they fell outside
the statute of limitations. At least two of the people died as long
ago as 1978.
   If convicted of all charges, Howell faces up to 30 years in
prison.
   ``People came in and made arrangements and never came back
again,'' Howell said in an interview broadcast Tuesday by
Jacksonville radio station WOKV.
   Howell's wife, Margaret, said her husband was too proud to admit
he had a problem and even hid what was going on from her. She said
her husband buried the bodies of indigents covered under a city
contract.

<HEAD>Fans, Youths Attack Police After German Defeat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten policemen were reported injured
today as soccer fans and youth gangs battled in Hamburg after the
Netherlands' victory over West Germany in the European soccer
championships, authorities said.
   Bernd Metterhausen, spokesman for the Hamburg police, said a
gang of about 1,000 German fans clashed in a red-light district of
this northern city. The unrest continued into the early hours today.
   The Reeperbahn, an area of Hamburg noted for its sex cinemas and
peep shows, was lined with police vans as about 600 riot police,
some with dogs, restored order.
   The officers, in helmets and shields, made at least 30 arrests,
police said.
   Several hundred Dutch fans, who were celebrating the 2-1 victory
Tuesday night that will put their team into the finals of the
tournament, appeared to be taking no part in the violence.
   In Aachen, near the Dutch border, one drunken Dutch fan fell to
his death from his hotel room early today, Metterhausen said.
   Metterhausen said the clashes began shortly before midnight,
when fans returning from the match began attacking the police.
   ``We were dealing with that incident when a gang of punks, who
live in the harbor area of the city, came up to the Reeperbahn and
also joined in,'' Metterhausen said.
   The German groups _ including right-wing extremists and rival
leftists _ also attacked each other, with police officers caught in
the middle, officials said.

<DATELINE>LITTLETON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 300-pound black bear who stumped police
and entranced onlookers by spending the day in a downtown tree
headed back to the woods early today.
   ``That poor bear wasn't going to come down in the day,''
firefighter Bill Sargent said. ``It was just waiting for night and
for everyone to get away.''
   The police had planned to wait until today to decide what to do
about the bear; they hoped it would leave by itself. They found the
tree empty when they cruised by at about 1:30 a.m.
   ``I don't know what the townspeople will do for excitement
today, though,'' Sargent said. The tree was about 500 feet from
town hall in this northern New Hampshire community of about 6,000
residents.
   The treed bear drew a crowd of spectators on Tuesday, including
children on their first day out of school.
   While officers made sure no one got close enough to get into
trouble if the bear decided to come down during daylight, the
dispatcher at headquarters was busy with calls from people who had
ideas on how to get the bear down.
   ``My phone has been ringing off the hook with suggestions,''
said the dispatcher, who declined to give her name. ``One person
said to get a long pole, tie a rag on the end and dip it in honey''
to coax the animal down.
   ``Another said `Use ice cream. Bears love ice cream.'
   ``And one suggested climbing the tree, and believe it or not,
just talking the bear down like you would a child or your pet,''
she said.
   Chief Louis Babin said it's likely the bear had visited the tree
before and had not been noticed.
   This time, one of his officers saw the animal on the street
early Tuesday, and Babin said the cruiser's light may have spooked
it and sent it up the tree.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Way Texas Courts Administer Death Penalty Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld the way Texas
courts administer that state's death penalty law, dashing the hopes
of more than 260 death row inmates.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that convicted murderer and
rapist Donald Gene Franklin properly was sentenced to death for a
1975 crime in San Antonio.
   The court said jurors deciding whether Franklin should be
sentenced to death or to life in prison did not need more guidance
on how to weigh ``mitigating circumstances,'' those factors
suggesting that life in prison is the appropriate punishment.
   The instructions given to jurors in Franklin's sentencing trial
are similar to those typically used in Texas.
   Writing the court's main opinion, Justice Byron R. White
rejected Franklin's argument that jurors were not given a chance
during his sentencing trial to consider any ``residual doubt'' they
might have had about his guilt.
   White rejected other arguments raised by Franklin as well,
concluding that the Texas death penalty system passes
constitutional muster.
   Under Texas law, capital case sentencing juries are asked two
key questions _ whether the murder was committed deliberately and
whether the killer poses a continuing, violent threat to society.
   If the jurors unanimously conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that the answer to both questions is ``yes'' a death sentence is
imposed.
   But Franklin wanted the judge who presided over his sentencing
trial to explain more fully to the jurors how they should consider
mitigating evidence.
   And he argued that the jurors wrongly were limited to
considering the mitigating evidence in determining a defendant's
future dangerousness, and not for some other reason.
   ``Because we do not believe that the jury instructions or the
(questions presented to jurors) precluded jury consideration of any
relevant mitigating circumstances in this case, or otherwise
unconstitutionally limited the jury's discretion here, we reject
(Franklin's) challenge to his death sentence,'' White said.
   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Harry A. Blackmun voted to
uphold the state's death penalty system for different reasons,
spelled out in a concurring opinion authored by O'Connor.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   The ruling is not expected to have any impact beyond Texas'
borders.
   Of the 37 states with death penalty laws, 33 provide for jury
participation in the sentencing. Of those 33, only Texas does not
require explanatory jury instructions about mitigating evidence.
   Franklin, 36, already has had three trials and four execution
dates. He had been a convicted rapist when convicted of the July
1975 abduction and murder of Mary Margaret Moran, a 27-year-old
nurse.
   Franklin was arrested hours after Ms. Moran's disappearance from
a hospital parking lot but he refused to tell police where he had
left her.
   Search parties combed San Antonio but it took four days to find
her, bleeding in a bed of insects and suffering from irreversible
shock. She died the next day.

   A car bomb exploded in Christian east
Beirut today, killing one person and wounding 18 and setting six
shops on fire, police reported.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the car bomb blew up at 11 a.m. in the Karantina
district.
   The explosion, the sixth car bombing in Lebanon this year, also
damaged six cars, the spokesman said.
   Fire engines and ambulances raced to the scene as police experts
examined the remains of the car that contained the explosives.
   The Voice of Lebanon radio said black smoke billowed from the
site of the explosion.
   By police count, 93 people have been killed and 233 wounded in
the five earlier car bombings this year. There have been no claims
of responsibility for any of the bombings.
   Also in Beirut today, Yasser Arafat's guerrillas said they beat
back attacks by Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising in Beirut's
devastated refugee camps of Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh, as
fighting raged with howitzers and rockets.
   Police said at least five people were killed and 16 wounded in
the battles between Arafat's Fatah faction, the main component of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the radical,
Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising.
   That raised the known casualty toll since fighting flared 13
days ago to 51 killed and 204 wounded.
   The rival Palestinian factions are fighting for control of south
Beirut's shantytowns.
   Lebanon has been torn for 13 years by a civil war that has mosty
pitted Moslem against Christian militias.

<HEAD>Oklahoma Man's Death Sentence Upheld Despite Judge's Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bitterly divided Supreme Court today upheld,
by a 5-4 vote, an Oklahoma man's murder conviction and death
sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to exclude
one juror.
   The justices said Bobby Lynn Ross' conviction for killing an
Oklahoma policeman was not tainted because his lawyer used a
``peremptory challenge'' to oust the juror.
   ``So long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the
defendant had to use a peremptory challenge to achieve that result
does not mean'' his constitutional right to a fair trial was
violated, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   But Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the four dissenters,
said, ``A man's life is at stake. We should not be playing games.
In this case, everyone concedes that the trial judge could not
arbitrarily take away one of the defendant's peremptory challenges.
Yet that is in effect exactly what happened here.''
   The justices heard a first round of arguments in the Oklahoma
case last January, a month before Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined
the court.
   They scheduled a second round of arguments in April so Kennedy
could participate in the decision _ a move indicating that the
eight justices had been evenly divided.
   Kennedy's vote, in which he joined the chief justice's opinion,
indeed proved to control Ross' fate.
   Prosecutors said Ross shot Elk City, Okla., Police Sgt. Steven
Mahan three times in the head after the officer arrived at a motel
being robbed by Ross on Jan. 5, 1983. The murder weapon was found
in Ross' pocket.
   During jury selection at Ross' trial, one potential juror said
he would vote to impose the death penalty _ and would not consider
a life sentence _ if Ross were convicted.
   Ross' lawyer attempted to have the person disqualified ``for
cause'' but the trial judge refused. The defense lawyer then used
one of nine peremptory, or automatic, challenges to oust the
potential juror.
   Ross contended that his right to a fair and impartial jury had
been violated becaused the judge's error forced the defense team to
expend one peremptory challenge unnecessarily.
   Writing for the court today, Rehnquist said the trial judge
clearly was wrong in not excluding the potential juror for cause.
But he said that error does not entitle Ross to a new trial.
   ``Although we agree that the failure to remove (the potential
juror) may have resulted in a jury panel different from that which
would otherwise have decided the case, we do not accept the
argument that this possibility mandates reversal,'' Rehnquist said.
   Quoting from a previous high court ruling, Rehnquist said, ``The
Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a
perfect one.''
   Aside from Kennedy, Rehnquist was joined by Justices Antonin
Scalia, Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Marshall was joined in dissent by Justices William J. Brennan,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The case is Ross vs. Oklahoma, 86-5309.

   Republican George Bush said today he will continue to criticize
Democrat Michael Dukakis' record because ``people need to know''
their differences. Dukakis held private talks with Jesse Jackson
about the vice presidential nomination, pledging an ``open'' search
for a running mate.
   As Dukakis begins his search in earnest, some members of
Congress say privately that placing the civil rights leader on the
ticket could seriously jeopardize chances of defeating Bush.
   Bush, still weeks away from having to pick his own running mate,
is concentrating on rallying enthusiasm for his candidacy.
   Aboard Air Force Two enroute to Kentucky today, Bush said his
likely fall opponent has waffled on major issues.
   ``People need to know. Where's the guy coming from? I can't
count on others to do this. I've got to spell it out and then get
surrogates, those other people who believe as I do, to spell it
out,'' Bush told reporters.
   Bush denied he was engaging in name-calling and said, ``It's the
record.''
   On Tuesday, Bush said ``I'm convinced we can carry the day''
despite his poor standing in the polls. He uttered his prediction
in a session with the 46 Republican senators in Washington.
   Dukakis emerged from a 40-minute meeting with Jackson in
California and said, ``the process has now begun'' that will lead
him to pick a running mate.
   At the same time, sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Dukakis' campaign has begun public polling to determine which
running mate will enhance his chances of winning the White House.
In the meantime, campaign officials have asked Jackson, Florida
Sen. Bob Graham and possibly others to provide background material
about themselves for review.
   Dukakis and his aides have avoided talking publicly about the
search for a running mate as much as possible in part because they
want public attention focused on the campaign's public themes.
   Neither Dukakis nor Jackson would say exactly what they talked
about. Nor would the Massachusetts governor say whether his closest
pursuer in the primary campaign had asked for the No. 2 slot on the
ticket.
   Jackson said they discussed the vice presidency ``to some
measure'' during the meeting and he repeated his assertion that
``our constituency deserves consideration.''
   ``We talk about lots of things when we talk,'' Dukakis said at a
news conference following the session. ``I don't talk about private
conversations.''
   Dukakis didn't say so, but sources in Washington disclosed that
his emissary, Paul Brountas, received strong advice last week not
to place Jackson on the ticket. These sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Brountas was urged to tell Dukakis
that a southerner or westerner with experience in the areas of
defense and foreign policy would enhance the party's chances the
most in the fall.
   ``He was told, `You can basically write it off in terms of the
election if you pick Jackson,''' said one congressman who met with
Brountas, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At the same time, sources disclosed Dukakis has asked for
background information on at least two possible vice presidential
contenders, Jackson and Graham.
   Sen. Bill Bradley's office disclosed that the New Jersey
lawmaker has not received such a request, even though he has been
mentioned as a possible running mate.
   Other names that crop up in speculation about Dukakis' ticket
mate include Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia; John Glenn of Ohio and
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, as well as Reps. Tom Foley of Washington
and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   While most of the attention was focused on Dukakis, Bush got a
boost from President Reagan, and a public show of support from the
Republicans in the Senate.
   Reagan made light of the prospect that Dukakis might move into
the White House next January, saying, ``Over my live body.''
   His aides passed the word that the president is making plans to
spend two days a week campaigning on Bush's behalf beginning in the
fall.
   The vice president met for lunch with GOP senators, who later
said they expressed their concern about the polls showing Dukakis
with a double-digit lead.
   They offered their help ``like a bunch of trout ready to jump
out of the water,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, the No. 2 Republican in
the Senate.
   Bush conceded the poll showings, but said, ``They don't bother
me.
   ``I'm convinced we can carry the day. I am not going to be
out-hustled by Michael Dukakis, I can guarantee you,'' he said.
   Bush has said he intends to wait until Dukakis fills his ticket
at the Democratic National Convention in July before selecting his
own vice presidential running mate.
   Both Bush and Dukakis have more than enough delegates to win the
major party presidential nominations this summer.
   But the issue has moved front and center in the Democratic
campaign, in part because that party's convention is only a few
weeks away, and in part because Jackson has mounted a public
attempt to assure that he is at least offered a spot on the ticket.
   ``We talked about it more than we have talked about it (before)
person to person,'' Jackson said of the vice presidential question.
   Dukakis repeated earlier statements that he has begun looking at
vice presidential nominees but has made no decisions yet.
   ``The process has now begun. But it's open. There's no short
list, or medium list or long list,'' Dukakis said.
   ``There's no understanding (with Jackson),'' Dukakis continued.
``He himself has said it's up to the nominee to make that decision.
I agree with him.''

   A melee erupted among a crowd of youths
applying for summer jobs today and one teen-ager was shoved through
a large store window, authorities said.
   ``It was a little misunderstanding,'' police officer J.A.
Pickens said of the ruckus among those applying for the Governor's
Summer Youth Jobs Program.
   The group of more than 200 quieted down after they were ordered
by police to form a single line, officers said.
   The boy who was pushed through the window suffered only minor
cuts, Pickens said, adding that authorities didn't know his
identity.
   Parents at the downtown temporary job office said they were
angered that the application procedures caused problesm.
   ``They ought to have so many come in each day instead of having
all this mess,'' said Olin Joplin.

who fired at them received a $25,000 reward.
   Carol Fayne, 56, and Michael Fabian Smith, 36, collected the

<HEAD>Vietnam Decides To Change Leadership On A Regular Basis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Do Muoi, who has directed purges
against corruption in Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, was chosen
today as the country's prime minister, the official Radio Hanoi
said.
   Do Muoi, 71, was elected on the opening day of the National
Assembly, said the broadcast, monitored in Bangkok. He replaces
Pham Hung, who died in March.
   A party communique, meanwhile, said Vietnam's Communist Party
has decided to regularly change its leadership to improve
efficiency and better the economy.
   The communique said the party Central Committee's fifth plenum
decided that every time the party elects members to its upper
echelons, one-third of the seats will change hands.
   Do Muoi is the third-ranking member of the Politburo, the top
policy-making body.
   Little known to most Vietnamese, Do Muoi gave up the vice
premiership last year when he became the No. 2 man in the party
secretariat, where a major responsibility was directing a purge of
inept and corrupt elements in the 1.8-million-member Communist
Party. Before that, the veteran revolutionary had a long list of
key party and government jobs.
   The Central Committee is the policy-implementing arm of the most
powerful party organ, the Politburo. The committee had 124 full
members and 49 alternate members when it was elected in December
1986.
   A text of the plenum communique, carried by the official
domestic Radio Hanoi Tuesday, was obtained from a Western embassy
in Bangkok. The June 14-20 plenum was convened to prepare for
today's National Assembly session.
   A separate Radio Hanoi broadcast said Tuesday that the assembly
would take up the ``very hot issue'' of how to resolve the crisis
in grain production. Vietnam has asked the international community
for emergency aid to offset serious food shortages resulting from a
series of crop failures last year.
   Since the party was founded in 1930, its leaders have largely
been veterans of the revolutionary struggle against the French
colonialists and then the Americans and South Vietnam. Lately, the
party set economic reform as its No. 1 priority and says
incompetent party members with outdated ways of thinking can no
longer remain in powerful positions.
   The plenum communique says the party will ``combine elderly
cadres with young cadres, avoid renovating and rejuvenating the
contingent of cadres for the sake of formality by referring only to
ages and academic degrees, and overcome the class ideology and
hierarchy.''
   Party committee secretaries generally will not remain in their
posts for more than 10 years, it adds.
   The communique says managers of state and business enterprises
and leading cadres of mass organizations need not be party members.
In the past, such positions have normally gone to party members.
   It says competent cadres in local areas should be brought to
central-level agencies and ``those cadres who have no ability and
quality to perform assigned duties must be relieved of of their
leading positions.''
   There has been a major ``purification'' campaign in the 1.8
million-member party, including large-scale purges, since Linh came
to power in December 1986.
   The communique said while most party members retained their
revolutionary qualities, ``the fighting will of quite a number of
cadres and party members has declined and their revolutionary
ideals have faded, making them degenerate and deviant.''

   Republican George Bush today denied he was
engaging in name-calling in his attacks on rival Michael Dukakis
and said he will continue to set the record straight on the
differences between the two presidential contenders.
   ``It's the record _ what he favors and what I favor. It's not
name-calling,'' Bush said aboard Air Force Two en route to
Louisville, Ky., where he was scheduled to address the National
Sheriffs Association.
   Bush said he hasn't seen much emphasis in news reports or
Democratic statements on the differences between himself and the
Massachusetts governor.
   ``Yet they are there. If people like that kind of thing, they'll
vote for him,'' he said referring to Dukakis' vagueness.
   Bush added that he will continue to ``spell it (the differences)
out and then get surrogates, those other people who believe as I
do, to spell it out.''
   On Tuesday, Senate Republicans, concerned about recent polls
showing Bush trailing Dukakis by 10 or 12 points, promised the vice
president they would campaign on his behalf.
   ``We're all politicians. We see a poll that shows that kind of
thing, we get excited and say, `Hey, what can we do?''' Sen. Alan
Simpson, Wyo., said after a meeting between Bush and the Senate GOP
in the Capitol.
   ``We're ready to go like a bunch of trout ready to jump out of
the water. We're going to get out our assignments and spread out
across the country,'' said Simpson, deputy Senate Republican leader
and a close friend of Bush's.
   The Bush campaign, which has curtailed sharply the vice
president's travel plans because it is nearing the federal limit on
pre-convention spending, is relying heavily on ``surrogate
speakers,'' including Republican senators.
   On Tuesday, Bush renewed his attack on Dukakis for supporting a
prison furlough system under which the vice president claimed
convicted murderers were released on weekend passes, and he accused
Dukakis of seeking to confuse the issue.
   Asked by reporters about statements by Dukakis that many other
states had such programs, including California while Ronald Reagan
was governor, Bush said: ``It's my understanding that none, except
Massachusetts, had furlough programs for first-degree murderers.''
   ``He can obfuscate it, confuse it all he wants. But the facts
are as I stated them. And I'm very interested in his response,''
Bush said.
   Reacting to Bush's statemement, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach
said there are ``a number of other states that grant furloughs for
first-degree murderers'' and that Massachusetts is no longer among
them.
   ``George Bush is using the furlough issue as a smokescreen to
hide the fact that he has no record on crime and drugs,'' Dach said.
   At Tuesday's GOP luncheon, Bush declared to a standing ovation:
``I'm convinced we can carry the day. I am not going to be
out-hustled by Michael Dukakis, I can guarantee you.''
   He was presented a letter signed by all 46 Senate Republicans
expressing their confidence in his victory in November but stating,
``we take nothing for granted.''
   The letter was inside a large white mailbox, with ``G & B Bush,
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue'' emblazoned on it. The `G & B' stands for
George and Barbara and the address is that of the White House.
   The letter from Republicans said, ``We realize it will be a
tough fight on the 1988 campaign trail. But there are some heavy
hitters in this room who wanted to let you know they'll be with you
every step of the way.''
   Speaking with reporters afterward, Bush said, ``I came out of
there feeling 20 feet high.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who pulled out of
the GOP race in late March and endorsed Bush, told reporters:
``This wasn't just an endorsement, it was a willingness to say
we're available, send us where he wants. We're ready to go.''
   Earlier, Bush met in his office at the Old Executive Office
Building with a presidential task force on drug interdiction and
called for greater emphasis on intelligence resources in the war on
drugs, claiming that the intelligence currently available was ``not
totally satisfactory.''
   Bush also issued a statement Tuesday in which he praised _ and
sought to take credit for _ the vow by the industrial democracies
at the economic summit in Toronto to set up a seven-country task
force on drugs and money-laundering.
   ``This is an idea that I proposed following (Canadian) Prime
Minister (Brian) Mulroney's most recent visit to Washington,'' Bush
said. ``I am pleased these ideas have been implemented.''

   The government today ordered a
dusk-to-dawn curfew, banned public meetings and closed more schools
after at least nine people were killed as thousands of students
battled riot police.
   Police arrested 77 people, the government radio announced.
   The radio said six policemen and three demonstrators were killed
and that 10 students and three women were among those arrested.
Dozens were injured, it said.
   The radio said the restrictions would last until Aug. 19.
   On Tuesday, students from the Rangoon Arts and Science
University surged into the streets after authorities closed that
and other institutions.
   The students had for the past week been peacefully demonstrating
for the release of detained students and the legalization of
student unions.
   The one-party regime of Ne Win did not give in to the demands,
and as it did against similar rioting in March, dispatched security
units to swiftly quell the disturbances.
   Ne Win, a socialist, has ruled this Southeast Asian nation with
an iron hand since seizing power in a 1962 military coup.
   The government earlier said five policemen were killed and 26
seriously wounded ``as a result of an attack by an unruly mob armed
with swords, sticks and catapults.''
   It said one rioter was killed and several wounded.
   Government radio said the mob set fire to one police station and
the family quarters of another station and damaged government-owned
movie theaters and traffic lights.
   Authorities today suspended classes at three more institutions
where students had staged peaceful rallies: the Institute of
Medicine, the Institute of Dental Science and the Rangoon Institute
of Technology.
   There was no apparent extra security on the streets, which were
calm but with less traffic. Few people went to offices or schools.
Markets were open but had few customers. Local officials went into
residential areas warning people not to gather in groups of five or
more.
   Witnesses said the fighting began as about 1,000 students of the
arts and science university marched toward downtown Rangoon, with
high school students joining them.
   They said about 200 police officers swung batons and hurled
stones to stop the marchers near the Singaporean embassy, about two
miles south of the campus.
   The demonstrators, by then about 5,000 strong, hurled stones and
other objects and forced the police to retreat a block south, where
a strong military barricade stood. The protesters then dispersed
into small lanes.
   Sporadic clashes also were reported in the nearby Sanchaung area
of the city, where security personnel were said to have used tear
gas and firearms.
   It was the worst rioting in the city since March 18, when
several days of student unrest at two universities climaxed in a
rampage by students and other protesters that was swiftly crushed
by police and military units.
   Diplomatic sources told reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, that as
many as 100 people may have died in the March 18 violence. A
government panel announced only two deaths, both students it said
were shot by riot police.

<TEXT>
   Two nuclear weapons were detonated
simultaneously beneath the Nevada desert this morning in a rare
experiment carried out only a few times in 43 years of nuclear
testing.
   The test was conducted 40 miles from the town of Mercury, where
33 Soviet nuclear scientists are preparing for a historic series of
joint nuclear experiments later this summer.
   The devices were detonated at 7 a.m. in a 750-foot vertical
shaft drilled in Yucca Flat, about 85 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said he felt ``very, very
slight motion'' at a control point 17 miles from ground zero.
   The devices tested today, he said, were ``very, very small'' and
little ground motion could be expected away from the site.
   In Golden, Colo., the National Earthquake Information Center
measured the magnitude of today's explosion at 3.1 on the Richter
scale, spokesman Waverly Person. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause
slight damage.
   The two devices were listed as having a combined force of less
than 150 kilotons of TNT. The exact size of each device was
classified information, Boyer said.
   The simultaneous test of two devices had been conducted only
once in the past 20 years, Boyer has said, adding that the
experiment is a rarity.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West said a check of DOE
records dating back to 1968 showed only one occasion _ September
1982 _ when two devices were detonated simultaneously.
   However, there have been several occasions when two or more
tests were conducted the same day.
   Soviet scientists are at the remote desert site to prepare for a
blast in mid-August that will determine the ability of the Kremlin
and the United States to measure the size of each other's nuclear
tests.
   The devices detonated today were the sixth and seventh tested
this year at the Nevada site. Six of the Soviet scientists have
been at the Nevada site for three of those tests.
   The United States has 34 technicians at the Soviet test site
preparing for a joint verification experiment in Russia a month
after the U.S. test.
   Today's test brought to 682 the number of devices tested at the
remote desert site since testing began in Nevada in January 1951.
The first nuclear tests in the United States began in New Mexico in
1945.

<HEAD>Court Limits Application of Rulings Requiring Equal Treatment of

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, rescuing employers from
having to pay potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in
pension benefits, today limited the application of rulings
requiring equal treatment of men and women in the workplace.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the state of Florida does not have
to pay $43.6 million to male state workers who retired since 1972.
   The justices limited the retroactive impact of a 1978 high court
ruling that barred employers from requiring women to make higher
contributions to pension plans because on average they live longer
than men and thus receive greater retirement benefits.
   The 1978 decision was greatly expanded by the high court in 1983
when it made it illegal for women to receive smaller monthly
retirement pay than men solely because of their sex.
   The 1983 ruling outlawed the practice of paying women smaller
monthly benefit checks than men with identical work and earning
histories.
   The outlawed practice was based on actuarial tables _ statistics
showing women as a group live longer than men and therefore
collected pensions for a longer time.
   The court ruled that all retirement benefits derived from
pension contributions made after Aug. 1, 1983, must be calculated
in a sex-neutral manner _ without regard to the sex of the
beneficiary.
   Both pension benefit rulings were based on the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 banning sex discrimination in the workplace.
   Until today, the court had not answered specifically the
question whether the sex-neutral principles it established in the
pension cases apply to a vast number of workers who have retired
since 1964.
   The justices used the Florida case today to bar retroactive
application of its 1978 ruling.
   The Florida state pension plan has been funded since 1975 solely
by contributions made by state and and city employers.
   Under one pension plan option, women received larger monthly
benefits than men because they lived longer.
   Several males sued Florida, claiming that the system
discriminated against them on the basis of sex in violation of the
1964 civil rights law.
   Florida amended the retirement system in 1983 to adopt wholly
sex-neutral actuarial tables.
   But lower courts ruled that male workers who retired after 1972
must be given additional benefits to raise them to the levels paid
women. The process, called ``topping up,'' meant $43.6 million in
additional benefits Florida was ordered to pay by lower courts.
   The Supreme Court today threw out the lower court rulings.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said ``the
imposition of retroactive liability on ... employers that offered
sex-based pension plans to their employees is inequitable.''
   Also, he said, imposing such extra costs on pension plans would
threaten their existence and the rights of other workers to collect
benefits.
   Some authorities estimated that applying the pension rulings
retroactively would have forced employers to spend hundreds of
millions of dollars in extra benefits.
   Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Dissenting were Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Said, in a decision that could carry some impact for the
continuing Iran-Contra affair investigation, that grand jury
targets may be forced to help prosecutors get at their accounts in
foreign banks.
   The court, by an 8-1 vote, ruled that prosecutors may compel the
target of a grand jury investigation to provide written
authorization so foreign banks will disclose records of the
target's accounts there.
   _ Upheld the way Texas courts administer that state's death
penalty law, dashing the hopes of more than 260 death row inmates.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that convicted murderer and
rapist Donald Gene Franklin properly was sentenced to death for a
1975 crime in San Antonio.
   _ Upheld, by a 5-4 vote, an Oklahoma man's murder conviction and
death sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to
exclude one juror.
   The justices said Bobby Lynn Ross' conviction for killing an
Oklahoma City policeman was not tainted because his lawyer used a
``peremptory challenge'' to oust the juror.
   _ Ruled that federal judges may not throw out indictments
because of misconduct by prosecutors unless the defendants can show
they would not have been indicted were it not for such misconduct.
   The 8-1 ruling upheld the reinstatment of an indictment in a
Denver case against the Bank of Nova Scotia and others accused of
setting up and taking part in phony tax shelters.
   The pension case is Florida vs. Long, 86-1685.

<HEAD>Ford First US Automaker to Offer Dual Air Bag System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will make passenger- and
driver-side air bags standard equipment on 1989 Lincoln
Continentals, the company said today.
   The move will make Ford the first domestic automaker and the
second in the world to offer the dual bag system, Ford Vice
President Helen Petrauskas said at a news conference.
   West Germany's Porsche has offered dual air bags on its
four-cylinder cars since 1987 as standard equipment on 944 Turbo
and added the 944 S and 944 Turbo S for 1988, Porsche spokeswoman
Martha McKinley said.
   In May, Chrysler Corp. announced it was including driver-side
air bags as standard equipment on six models built after May 15. By
1990, Chrysler plans to have driver-side bags as standard equipment
on all U.S.-built models.
   Ford last year requested and won for the industry a delay in a
federal passive restraint regulation that would have required air
bags on both sides of cars not equipped with automatic seat belts.
   Instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
allowed automakers to count the single-bag, driver-side-only
systems as passive restraints while they developed the dual-bag
systems.
   Petrauskas said the decision prevented slower passenger-side bag
development from holding up installation of driver-side bags. Since
1985, Ford has offered air bags as an option on its small Ford
Tempo-Mercury Topaz cars.
   Petrauskas said safety had become an area of intense competition
among the nation's automakers.
   ``That safety race is in high gear,'' she said.
   In the dual system, the driver-side and passenger-side bags
share a single set of sensors, which detect impact, and computer
controls, which set off an explosive charge that inflates the bags
in a fraction of a second.
   The NHTSA rule required all automakers to include passive
restraints _ air bags or automatic front seat belts _ on 10 percent
of their cars in 1987, 25 percent in 1988, 40 percent in 1989 and
100 percent in 1990.
   Ford said 11 of its 1990 car lines will have driver-side air
bags as standard equipment with projected sales of 1 million
vehicles, Petrauskas said.
   On the Tempo-Topaz, the driver-side air bag is an $815 option.
Ford said it has sold about 12,000 of the air bag-equipped
Tempo-Topaz models a year since 1985 and expects to sell 50,000
Lincoln Continentals in 1989.
   The dual system is a $3,500 option on the base Porsche 944,
McKinley said, adding that Porsche has never offered a
driver-side-only air bag system.

   The Supreme Court today ruled that federal
judges may not throw out indictments because of misconduct by
prosecutors unless the defendants can show they would not have been
indicted were it not for such misconduct.
   The 8-1 ruling upheld the reinstatment of an indictment in a
Denver case against the Bank of Nova Scotia and others accused of
setting up and taking part in phony tax shelters.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said the
judge who originally dismissed the indictment lacked such authority
``absent a finding that (defendants) were prejudiced by
(prosecutorial) misconduct.''
   Kennedy said the dismissal of an indictment must be based on
evidence that the grand jury would have voted against indictment
were it not for the misconduct. Otherwise, he said, any violations
by prosecutors must be ``deemed harmless.''
   The case stems from a 20-month federal investigation that led to
a 27-count indictment in 1982 against seven individuals and the
Bank of Nova Scotia. The indictment alleged conspiracy, mail fraud
and tax fraud.
   There also was one count of obstruction of justice against
Denver businessman William A. Kilpatrick, accused of being
instrumental in setting up the tax shelters.
   U.S. District Judge John L. Kane Jr. in Denver dismissed 26 of
the counts of the indictment on Feb. 21, 1983, and threw out the
remaining obstruction of justice charge against Kilpatrick after he
was convicted.
   Kane said the indictment was defective for several reasons,
including extensive misconduct by federal prosecutors and Internal
Revenue Service officials.
   For example, Kane said IRS agents made frequent appearances
before the grand jury when they were unsupervised by government
attorneys. The agents also appeared together to read testimony in
violation of grand jury rules.
   Also, the attorneys allowed the IRS to disclose confidential
grand jury material to other IRS agents who were investigating
civil charges in the case.
   There also was evidence that a tax expert who testified for the
defendants was ``browbeaten and ridiculed'' in testifying before
the grand jury, Kane said. The judge also noted that a prosecutor's
heated argument with the tax expert was overheard by other
witnesses waiting to testify.
   And, the judge said, prosecutors impermissibly interrogated
high-level bank employees outside the grand jury without notifying
lawyers for the Nova Scotia bank.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the indictment
in 1987.
   The Supreme Court, in upholding that ruling, agreed with the
appeals court that there is a lack of conclusive evidence the grand
jury would have voted against indictment were it not for the
alleged misconduct.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall was the lone dissenter.
   The case is Bank of Nova Scotia vs. U.S., 87-578.

   Gov. Bob Martinez said today he would
name a ``drug czar'' and create a drug policy task force to wage
war on narcotics in the Sunshine State.
   Martinez, who just returned from a trip to Washington where he
met with Vice President George Bush and Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, said the top-level policy adviser would serve as chairman
of the task force.
   ``Florida's drug problem won't get any better unless we develop
tougher and more creative policies and penalties,'' Martinez said.
``We must make the cost of drug trafficking and drug abuse so high
that individuals won't risk getting involved.''
   Martinez said he wanted the new chairman and 15-member task
force to consider such options as using the Florida National Guard,
including its air unit, to help locate illicit drug shipments into
the state. The National Guard is now used in a minor role in
surveillance.
   About 70 percent of the cocaine shipped to the United States is
believed to come through Florida, which has more than 1,350 miles
of coastline.
   He also recommended that a task force look at random drug tests
for most state employees, especially those who work in the state's
schools, in the prisons and on the highways.
   He also said the task force would consider extending the death
penalty statute to major traffickers and drug dealers.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The new military government has
arrested former aides of ousted President Leslie Manigat, who was
overthrown in an army coup, sources said today.
   The information minister, Col. Acedius St. Louis, confirmed over
the independent Radio Antilles that an unspecified number of
prisoners have been held since Sunday, when the military deposed
Manigat's 4-month-old civilian government and restored Lt. Gen.
Henry Namphy to power.
   St. Louis gave no names nor details but said the prisoners were
being treated well.
   He also said the private home of Roger Savain, Minister of
Information under Manigat, was being guarded for protection against
vandalism. Another independent radio station, Radio Metropole,
reported today the pillaging of the private home of Lionel
Desgranges, Manigat's chief of staff.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, late
Tuesday identified former Manigat aides under arrest as Savain, his
son Roger Savain Jr., Desgranges, and former Information Ministry
officials Rodney Marcellus and Jean Narces Lescouflair.
   Opposition leaders, meanwhile, called on the army to set a date
for new, independently run elections.
   ``It is now possible for the army to redeem itself,'' Sylvio
Claude, leader of the Haitian Christian Democratic Party, told
Radio Lumiere today. ``For the present, we neither condemn nor
congratulate the army.''
   Louis Dejoie II, another opposition leader, said Tuesday in
Puerto Rico that he wanted to talk with Namphy about holding
elections. Claude, Dejoie, economist Marc Bazin and human rights
activist Gerard Gourge were considered the leading candidates in
the Nov. 29 elections but boycotted the army-run voting on Jan. 17.
   The deposed president, meanwhile, called Tuesday for the
international isolation of Namphy's restored military government.
But he virtually conceded he has joined the long list of Haiti's
ex-leaders.
   In Washington, the State Department said it would maintain
diplomatic relations with Haiti and keep up humanitarian aid.
   A government communique Monday afternoon announced a reshuffling
of the military, returning officers involved in the coup to their
commands and giving most promotions. Manigat had sided with Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the Dessalines Battalion, last week
in an apparent rift with Namphy.
   Manigat had rescinded Namphy's order transferring Paul, then
retired or transferred other officers and placed Namphy under house
arrest. But after Namphy was freed by loyal troops Sunday night,
Paul was at Namphy's side Monday when the military government was
announced.
   Paul wasn't mentioned in the government communique on the army
promotions, but he was back at his Dessalines command after the
coup as the 7,000-man military united behind Namphy. Paul's
battalion was linked to violence that scuttled attempted elections
last Nov. 29, and he is under federal drug indictment in Miami.
   Among the promotions was Gen. Carl Michel Nicolas to major
general and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Namphy's former
title. Col. Wilthan Lherisson was promoted to major general and as
Nicolas' assistant commander. Both had been retired by Manigat.
   Col. Prosper Avril, reputed a leader of the effort to free
Namphy and put him in power, was promoted to brigadier general and
adjutant general of the armed forces. Brig. Gen. William Regala,
Manigat's Defense Minister, was returned to active military
service. He also served in the military-civilian junta headed by
Namphy before Manigat's election.
   Port-au-Prince Police Chief Gregoire Figaro, removed by Manigat,
was returned to his post, named military commander for the
Port-au-Prince region, and promoted from colonel to brigadier
general.
   Manigat told reporters Tuesday in the Dominican Republic, to
which he was expelled after the coup, that he would not ``fall into
the classic trap of deposed political men who see the return to
power from one moment to the other and pass all their time waiting
for that imminent return.
   ``I don't have any bitterness, nor personal rancor. I am sad for
my country, for my people and for Haitian democracy,'' the
57-year-old former university professor added.
   There were no signs of protest Tuesday in the 184-year-old
republic, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, which has known
dozens of leaders, some of whom lasted only days.
   The new government's Cabinet ministers were unceremoniously
installed.
   The United States has withheld about $60 million in
non-humanitarian aid from Haiti since independently run elections
last Nov. 29 were thwarted by attacks on voters that killed more
than 30 people.
   Namphy led a military-civilian junta that ran the country after
President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Feb. 7, 1986, ending the
29-year dictatorship founded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier.

<HEAD>Woman Who Left Five Children At Hospital Charged With Abandonment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 31-year-old mother charged with abandoning her
five children at a hospital emergency room faced similar charges
two years ago.
   Brenda Shed was arrested early Tuesday after being interviewed
by police and caseworkers for the state Department of Children and
Family Services, said Police Youth Division Officer Terry Belinski.
   The five children ranged in age from a 2-year-old girl to
9-year-old twin boys. The three youngest children were placed in
foster homes by Tuesday night, but the 9-year-olds remained in an
emergency shelter, said Dave Schneidman, a family services
spokesman.
   The agency, he said, would seek to win temporary custody of the
children.
   Schneidman said the child-welfare agency cited Ms. Shed for
neglect in 1986 and that her four children were placed in foster
care for seven months.
   The citation, he said, came after the children were found living
alone for four days with only ``minimal food,'' and a neighbor
looking in on them once a day.
   But a Juvenile Court judge ordered the family reunited in
November 1986, Schneidman said.
   ``There was no follow-up investigation since then,'' he said.
   Following her arrest Tuesday, police said Ms. Shed told them she
was ``financially stressed,'' and had been evicted from an
apartment into which she moved three months earlier from public
housing.
   According to Ms. Shed's account, her older sister, Dorothy, 40,
came to the family's apartment as they were being evicted Monday
and said she would drive them to a public-aid shelter.
   Instead, Dorothy Shed drove to Cook County Hospital and while
the children's mother waited in the car, took the youngsters to the
emergency room. There, she left Brenda Shed's name and told a
security guard, ``I'll pick these children up Thursday.''
   Youth Division officers picked up Dorothy Shed late Monday and
charged her with contributing to the dependency of a child, a
misdemeanor, said Belinski.
   The children were examined Monday and found to be healthy. They
also were well-dressed and the three school-aged children had their
schoolbooks with them, said Belinski.

<TEXT>
   Ancient ancestors of humans apparently ate soft
fruits and leaves, but their evolutionary cousins chomped on nuts
and bark, a new study of fossil teeth suggests.
   The work bears on a longstanding debate over whether the two
kinds of animals ate different diets or just differing amounts of
the same food, said researcher Frederick Grine.
   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by Grine, associate professor of anthropology at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, and Richard Kay, professor
of anatomy at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
   They studied detailed replicas of molars that human ancestors
called Australopithecus left 2.5 million to 2.8 million years ago
in South Africa, and that other beasts called Paranthropus left
there 1.5 million to 1.8 million years ago.
   The two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust
australopithecines, respectively.
   Both walked upright, but after their lineages split 2.5 million
years ago, the Australopithecus group evolved toward modern humans
while the Paranthropus branch eventually died out.
   Grine and Kay studied microscopic patterns of dental wear and
compared them to teeth from modern animals with known diets.
   Paranthropus teeth showed more pits, and wider pits and
scratches, suggesting a diet of tougher foods than Australopithecus
ate, researchers said. The difference probably led to the bigger
teeth and larger jaws of Paranthropus, they said.

   Alan Simpson of Wyoming has climbed toward the
peak of the Senate's Republican ranks with a determined lawmaking
style that's spiced with a rangeland wit and outspoken irreverence.
   ``I've punched the lights out of every sacred cow in this
city,'' he says.
   Despite his blunt independence, the 56-year-old attorney from
Cody, Wyo., is being mentioned as a possible running mate for
George Bush. Not surprisingly, he's less than enthusiastic.
   ``I just can't imagine myself in the capacity of a vice
presidential running mate,'' he said, citing the loss of privacy
and freedom he'd have to endure. ``It would be a very difficult
thing for me to do.
   ``I can't get out of a plane in Detroit and have somebody hand
me a speech and tell me what I have to say. I have an aversion to
that _ it's almost physical,'' he said in an interview.
   Simpson has been writing his own speeches since he entered the
Senate a decade ago after serving in his state legislature,
including majority leader of the Wyoming House of Representatives.
   In 1984, after only a single six-year term, he was named by his
GOP colleagues as deputy majority leader. Had Republican leader Bob
Dole's campaign for the party's presidential nomination succeeded,
Simpson would have been hard to beat for the top job.
   His is a distinctive presence on the Senate floor.
Six-foot-seven, stoop shouldered, thin and balding, he stares
menacingly over his half-frame glasses like a vulture and surveys
the Senate floor for prey.
   Then he smiles, and compares passing a tough bill to ``giving
dry birth to a porcupine.''
   Simpson is known as one who fights to win his arguments, not
just go for the easy compromise. He arms himself by studying at
home late into the night.
   He's been critical of some of the most popular programs in
Washington, including veterans benefits for non-combatants,
cost-of-living increases for entitlements and rural electric
cooperatives.
   He has sometimes shown impatience with colleagues _ even GOP
colleagues _ who use the Senate's arcane rules to make things
difficult. But his ability to soothe and work with opponents while
maintaining his priorities has earned him respect from both parties.
   Simpson's credentials as a conservative are unquestioned, but
he's not aligned with the New Right.
   His father, Milward Simpson, was a governor and a senator. His
leap from the statehouse to Washington's most exclusive club, and
his re-election in 1984, were made with ease.
   The marathon and ultimately successful effort to overhaul the
nation's immigration laws has been Simpson's most noted
accomplishment. It was, he said, one of those porcupine bills.
   Simpson teamed up with Rep. Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky., and spent six
years crafting and pushing the immigration bill to final approval.
Along the way, the measure became known simply as
``Simpson-Mazzoli,'' and it was signed into law by President Reagan
in November 1986.
   Along with the successes have come frustrations _ especially
with the inability of Washington to resist special interest
lobbying and attack federal deficits.
   He's not shy about making those feelings known, and his humor
can take an edge when he's on the attack. His jokes are ``my sword
and my shield,'' he says.
   Simpson says his friend George Bush will find many who are
qualified to be his running mate. He says whoever is chosen, he's
confident the Republicans will hold the White House.
   On their fishing trips, Simpson has learned that Bush is ``good
at anything, because he's highly competitive.''
   And, he adds: ``Michael Dukakis is going to find that out.''

   A political consultant testified that
he instructed workers to sign others' names on petitions for a
Republican presidential candidate, but never expected the
signatures to be used.
   Rocky Mountain said it was ``probably one of the dumbest things
I've ever done in my life'' to give teen-agers and other temporary
workers beer and tell them to sign names from a computerized list
on state primary petitions for candidate Pete du Pont.
   However, Mountain said, ``I don't believe it constitutes a
crime.''
   The defense rested after Mountain's testimony on Tuesday. Harris
County Judge Sherman Ross was to consider motions today and
attorneys were to deliver closing statements before the case goes
to the jury.
   Mountain and the company for which he is a vice president,
Southern Political Consulting Inc., in Houston, each were indicted
on 64 counts of misdemeanor forgery. But the judge threw out 26 of
the counts Tuesday on grounds of insufficient evidence.
   Mountain said he did not intend to defraud or harm anyone, but
simply meant to present the petitions to du Pont aide Scott
Malfitano. Mountain said he was angry at Malfitano because of
pressure from the du Pont campaign to get signatures.
   ``I wanted to get a whole big stack of petitions, dump them on
Malfitano's desk and say, `You want petitions, man, here's the
petitions,' '' Mountain said. He said Malfitano used the firm's
offices for several days.
   ``Never in a million years did I imagine he was going to turn
them in (to the Republican Party of Texas). We all agreed there was
no way to use those petitions,'' Mountain said.
   Defense lawyers have said they were unable to secure Malfitano
as a witness.
   Republican Party rules required candidates to submit 5,000 voter
signatures to get on the ballot. The rules since have been changed
to allow candidates to pay a filing fee or submit signatures.
   Mountain contended Tuesday that the law was being selectively
enforced. He and his firm are the only ones to be indicted,
Mountain noted, even though apparently forged signatures were found
on a number of presidential candidates' petitions.
   Mountain faces a fine of up to $2,000 per count and up to a year
in jail. The firm could be fined up to $10,000 per count.

   President Reagan met today with a U.S. team
that is scheduled to begin inspecting Soviet missile facilities
July 1 in accordance with the U.S.-Soviet treaty on intermediate
and shorter-range nuclear weapons.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said the president conferred
with Brig. Gen. Roland La Joie, director of the On-Site Inspection
Agency, and members of the first team of inspectors named to
monitor Soviet compliance with the treaty.
   The team was leaving later today for a staging area in Japan
from which it is scheduled to conduct initial base-line inspections
of 133 Soviet missile facilities over a 60-day period.
   The Soviets will inspect 26 sites in the United States and
allied basing countries, Cooper said.
   He said that in addition to the base-line inspections, the U.S.
team will begin resident on-site monitoring of the missile facility
at Votkinsk in the Soviet Union and will keep track of elimination
of Soviet missiles and related equipment covered by the treaty.
   ``These inspection activities are an essential element of our
verification regime for the INF treaty,'' Cooper said. ``In
addition, the experience will be useful as we develop verification
provisions for a strategic arms reduction agreement.''
   The intermediate and shorter-range missile treaty, which
eliminates a class of nuclear weapons in that category, was signed
by the president and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at their
summit meeting in Washington in December.
   The strategic arms reduction treaty, covering missiles of
intercontinental range, is being negotiated in Geneva.

   Bus drivers in the northwestern city of
Szczecin staged a brief strike Wednesday and won reinstatement of
two fired worker leaders, according to opposition spokesmen and the
state-run news service PAP.
   Spokesmen of the banned Solidarity trade union in Warsaw said
drivers at three bus depots struck from 4:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. The
depots employ nearly 4,000 workers. A brief report by PAP said the
disruption ended at 7 a.m.
   Ryszard Anczykowski, director of the transport company for the
city of 390,000, refused comment.
   The drivers demanded reinstatement of Jozef Ignor, chairman of
the workers' council and co-chairman of the strike committee formed
when the drivers went on strike for one day May 5, and Romuald
Ziolowski, also co-chairman of the strike committee and a workers'
council member, the spokesmen said.
   Ignor and Ziolowski were fired May 18 and Wednesday's strike was
called after the dismissals were upheld by a labor court Monday,
said Henryk Wujec, a Solidarity leader in Warsaw.
   Management signed an agreement at 7:30 a.m. restoring their jobs
and promising no further punishment for the strike, and drivers
went back to work soon afterward, said Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   ``What is interesting is the fact that it wasn't a strike
demanding higher pay, but a typical Solidarity strike,'' said
Onyszkiewicz.
   The stoppage was the second reported among bus drivers since a
wave of strikes between April 25 and May 10 in Poland, the worst
labor unrest since the 1981 imposition of martial law.
   Drivers in Lomza in northeast Poland struck briefly June 15 in a
pay dispute.

   Uganda's new ambassador to Egypt, a
former aide to dictator Idi Amin, will go on trial on charges of
kidnapping with intent to murder for the disappearance of two
businessmen in 1972.
   Lt. Col. John Onah appeared in Kampala magistrate's court
Tuesday, two days after his appointment was announced.
   Onah, 44, denied charges that he kidnapped businessmen Gregory
Kabera and Matthew Kandore in the western town of Fort Portal on
Sept. 2, 1972, and planned to kill them. He was commanding a
paratroop battalion at the time, when soldiers indiscriminately
arrested civilians they accused of supporting rebels.
   Onah was Amin's minister of tourism and wildlife when the
dictator was overthrown in 1979 and civilian President Milton Obote
was returned to power. Onah fled Uganda, returning after Obote was
ousted in a 1985 coup and replaced by a military junta.
   Five months later, President Yoweri Museveni chased the junta
from power, ending a five-year insurgency. He set up a broad-based
government and a commission to investigate deaths and
disappearances of thousands of Ugandan civilians under previous
governments.
   Like many, Kabera and Kandore have not been seen since they
disappeared.
   Onah was remanded in custody until a trial date is set.

   An bomb blast destroyed a
video game and pinball arcade in downtown Johannesburg, injuring at
least 10 people, police said.
   The facade of the Winning Games Center was blown out by the
explosion at 2:06 p.m. and a fire flared briefly before it was put
out, they said.
   Police Col. Frans Malherbe said the injured included six blacks,
one white and three people of Indian descent, including the
pregnant woman, her husband and their daughter.
   Malherbe said four of the victims were seriously hurt.
   Witnesses said one woman was knocked off her feet by the blast
and appeared seriously injured. Police said the blast was caused by
an explosive device known as a limpet mine.
   The arcade is located on the ground floor of an apartment
building. Residents were ordered to evacuate as police investigated.
   More than two dozen bombing and hand grenade attacks in South
Africa this year have killed 14 people.
   The government has blamed the attacks on the outlawed African
National Congress, the only guerrilla movement fighting the white
South African government. The ANC has not claimed responsibility
for the various attacks, but has said it plans to intensify its
guerrilla operations.

<HEAD>Autographed Manuscript of O'Casey Play Auctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The autographed manuscript of ``The Plough and the
Stars'' by Irish playwright Sean O'Casey was sold on Wednesday for
about $68,000, auctioneers Christie's said.
   The buyer was Bernard Quaritch, leading London book dealers. The
seller was not identified.
   The manuscript on lined paper stapled to make a school exercise
book was of the type that O'Casey used for the two earlier plays in
the trilogy on which his fame rests: ``The Shadow of a Gunman'' and
``Juno and the Paycock.''
   Kate Hedworth, head of Christie's manuscripts department, said
O'Casey used the cheap books for the manuscript because he was very
poor at the time he wrote them.
   ``The Plough and the Stars'' is about the effects on the people
of a Dublin tenement of the violent Easter Rising in the city in
1916 against British rule.
   When staged at Dublin's Abbey Theater in 1926, the play provoked
riots as O'Casey was accused of distorting Irish life.
   On the fourth night, the poet William Butler Yeats jumped on the
stage and told the audience to calm down. He said they had failed
to recognize O'Casey's ``genius'' and they were bringing disgrace
on Ireland.
   But the uproar and the Abbey's rejection in 1928 of his next
play, ``The Silver Tassie,'' led O'Casey to quit Ireland for good.
He made his home in England where he died in 1964 at age 84.

<HEAD>Deng Says Market-Style Economic Reforms Face Serious Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping confidently assessed
his own economic policies Wednesday while condemning as ``leftist
mistakes'' those followed by Mao Tse-tung for two decades, an
official report said.
   The Xinhua News Agency said Deng acknowledged that his
market-style economic reforms face serious problems, including
inflation and wage inequities that have caused widespread
discontent. He said the problems will take five or six years to
resolve.
   But in a meeting with visiting Ethiopian President Mengistu
Haile Mariam, Deng criticized China's policies from 1957-76 for
``bringing the country to a virtual standstill,'' Xinhua said.
   Deng apparently did not mention Mao by name. Mao died in 1976
after 27 years as the most powerful man in Communist China.
   Criticism of Mao's 1957 drive to form huge communes and the
1966-76 radical leftist Cultural Revolution have become routine
under Deng, twice purged by Mao.
   But Deng's condemnation was unusually sweeping, rejecting the
entire two decades as a time when China's ``productive forces went
undeveloped and people's living standards did not improve.''
   He blamed the era's emphasis on class struggle and policy of
isolating China from the outside world.
   At the start of the meeting with Mengistu in the Great Hall of
the People, Deng reminisced about his political exile under Mao.
   ``You made your first visit to China 12 years ago, that is in
1976,'' he told Mengistu.
   ``At that time I was not in Beijing. I was confined in what we
call a cowshed for the second time,'' he said, using a Chinese term
for places of punishment for those purged during the Cultural
Revolution.
   Deng was branded a ``capitalist roader'' in 1968 and exiled to
rural Jiangxi province. He was reinstated in his posts in 1973, but
was purged again three years later.
   He gradually consolidated power after Mao's death and became top
leader in 1978. He since has made economic development his top
priority and declared that talk of reaching communism is premature
until China becomes prosperous.
   ``Communism consists of two stages,'' Deng told Mengistu, head
of Ethiopia's Marxist government, as he expounded China's current
line that it is only in the first stage of socialism.
   Deng said his current policies ``guarantee that production will
develop at a comparatively good speed,'' Xinhua reported.
   He said price increases, which averaged 11 percent in the first
quarter of the year, and wage inequities pose serious problems.
   ``Our plans call for taking five or six years to overcome these
barriers,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying. ``There are many risks.
But we believe we can overcome them.''

<HEAD>Arafat Aide's Peace Proposals Fan Palestinian Feud</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 17th graf, `He said...' to clarify that Arafat is being
quoted; picks up 18th pvs: Abu Shariff...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Feuding between rival Palestinian
factions has been fanned by a statement from a close aide to PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat that the movement is prepared to live in
peace with Israel.
   The unusually conciliatory statement by Bassam Abu Sharif,
Arafat's chief spokesman, was clearly aimed at pushing the United
States to deal directly with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   It was branded ``high treason'' by five dissident Syrian-backed
guerrilla groups who broke away from the PLO five years ago in a
dispute with Arafat's policies.
   The statement, initially circulated earlier this month, sparked
a new outburst of heavy fighting between Arafat's Fatah faction and
a radical group, Fatah-Uprising, in the refugee shantytowns on
Beirut's southern outskirts.
   At least 51 people have been killed and 204 wounded since the
fighting flared 13 days ago.
   When Abu Sharif's statement was published Monday on the front
page of the leftist As-Safir newspaper, it led to the collapse of a
four-day truce in the camps battle.
   Abu Sharif labeled his statement a ``policy breakthrough.''
   It said: ``The PLO's raison d'etre is not the undoing of Israel,
but the salvation of the Palestinian people and their rights,
including their right to democratic self-expression and national
self-determination.''
   The PLO, backed by the Arab world, wants an independent homeland
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the
Israelis have been fighting to quell a 6-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   Abu Sharif added that ``as for the fear that a Palestinian state
would threaten its neighbor, the Palestinians would be open to the
idea of a brief, mutually acceptable transitional period during
which an international mandate would guide the occupied territories
to democratic Palestinian statehood.
   ``Beyond that, the Palestinians would accept, indeed, insist on,
international guarantees for the security of all states in the
region.''
   Abu Sharif also said that ``the means by which the Israelis want
to achieve a lasting peace and security is through direct talks,
with no attempts by any outside party to impose or veto a
settlement. The Palestinians agree.''
   The Arabs have endorsed the PLO's role as the sole
representative of the 5 million Palestinians. But the U.S. and
Israel refuse to deal directly with the Palestinians.
   Abu Sharif proposed an internationally supervised referendum in
the West Bank and Gaza to allow the 1.5 million Palestinians living
there to decide whom they want to represent them, the PLO or ``any
other group of Palestinians that Israel or the United States ...
wishes to nominate.''
   Arafat himself has yet to publicly endorse Abu Sharif's
statement, which was first circulated at the Algiers Arab summit
earlier this month without Abu Sharif's signature.
   Abu Sharif's statement was similar in outline to remarks Arafat
made in Baghdad last January.
   Arafat told The Associated Press that he was prepared to
recognize Israel's right to exist and accept U.N. resolutions
declaring Israel's right to exist behind secure borders if
Washington dropped its objections to PLO attendance at an
international peace conference.
   Abu Sharif reiterated that the PLO would accept Security Council
Resolutions 242 and 338 if Israel accepted General Assembly
resolutions that recognize Palestinian rights.
   The PLO has not unconditionally accepted those resolutions
because they make no reference to Palestinian self-determination.

   The Intelligencer, Wheeling, W.Va., on U.S. aid to Nicaragua:
   The president has warned the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua that
he is prepared to ask Congress to renew military aid to the
resistance fighters.
   This will happen if the Marxists running Nicaragua fail to live
up to their pledges for democratic reforms under a Central American
peace accord.
   A lasting peace in Nicaragua must be based on more than an end
to the shooting and the release of a few political prisoners.
   There were promises made by the Sandinistas that broad
democratic reforms would be effected. These promises must be kept.
   Unless they are, then it seems to us the Congress will have no
honorable alternative save to resume full-scale military aid to the
Contras.

   The Baltimore Sun on railroad safety:
   The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 will close a huge
loophole in the running of the nation's rail systems.
   It seems so eminently logical now, but it took 21 years for
Congress to grant Federal Railroad Administration officials the
authority over the personnel who run the trains to match their
authority over the companies that manage the system.
   It is imperative now that Congress finish what it started.
   Rail administrators want to develop rules for pre-employment,
post-accident and unannounced random drug-testing among train
personnel, with predictable opposition from rail unions.
   The evidence of drugs influencing those who operate the nation's
rail passenger and freight trains is too pervasive to allow any
group, however well-meaning, to block reforms.
   Congress can _ and should _ help by buttressing FRA authority in
this critical area.

   The West Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on the tobacco liability trial:
   For the first time ever, a court has held a tobacco company
responsible for the consequences of cigarette smoking.
   This ``crack in the dam,'' as one attorney called it, is yet one
more signal of changing attitudes.
   A federal jury in Newark (N.J.) has ordered Liggett Group to pay
$400,000 to Antonio Cipollone, whose wife died of lung cancer in
1984.
   The tobacco firm had failed to warn customers of health risks
before such warnings were required in 1966 and had misled the
public in its advertising, the jurors said. ...
   The award is small enough, Mrs. Cippoline was found to bear 80
percent of the blame herself _ so that it will not encourage a rush
to the courthouse door. If it is thrown out on appeal, the
incentive will be even less.
   Nevertheless, it tells the industry that the times they are
a-changin'.

   Austin (Texas) American-Statesman on Congressional pay:
   The House, mindful of the election year, (on June 14) reportedly
``reluctantly'' voted to deny its members and other top federal
officials a cost-of-living pay raise for the second year in a row.
   While some may applaud the decision, the fact is that lawmakers
are underpaid at $89,000 a year, considering the cost of
maintaining a residence in both Washington, D.C., and at home, plus
the importance and nature of their jobs.
   The relatively low pay is one reason why some lawmakers keep
getting in ethical snags.
   One should not have to be either rich or ethically bent in order
to serve in Congress.
   The way to get the most service from the best people is to make
the pay commensurate with the job and to forbid by law any outside
earnings that could constitute a conflict of interest.
   But it will take political fortitude from the Congress and the
understanding and agreement of the U.S. taxpayer, and
unfortunately, both appear to be lacking at this time.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on the tobacco liability case:
   The jury was right not to buy the picture of Rose Cipollone as
an innocent victim, trapped in her smoking habit by addiction and
by glossy ads. But the jury was also right not to let the Liggett
Group off free.
   After all, Liggett ran ads suggesting that smoking was safe. ...
   Tobacco cases are different from those ... in which the risks of
the product were unknown outside a specific industry. Smokers are
aware _ and have been for years _ that they're taking a risk.
   The most appropriate place to fight against cigarettes is
outside the courts. ...
   Well-designed anti-smoking ads have educated millions of
Americans about the danger of cigarettes. Congress has required
strict warnings on cigarette packs and in ads.
   Many states ... have restricted the right to smoke in public
places. A number of private employers have chosen to go even
farther and prohibited smoking in the workplace.
   Manufacturers of cigarettes can afford to worry a bit less about
the danger of expensive jury awards.
   But the Cipollone verdict will encourage those fighting for new
restrictions on cigarette smoking.

   The Daily Times, Maryville, Tenn., on catastrophic illness
insurance:
   Obviously it will mean an increase in taxes, but one of the most
important bills passed in recent days is the one which provides
catastrophic illness insurance.
   The bill passed the Senate 86-11, and earlier passed the House,
328-72. President Reagan, at the urging of Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, sent the insurance proposal to
Congress more than a year ago. It passed with some features the
President doesn't like but it apparently is acceptable.
   It will give 29 million elderly Americans vastly improved
protection against financial ruin if they are stricken with
so-called catastrophic diseases such as cancer.
   For the first time, general prescription drug benefits will be
paid under Medicare, a real boost for elderly people trying to make
ends meet on small, fixed incomes.
   The plan provides full hospital coverage after a once-a-year
deductible estimated at $564 in 1989.
   Little has been done for long-term home health care for disabled
and chronically ill people of all ages, but the plan passed will
provide some peace of mind to millions of elderly who now live in
fear that an extended hospital stay will wipe them out financially.

   The Honolulu Advertiser on George Bush and James Baker:
   More important now than than who (George) Bush picks for vice
president may be who runs his campaign.
   Despite denials, Treasury Secretary James Baker III may be asked
to join the campaign full-time. The old friends already talk
regularly and Bush often takes Baker's advice.
   Baker is known as a superb organizer able to anticipate
political problems and avoid them.
   In 1981, he went from working against Reagan's nomination to
being one of the new president's top advisers, along with Edwin
Messe and Michael Deaver.
   Baker is one of the most important but least scrutinizd figures
on the political landscape today. He may believe he can do more for
Bush in November by staying at Treasury and keeping the economy
humming.
   But if Bush's campaign continues to falter and he asked Baker to
come on board, perhaps sometime after (this) week's Toronto
Economic Summit, it's unlikely Baker could say no.

   The Los Angeles Herald Examiner on jail sentences for corporate
crimes:
   As commentators have taken to repeating endlessly, our society
is failing to impart decent values to certain of its citizens.
   Hoodlums shoot innocent bystanders, buy Jaguars with money from
drugs they sell to elementary school kids and terrorize the
law-abiding residents of the neighborhoods they designate as their
home turf.
   But moral decay isn't the sole province of street toughs and
drug merchants.
   Take, for instance, the case of the Beech-Nut crooks. Over
several years, these two guys, top officials of the nation's second
largest baby-food maker, ran a major scam that enriched their
company and themselves.
   Unsuspecting parents who thought they were buying nutritious
apple juice for their babies were getting caramel-colored sugar
water.
   Now (the officials are) being made to pay for it. The judge has
fined them each $100,000 and sentenced them to a year and a day in
jail.
   That's the right message to send.

   Congress can soon be expected to get serious about day care.
   The need for day care has become a national emergency, as
working parents scramble to make do with the best care they can
find at a price they can afford.
   This is not an issue just for mothers or an issue just involving
day care. It involves the way we are acquiescing to a restructuring
of our entire economic and societal life.
   The situation will not right itself until we unravel the
economic knots we have bound ourselves in.
   While we muddle with the immediate issue of day care
legislation, we ought to be taking a long view as well and bearing
in mind that no particular future is inevitable.
   We can march down a seemingly inexorable path, or we can find
new ways to create choice for the next generation of children,
mothers and fathers.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on Jim Wright:
   Let's face it, the House of Representatives doesn't have a great
record in ethics investigaton of its own members.
   Slow to act, quick to forgive, errant House members have been
given slaps on the wrist for misdeeds that might land someone on
the ``outside'' in the pokey.
   That is why the House should not be left alone to investigate
its leader, Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Wright has been charged with several ethics violations ranging
from lobbying his colleagues when he might have had a conflict of
interest to accepting an unusually high royalty for a book
published under his name, but actually prepared by a
congressionally-paid aide.
   Wright has said he has done nothing wrong.
   If the investigation is left to the House Ethics Committee, its
conclusions will have no credibility if Wright is declared to be
innocent.
   The only answer is to engage an independent counsel to lead the
investigation.

   The Milwaukee Journal on riding for muscular dystrophy:
   The leather-clad motorcyclists who descended on Milwaukee over
the weekend may have seemed unlikely fund-raisers, but the truth is
that they contributed upward of $500,000 toward the fight against
muscular dystrophy.
   So successful was the effort that officials of Harley-Davidson
Co., which sponsored the bash as part of its 1988 fund-raising
effort, are talking about increasing their goal from $1 million to
$1.5 million.
   The bikers, some 50,000 strong, flocked to Milwaukee like ants
do a picnic, intent on celebrating the 85th birthday of their
favorite cycle, the Harley-Davidson.
   Admission to the party ... covered the cost of entertainment and
a donation to the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
   That so many motorcyclists would turn out for a charitable cause
bebpeaks tender hearts beneath sometimes tough exteriors.

   The two were sentenced to death for armed robbery, a capital

two-year prison term in a liquor license conspiracy case, says he
ran the cleanest administration in U.S. history.
   Blanton, who is vying for the 8th Congressional District seat,
on Tuesday compared his government to the Reagan administration.
   ``I think we had the cleanest administration in the history of
this country,'' he told a group of reporters and about 150 people
attending a forum for Democratic candidates in the 8th District
race.
   The former governor is one of five candidates in the Democratic
primary Aug. 4; three candidates are seeking the Republican
nomination.
   Blanton alleged that federal agents entrapped him and said his
refusal to answer negative questions led to bad press.
   ``The present administration in Washington _ the Reagan
administration _ has had 150-odd people indicted or gone to prison
and they don't say a thing in the world about him having a
scandal-ridden administration,'' Blanton said.
   Blanton, 58, whose rights of citizenship were restored last
year, is seeking the seat of U.S. Rep. Ed Jones, a Democrat who is
retiring.
   Blanton served the prison term for his 1981 conviction on
charges of mail fraud, extortion and conspiracy in connection with
the issuance of 12 liquor licenses to friends. The mail fraud
convictions recently were vacated and Blanton is appealing the
other convictions.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier to Sue Officials Accused of Violating Civil
Rights Laws</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
people to sue in state court those public officials they accuse of
violating federal civil rights laws.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, reinstated a Milwaukee man's $2.3
million lawsuit against 10 city policemen. The suit contends that
the white officers used excessive force and falsely arrested Bobby
Felder because he is black.
   State courts had thrown out Felder's suit because he did not
comply with a state law imposing procedural hurdles against those
who sue state and municipal officials.
   But writing for the high court today, Justice William J. Brennan
said the Wisconsin law cannot be applied when the lawsuit alleges
violation of federal civil rights law.
   The Wisconsin law requires that anyone filing suit in state
court against a state or local government official must notify the
defendant within 120 days of the alleged injury.
   The defendant then has 120 days to reach an out-of-court
settlement. If one is not reached, the lawsuit may be filed within
six months of the defendant's refusal to settle.
   Felder sued in state court, charging violations of a post-Civil
War federal law enacted to protect the rights of blacks. He could
have sued in federal court.
   Felder had not notified the policemen about his complaints
within 120 days of his arrest, and his case was thrown out of state
court for that reason.
   ``We think it plain that Congress never intended that those
injured by governmental wrongdoers could be required, as a
condition of recovery, to submit their claims to the government
responsible for their injuries,'' Brennan said.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented.
   Felder became involved in a confrontation with the police on
July 4, 1981, when they stopped him for questioning outside his
Milwaukee home. The police were looking for a man reported to be in
the neighborhood.
   Police said Felder was uncooperative and began to shout
profanities at them. As a crowd of neighbors gathered, police said
Felder shoved an officer.
   Felder was arrested on disorderly conduct charges. He said
police officers beat him with batons and threw him into a police
van while he was semi-conscious.
   The case is Felder vs. Casey, 87-526.

   Fires blamed on Arab arsonists destroyed more
than 60 acres of treasured forest in northern Israel today, and a
rash of stone-throwing signaled new momentum in the 6{-month-old
Palestinian uprising.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the new wave of violence an
attempt to destroy the Jewish state.
   ``There is a wave of aggression, whether arson or murder,
against the Jewish presence everywhere in the land of Israel,''
Shamir told Israel army radio. ``The problem is one of survival.''
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, most businesses and
schools were shut today by a general strike called for in leaflets
from the uprising's underground leadership.
   Israeli troops captured four armed Palestinian guerrillas trying
to infiltrate from south Lebanon and wounded three after a brief
firefight, the army said.
   It was the 15th infiltration or attempted infiltration since the
Arab uprising began Dec. 8.
   The army said in a statement the guerrillas planned to attack
one of Israel's northern settlements. It said there were no
injuries to Israeli forces.
   Israel radio said the guerrillas were captured north of Israel's
self-declared security zone and belonged to the pro-Syrian Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Also, a woman was injured when Palestinians stood in the middle
of a West Bank highway and stoned a bus heading for the Jewish city
of Ariel, Israel radio reported. It said the bus also was hit by a
firebomb but not set ablaze.
   Police, firefighters and volunteers, backed by army helicopters
and planes, were on alert for arson. The uprising's leaders had
ordered Palestinians to set fire today to Israel's farms, forests
and factories.
   Eight fires erupted, and all but one of those were suspicious,
police said. David Angel, spokesman for the Jewish National Fund,
said that was less than the 18 average daily fires last week.
   ``It's because we had so many people out looking,'' he said.
   Angel said he believed the fires Wednesday were probably set or
started by carelessness because an overnight shower and cool
weather made spontaneous combusion unlikely.
   The largest fire scorched 50 acres of woodlands in Mt. Gilboa,
70 miles north of Jerusalem, some of it part of a reforestation
program. The blaze began overnight.
   ``You see years of work go up in smoke in a few minutes,''
Avraham Yariv, head of the Gilboa regional council, told Israel
radio. ``You stand helpless before this terrible sight.''
   Yariv said the fire was obviously arson because it started in
four places.
   Angel said another blaze destroyed 10 acres of woodlands near
Kfar Qassem, north of Tel Aviv. ``This was a young forest first
planted a couple of years ago,'' he said.
   The destruction of trees is especially painful to Israelis, who
take pride in having made the desert bloom. Many of the trees were
bought by American Jews in memory of relatives.
   Police commissioner David Krauss said the fires were set by
Palestinians, some of them as young as 8 or 9.
   In the past two months, fires have destroyed 35,000 acres in
Israel, much of it cherished farmland and forest, about 10 times
last year's total.
   Officials have blamed at least half the fires on the uprising,
which has claimed 210 Palestinian and four Israeli lives.
   The arson has brought the Arab revolt into Israel proper and has
been augmented by stone- and firebomb-throwing in Israeli cities
and highways.
   Two female soldiers were slightly injured in separate incidents
Tuesday when rocks smashed the windows of passenger trains near Tel
Aviv and Netanya. Also, stoned smashed the windshields of two cars
on highways around Tel Aviv.
   Some of these attacks are apparently carried out by Palestinians
working in Israel. As many as 140,000 Arabs from the occupied lands
are employed by Israelis and some live part of the time in Jewish
cities.
   Today's general strike was ordered in the latest in a series of
leaflets that PLO-backed resistance leaders use to communicate with
the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
Israel seized during the 1967 Middle East war.
   In many West Bank towns and cities, Palestinian students
boycotted classes despite army threats to close down their schools,
which were reopened last month after a four-month suspension.
   The military government says it will close them again if
students fail to attend class regularly.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, students blocked streets with
rocks and stoned Israeli troops, who fired tear gas to disperse the
demonstrators, witnesses said.

<TEXT>
   Nadezhda Nuzhnaya will bid her son and
husband goodbye Thursday and board a train for Moscow. This month,
the woman who paints tea sets for a living is one of the 5,000 most
important people in the Soviet Union.
   Ms. Nuzhnaya, 36, has been chosen to represent her fellow
Communist Party members in the northern Ukraine at a national party
conference, the first in 47 years, that will pass judgment on a
program designed to make Soviet political life more democratic.
   ``This will be one of the most important events in my life,''
the shy woman, a party member since 1978, said in an interview.
``But it will also be an important event for every Communist, for
every citizen of our country.''
   Mrs. Nuzhnaya, whose candidacy was supported by co-workers in
the porcelain factory where she has worked for 19 years, is one of
the winners in a Soviet electoral process unlike any in recent
memory, but whose choices often seem to differ little from past
party elections.
   Along with Mrs. Nuzhnaya, fully half of the Communists chosen to
represent the Sumy region in the southeastern Ukraine are party and
government bureaucrats whose privileges and perks would be deeply
affected if the reforms proposed for the conference are enacted.
   In recent weeks, protests over ballot-rigging by party
apparatchiks and some of the delegates chosen for the conference
has brought Soviet citizens into the streets from the Pacific Ocean
island of Sakhalin to the Baltic republic of Estonia.
   ``By my estimate, 90 to 95 percent of the delegates are of the
same type that have attended past party meetings,'' said a
Moscow-based Western diplomat. ``True, the other 5 or 10 percent
may give us some fireworks.''
   Who exactly will attend the conference that convenes June 28 in
the Kremlin is crucial because the more than 5,000 delegates will
be asked to vote on proposals that would more firmly separate party
from state and limit apparatchiks to two five-year terms in office.
   In a May 7 speech, Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered that there be no
attempt, as in the past, to impose quotas from above for ``so many
workers, so many peasants, so many woman, and so on.'' The sole
criterion, the Communist Party chief insisted, was that delegates
be ``active supporters of perestroika.''
   Gorbachev's apparent strategy was to form an alliance with the
grassroots party membership against the middle-echelon bureaucracy.
But if the Sumy region about 400 miles south of Moscow is any
indication, the grip of the apparatchiks may be unshaken.
   Of the 24 delegates elected in the Maryland-sized district,
eight are local party and government bureaucrats. Four more hold
posts in the armed forces and Ukrainian or national governments,
including Vladimir M. Lukyanenko, Soviet minister for petroleum
machine-building.
   There are also seven workers, three economic managers and two
collective farmers.
   Only the local party first secretary, Ivan G. Grintsov, and the
head of the regional Soviet, or government, served as delegates to
the party's 27th Congress in 1986. But that may be deceptive.
   At a meeting with foreign reporters this week, Grinstov, the
Sumy area's party boss for 13 years, dominated the discussion. Mrs.
Nuzhnaya and another conference delegate, lathe operator Viktor
Plavich, 34, said virtually nothing.
   ``We unanimously support the theses submitted to the
conference,'' said Grintsov, 53, a stocky man with graying hair.
The two other delegates present did not demur.
   Mrs. Nuzhnaya said she did not know if she would seek to speak
at the conference. She said she backed Gorbachev's campaigns for
``glasnost,'' or openness, and ``perestroika,'' or economic and
social restructuring, and wanted to make the party closer to the
citizenry.
   ``One thing I believe is that we have to free grassroots party
leaders from the enormous paperwork they have so they can spend
more time with the people, with party members and workers,'' said
Mrs. Nuzhnaya.
   Many prominent proponents of perestroika have accused midlevel
bureaucrats in the 20 million-member party of stacking the
candidacies to exclude them and their like-minded comrades from the
conference.
   ``Not all primary party organizations took part in the
elections, and if they had taken place in a more democratic and
open atmosphere, then there would be more (perestroika) supporters
among the delegates,'' Yuri N. Afanasyev, a historian and
conference delegate from Moscow, told a news conference in Moscow
on Friday.
   In Sumy, local party cells, like that in Mrs. Nuzhnaya's
porcelain factory, first nominated 50 candidates to represent
Communists in the region, which has a population of 1.6 million.
   The regional party bureau, headed by Grintsov, then relayed
those names to a May 21 meeting of the local party committee held
in the seven-story party headquarters in Sumy. That session chopped
the list down to 24 candidates, and elected all of them as
delegates.
   The Frunze machine-building works, which employs more than
25,000 people and has been a showcase for Gorbachev's economic
reforms, had nominated a work brigade leader, Svetlana Yeris, and
the enterprise's director, Alexander A. Voronko.
   The plenum threw out Ms. Yeris' candidacy and elected Voronko,
meaning that the Communists at Sumy's single largest industry will
not be represented by a worker, but by their boss.

   Prosecutors rested in their racketeering case
against Rep. Mario Biaggi and six others after detailing to the
jury the New York Democratic's indictment and conviction in an
unrelated case.
   The defense began its case in U.S. District Court today by
calling a series of witnesses to refute allegations against former
Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon.
   The 70-year-old Biaggi and his co-defendants are charged with
turning Wedtech Corp., a now-bankrupt Bronx defense contractor,
into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in
payoffs to obtain no-bid government contracts.
   The prosecution concluded by telling the jury about Biaggi's
federal indictment on charges of accepting vacations paid for by
Meade Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic chairman, in return
for seeking favorable treatment by the Navy and Coast Guard for a
client of Esposito's insurance firm.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Wilson also told the jury Tuesday
that Biaggi was convicted of accepting an unlawful gratuity but is
appealing the verdict.
   Biaggi was sentenced to 30 months in prison for that conviction
but has remained free on bail pending appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley told the jurors they
could only consider Biaggi's prior conviction for determining his
intent regarding extortion and bribery charges in the Wedtech case.
   Prosecutors charge Biaggi demanded and was given 5 percent of
Wedtech's stock, and split that with his former law partner,
Bernard Ehrlich. Because of congressional rules limiting his
outside income, prosecutors contend, Biaggi placed his stock in the
name of his eldest son, Richard, who like Ehrlich is a co-defendant.
   Besides Simon, the other defendants are Wedtech founder John
Mariotta, former Small Business Administration Regional
Administrator Peter Neglia and Neglia's friend, Ronald Betso, a
former police officer.
   Several witnesses, including four former Wedtech executives who
pleaded guilty to corruption charges and testified in exchange for
leniency, linked Biaggi with the Wedtech stock.
   One, former Wedtech chairman Fred Neuberger, also said Simon
sought $50,000 in cash, charitable and campaign contributions from
Wedtech in return for his help in a city real-estate transaction.
   But Neuberger also was forced to admit that he lied to the jury
during the trial about hiding his assets.

   The Supreme Court, in a decision that could
carry some impact for the continuing Iran-Contra affair
investigation, today said grand jury targets may be forced to help
prosecutors get at their accounts in foreign banks.
   The court, by an 8-1 vote, ruled that prosecutors may compel the
target of a grand jury investigation to provide written
authorization so foreign banks will disclose records of the
target's accounts there.
   Compelling such action does not violate the constitutionally
protected privilege against self-incrimination because providing
written authorization is not testimonial, Justice Harry A. Blackmun
wrote for the court.
   The justices rejected arguments by a man identified in court
documents only as John Doe, who is under investigation by a federal
grand jury in Texas. The grand jury is looking into alleged
fraudulent manipulation of oil cargos and receipt of unreported
income.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Doe's case that
he properly was held in contempt for refusing to authorize banks in
the Cayman Islands and Bermuda to provide his bank records to
prosecutors.
   Today's decision upheld the 5th Circuit court's ruling,
preserving the government's victory.
   The ruling also could have a bearing on efforts to obtain
foreign bank records in investigations of the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Senate Iran-Contra committee unsuccessfully sought a court
order to compel retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to
authorize the release of Swiss bank records of corporations he
headed.
   The companies helped arrange the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and
diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.
   The Senate is appealing a federal judge's refusal to order
Secord to release the records.
   Also, Secord's former business partner, Albert Hakim, is
fighting an effort by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to
subpoena records of Swiss-based corporations that Hakim and Secord
ran. That case is pending before a federal appeals court.
   In today's decision, Blackmun said forcing Doe to sign the
authorization form does not amount to forcing him to testify
against himself.
   ``Because the consent directive is not testimonial in nature, we
conclude that the district court's order compelling petitioner to
sign the directive does not violate his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination,'' Blackmun said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens was the lone dissenter.
   In a case dealing with a related issue, the court said a
custodian of subpoenaed corporate records may not withhold them
from the government by claiming the act of providing the documents
could incriminate the custodian.
   By a 5-4 vote in a case from Magnolia, Miss., the justices said
the subpoena must be honored even when a corporation is
family-owned and the custodian of the records is the principle
owner of the business.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
granting such custodians the right to withhold documents would
jeopardize the government's fight against white-collar crime. He
called that fight ``one of the most serious problems confronting
law enforcement.''
   The court upheld a ruling that Randy Braswell, head of Worldwide
Machinery Sales Inc. and Worldwide Purchasing Inc., must provide
records the government sought in a tax investigation.
   Braswell is the sole officer of both corporations. The only
other corporate employee was his sister-in-law, who acted as his
secretary.
   Braswell's wife and mother also served nominally as directors of
the corporations.
   The Internal Revenue Service in 1986 subpoenaed Braswell to
produce all corporate records for a federal grand jury. He said the
mere act of producing the records might tend to incriminate him in
violation of his constitutional rights.
   Rehnquist was joined by Blackmun, Stevens and Justices Byron R.
White and Sandra Day O'Connor. Dissenting were Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Antonin Scalia.
   The case is Braswell vs. U.S., 87-3.
   The bank records case is Doe vs. U.S., 86-1753.

   Federal authorities are holding as a material
witness a man who claims one of Tawana Brawley's advisers hired him
to tape the adviser's conversations with her lawyers.
   Samuel McClease was released to federal custody after he
appeared before a federal magistrate Tuesday. He was brought into
court on a material-witness warrant after he apparently failed to
show up at U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's office with the tapes.
   Under federal law, a witness whose testimony is deemed crucial
to a case can be detained by authorities.
   McClease, who was reportedly brought to Giuliani's attention by
a tipster, was subpoenaed Friday to appear on Monday, but failed to
show.
   However, McClease's attorney, John Gross, told the magistrate on
Tuesday his client, ``came in voluntarily with me.''
   McClease has said his tapes showed that the advisers didn't
believe Miss Brawley's story that she was kidnapped and raped by
six white men, one of whom showed a police-type badge, but were
using it for personal and political gain.
   Court papers in the matter were sealed; officials would not
comment about what the federal grand jury was investigating.
   Miss Brawley, 16, and her family have refused to cooperate with
a state grand jury, which has been trying to learn what happened to
the Wappingers Falls girl during a four-day period last November.

   A team of British mountaineers on Wednesday
abandoned its expedition to climb a 23,410-foot Himalayan peak
after one of its members died in the attempt, government sources
said.
   Graham Keith Mayer died when he fell from a height of 22,000
feet during the team's attempt to climb the Nun peak in Kashmir
state's frontier Ladakh region, said the sources, who insisted on
anonymity.
   The mountaineering team returned to the base camp at Kargill,
about 434 miles northeast of Jammu.
   Mayer's body has not yet been recovered because of heavy
snowfall in the area, the sources said. Government helicopters have
been asked to circle the area to look for the body.

   In an annual report, the agency said individuals and
organizations had earned a large part of the revenues through
stocks or real estate.
   The agency said it collected $372 million in taxes and penalties
from those who failed to report all their earnings.
   The amount of unreported earnings in 1987 was $81.6 million more
than in 1986, and $30.53 million more than the previous record high
of $504.47 million in 1985.
   Japan's fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita went to the Toronto
summit seeking commitments from his economic partners on five
points. By the time the summit ended, he got nearly everything he
wanted.
   The result pleased leaders here, who called it a sign that Japan
is now exercising some of the clout it has won by building one of
the world's leading economies.
   ``As a whole, it was strongly felt that Japan's international
role has heightened,'' said Keizo Obuchi, chief Cabinet secretary.
   A political cartoon in the nationwide newspaper Asahi Shimbun
summed up Japanese feelings toward the summit, showing the
diminutive Takeshita towering over President Reagan and Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, boosted in stature by recent
agreements resolving disputes over beef and oranges and a new aid
package for developing countries.
   To ensure a cordial if not warm reception in Toronto, Japan
announced on the eve of the summit that it was absolving 17 of the
poorest Third World countries of $1 billion in debt in the next
five years. Japan also rushed to conclude an agreement with the
United States on beef and oranges, eliminating a major source of
trade friction.
   Before leaving for the summit, Takeshita indicated Japan no
longer was willing to take a back seat in world affairs.
   ``Seen from the international perspective, it is fit that Japan
has gained the status of an economic power. I believe it is my
responsibility to assert that strength in terms of a specific role
Japan should play,'' he said.
   However, Takeshita also acknowledged he was a man of few words,
often content to sit in the background working for a consensus.
This has upset many Japanese, who think it is time for their
country to be more assertive.
   Thus, many image-conscious Japanese were eager to see what kind
of reception Takeshita would get.
   There was more than a little concern here when Takeshita got
elbowed to the edges during a formal photograph session for the
world leaders. Reporters were quick to note it was the first time
Japan missed an inside spot in the official photo since former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone first managed to place himself
between Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the
1983 Williamsburg summit.
   However, any stature he might have lost in Japanese eyes he
regained at the negotiating table.
   Before leaving for Toronto, Takeshita said he wanted to get
commitments on
   _ coordinating economic policy;
   _ preventing trade protectionism;
   _ cooperation on the international debt problem;
   _ a statement on policies toward the Newly Industrialized
Economies; and
   _ a statement of support for the Seoul Olympics.
   The final summit communique urged continued progress toward
reducing agricultural subsidies, called for special attention to
heavily indebted countries, endorsed the free-market economics
urged by Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher, agreed on rescheduling the debt
of the world's poorest countries, and urged constructive talks with
the Newly Industrialized Economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, South
Korea and Singapore.
   Japan was praised for spurring domestic demand and urged to
continue promoting land-use reform.
   The communique did not include a statement on the Olympics,
partly over concern about linking politics and sports. However,
Mulroney issued a special statement hours after the summit ended,
saying summit leaders expressed support for the Games. The
statement came after strenuous prodding from Japan.
   It was a symbolic victory for Takeshita, who had promised Asian
leaders he would attend the conference as a regional representative.
   At a news conference following the summit, Takeshita said he was
happy with the declaration on Newly Industrialized Economies, and
said he viewed the summit with a ``sense of fulfillment.''
   Another major success for Takeshita was something that did not
occur at the summit _ the Japan-bashing that has preoccupied
previous sessions.
   Takeshita took special steps to ensure that wouldn't happen this
time.
   In addition to initiatives on beef and oranges and foreign aid,
Japan announced June 14 it was more than doubling its overseas
development aid to at least $50 billion in the next five years.
   Michihiko Kunihiro, chief Cabinet councillor for external
affairs, said Takeshita also won compliments for Japan's recent
success in boosting imports and narrowing its trade surpluses.
   In the end, he said, ``statistics talked on our behalf.''

   Canada expelled eight Soviet officials last week
for spying on scientific, technological and military targets and
has in recent months barred nine others from returning to the
country, government sources say.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Tuesday that the diplomats
and trade representatives were engaged in ``improper and
unacceptable behavior.''
   The officials were believed to have links to both the KGB and to
the GRU, intelligence organizations run by the Soviet military,
government sources told the Canadian Press news agency on condition
of anonymity.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said the expulsions were ``entirely groundless and invented.
   ``Here we have an apparent provocation planned in advance that
has nothing to do with the activity of Soviet citizens in Canada,''
Gerasimov said. ``The provocation of the Canadian authorities will
naturally not remain without due reply.''
   ``We'll reply as appropriate as soon as possible,'' Gerasimov
said, when asked whether the Soviets would reciprocate.
   Government officials in Ottawa said the eight Soviets expelled
last week included two people from the Soviet Embassy and six
others who held diplomatic status and were based in Montreal.
   The other nine completed their normal tours of duty in Canada
and returned home at various times over the last six months or so,
the sources said. All have been declared persona non grata, meaning
they cannot return to Canada.
   The sources said the targets of the expelled Soviets were
primarily scientific and technological. One told Canadian Press
there were military objectives as well.
   Mulroney confirmed the expulsions Tuesday at a final summit news
conference when asked about them by a Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
reporter.
   ``I will confirm the government of Canada took some action last
week in regard to the improper and unacceptable behavior by
representatives of the Soviet government in Canada,'' he said.
   Mulroney said Foreign Minister Joe Clark would make a statement
on the action in Parliament today.
   Canadian Press said the expulsions appeared not to be connected
to the arrest last week on spying charges of Stephen Joseph Ratkai,
a Nova Scotian of Hungarian descent. Ratkai was accused of
gathering classified U.S. military documents from a
submarine-tracking station at Argentia, Newfoundland.
   Mulroney said that despite the summit's endorsement of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, Western leaders are ``under
no illusions'' about the Soviet Union.
   Spokesmen for Canadian Security Intelligence Service and
External Affairs also declined comment, as did Solicitor General
James Kelleher.
   More than 40 diplomats from the Soviet Union and East European
countries have been publicly ordered out of Canada since World War
II.

   Forty-three years after Hungarian
composer Bela Bartok died, his remains today began a two-week trip
to his homeland.
   Following a farewell ceremony attended by 150 U.S. and Hungarian
dignitaries, family, friends and fans, the composer's remains
embarked on a trip by sea and land to the Budapest cemetery where
Bartok's wife and mother are buried.
   ``He was very Hungarian, but we know he and his wife's work
belong to the whole world. He is international,'' said Gyorgy
Banlaki, the Hungarian consul, at the ceremony at Ferncliff
Cemetery, where the coffin was exhumed Tuesday.
   The coffin, packed in a shipping crate festooned with ribbons in
the Hungarian colors of red, white and green, sat near the
gravesite.
   A simple metal grave marker was removed and replaced with one
that read, in Hungarian and English: ``The first resting place of
Bela Bartok. ... Remains removed to Farkasret Cemetery, Budapest,
Hungary, following June 25, 1988.''
   Plans call for the remains to depart on the Queen Elizabeth 2 on
Saturday, accompanied by Bartok's sons, Peter, 64, of Homosass,
Fla., and Bela, 78, of Budapest. They are to arrive in Southampton,
England amid fanfare, concerts and a message from British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The ship then will head for France and from Cherbourg, the sons
will accompany the body through France, Germany and Austria before
arriving in Hungary.
   Concerts and recitals will highlight the trip, including a
performance of the Orchestre de Paris conducted by Hungarian-born
conductor Sir Georg Solti.
   After a public display of the coffin, Bartok will finally be
laid to rest on July 7 in the Farkasret Cemetery.
   The decision to take the body to Hungary was made by the
composer's sons.
   Born in 1881, Bartok's music celebrated the folk tradition of
his country. A piano virtuoso, he came to this country in 1940 on
tour and never returned because of the devastation of World War II.
   He died of leukemia in 1945 at age 64 and was buried without
fanfare in Ferncliff, the final resting place of singer Judy
Garland, TV personality Ed Sullivan, movie star Joan Crawford,
actor Basil Rathbone, civil rights leader Whitney Young,
singer-actor Paul Robeson and black radical leader Malcolm X, among
others.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PENSION BENEFITS
   
   The court, rescuing employers from having to pay potentially
hundreds of millions of dollars in pension benefits, limited the
application of rulings requiring equal treatment of men and women
in the workplace.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the state of Florida does not have
to pay $43.6 million to male state workers who retired since 1972.
   The justices limited the retroactive impact of a 1978 high court
ruling that barred employers from requiring women to make higher
contributions to pension plans because on average they live longer
than men and thus receive greater retirement benefits.
   The case is Florida vs. Long, 86-1685.
   
   FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS
   
   The court said, in a decision that could carry some impact for
the continuing Iran-Contra affair investigation, that grand jury
targets may be forced to help prosecutors get at their accounts in
foreign banks.
   The court, by an 8-1 vote, ruled that prosecutors may compel the
target of a grand jury investigation to provide written
authorization so foreign banks will disclose records of the
target's accounts there.
   The case is Doe vs. U.S., 86-1753.
   
   CORPORATE RECORDS
   
   The court said a custodian of subpoenaed corporate records may
not withhold them from the government by claiming the act of
providing the documents could incriminate the custodian.
   By a 5-4 vote in a case from Magnolia, Miss., the justices said
the subpoena must be honored even when a corporation is
family-owned and the custodian of the records is the principle
owner of the business.
   The case is Braswell vs. U.S., 87-3.
   
   TEXAS DEATH PENALTY
   
   The court upheld the way Texas courts administer that state's
death penalty law, dashing the hopes of more than 260 death row
inmates.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that convicted murderer and
rapist Donald Gene Franklin properly was sentenced to death for a
1975 crime in San Antonio.
   The case is Franklin vs. Lymaugh, 87-5546.
   
   MURDER CONVICTION
   
   The court upheld, by a 5-4 vote, an Oklahoma man's murder
conviction and death sentence even though the presiding judge
wrongly refused to exclude one juror.
   The justices said Bobby Lynn Ross' conviction for killing an
Oklahoma City policeman was not tainted because his lawyer used a
``peremptory challenge'' to oust the juror.
   The case is Ross vs. Oklahoma, 86-5309.
   
   PROSECUTORS MISCONDUCT
   
   The court ruled that federal judges may not throw out
indictments because of misconduct by prosecutors unless the
defendants can show they would not have been indicted were it not
for such misconduct.
   The 8-1 ruling upheld the reinstatment of an indictment in a
Denver case against the Bank of Nova Scotia and others accused of
setting up and taking part in phony tax shelters.
   The case is Bank of Nova Scotia vs. U.S., 87-578.
   
   CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court made it easier for people to sue in state court those
public officials they accuse of violating federal civil rights laws.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote, reinstated a Milwaukee man's $2.3
million lawsuit against 10 city policemen. The suit contends that
the white officers used excessive force and falsely arrested Bobby
Felder because he is black.
   The case is Felder vs. Casey, 87-526.

<HEAD>Minor Acid Leak Reported at Closed Union Carbide Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minor acid leaks from a storage tank at
the closed Union Carbide Corp. plant at Bhopal were detected on two
days this week, the Press Trust of India reported today.
   The first leak, discovered Monday, was stopped by a team of
experts summoned from New Delhi, the news agency said.
   A second leak, described as ``a small trickle,'' was discovered
Tuesday and fixed immediately, it said.
   The plant has been closed since December 1984, when toxic methyl
isocyanate gas leaked from the pesticide plant run by a Union
Carbide subsidiary.
   The Indian government is suing the U.S. company for $3 billion
to compensate the nearly 3,000 people killed and thousands wounded
in the toxic gas leak.
   India has accused Union Carbide of negligence in causing the
fatal leak. Union Carbide contends the plant was sabotaged.
   PTI said that this week there was ``minor leakage'' of
chlorosulphonic acid from the tank.
   PTI quoted unidentified official sources as saying there was
``no cause whatsoever for alarm, nor was there any danger from this
leak.''

   The State Department's chief spokesman
expresed alarm today at the arrest of aides to deposed Haitian
President Leslie Manigat and called on the new military government
in Haiti to respect human rights.
   Charles E. Redman, assistant secretary of state for public
affairs, reacted to confirmation by Haitian authorities that an
unspecified number of prisoners have been held since Monday's
military coup by Lt. Gen. Henry Namphy.
   ``We find that alarming as one of the first acts of the Namphy
regime,'' Redman said of the arrests. ``We have taken that issue up
with Haitian officials, making clear ... that we expect strict
respect forinternationally recognized human and civil rights.''
   U.S. diplomats in Haiti, who have not had contact with Namphy
since the takeover, voiced their concern over the arrests to lower
level officials, Redman said.
   Meanwhile, the Reagan administration will continue a $36 million
humanitarian aid program and try diplomacy to nudge the Caribbean
nation's new military government toward democracy.
   ``There is no break in the diplomatic relations; we're not
contemplating it,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said Tuesday.
   Once again, she denounced the coup as a setback for democracy.
   But she and other State Department officials, some of whom spoke
on condition of anonymity, made clear that the United States would
work with the new military regime.
   ``I think there are examples of many governments around the
world of whom we don't particularly approve, with whom we have
relations and have dealings,'' she said.
   ``We're talking about the situation as it evolves in Haiti.
We're continuing the operation of our embassy there,'' the
spokeswoman said.
   She said there are no plans to halt U.S. humanitarian
assistance, which is distributed directly to Haitians by
non-governmental agencies, including many based in the United
States. This fiscal year's plan calls for $30 million for
development and relief programs and $6 million in the form of
surplus American food.
   A U.S. diplomat said, ``There was no thought of interrupting
this assistance. Who would it hurt if we stopped the aid? The poor
people of Haiti, not the leaders.''
   Economic sanctions also have been ruled out, the diplomat said.
Such sanctions would hurt the estimated 40,000 Haitians who have
jobs assembling products for American markets. These 40,000 people,
in turn, each support an average of five other people, he said.
   Haiti has the lowest per capita income in the Western Hemisphere.
   About $60 million in direct U.S. assistance to the Haitian
government was suspended last November and will remain frozen.
   The reaction to events in Haiti are in stark contrast to what
the United States did in an analogous case: the removal of
Panamanian President Eric Delvalle by military chief Manuel Antonio
Noriega earlier this year.
   That sparked swift action by the Reagan administration, which
continued to recognize Delvalle as the legitimate leader of the
country and imposed massive economic sanctions on Panama in an
effort to drive Noriega from office. The effort has failed.
   A State Department official said that before acting in the
Noriega case, the administration took into account the longstanding
relationship between the United States and Panama and ``we saw a
significant element of dissatisfaction among the people of Panama
that we thought could be translated into his (Noriega's) downfall.''
   The United States appears to have less influence among the
people of Haiti, which had been a virtual hemispheric outcast for
decades under the dictatorship of Francois Duvalier and his son
Jean Claude Duvalier, who fled the country in February 1986.
   Haiti is so poor economically and inexperienced in the formation
of democratic institutions that tough measures would have little
impact, the official said.
   ``Namphy is immune to certain kinds of pressure because he
doesn't have much to lose,'' the official said. ``Haiti is already
at the bottom.''
   The official also noted there has been little pressure on
Capitol Hill for tough measures against the new Haitian regime,
while in the case of Panama, many members of Congress called for
stern action.

   The wife of a former minister who has been in a
coma since being attacked more than a year ago has been admitted to
a hospital for a two-month period of evaluation and rehabilitation,
hospital officials said today.
   Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey was admitted to Baylor University
Medical Center on Tuesday, said Dr. William L. Parker, medical
director of the Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation.
   ``She was brought here at the family's request because she had
not received an evaluation of her injuries'' since she was admitted
to a nursing home in December, Parker said today.
   ``We cannot predict how her improvement is going to turn out,''
Parker said, adding that a team of 12 physicians and specialists
hope to bring Mrs. Railey, 39, out of her coma.
   She now has normal and waking cycles and her eyes follow
movement some of the time, he said.
   Walker Railey, former senior pastor at the First United
Methodist Church in Dallas, said he found his wife on the garage
floor of their home on the night of April 21, 1987. She appeared to
have been choked, investigators said.
   Not long after the attack, Railey attempted suicide. Later, he
surrendered his ministerial credentials and moved to San Francisco
with a psychologist, Lucy Papillon, who admitted a romantic
relationship with Railey dating back to 1986.
   Mrs. Railey's parents have filed a civil lawsuit that accused
their son-in-law in the attack.
   No charges have been filed in connection with the attack;
authorities have said their investigation is at a standstill.

   A convicted murderer has filed a federal
lawsuit seeking the right to play the state lottery.
   Jesse Hatch, who is serving a life sentence at the Pontiac
Correctional Center, wrote lottery officials in February requesting
an application to play by mail, but they denied the request,
according to the lawsuit filed Monday.
   Steve Clark, assistant to the director of sales for the Illinois
State Lottery, suggested that Hatch seek permission from the
Department of Corrections, according to the lawsuit. But the
assistant warden at Stateville Correctional Center, where he was in
custody at the time, said no.
   So, Hatch filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court asking a
judge to order state officials to let him try his luck.
   Hatch, 35, has been in Pontiac since April. He was convicted in
1983 of the murder of a contractor, and his sentence specifies that
he has no chance for parole.
   In the lawsuit, Hatch says the state is denying his
constitutional rights by not allowing him to play the lottery.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A school administrators' group unveiled a
manual Wednesday to help teach superintendents how to get the most
out of their schools.
   The guide, ``Challenges for School Leaders,'' summarizes advice
from national reports on school reform and from such bibles of
modern business techniques as ``In Search of Excellence'' by Thomas
Peters and Robert Waterman.
   The study by the American Association of School Administrators
singled out six key challenges for superintendents and other school
leaders: sharing decision-making; attracting and rewarding good
teachers; curriculum leadership; educating the disadvantaged;
forging partnerships with businesses and other organizations; and
promoting greater parental involvement.
   Richard Miller, president of the association, told a news
conference that strong leadership is essential for effective
schools.
   ``If things are going to happen, it will happen largely because
of the expertise or lack thereof of the leadership that exists on a
site level or on a system-wide level,'' he said.
   He took exception to Education Secretary William J. Bennett's
characterization of public school administrators as a ``blob'' that
grows even when enrollment shrinks.
   Miller said, however, it is vital to provide more leadership
training for school executives because more than half the existing
administrators are expected to retire or leave the profession in
the next seven years.
   Strong superintendents already are moving to give teachers a
larger role in decision-making and to give local schools wider
authority to manage their own affairs, Miller said.
   Bennett has also suggested that schools experiment with hiring
business executives and other leaders from outside the education
establishment to run public schools.
   ``It would be interesting if we could take a Lee Iacocca or Ross
Perot and give them the same resources and the same regulations
that Richard Greene as chancellor of the New York City schools
operates under, to see how effective they could be,'' Miller said.
   The report quotes management expert Peter Drucker as writing
that, ``Effective executives do not make a great many decisions.
They concentrate on the important ones. They try to think through
what is strategic and generic, rather than solve problems.''

<TEXT>
   Syria has located the place in Lebanon where 15
foreign hostages are believed held by Iranian-backed guerrillas,
the Independent newspaper reported today.
   The London daily quoted unidentified Syrian intelligence
officers as saying the hostages are imprisoned inside the Hay Madi
barracks of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beirut's southern
suburbs.
   The report could not be independently confirmed.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
``that report is not new. We have never been able to confirm the
exact location of the hostages and we cannot confirm this latest
report.
   ``Although information on the hostages is conflicting and rarely
reliable we have always believed that some of them are in Beirut's
southern suburbs. We continue to pursue all leads about the
hostages.''
   The Independent said the Syrian officers are convinced the
hostages and their kidnappers ``are bottled up in an area no more
than 1,000 yards square and that there is no possibility of the
captors moving out.''
   But the Syrians also acknowledged that the hostages cannot be
rescued by force and that negotiations are needed with Hezbollah, a
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militant faction, if the hostages ``are
to be extricated alive,'' wrote correspondent John Bulloch.
   The barracks is situated close to the line dividing
Hezbollah-controlled territory from the Chiyah suburb dominated by
the pro-Syrian Amal militia, the newspaper said.
   Amal and Hezbollah guerrillas had been fighting for control of
Lebanon's slums until a cease-fire was called in May.
   The report said the single-story building is guarded by about
250 men, including Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and contains three
sections, including a closed section for ``special guards'' who
give the orders.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence officers in
Beirut as saying U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 43, who
was kidnapped near Tyre on Feb. 17, was moved to the barracks
before the Syrian army entered south Beirut last month.
   The Syrians entered the slums as part of the cease-fire
agreement between Amal and Hezbollah.
   The Syrians established the hostages' whereabouts from
observation and tip-offs and from Amal fighters captured during
fighting with the Hezbollah who were later released in prisoner
exchanges, the report said.
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon. The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Anderson was also reportedly among the hostages in the barracks.
   The three hostages reportedly missing from the barracks were
Alec Collett, 66, a British citizen, and two other hostages of
unknown nationality.
   Collett, a New York-based journalist, was kidnapped March 25,
1985, while traveling south of Beirut. On April 23, 1986, the
Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems said it killed
Collett in retaliation for British complicity in the April 15 U.S.
air attack on Libya. A videotape purporting to show Collett hanged
was made public.
   The two unidentified hostages were kidnapped on Jan. 26, 1987.

   Inspectors out looking for rundown houses
spotted one that needed a paint job, and it turned out it belonged
to Mayor John Norquist.
   But when the city issued an order that he get the place in
shape, his honor said not to worry, now that his campaign is over
he is getting his house in order.
   Norquist joked about the order this week at a public hearing. He
said Tuesday he has received two bids for the repainting, and he
soon will sign a contract for the work.
   ``I should have done it last year, but it was the heat of the
campaign,'' he said. Norquist was elected this spring.
   Robert Peterson, building code enforcement supervisor, said the
need for new paint was noticed by inspectors doing exterior house
checks in recent weeks. The order, which gives Norquist 60 days to
make arrangements for the improvements, will be mailed to the mayor
in a few days, he said.
   People who disregard repair orders can be fined $150 to $10,000,
Peterson said.

   Boris Becker has won Wimbledon twice,
but when he tried to park his car at the tournament Wednesday he
turned up a two-time loser _ and took a verbal beating from an
attendant named Tom.
   First, Becker, 20, was barred from the players' parking lot
because his car lacked an official sticker.
   Then, he ran into Tom, an attendent at Public Car Park No. 8,
who demanded that the men's sixth seed pay $9 to enter. Becker
refused, and Tom let fly in his best cockney.
   ``The tight sod. You would think with all the money he earns he
could spare a fiver for the car park,'' the attendant, whose last
name was not given, told Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.
   Tom said he would wait for Becker to return after his
second-round match against Karel Novacek and collect the money then.
   ``I'm also going to get him to autograph it,'' he said.
   But after beating Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia, Becker said
the incident had been blown out of proportion.
   ``There was never any problem this morning,'' Becker said. Asked
if the attendant had asked him to pay $9, Becker replied: ``Not
from me. Maybe from the policeman.''
   Wimbledon transport manager Pat Edwards said Becker should have
been allowed into the players' lot and she would look into the
matter.
   ``He is very special to us,'' she said.

   Like father, like son, except when taking
flying leaps on a motorcycle.
   Daredevil jumper Evel Knievel says his son Robbie will try next
month to break his father's record _ without breaking any bones _
and jump 22 cars, riding his motorcycle without using his hands.
   ``Nobody in the world can perform like this kid,'' the elder
Knievel said Tuesday during a promotional tour for his son's
upcoming jump, scheduled here July 31.
   ``How he does it, I don't know,'' Knievel said. ``I get nervous
just thinking about it. I get a lot more nervous than when I was
jumping.''
   Knievel, 49, said he cleared 21 cars during his career.
   Accidents have cost Knievel about three years in hospitals and
forced him to endure 14 operations to repair injuries that included
a total of 35 broken bones, he said.
   His 25-year-old son, by contrast, has broken only his knee.
   ``He's a lot better than I ever was,'' Knievel said.

<HEAD>Fire Kills Dozens of Pilgrims, Many of Them Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sparks from a makeshift food stall were
blamed Wednesday for a fire that killed 47 Christian pilgrims, most
of them children, who had camped outside a monastery to pay homage
to the Virgin Mary.
   Hundreds of tents lay in smoldering heaps in the wake of the
Tuesday night blaze fed by exploding butane lamps.
   Witnesses said monks quickly closed al-Muharraq Monastery's
massive front door after the fire broke out, and some of the dead
were trampled as panicking pilgrims rushing to the door turned back
toward a gate in the fence around the campground.
   About 5,000 pilgrims were at the monastery for the Feast of the
Consecration of the Church of the Virgin.
   Held every June 21-28, the feast commemorates the farthest south
that the Holy Family reached in its flight to save the infant Jesus
from King Herod's order that newborn boys in Palestine should be
slain. The monastery is built on the cave in Mount Qousqam where
Coptic Christian lore says Joseph, Mary and Jesus were sheltered.
   The church, called the Church of the Cave, has its altar atop a
stone where the Holy Family is said to have rested. The altar is
dated 747.
   Neither the church nor the monastery, a 10-acre compound with 70
to 80 monks in residence, was damaged in the tent-city fire.
   A senior provincial security officer for Assiut, the governorate
capital 240 miles south of Cairo, said 26 children, 15 men and six
women died from burns, smoke inhalation or from being trampled. He
said 15 others were injured trying to escape.
   The blaze began when sparks from the food stall, which provided
pilgrims with tea, coffee and sandwiches, set afire nearby tents,
he said. This in turn ignited about three dozen butane lamps, said
the officer, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   The officer said the stand's two owners, both Copts, were
arrested, but that the fire clearly was an accident.
   ``There was a big rush from the pilgrims toward the main gate of
the camp. Some children fell and were trampled to death,'' he said.
   A survivor, who appeared dazed, said eight pieces of
firefighting equipment arrived from nearby villages but not until
``a full hour after the fire started.'' He said there was no water
at the tent city to fight the blaze.
   A preliminary police report estimated damage at $420,000.
Several of the burned tents were occupied by merchants catering to
the pilgrims, many of whom were camped for the duration of the
religious festival, or ``moulid.''
   In Egypt, such festivals are common among both Moslems, almost
90 percent of the 54 million Egyptians, and Coptic Christians,
whose ancestors gave to the world the concept of monasticism.
   Unlike most monasteries, whose ascetic founders in the first
years of Christianity usually wandered away into the desert for
solitude, al-Muharraq Monastery is relatively accessible. It is in
al-Qusiyyah, near a well-traveled route and the Nile River about 35
miles north of Assiut.
   Moreover, because of its importance to the Copts as the
southernmost haven for the Holy Family in Egypt, its moulid is
among the most famous in the Coptic Orthodox Church, founded by St.
Mark.
   Al-Muharraq formerly was called the Virgin Mary Monastery. Anba
Sarabion, the Coptic bishop for public services in Cairo, said it
took its current name apparently because of the reddish color of
the rocks in the area. The name means ``The Burnt Monastery.''

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Bill to Tighten Controls Over Covert Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee gave
party-line approval Wednesday to a bill designed to tighten
congressional control over foreign covert intelligence action,
after defeating a Republican attempt to ease the restrictions.
   The 22-17 vote sends the bill to the full House, where it is
expected to be passed later this summer. It remains unclear,
however, whether the measure will attract enough support to counter
an almost certain presidential veto.
   The bill, which grew out of the congressional Iran-Contra
hearings last year, would spell out more specifically how a
president must notify the House and Senate intelligence oversight
committees when he authorizes a covert action.
   Such actions are defined as government activities designed to
influence political, economic or military conditions abroad while
concealing the U.S. role.
   Under the proposal, a version of which already has been passed
by the Senate, the president would be required to report any covert
action to the intelligence committees within 48 hours of its
authorization.
   In extremely sensitive cases, the president could limit
notification to a so-called ``gang of eight:'' the chairman and
ranking minority member of the House and Senate intelligence
committees and the majority and minority leaders of each chamber.
   Current law requires only that the president give an undefined
``timely'' notice to Congress, and the Iran-Contra investigators
concluded that President Reagan exploited the loophole to put off
notification on the Iran arms-for-hostages deals for more than 10
months.
   Foreign Affairs Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., a member of the
Iran-Contra investigating panel, called the bill ``a modest but
appropriate adjustment in the current law.''
   The Democratic-dominated panel defeated, 19-13, an amendment by
Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., that would have limited
notification in sensitive cases to only the minority and majority
leaders of the two chambers, and would have let the president waive
the 48-hour notification limit in ``rare, extraordinary
circumstances'' where national security was at stake.
   Arguing for the amendment, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a member of
the House Intelligence Committee, noted cases in which other
countries had come to the United States for help in a covert action
but asked that Congress not be notified because of a perception
that lawmakers can't keep secrets.
   He cited cases in which an Algerian effort several years ago to
damage the standing of Libya's Moammar Gadhafi was ``blown'' by an
apparent U.S. leak to the news media, and where covert aid to
Philippine President Corazon Aquino to combat communist rebels was
disclosed in a news report.
   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a former Intelligence Committee
chairman who headed the House Iran-Contra panel, said the
legislation is necessary to ensure that Congress can exert a
balancing effect on administration decision making. He said that
need outweighs the risk of occasional leaks.
   ``If you grant the president power to withhold information, the
whole oversight process is irreparably damaged,'' Hamilton said.
``Information, in this town, is power.''
   The panel also defeated, 13-10, an attempt by Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., to impose criminal penalties on government
officials who leak classified national security information.

   The home of the Atlanta Falcons wants
motorists to get a kick out of their town and leave some of their
tourist dollars behind.
   City officials plan to erect ``the world's largest football'' to
lure tourists off Interstate 85 and into their town, 30 miles
northeast of Atlanta.
   The Big Football, to be a fascimile of an official NFL football,
will be 200 feet high and 60 feet wide.
   ``We are very fortunate to have the Falcons here,'' said
Councilman Jim Theus, who pitched the idea at Tuesday's council
meeting. ``Whether they win or whether they lose, they are a
professional football team. How many places can boast that? Tourism
is going to be the big thing here.''
   Theus owns Porkland Express, a popular barbecue restaurant at
the Suwanee exit on I-85. Across the street from Porkland is the
Falcons complex, including team offices and the training camp,
where players work out nearly year-around.
   Local merchants favor the idea and are willing to help pay for
the football, which may cost as much as $100,000, he said. However,
Theus also hopes the city's tourism tax will help cover expenses.

   Companies contemplating a 1990s version of ``The
Name Game'' might be well advised to stick with the old and
familiar.
   An ill-conceived name chance can hurt a company, says Landor
Associates, a San Francisco-based consulting firm.
   Landor recently asked 1,000 consumers in shopping malls in 12
cities to rate 672 different names in terms of familiarity and
esteem.
   Sara Lee ranked in the top 15 percent in the latest survey. That
was a marked improvement from the days when it was known as
Consolidated Foods and ranked in the bottom 10 percent of the
Landor sample.
   Allegheny Airlines once ranked in the bottom 20 percent in the
Landor survey, but placed in the top 40 percent after changing its
name to USAir.
   ``In the '90s, major corporations will rediscover the raw image
power of their established names and may find it much more
efficient to modify or add meaning to them rather than start from
scratch,'' said Landor President John Diefenbach.
   The survey said consumers scoff at some of the high-tech names _
such as USX, Primerica and Unisys.
   The old names of those corporations _ U.S. Steel, American Can
and the premerger Burroughs and Sperry _ each had placed higher in
previous surveys.
   ``The message is very simple,'' Diefenbach said. ``Meaningless
names and symbols can confuse and alienate the consumer.''

   Forty-eight percent of hospital executives who
answered a mailed questionnaire said they thought their hospitals
could fail financially within five years.
   Hospital occupancy rates were reported to be low. Executives at
46 percent of the hospitals said their hospitals were less than
half full during the year preceding the survey, which was released
Wednesday.
   Three-fourths of the respondents said their hospitals faced a
nursing shortage and that the quality of patient care was declining
as a result.
   The survey was conducted by Touche Ross, a New York accounting
firm. Questionnaires were sent to the top hospital executive in
each of the nation's 5,678 hospitals, Touche Ross said. The
questionnaires were returned by 1,419, or 25 percent, of the
executives, the firm said.
   Seventy-six percent of the hospital executives said that in five
years patients will have less freedom in their choice of doctors
and medical services. And three-fourths of the executives said they
think health care should be limited when the cost of that care
becomes excessive, according to the survey.

<TEXT>
   Driver- and passenger-side air bags will be
standard equipment on 1989 Lincoln Continentals, Ford Motor Co.
announced Wednesday in a move that safety advocates said will
trigger adoption of the restraint system throughout the auto
industry.
   ``This is the final event that will make the air bag inevitable
as a standard safety feature in American automobiles,'' Ralph Nader
said following Ford's announcement.
   Ford's plan will make it the first U.S. automaker to offer air
bags as standard equipment on both sides of the front seat. West
Germany's Porsche since 1987 has offered twin air bags as standard
equipment on some models.
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford vice president for environmental and
safety engineering, told reporters that safety has become a quality
that sells among car buyers.
   ``(The) safety race is in high gear,'' she said. ``Old-fashioned
word of mouth about ... safety features will provide the biggest
spark for selling safety.''
   The Continental's air-bag system will have four sensors on the
front of the car to trigger the air bags in the event of a frontal
crash equivalent to a 25 mph collision with a parked car, said
Robert Munson, director of the Ford automotive safety office.
   The system is designed to be used with seat belts, not to
replace them.
   The air bags inflate with nitrogen gas in 1-25th of a second and
deflate immediately. Design of the passenger-side air bag was
difficult technically because the bag must cover both the window
and center positions of the front seat and also must travel a
greater distance on inflating, Ford said.
   The company had no firm estimate of how much the air bags would
add to the cost of the Continental. Ford said each bag would cost
the company $300 to $350.
   Ford in 1985 made driver-side air bags standard equipment on its
Tempo and Topaz models. The automaker's 1990 line will have 11
models with standard driver-side air bags, with projected sales of
1 million, Petrauskas said.
   The company last year successfully opposed a federal regulation
to require air bags on both sides of cars not equipped with
automatic seat belts. Petrauskas said the delay in the requirement
allowed the company to install driver-side bags without waiting for
development of passenger-side bags.
   Besides Ford, Chrysler Corp. has adopted air bags for some
models. The company in May said driver-side air bags would be
standard equipment on six models built this year, and by 1990 on
all models built in the United States.
   General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automaker, in 1988
offered driver-side air bags as an option on one model. The number
will be expanded to five in 1989, and the next year 500,000 GM-made
cars will have driver-side air bags as standard equipment, GM
spokesman Don Postma said in Detroit.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group that monitors the
auto industry, said only Honda among the Japanese automakers offers
an air bag as standard equipment on any model.
   Nader criticized other automakers for not keeping up with Ford
and Chrysler in safety features.
   ``It is not nice to see GM and the Japanese automakers lagging
behind,'' Nader said. ``They're jeopardizing their customers'
lives.''

<HEAD>Intruding Sub Apparently Hit But Escapes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Submarine hunters believe they hit and
probably damaged a foreign submarine prowling off southern Sweden
earlier this month, the military said Wednesday.
   A search of the area failed to produce evidence of damage, and
the intruding ship apparently escaped, said an armed forces
statement.
   The incident was one of nine live-fire engagements in the last
two months between the Anti-Submarine Warfare unit and suspected
foreign vessels from unidentified countries.
   On two of those occasions the sub hunters found they had blasted
submarine-shaped rocks, said armed forces spokesman H.G. Wessberg.
   Sweden has reported underwater snoopers every summer for the
last decade. It refuses to say whom it suspects for the violations
of its territorial waters.
   But it has accused the Soviet Union twice, once in 1981 when a
Soviet sub grounded near Sweden's largest naval base at Karlskrona,
and after a series of incidents the following year. Moscow has
denied it has recently intruded into Swedish waters.
   The military statement _ its first communique issued since the
incidents _ also indicated that the rules-of-engagement were being
relaxed to give commanders on the scene the power to decide when to
open fire.
   ``This is necessary to get results, and at the same time to
increase the risk for an intruding power,'' the statement said.
``Our anti-submarine activities have continuously improved,'' it
said.
   Ship commanders previously needed higher authority to open fire
and were required to warn suspected intruders that they could be
fired upon.
   Defense analysts believe neutral Sweden is growing more
important in the war planning of both the NATO alliance and the
Warsaw Pact as both sides focus more attention on the naval theater
of the northern seas.
   The Swedish-Danish straits control the bottleneck into the
Baltic Sea, along which the Soviet Union has a network of dry docks
for maintenance and repair.
   In one incident two weeks ago, Wessberg said, the sub hunters
opened up on an intruder with more firepower than Sweden has ever
been used against a single target at sea.
   The prowler was detected and trapped in 282 feet of water near
the Gustav Dalen lighthouse off the city of Oxelsund, about 60
miles south of Stockholm, he said in an interview.
   Contact was lost amid the noise of exploding depth charges and
underwater grenades, and the sub apparently slipped away in the
roil of water.
   ``When we played back the tapes, we saw that the submarine was
exactly where we thought it was,'' Wessberg said, adding that
``it's probable'' the ship was damaged.
   In other incidents this year, the navy detonated remote-control
mines lacing the waters around sensitive bases, but failed to score
any hits, he said. The navy was investigating the why the intruders
escaped apparently unharmed, he said.
   Earlier this year the government approved a special allocation
for the unit of $83 million and an extra ship. It was the third
time since 1980 that extra money was earmarked for the unit,
bringing the total to $333 million.
   The unit is comprised of two Swedish-made corvettes, 12
submarines, 7 mine-detector vessels, 16 patrol boats and 12
sonar-equipped helicopters, Wessberg said.

<HEAD>U.S. Would Be Concerned About Chinese Missile Sales to Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday that
Chinese sales of short-range missiles to Syria would raise ``deep
concern'' and add to the proliferation of dangerous ballistic
weapons in the volatile Middle East.
   Syria is rumored to be talking to China about buying
surface-to-surface M-9 ballistic missiles the Chinese are testing,
according to Israeli leaders, including Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres.
   While the Soviet SS-21 missiles now in Syrian hands would have
to be deployed in vulnerable sites on the Golan Heights to hit
Israeli population centers, a Chinese M-9 could wreak the same
havoc from protected sites near Damascus, according to the Israeli
officials.
   Israeli Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron has expressed
particular concern that the missiles could be fitted with
chemical-agent warheads.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman echoed the Israeli
view that there is no evidence a Syrian-Chinese deal is imminent.
He did, however, repeat U.S. dismay at ``the global proliferation
of ballistic missiles.''
   ``Especially disturbing are sales to such regional hot spots as
the Middle East. We have raised these concerns with China and other
countries,'' he said.
   ``The Chinese have exhibited their ``M'' family of
surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles at arms shows. We
would view the sale of such missiles to Syria with deep concern, as
we would proliferation of other ballistic missile systems,'' Redman
said.
   He noted that the U.S. concern about missile proliferation in
the Middle East was raised with the Soviets during President
Reagan's summit trip to Moscow.
   The United States also has complained to China about sales of
long-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia.

<HEAD>Vietnam Choses Reported Corruption Fighter As Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Do Muoi, a veteran revolutionary who
reportedly directed purges against corruption in Vietnam's ruling
Communist Party, was chosen prime minister Wednesday, Radio Hanoi
said.
   Do Muoi was elected on the opening day of a regular National
Assembly session, the broadcast monitored in Bangkok said. He
replaces Pham Hung, who died of a heart attack in March.
   Do Muoi, 71, is the third-ranking member of the Politburo, the
nation's top policy-making body.
   A party communique, meanwhile, said the party has decided to
regularly change its leadership to promote efficiency and economic
reforms.
   The communique of the Central Committee's recent session said
that when the party elects members to its upper echelons one-third
of the membership should be changed.
   The Central Committee is the policy-implementing arm of the
13-member Politburo. It had 124 full members and 49 alternate
members when it was elected in December 1986.
   At the National Assembly session, Vo Van Kiet, who had been
acting premier, noted among other serious economic problems an
acute food shortage in the northern provinces since early this
year. Vietnam has appealed for foreign emergency aid to offset the
shortages caused by crop failures last year.
   Kiet said that because production stagnated as the population
grew, the amount of food available per capita in those provinces
dropped from 581 pounds in 1982 to 506 pounds in 1987.
   He called for continuation of economic reforms based on
decentralized management and material incentives, according to the
official Vietnam News Agency.
   Do Muoi gave up the vice premiership last year after becoming
the No. 2 man in the party secretariat, where he is said to have
directed a purge of inept and corrupt elements in the 1.8
million-member party.
   Do Muoi, who is little known to most Vietnamese, joined the
Indochinese Communist Party in 1939 and held key party and
government posts during the struggle against the French
colonialists and then the Americans and South Vietnamese.
   In several top economy-related government posts after the 1975
communist victory, Do Muoi helped forge the strict Marxist policies
which the party now says led to Vietnam's ruin.
   Southerners are said to resent him for having led a disastrous
effort in 1978 at ``socialist transformation'' of the private
business and commerce in the traditionally capitalist south.
   Vietnamese sources had said Do Muoi was the most likely choice
as premier because of his reputation as a party organizer and
disciplinarian.
   Some Western diplomats have said the choice of Do Muoi would
send a wrong signal to the average Vietnamese, who preferred acting
premier Vo Van Kiet, 66, a leading pioneer of economic reform. The
selection of Do Muoi could slow down the reform momentum, the
Hanoi-based diplomats said.
   The pragmatic party chief, Nguyen Van Linh, called for the
continuation of purges begun since he took power in December 1986,
according to a partial text of his speech obtained from a Western
embassy in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   Since the party was founded in 1930, its leaders have largely
been veterans of the revolutionary struggle against the French,
Americans, and South Vietnam. Lately, the party has given top
priority to economic reform and said that incompetent,
conservative-thinking members can no longer remain in top posts.

   A 13-year-old girl who survived a
fiery bus-truck accident that killed 27 people has sent a message
of forgiveness to the driver charged with murder in the case.
   Katrina Muller recorded her thoughts on tape and said afterward
that she didn't know if Larry Mahoney ``should be put to death or
not, but he should be punished.''
   Mahoney, 34, allegedly was drunk and driving the wrong way on
Interstate 71 near Carrollton last month when his pickup truck
collided with the bus loaded with youngsters returning from a
Cincinnati amusement park to a church in Radcliff.
   Two days later, Mahoney was booked on 27 counts of murder and a
commonwealth's attorney said he would seek the death penalty.
   Katrina made the tape and sent it June 3 while still
hospitalized in Louisville and undergoing three skin graft
operations. Her face, right arm and both hands were burned badly in
the fire that followed the May 14 collision.
   She was released from the hospital Saturday.
   ``The tape is now at the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric
Center where Larry is being evaluated,'' said one of his attorneys,
Russell Baldani of Lexington.
   Baldani said he checked Wednesday with Mahoney ``and he hasn't
heard the cassette but he knows about it from his family. I'm going
to talk with the center's director tomorrow at LaGrange to see if
he will release it to us.''
   The teen-ager's mother, Mickie Muller, said the idea for the
tape came during one of those days when Katrina was ``having a lot
of pain. This was in the midst of some of the worst time she was
having.''
   She recalled her daughter saying, ``I wish Larry Mahoney was
right here in front of me. I would tell him I forgive him and maybe
it'd make him feel better.''
   Mrs. Muller said that on the tape, Katrina ``introduced herself
and told him some things about herself, just to make herself not
just a statistic but a real person.''
   Aware of reports that Mahoney had become a born-again Christian,
Mrs. Muller said Katrina hoped that the rumor was true.
   ``Just keep on doing right,'' Katrina said to Mahoney. ``And
then when it's your time to go, then you'll be with the children
who've go on before.'' Most of the victims were teen-agers.
   Katrina also sent along a photograph taken of herself before the
crash.
   Mrs. Muller said ``I can't honestly say I'm not still angry with
Larry Mahoney _ not as a person but as a drunk driver. But that's
all right too. The Bible says to `be angry and sin not.'''
   Despite her anger, she said she still could forgive.

<HEAD>Slower Aircraft Sales Helped Pull Down Durable Goods Orders in May</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY41</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A falloff in aircraft orders caused a 2.2
percent plunge in overall orders to U.S. factories for ``big
ticket'' durable goods in May, the steepest drop in nine months,
the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$114.8 billion last month, down from $117.4 billion in April.
   Economists, who had expected more than a 2 percent rise in
orders, were suprised, but noted that the government's survey
apparently did not include several multibillion-dollar orders
placed to Seattle-based Boeing Co.
   Even though the overall May decline was the largest since
August's 2.3 percent fall, analysts saw little cause to worry that
the report was forecasting a significant decline in manufacturing,
which has been booming as the cheaper dollar bolsters export sales
of U.S. goods.
   Transportation orders, which includes aircraft, fell 9 percent
to $28.6 billion following a 0.2 percent increase in April.
Military orders, another category which swings widely from month to
month, was down 16.6 percent to $8.3 billion in May, after rising
1.9 percent in April.
   Excluding defense goods, orders fell only 0.9 percent. Excluding
airplanes, they rose 0.6 percent.
   ``It's really not a report of great consequence in terms of
showing any fundamental weakness in the manufacturing sector,''
said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association
of Manufacturers.
   Before May, durable goods orders rose three months running. The
April increase, which previously had been pegged at 1.0 percent,
was revised on Wednesday to a stronger 1.8 percent.
   ``I think what we're seeing is what we want to see, which is
continued growth, but maybe some moderation of the pace,'' said
Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist of Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., consulting firm.
   The financial markets and the White House read the report as
good news for inflation. Many traders and some analysts have been
concerned that the export boom, coupled with steady consumer demand
in the United States, would strain manufacturers' capacity and
cause shortages and price increases.
   Rallies in early trading Wednesday on both the stock and bond
markets was attributed to a rise in the value of the dollar and to
the durable goods report.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said the report offered
``more news that inflation remains under control. It is good news.''
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a sign
of business expansion plans, fell 6.9 percent last month, following
increases of 3.4 percent in April and 3.8 percent in March.
   Despite the setback in May, analysts still expect
export-producing manufacturers to spend heavily on modernization
and expansion. At the current rate of shipment, capital goods
manufacturers would need five months to eliminate their order
backlog even if they received no new orders.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel zoomed 5.5 percent
following a 1.6 percent rise in April.
   Orders for electrical machinery also posted a strong gain, 3.5
percent, following a 5.0 percent rise a month before.
   There was a 2.4 percent decline in orders for non-electrical
machinery, more than erasing a 1.2 percent gain in April.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent in May to $114.4
billion, following a 0.9 percent decline in April. The backlog of
unfilled orders edged up only 0.1 percent to $405.4 billion.

   Ecstatic Lakers fans, relishing the
back-to-back basketball title promised a year ago by Coach Pat
Riley, filled downtown in a sea of purple today to bask in the
presence of their heroes.
   ``Ain't it great?'' asked a beaming Tyrone May, 22.
   Thousands of people stood along a mile-long section of Broadway
and cheered the champions, who wore Lakers T-shirts and ballcaps
and waved to fans from floats headed to a noon City Hall ceremony.
   An estimated 15,000 lined the parade route and 4,000 had
converged on City Hall, said police spokesman Don Lawrence.
   The single-word headline ``CHAMPS!'' in Lakers purple splashed
across the top of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner in 2{-inch type,
and the parade route was clogged with vendors hawking T-shirts,
buttons and posters as fans grabbed prime spots to view the floats.
   The 108-105 victory Tuesday night over the Detroit Pistons made
the Lakers the first team since the Boston Celtics of 1969 to
repeat as consecutive NBA champions.
   ``It's party time,'' said Gus Corona, 29. ``This is great, it's
the first time in 19 years. This has got to be the greatest.''
   Corona stood on a milk crate to tape the parade with his video
camera.
   At City Hall, voice-of-the-Lakers Chick Hearn and Mayor Tom
Bradley were to preside at the noontime rally to introduce the
players.
   It was during similar ceremonies last year that Riley
``guaranteed'' that the Lakers would repeat as champions in 1988.
   The parade culminated two days of Laker fever that began
building early Tuesday. T-shirts, confetti, glitz, glamour,
parties, celebrities, music and Magic (as in Lakers' superstar
guard Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson) were on the minds of most fans.
   During the game, traffic was strangely light on Southern
California's usually busy freeways. Sounds of the play-by-play
could be heard drifting out of apartments throughout the city.
   ``Go Lakers Go. Beat Detroit,'' read the shopping center marquee
in Malibu, the celebrity enclave that many fans call home.
   Tickets were at a premium three hours before game time: A $1,100
price tag was set on the last pair of tickets remaining at Tyson
Choice Ticket Service.
   ``It's been nuts all day,'' said Mike Gubner at the Sports
Section, a souvenir store six blocks from the Forum in Inglewood,
the Lakers' home court. Selling at a brisk pace were $10 T-shirts
reading: ``We're shootin' for two, back to back.''
   At the Sports Deli in Century City, assistant manager Marvin
Smith described the post-game scene as ``bedlam.''
   Smith, a Pistons fan, said he played ``Respect'' by Aretha
Franklin over the bar's stereo system ``because we beat the Celtics
and we took the Lakers all the way to seven games.''

<HEAD>Atlanta Mayor Says City Close To Ready For Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young on Wednesday blasted
criticism of the city's preparations for the Democratic National
Convention, saying reports that the host city will not be ready in
time are exaggerated.
   ``I don't care what people say about Atlanta. Anybody who
doesn't like Atlanta can go somewhere else,'' Young said. ``This is
a building and growing city and it will be for some years to come,
but whatever we need for the convention is going to be ready by the
time the convention gets here.''
   Young was responding to recent news articles that reported bad
judgment calls by convention planners working on space for
convention sessions and hotel accomodations. The articles also said
some major transportation routes are still under construction and
convention planners have been fighting among themselves.
   ``I don't know what (they're) talking about in terms of
confusion and chaos,'' Young said. ``Peace and quiet and
tranquility and everybody getting along is not news, and that's
what we got.''
   Young said he is in frequent contact with convention planners
and party officials. He estimated that the city is about ``85 to 90
percent ready'' for the convention, a condition with which he is
``very comfortable.''
   ``The things we intended to get ready by the convention will be
ready,'' Young said. ``We had a convention bigger than this a month
ago, so we can take care of the convention as we are.''
   Young said state officials never expected to complete expansion
on Interstates 75 and 85, which pass through downtown Atlanta,
before the convention begins July 18.
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris also defended the city's readiness
for the convention at his weekly news conference Wednesday, saying
``we handle almost on a weekly basis conventions that large and
even larger.''
   ``I saw the same kind of stories from the California convention
before we went there (San Francisco in 1984) ... and it all worked
well. And I think Atlanta and Georgia are going to do the same
thing,'' he said.
   Harris, noting the convention's importance to Atlanta's image,
announced a stepped-up litter collection program using non-violent
criminal offenders sentenced to community service as part of their
probation.
   Officials said such offenders, most of whom were convicted of
drunken driving, already have collected 70 tons of trash in
downtown Atlanta in sweeps over the last three months.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 77 in Street Battles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested 77 people following
street battles between protesters and riot police in Rangoon that
claimed the lives of nine people, the state radio announced
Wednesday.
   Calm returned to the streets of the capital as authorities
enforced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and banned public gatherings.
The restrictions were ordered late Tuesday, hours after 5,000
students and other protesters fought stone-throwing duels with
police.
   The restrictions are to last until Aug. 19.
   Students at several institutions had peacefully demonstrated the
past week for release of detained students, reinstatement of those
expelled after previous protests, and legalization of student
unions. Violence erupted after the government responded by closing
the schools.
   The radio said 10 students and three women were among the 77
people arrested. It said six policemen and three demonstrators were
killed.
   The government earlier said five policemen were killed and 26
others seriously injured. One rioter was killed and several others
were injured, it had said.
   The radio also announced the closure of Medical College Two.
Closure of the Rangoon Institute of Technology was announced
earlier in the day, and classes were suspended at the Institute of
Medicine and the Institute of Dental Science. The Education
Institute was the only institution of higher education still open
in the capital.
   There was no apparent extra security on the streets, which were
calm but with less traffic than usual. Few people went to offices
or schools, and markets had few customers. Local officials went
into residential areas warning people not to gather in groups of
five or more.
   Burma is ruled by the one-party regime of military strongman Ne
Win, who seized power in a 1962 military coup. Ne Win's ``Burmese
way to socialism'' is an amalgam of socialist economics, strict
military control and isolationism.
   For decades, the government has been fighting a dozen
ethnic-based insurgencies in the country, one of Southeast Asia's
poorest, and has dealt with other domestic opposition swiftly and
decisively.
   The country's first riots since 1974 erupted last October when
the government declared invalid much of the currency in
circulation, making life difficult for many people. On March 18,
several days of student unrest at two universities climaxed in a
rampage by students and other protesters that was swiftly crushed
by police and military units.
   Diplomatic sources told reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, that as
many as 100 people may have died in the March 18 violence. A
government panel announced only two deaths and said 625 people were
arrested, many of them since freed.
   Witnesses said Tuesday's fighting began as some 1,000 students
of the Rangoon Arts and Science University, which was closed after
Monday's classes, marched from the campus towards downtown Rangoon.
High school students joined them.
   They said 200 police swung batons and hurled stones to stop them
near the Singaporean embassy, in the Myenigone area about two miles
south of the campus.
   The demonstrators, by then about 5,000 strong, hurled stones and
forced the police to retreat a block south, where a strong military
barricade stood. The protesters then dispersed.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets To Exchange Recent Movies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union will
exchange 10 recent movies apiece under an agreement signed
Wednesday to take advantage of the reforms under way in Moscow.
   The 10 films will be chosen from a field of 30 nominated by each
side, and will be shown in five U.S. and Soviet cities, said the
American signatory, Arthur Hiller, a vice president of the
Directors' Guild of America.
   Movies are ``one of the best reflections of our new politics of
perestroika and glasnost,'' said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin,
who signed the agreement for the Soviet State Committee for
Cinematography.
   Perestroika refers to efforts to restructure the Soviet economy
and glasnost to the campaign for greater openness.
   The reforms, and improved U.S.-Soviet relations, have made the
Soviets more receptive to U.S. movies and have produced Soviet
films that are more interesting to U.S. audiences, raising
prospects that ``out of this cultural exchange can come a
commercial exchange,'' said Jack Valenti, head of the Motion
Picture Association of America.
   ``The future for this has never been brighter in the Soviet
Union,'' Valenti said. ``Once this gets started, I see ...
expansion.''
   The exchange agreement stemmed from cultural talks conducted by
the director of the U.S. Information Agency, Charles Z. Wick, who
also attended the signing ceremonies.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes in Beirut, Killing One and Injuring 18</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A car bomb in Christian east Beirut
killed one person and wounded 18 on Wednesday, while Palestinian
militias battled in the city's refugee camps in a power struggle
that has claimed more than 50 lives.
   A police spokesman said a green sedan loaded with 44 pounds of
explosives detonated at 11 a.m. in a narrow alley in the Karantina
district.
   The blast set six shops on fire and damaged eight cars parked
nearby, according to the spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
   Wednesday's explosion raised the death toll from six car
bombings in Lebanon this year to 94 people killed and 251 wounded.
   The Lebanese Forces, the main right-wing Christian militia that
controls east Beirut, said explosives experts defused another car
bomb in Karantina minutes before it was to explode. The Lebanese
Forces said in a statement that the car contained a 22-pound time
bomb.
   The second car bomb was meant to explode shortly after the first
one ``to inflict as many casualties as possible among rescuers,''
the statement said.
   Police could not confirm there was a second car bomb.
   The Lebanese Forces blamed the recent bombings in east Beirut on
a rival militia force led by Elie Hobeika, a Syrian-backed
Christian leader.
   The leader of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, ousted Hobeika
as the militia's commander in a bloody rebellion in January 1986,
after Hobeika signed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty with rival
Moslem warlords in Lebanon.
   Hobeika then set up a base in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.
   Also in Moslem south Beirut on Wednesday, police spokesman said
five people were killed and 18 wounded in clashes between Yasser
Arafat's Fatah guerrilla faction and Col. Saeed Mousa's
Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising.
   Mousa broke away from Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
in 1983 and set up headquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   The casualties raised the death toll to 51 people killed and 206
since the latest round of fighting between the two Palestinian
militias erupted 13 days ago.
   The factions are fighting for control of the devastated Chatilla
and Bourj el-Barajneh camps. Both sides are using howitzers,
rockets and mortars to pound each other's positions in the camps,
already badly battered from years of violence.
   A Fatah spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused
unidentified ``other sides'' of supporting Mousa's fighters with
artillery fire from positions in Syrian-policed west Beirut.
   Arafat's guerrillas dislodged Mousa's followers from the two
camps on Beirut's southern outskirts in earlier battles. But the
dissidents regrouped in Syrian-controlled territory along the edges
of the shantytowns.
   Libyan mediators and other Palestinian factions have failed to
secure a cease-fire to end the fighting.
   Arafat's loyalists and Mousa's dissidents have been fighting for
supremacy in the camps despite a reconciliation between the PLO
chief and Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus in April.
   Their efforts were aimed at ending the often bloody 5-year-old
feud over who would control the Palestinian movement.
   The battles between rival Palestinian factions have been fanned
by Arafat's chief spokesman, who has said that the PLO is prepared
to live in peace with Israel.
   The unusually conciliatory statement by Bassam Abu Sharif,
initially circulated earlier this month and repeated again Monday
on the front page of Beirut's leftist As-Safir newspaper, led to
the collapse of a four-day truce in the camps battle.
   The statement, which Sharif labeled a ``policy breakthrough,''
said:
   ``The means by which the Israelis want to achieve a lasting
peace and security is through direct talks, with no attempts by any
outside party to impose or veto a settlement. The Palestinians
agree.''
   ``The Palestinians would accept, indeed, insist on,
international guarantees for the security of all states in the
region.''
   The PLO, backed by the Arab world, wants an independent homeland
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the
Israelis have been fighting to quell a 6{-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   Arafat himself has yet to publicly endorse Sharif's statement,
which was first circulated at the Algiers Arab summit earlier this
month, without Abu Sharif's signature.

   The people of Landaize, one of whom recently
dug up five skeletons under his house, were relieved to learn that
their village was not the scene of a massacre _ at least not
recently.
   Santos Martin, a resident of Landaize, near Lyon, came upon the
skeletons of two men, one woman and two children while digging in
his basement, officials said Tuesday.
   Experts who examined the skeletons said the bones dated from the
sixth century A.D., when Germanic tribes battled to take over this
region of Burgundy.
   The expert opinion was important for the villagers, said Robert
Vilain of the National Center for Scientific Research. They had
already begun throwing suspicious glances at their neighbors.

   Police raided hideouts of suspected Sikh
extremists in Punjab state on Wednesday, and the death toll in a
bomb attack a day earlier in Amritsar rose to 29.
   A.A. Siddiqui, a deputy inspector general of the Punjab police,
blamed the Amritsar bombing and two others this week on the Barbar
Khalsa gang, one of a dozen Sikh extremist groups operating in
Punjab.
   The radicals have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an
independent homeland in the northern state, where Sikhs form a
majority.
   Siddiqui said law enforcement officials launched ``a massive
combing'' operation aimed at suspected Barbar Khalsa hideouts.
   Police did not have a figure on number of people arrested, but
several were detained in New Delhi and Punjab after the bombings,
according to newspaper reports.
   He also said that patrolling has been stepped up and that the
government has renewed warnings to citizens not to touch suspicious
objects.
   The bomb went off Tuesday in a crowded wholesale market near the
Golden Temple in Amritsar. Most of the victims were Hindus.
   At least 40 people were injured, and 12 remained in critical
condition at Amritsar hospitals.
   Police said that 11 people were killed across Punjab state late
Tuesday and Wednesday in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists.
   Four of the victims were pulled out of a car in Punjab's
southern Sangrur district and shot to death, police said.
   The latest deaths raised to more than 1,370 the number of people
killed in Punjab by Sikh extremists since the start of the year.
   At least 55 more people have died in attacks blamed on the
radicals in neighboring states and New Delhi.
   The old walled city of Amritsar and several other neighborhoods
have been under an indefinite curfew since the bombing. A curfew
requires people to stay off the street.
   The curfew was ordered after mobs gathered Tuesday night and
initially blocked police from the bomb site.
   Sarabjeet Singh, deputy commissioner for Amritsar District,
described the city as ``tense but under control.''
   There was little activity in other parts of Amritsar as most
people observed a strike called to protest the bombing, the third
in as many days in northern India.
   On Monday, four people were killed and 40 injured when a bomb
went off in a crowded vegetable market in New Delhi.
   A day earlier, 18 people were killed and 33 injured when a bomb
exploded as they were watching a TV show at an electronics shop in
Haryana state.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million people
but are a majority in Punjab.

   An earthquake capable of cracking plaster and

of Armenia on Wednesday, the Tass news agency reported.
   The quake damaged old buildings in the Gukasyan district, about
68 miles northeast of the Armenian capital of Yerevan, according to
Tass. No injuries were reported.
   The quake struck the ancient land east of Turkey and south of
the Soviet republic of Georgia at 5:18 a.m. (9:18 p.m. EDT
Tuesday), with a magnitude of six on the 12-point Soviet scale at
the epicenter.
   A quake registering six is strong, felt by all people in the
area, knocking pictures from the walls and cracking plaster. Light
damage to buildings is possible.
   The Soviet scale measures the effects of an earthquake rather
than its intensity. It cannot be converted to the Richter scale
more widely known in the West.
   Armenia has been in the news since February because of a
campaign by ethnic Armenians to annex Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in
the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Church Unity As Lefebvre Stands Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday issued a plea
for unity within the Roman Catholic Church as Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre's continued defiance threatened a schism with the Vatican.
   Lefebvre on Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to elevate four
priests among his traditionalist followers to bishop's rank in a
ceremony on June 30.
   Creating bishops without papal permission is against the
church's canon.
   The 82-year-old Frenchman has rebelled for two decades against
the reforms enacted by the Vatican after the Second Vatican Council
of 1962-65, which simplified and modernized the Roman Catholic
liturgy.
   John Paul has given Lefebvre permission to consecrate only one
bishop Aug. 15. The Vatican has also formally warned Lefebvre that
he would be automatically excommunicated if he goes ahead with his
consecration plan.
   ``In these days we are particularly worried for the unity of the
Holy Church in the faithfulness to the revealed truth,'' the pope
told 13,000 people who attended his weekly audience at the Vatican.
   ``Let's return to the prayer of Christ, who during the Last
Supper, exhorted his disciples to be one. When we say the `Our
Father' at the end of this audience, let's recite it with this
particular intention,'' John Paul told the audience.
   A showdown that might cause the first schism in the church in
more than 100 years has loomed since Lefebvre reneged on a May 5
protocol that called for compromises by both the Vatican and the
traditionalists.
   Under the protocol, Lefebvre would have promised to be faithful
to the church and pope and to accept the teachings of the Second
Vatican Council.
   In 1976, Pope Paul VI barred Lefebvre from saying Mass and
giving the sacraments, but the archbishop has ordained more than
200 priests who continue to use the 16th century Tridentine Mass, a
Latin rite for which special permission is required. His movement
claims millions of followers worldwide.
   Lefebvre founded the traditionalist St. Pius X Fraternity based
in Switzerland and named after Piux X, who was pope in 1903-14 and
who condemned religious modernism.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves AIDS Testing, Counseling Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel on Wednesday approved a $400
million-a-year AIDS testing and counseling bill that includes stiff
penalties for breaching the confidentiality of a patient's test
results.
   The bill, in the works for a year before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, would give grants to states and to clinics,
health centers and hospitals to expand testing programs. It would
require post-test counseling to all who take the test for the fatal
disease, whether they were infected or not.
   The committee sent the bill to the House floor on a voice vote
after sponsors took out a section banning discrimination against
people with AIDS or the virus that causes it.
   ``The broad, private-sector, non-discrimination policy was
clearly too controversial for the current political climate,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the committee's health
panel.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called the omission ``a terrible public
health mistake.'' He said those most likely to have and transmit
AIDS would be reluctant to come in for tests if they could lose
their jobs, insurance or housing on the basis of the results.
   The president's commission on AIDS recently recommended a
federal policy banning discrimination against victims of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. Wyden said he would use the
recommendation in an attempt to build bipartisan support for
restoring the provision on the House floor.
   However, Waxman said he was pessimistic about the chances of
winning back the ban on discrimination unless President Reagan
specifically backs the panel's recommendation.
   ``We need the president, not the president's commission,'' he
said. ``Without it (Reagan's support), I can't see that members are
going to be willing to vote for it, have the courage to vote for
it, in an election year.''
   Waxman also said elimination of the discrimination portion
``removes the biggest objection that some of the right-wingers
have'' and makes it much less likely that the bill would be blocked
in the Senate, where it is pending in a committee.
   In work sessions Tuesday and Wednesday, the committee rejected a
long series of amendments sponsored by Rep. William Dannemeyer,
R-Calif., most of them proposals that had failed earlier in
Waxman's subcommittee.
   Among them were attempts to require testing of all prisoners,
marriage license applicants and hospital admittees. The bill does
require that states test people convicted of prostitution, sexual
assault or crimes related to intravenous drug abuse in order to
qualify for federal testing and counseling money.
   Dannemeyer also failed to win approval of a requirement that
people with AIDS or the AIDS virus be reported to authorities by
name; the bill requires that cases be reported with statistical and
demographic information, but does not require identifying
information.
   Other unsuccessful Dannemeyer amendments would have reduced from
$10,000 to $2,000 the maximum fine for intentional or negligent
violation of confidentiality; required states to outlaw gay
bathhouses in order to receive money; and required doctors to
notify spouses, sex partners or IV needle partners if the patient
didn't notify them within a reasonable period.
   The last was rejected after members of both parties said the
bill already exempts doctors from confidentiality requirements in
such situations. They said a notification requirement would
constitute a tremendous burden and make doctors vulnerable to
malpractice suits.
   AIDS renders the body's immune system incapable of resisting
other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread
through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from
infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acne drug Accutane, which can cause birth
defects in pregnant women, prevents skin cancer in people at
extremely high risk of the common malignancy, a study concludes.
   Experts cautioned that the treatment is too toxic to be used
routinely by most people who are afraid of skin cancer. But they
said it raises the possibility that similar drugs may someday be
given safely to prevent this and other forms of cancer.
   Until now, medicines have been given almost exclusively to
attack cancers once they occur rather than to prevent them.
   ``This is the first study that has scientifically proven in
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means,'' said Dr.
Howard Koh of Boston University School of Medicine. ``We use sun
screens because they should work, but we still have not rigorously
proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be prevented with
that method.'' Sun is considered the main cause of skin cancer.
   However, he cautioned that the study, conducted on just five
people, is very small, and it is unclear whether the findings will
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer.
   Dr. Kenneth H. Kraemer, who directed the research at the
National Cancer Institute, believes the study could represent a
step toward cancer prevention.
   He noted that Accutane is one of more than 2,000 synthetic forms
of vitamin A, and some of these could prove safe and effective for
routine use in warding off skin cancer in low-risk people.
   ``You are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the
beginning,'' Kraemer said. ``But if that isn't the case, this is an
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression
of the damage to cancer.''
   The study was conducted on victims of xeroderma pigmentosum, an
inherited skin disorder that occurs in about one in 1 million
people. Their skin is unable to repair genetic damage caused by
sunlight, and they are more than 1,000 times more likely than the
average to get basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin.
   In the general population, these are the most common kinds of
cancer, striking about 500,000 people in the United States each
year. These tumors, which are usually curable, occur most
frequently in light-skinned people.
   In the study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, five patients took high doses of Accutane for two years.
   Doctors compared the number of tumors before, during and after
treatment. In the two years before taking Accutane, the five
patients had a total of 121 tumors. While on the drug, they had 25.
When the drug was stopped, they had nearly a nine-fold increase in
the frequency of tumors.
   But side effects caused two people of the seven who started in
the study to drop out. One had high levels of blood fats, while the
other showed signs of liver abnormalities.
   The researchers currently are checking to see if a dose
one-quarter as large will work as well but be less hazardous.
   Kraemer said high doses of Accutane could be warranted for some
people, such as sailors and farmers, who have frequent skin cancers
because of their lifelong exposure to the sun.
   Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, is already widely
used to treat severe acne. Because of its possible danger for
pregnant women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month
ordered its maker, Hoffman-La Roche, to warn customers by printing
a picture of a deformed baby on the drug's packaging.
   At least two other studies using Accutane to treat pre-cancerous
ailments have been published over the last two years. One showed
that the drug clears up oral leukoplakia, pre-cancerous white
patches in the mouth that are common among smokers. The other found
that it improved the survival of people with myelodysplastic
syndrome, a pre-leukemic disorder.
   Some experts also believe that beta carotene, the form of
vitamin A found in food, helps prevent cancer.
   Dr. Harley Haynes of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said
that vitamin A drugs similar to Accutane may someday be used to
treat other tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the
lung, stomach, colon, bladder, cervix and breast.

<TEXT>
   Dissidents within the Nicaraguan Contras assembled
Wednesday to demand drastic leadership changes as the U.S.-backed
rebel group prepares for massive layoffs and cutbacks.
   Contra Director Pedro Joaquin Chamorro backed the dissident
former military commanders at an unprecedented Miami headquarters
news conference, apparently widening the split in the movement
against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua.
   The six commanders and their supporters, many of whom were fired
by rebel military chief Col. Enrique Bermudez, stopped short of a
full break with the Contra umbrella organization, the Nicaraguan
Resistance. Instead, they announced the formation of a new
``current'' within the group.
   Chamorro denied the open split hurts the image of the
financially strapped Contras just as the Reagan administration goes
back to Congress to ask for more aid. In March, Congress adopted a
limited $47.9 million budget limited to humanitarian aid.
   ``What hurts the image of unity is to marginalize people who
have so much support inside the movement,'' said Chamorro. ``It
hurts the image to throw them out in the street like dogs.''
   Chamorro confirmed that massive administrative layoffs are being
planned, but refused to give details, saying only that as many as
400 people in rebel political offices in Miami, Washington, Latin
America and Europe might be affected.
   Contra spokeswoman Marta Sacasa said the cuts would not affect
troops in the field or financial support for their families, and
were part of a wholesale ``restructuring'' of the rebel
organization.
   Chamorro said the dissident's formation of a group was no
different from the shifting alliances within the directorate
itself, which has been bitterly divided since peace talks began
with the Sandinista government, he said.
   The dissidents Wednesday demanded total restructuring and
renovation of the movement, accusing the directors of serving U.S.
interests instead of those of Nicaragua.
   ``We want the Resistance be open to everyone, and not subject
the interests of the Nicaraguan people to foreign pressure,'' said
Diogeenese Hernandez, known as Commander Fernando.
   Hernandez said new faces in the six-member directorate ``would
be healthy,'' but did not specify any names.
   He once again called for the removal of Bermudez, as he and the
other commanders did when they were expelled from the military. But
the dissidents offered a conciliatory solution to Bermudez's
departure, suggesting he be elected to the empty seat in the
directorate, which would force him to resign as commander of the
rebel forces.
   The commanders strongly backed the peace talks with the
Sandinistas, although they accused the Nicaraguan government of
failing to fulfill its commitments under the cease-fire agreements.
Chamorro said no date has been set for the next round of talks.

   President Reagan intends to nominate Maynard
Glitman, one of the administration's negotiators on the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, to be ambassador to
Belgium, the White House announced Wednesday.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Glitman will succeed Geoffrey
Swaebe..
   Glitman, a 54-year-old Chicago native, was named in 1981 as the
State Department representative and deputy negotiator to the INF
negotiations, with the rank of ambassador. He served in this
capacity until 1984, when Glitman was named chief U.S.
representative to the Vienna talks on East-West conventional forces.
   Since 1985, Glitman had been the chief U.S. negotiator on the
INF issue in Geneva.
   Glitman, a 1955 University of Illinois graduate, entered the
Foreign Service in 1956 after graduating from the Fletcher School
of Law and Diplomacy.
   He was an economics officer in the State Department and then a
fiscal and financial officer. He also was a consular officer in
Nassau from 1956-61, and also in Ottawa, Canada, from 1961-65.
   From 1967-68, he was an international relations officer in the
State Department, and then did tours at the U.N. General Assembly
and at the National Security Council.
   Glitman also served as a political officer in Paris, and then
returned to the State Department to be director of the Office of
International Trade Policy.
   From 1977-81, he was deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Mission
to NATO in Brussels, Belgium.

   President Reagan still wants global farm

summit's more moderate call for only a reduction in the handouts,
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said Wednesday.
   ``The president's position remains the same and will be advanced

Canadian Importers' Association luncheon.
   The $200 billion subsidy war, in which support for farmers has
caused surplus production and slumping prices, caused the most
heated debate of the seven-nation summit that ended Tuesday.
   The United States proposed the phaseout of all subsidies by the
end of the century, while most European countries and Japan said
that was unrealistic and Canada looked for compromise language.
   ``Everyone agreed the summit was not the place to reach the
final agreement,'' Baker said, noting that the real deadline for
action is the December midterm review in Montreal of the current
Uruguay Round of talks within the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. The GATT system sets rules for international
trade.
   ``What we wanted to do was direct our negotiators at the midterm
review to develop a framework that includes both long-term and
short-term (measures),'' Baker said.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said at a summit-ending
news conference Tuesday that the farm subsidy clause in the
declaration was ``not perfect'' but sent a strong signal to GATT
negotiations for reform of a system that is draining treasuries and
dislocating economies.
   In his speech, Baker termed the Toronto summit the best of the
eight he has attended as chief of staff and then treasury boss for
Reagan. But he added that the multilateral trading system remains
threatened by new forms of protectionism and the belief by some
countries that exports are good but imports are bad.
   He said the United States might explore a ``market
liberalization club'' approach to trade, if the current
renegotiation of GATT rules does not reduce tariff and non-tariff
barriers around the world.
   He pointed to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, facing
ratification hurdles in both countries but due to take effect Jan.
1, as an important catalyst for this ``new trade policy strategy.''
   In Ottawa, meanwhile, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
gave a ringing endorsement to the Free Trade Agreement during an
address to a joint session of the Canadian Parliament.
   She termed it courageous and dismissed Canadian opposition party
claims that the deal might result in Canada losing its identity.
   ``On the basis of Britain's experience of joining the European
Community, you need have no fear that Canada's national personality
will be in any way diminished,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``Fifteen
years of European Community membership have left our people no less
British.''
   Later, in an angry exchange, opposition party leaders blasted
the Mulroney government for allowing Mrs. Thatcher to make such
partisan comments. They said it was like a Canadian prime minister
telling the British what to do about Northern Ireland.
   But Foreign Minister Joe Clark snapped back: ``If members
opposite think Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lets other people
tell her what to say, then they know a different Margaret Thatcher
than I do.''
   The Thatcher and Baker testimonials to free trade, a deal that
would eliminate all tariffs in 10 years and more closely integrate
the Canadian and U.S. economies, were in contrast to
behind-the-scenes battling during the economic summit.
   Mulroney had sought strong backing for the treaty in the final
communique, but the French and Japanese were among governments
concerned that the sweeping bilateral agreement could deprive them
of market share in North America.
   The tentative draft of the communique said only that summit
partners ``welcome'' the U.S.-Canada deal, but under last minute
pressure from Canada, that was changed to ``strongly welcome'' _
which British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson pointed out
was awkward English but agreed to accept.
   Baker said the pact will enhance trade liberalization, and break
ground by covering services, investment and technology and possibly
dislodging differences over agriculture.
   ``Canada and the U.S. are lowering barriers between themselves,
not raising barriers to others,'' he said. ``The rewards of this
agreement offer an incentive to other governments.
   ``We hope ... follow-up liberalization will occur in the Uruguay
Round. If not, we might be willing to explore a `market
liberalization club' approach, through minilateral arrangements or
a series of bilateral agreements. In this fashion, North America
can build steady momentum for more open and efficient markets.''
   Baker spoke as crews cleaned up the Metropolitan Toronto
Convention Center where 1,500 delegates and 3,000 journalists
gathered for the $16 million summit.
   Reagan and the other six heads of state or government pledged to
ease the debt burden of the poorest Third World nations, combat
drug trafficking and continue a policy of encouraging growth
without inflation.
   The 3,000-member security force assembled for the summit was
relieved to see the leaders go. Apart from two demonstrations
resulting in more than 160 arrests and an arson attack on a
derelict building a block from Reagan's hotel, the meetings went
off without incident.

<TEXT>
   The Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia have
made radical demands to next week's national Communist Party
conference that they be given control over virtually all their own
affairs.
   A published platform for the 32 delegates from Estonia and a
letter signed by hundreds of Latvian intellectuals to the
conference demand the republics take charge of their own finances,
ecological policy, culture, education, media and foreign affairs.
   Both documents also voice strong criticism over ethnic policies,
demanding the right to control migration to their republics _ where
ethnic Estonians and Latvians are in the minority _ and to
strengthen the place of their indigenous languages in their
schooling and arts.
   The demands from the two republics _ long the most
westward-looking Soviet regions _ are the most radical from the
Soviet Union's 15 republics since Mikhail S. Gorbachev launched a
liberalization that has given rise to increased outbursts of
national feeling.
   Public protests and media articles in recent months in Estonia,
Latvia and the third Baltic republic, Lithuania, suggest the
proposals to the 5,000 delegates of the party conference opening
June 28 have strong popular backing.
   Radio Moscow reported Wednesday that a crowd of 100,000 people
turned out in Estonia to see the republic's 32 delegates off to the
conference.
   Both their platform and the even more radical demands of the
Latvian intellectuals were published in state-run republican media
in the past two weeks, ensuring a broad audience is familiar with
the proposals.
   According to the June 11 edition of the newspaper Soviet Latvia,
the Latvians demanded ``effective sovereignty'' over their own
resources and treatment of Latvia as a ``sovereign national state''
with the right to its own membership in the United Nations and
other international organization and its own team at the Olympics.
   In unequivocal terms, the letter says ``the dictatorship of All
Union ministries and enterprises under Soviet power has become a
serious brake on the economic, social and cultural development of
the national republics.''
   In the proposals to next week's conference, known as the theses,
there is only scant mention of ethnic questions that have erupted
into fierce violence that has killed at least 34 people in the
southern Soviet Union.
   The republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan are at loggerheads over
the fate of the mainly Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which
was incorporated into Azerbaijan in 1923.
   The Latvian letter made no mention of the violence in the
Caucasus or other ethnic strife. But it said the hundreds of
writers and other intellectuals who signed the missive ``consider
that the subject of national questions and ways to solve them is
undervalued in the theses (for the conference), in the mass media
and in the speeches of state leaders.''
   Latvian writer Yanis Peters told the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta
on Wednesday that ``we must develop and strengthen Soviet
federalism on the basis of the Leninist principle that union
republics are like sovereign states, and not like territories on
which it is profitable to dump this or that industrial capacity.''
   The Latvian and the Estonian documents demanded rehabilitation
for republican victims of mass deportations in 1941 and 1949.
Neither mentioned, however, is the 1940 annexation of the Baltic
republics by Soviet troops under a secret clause of the treaty
Josef V. Stalin concluded with Nazi Germany in 1939.
   The Latvian intellectuals' resolution demanded publication of
the agreement.
   Both radical Baltic demands stopped short of calling for
secession from the Soviet Union _ which is sometimes demanded by
dissident groups and emigres _ but made clear they want much more
genuine autonomy from Moscow.
   Similar demands have been voiced in recent months in meetings
and in the media in Lithuania, where a historian recently launched
an unprecedented attack on the Stalinist repression of the 1944-52
partisan war in the republic.
   In March, the Lithuanian Writers' Union held a startlingly frank
open meeting on ecology in the republic, and followed up on April 4
by calling openly for the adoption of Lithuanian as the republic's
official language, the abolition of dual-language Russian and
Lithuanian schools and schools for Lithuanian minorities outside
the republic's borders.
   Ecology is a particularly strong worry to the citizens of the
Baltic republics, who say that industrialization forced on them
under Soviet rule has ruined their environment.
   The Estonian conference platform, published in the republic's
newspapers on June 18, devotes a section to ecology, demanding that
the Soviet republics be granted full rights to decide on how to use
their natural resources.
   Like the Latvian document, it demanded the republic receive full
rights starting in 1991 to determine prices, wages and investment
policy. It also urged referendums on policy questions and called
for constitutional reform.
   Estonia's new Communist party leader, Vaino Vyalyas, told the
government newspaper Tuesday the conference platform is a ``unique
document'' worked out with the participation of non-official groups
such as the environmental Greens and the National Front set up with
apparent official backing in April.

<HEAD>Tart Cherries Crop Expected To Drop 41 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If there are fewer cherries to bake into pies
this fall, part of the blame can be put on the drought gripping
much of the nation, an Agriculture Department report indicated
Wednesday.
   Production of tart cherries is expected to drop 41 percent from
last year's harvest of 358.5 million pounds down to 211 million
pounds. In Michigan, the largest producer, the crop was estimated
at 150 million pounds, down 43 percent from 1987.
   Severe spring freezes, drought and a high June drop of fruit
were blamed for the decline in Michigan production. And rain is
needed ``within the next few weeks'' for the remaining cherries to
grow properly, the report said.
   Production in the four leading states accounts for about 94
percent of this year's expected tart cherry production. Others
include: New York, 23 million pounds, down from 35 million in 1987;
Utah, 15 million, down from 29 million; and Wisconsin, 9 million,
down from 14 million.
   The crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 175,400 tons, down 17
percent from last year's harvest of 210,800 tons.
   Department officials say that sweet cherry output in the Western
states is mostly quoted by the ton, while Eastern practice favors
pounds. Since most production is in the West, the agency reports
sweet cherries in tons.
   The top four producers of sweet cherries in this year's forecast
are: California, 32,000 tons, down from 45,000 last year; Michigan,
22,000, down from 32,000; Oregon, 45,000, down from 50,000; and
Washington, 67,000, down from 74,000.

<HEAD>Ad To Be Aired After 9 Years; Glasnost and Afghanistan Pullout
Credited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Blitz-Weinhard Brewing Co. has
announced it plans to air a 60-second television commercial filmed
nine years ago but canceled after the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
   The commercial depicted a group of visiting Soviet sailors who
discover the company's Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve Beer, and
is loosely based on an actual incident.
   Gene Clark, a brewery spokesman, said the Soviet pullout from
Afghanistan and the spirit of glasnost has made it possible to put
the ad on television.
   ``The goal of our advertising is to entertain the viewer and
sell beer, not to make political statements,'' Clark said. ``In
today's climate, however, we feel the commercial can be aired and
accepted for what it is _ 60 seconds of entertainment that we hope
sells beer.''
   Filmed in 1979, the $200,000 commercial portrays a group of
Soviet sailors touring the city in 1973 after two Russian fishing
trawlers collided off the central Oregon Coast and one had to be
docked in Coos Bay for two weeks for repairs.
   The sailors keep telling their hosts that life in the Soviet
Union is better, until they are introduced to the beer.

<HEAD>South Africa Sanctions Bill To Go Ahead Despite Dim Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of a bill imposing harsh new
sanctions against white-dominated South Africa acknowleged
Wednesday they do not have the votes to override a certain veto by
President Reagan.
   But they said that in order to highlight opposition to South
Africa's racial policies, they would battle for Senate passage of
the bill, which requires an end to most trade with South Africa as
well as the withdrawal of all U.S. corporate investment.
   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Deputy
Secretary of State John C. Whitehead strongly opposed the harsh
sanctions measure as counterproductive.
   And Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading opponent of using
sanctions to increase pressures on South Africa to adopt majority
rule reforms, said he will introduce legislation repealing the less
severe sanctions bill passed over President Reagan's veto two years
ago.
   Whitehead said that while the Reagan administration believes
apartheid is repugnant, ``sanctions are the wrong tool because
South Africa has the resources to resist an economic siege and has
been preparing for such a contingency for many years.''
   He said it has become clear over the past two years that the
industrial allies of the United States will resist the U.S. lead
and will not impose sanctions of their own.
   He said South Africa could at will cut off exports of strategic
minerals vital to U.S. industrial efforts.
   Americans must accept the fact that U.S. leverage in South
Africa is limited, Whitehead said.
   ``Resorting to drastic remedies, such as the misuse of American
power to destabilize the South African economy, only increases the
chances of a catastrophic outcome for all South Africans,''
Whitehead said.
   Instead, he said, `'our mission should beone of using all
available means to maximize our influence and leverage.'
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a strong sanctions supporter, said
the administration's attitude demonstrates that the ``thoroughly
discredited'' administration policy of ``constructive engagement''
to nudge South Africa toward reform still survives.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said the 1986 sanctions bill has not
produced results because ``the administration has been dragging its
feet, creating loopholes, doing nothing to urge our allies to join
in the sanctions.''
   But he and other senators said the drive to impose virtually
total economic sanctions likely will fall short, at least for now.
   ``Candidly, right now I don't think we have the votes to
override a veto,'' Simon said.
   But he said the effort should proceed to demonstrate the breadth
of the U.S. opposition to apartheid and to support internal
pressures for change in South Africa.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., another sanctions supporter,
told the committee: ``There are those who say that waging economic
war against South Africa will only hurt the people we want to help,
the black workers. But those people are already being hurt more
profoundly by apartheid than any trade sanction we could possibly
devise or impose.''
   The sanctions measure calls for the total removal of all U.S.
corporations and businesses from South Africa and for the end of
two-way trade except for U.S. imports of certain strategic South
African minerals.
   A similar sanctions bill apparently has gathered stronger
momentum in the House.
   So far it has been consdidered favorably by the House Foreign
Affairs, Intelligence, Armed Services and Banking committees and is
pending before the Ways and Means Committee.
   It is likely to be considered on the House floor at a relatively
early date. Passage is expected by a large majority, probably
greater than the two-thirds needed to override a veto.

   Soldiers on Wednesday captured four teen-age
Palestinian guerrillas who were trying to sneak across the border
with submachine guns and grenade launchers to attack a settlement
in northern Israel, the army said.
   A security source said three of the guerrillas were wounded. He
said soldiers spotted them at a fence on the Lebanese border and
they gave up after a half-hour skirmish 20 feet from Israeli
territory. The army reported no Israeli casualties.
   In the Rafah refugee camp, in the occupied Gaza Strip,
16-year-old Talad Khalil Zakoot was killed during a clash with
troops, an Arab reporter quoted the boy's relatives as saying.
   An army official said troops fired in the air to disperse
stone-throwing Arabs in Rafah, and that the body of a Palestinian
youth from Rafah was later taken to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan
Yunis. Hospital officials refused comment.
   The official said the army was investigating whether the youth
was killed by army gunfire.
   Soldiers in Nablus in the occupied West Bank shot and wounded
two Palestinians when a gang of youths, some wearing masks, threw
stones and bottles at them, an army spokesman said.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital Nablus said both young men,
aged 15 and 17, were shot in the right leg.
   If confirmed, Wednesday's fatality would bring to at least 211
the number of Palestinians killed in the rebellion that began Dec.
8. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
Four Israelis also have died.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged tougher tactics against
arson, firebombings and stoning that have given new impetus to the
revolt.
   ``We have to step up our activities in every sphere against this
phenomenon and we mustn't sit and wait for some political solution
to come from heaven,'' he said on army radio.
   Shamir called the uprising a challenge to national survival and
declared: ``There is a wave of aggression, whether arson or murder,
against the Jewish presence everywhere in the land of Israel.''
   Another general strike ordered in underground Palestinian
leaflets virtually shut down the West Bank and Gaza, but fire
officials said a special alert thwarted calls for a rash of arson
against Israel's forests and factories.
   A new leaflet circulated Wednesday exhorted Palestinians to
``destroying the properties of our fascist enemy'' and expanding
the revolt against occupation.
   It orders two more general strikes _ next Tuesday to protest the
anniversary of Israel's annexing Arab east Jerusalem, and on on
July 5.
   ``Our uprising is intensifying and escalating, shattering the
delusions of the occupier that the flames of revolt can be
extinguished,'' said the leaflet, signed as usual by the United
National Leadership of the Uprising, which is linked to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israeli troops saw the four guerrillas trying to cross the
border near Kfar Yuval in northern Israel, an army statement said.
   It was the 29th infiltration or attempt since Israel ended its
three-year occupation of south Lebanon in June 1985 and established
a ``security zone'' just north of the border. Fifteen of the
efforts have been made since the uprising began.
   The army statement said the guerrillas planned to attack a
northern settlement. Israel radio said they belonged to the
pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine led by
George Habash.
   Police reported nine new fires Wednesday in Israel and said at
least seven were suspicious. The worst burned 50 acres of woodlands
at Mount Gilboa, 70 miles north of Jerusalem, destroying many
saplings for intended for transplant.
   David Angel, spokesman for the Jewish National Fund which
manages Israel's forests, noted a sharp from a daily average of 18
fires last week and said: ``It's because we had so many people out
looking for any sign of fire. We have hundreds of volunteers spread
all over the country.''
   Police and fire officials say Arab arsonists are setting most of
the fires, which have destroyed more than 35,000 acres of woodland
and pasture since early May.
   Destruction of trees is especially painful in Israel, where much
effort has been devoted to turning arid land into woods and farms.
Many of Israel's trees were donated by American Jews in memory of
relatives.
   ``You see years of work go up in smoke in a few minutes,''
Avraham Yariv, an official at Gilboa, told Israel radio after the
fire there. ``You stand helpless before this terrible sight.''

<HEAD>Hyundai Plant Fails To Resume Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's No. 1
automaker, remained closed Wednesday as management rejected a new
labor union demand for payment of wages lost during a 24-day strike
for higher wages.
   The union leaders had called off the strike on Monday, prompting
the company to announce that its auto plant in the southern city of
Ulsan would resume production Tuesday.
   Union leaders said no firm agreement had been reached with the
company, but they indicated Hyundai officials assured them of the
pay raises, which would be negotiated after the workers returned to
the assembly lines. The union leaders, however, changed their
strategy Tuesday after a militant faction of workers refused to
return to work and demanded a compensation for lost wages.
   ``We can't pay wages, under the principle of no work and no
pay,'' said one company official, who requested anonymity.
   The official said union officials would continue negotiating
with the company, which he indicated would find what he called
``indirect'' ways to meet the workers' demand. He refused to
elaborate.
   The company last offered the 20,000 striking workers a pay
increase of $106 a month. The union is demanding $130. Hyundai
autoworkers earn an average of $800 a month after six months,
including allowances. Company officials said Wednesday they would
stick to their last offer, but they said they would consider
additional fringe benefits.
   Hyundai said it has lost production of some 40,000 vehicles
during the strike. About two-thirds of the production was intended
for export to the United States and other countries.

   A change in design plans for the
expansion of Interstate 95 will result in the razing of a new
$400,000 city warehouse, officials said.
   ``It just happened,'' said Grady Greene, district director of
production for the Department of Transportation.
   The warehouse was built on land that will used as right of way
for an expansion of I-95. When work on the warehouse started, plans
for the road were different.
   The city is hoping the state will buy the buidling, which cost
$395,787 to build, then scrap it at state taxpayers' expense.
   Salem A. Salem, city Public Works director, said no single
person or agency is to blame. But Greene said the city knew the
state was in the process of expanding I-95 in the vicinity of the
warehouse.
   Because of the mix-up, Salem said his department created a new
department head in charge of attending all DOT planning discussions.

<HEAD>Army Laboratory Identifies Remains Of Air Force Enlisted Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army laboratory in Hawaii has positively
identified the remains of an Air Force enlisted man missing from
the Vietnam war, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   The remains of Chief Master Sgt. John M. Mamiya were identified
by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu after
being repatriated to the United States on March 2 in a group of 17.
   Four of the other remains from that group were identified
earlier by the laboratory, including three colleagues of Mamiya who
disappeared in the same incident.
   Mamiya was one of eight men aboard an RC-47 reconnaissance plane
when it was reportedly attacked by a MiG jet fighter over North
Vietnam on July 29, 1966. According to Pentagon records, the plane
went down over Son La-Hoa Binh Province after a radio distress call.
   Mamiya was 32 at the time. Mamiya's remains will b interred in
Hawaii, where he had resided, the Pentagon said.
   With the latest identification, 2,399 Americans remain listed as
missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of whom 1,761
are listed as missing in either North or South Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 157 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States and subsequently identified by the laboratory
since the end of the war.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the cooperation of the
Socialist Republic of Vietnam that resulted in the recovery and
return of these remains and hopes it is representative of continued
cooperation to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue,'' the
Pentagon said in its statement.

<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. experts Wednesday tested
barrels of European toxic waste an Italian company has dumped in
this West African nation.
   The 2,000 tons of waste _ transported as construction material _
was reportedly dumped near the town of Koko, about 150 miles
southeast of the capital of Lagos.
   The material includes poisonous chemicals and radioactive
material from at least 10 European companies.
   Infuriated by the incident, Nigeria has recalled its ambassador
to Italy, seized an Italian ship and arrested 15 people, including
some Italians.
   The military government has warned Nigerians convicted of
involvement in the dumping that they will be shot by a firing squad.
   The five-man U.S. team, sent at Nigeria's request, will advise
the government on how to dispose of the waste.

   The government has banned nine books
from public distribution and said they advocate North Korean
communist ideas, officials from the Culture and Information
Ministry said Wednesday.
   The books include fiction, accounts of travel in North Korea and
writings by radical South Korean students, praising life in the
North and blaming the United States for keeping the peninsula
divided, according to the officials.
   The officials said they have urged prosecutors to punish the
dealers and publishers of the books.

   Hungarian composer Bela Bartok began his
final journey home Wednesday, 43 years after his death, as almost
150 family and friends gathered around his American gravesite to
bid him farewell.
   Bartok's remains were exhumed from Westchester's Ferncliff
Cemetery, and he will be buried in Budapest near his mother and
wife.
   ``As we are immensely proud to know that he was very Hungarian,
we are aware that he and his life's work belong to the whole
world,'' Gyorgy Banlaki, the Hungarian consul general told the
gathering. ``He was international. He is international and we want
to keep it that way.''
   On hand were Bartok's sons, Bela Jr., 78, of Budapest, and
Peter, 64, of Homossassa, Fla. They decided to move their father's
body during the younger son's visit to Budapest last year.
   ``I felt it was the wish of the entire Hungarian nation that he
should be there,'' said Peter Bartok after the ceremony. ``It
became my wish, too. Here my father is entirely alone. There are
all the people who were close to him in life. He will never be
alone.''
   His father had always wanted to return to Hungary, but died in
1945 of leukemia at age 64 before he could go back, said Peter.
   The sons will accompany their father's remains throughout the
six-country trip, which will feature concerts and recitals.
   The remains, exhumed Tuesday, were in a new coffin and a huge
packing crate festooned with red, white and green ribbons _ the
colors of the Hungarian flag.
   Thomas Simons, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, praised
the composer on behalf of the U.S. government.
   Bartok ``combined in himself and his music the best of Hungary
and the best of the outside world ... who chose exile rather than
acquiescence'' when he left Hungary in 1940 on a piano concert tour
and did not return because of World War II, Simons said.
   Bartok was known for popularizing and chronicling Hungary's folk
music and incorporating it into his own works. Banlaki said the
composer's popularity was evident almost everywhere in Hungary.
   ``Countless streets, schools, institutions bear his name. There
is hardly a locality in the whole country where something would not
bear his name,'' Banlaki said. His portrait adorns the country's
biggest bank note.
   Hungarian flutist Juli Zabos of Ossining played two Bartok
pieces during the ceremony and a group of fans broke into song
afterward.
   After the ceremony, cemetery workers removed the original grave
marker and replaced it with a new one.
   It read, in Hungarian and English: ``The first resting place of
Bela Bartok ... remains moved to Farkasret Cemetery Budapest
Hungary Following June 25, 1988.''
   After a departure on the Queen Elizabeth 2 on Saturday, the
remains will arrive in Southampton, England, amid fanfare and
concerts, and a message from British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   The ship then heads to Cherbourg. The sons will accompany the
body through France, Germany and Austria before arriving in Hungary.
   After a public display of the coffin, Bartok will be laid to
rest July 7 in Budapest.

   A delegation of Israeli left-wingers and
moderates challenged a 2-year-old law by attending a conference
along with Palestine Liberation Organization observers, a
participant said Wednesday.
   The delegates could face three years in jail if they are found
to have violated a law passed in August 1986 which bars Israelis
from meeting with members of the PLO, viewed by Israel as a
terrorist group.
   In the first test case last month, a court convicted four
Israelis for meeting with PLO officials in Costinesti, Romania in
November 1986. The four have not yet been sentenced.
   Moshe Amirav, an Israeli delegate, told The Associated Press the
Israeli group attended a three-day symposium last week along with
Palestinian academics at the invitation of the Free University in
Amsterdam.
   Two PLO officials, Afif Safieh and Ilan Halevy, attended the
conference as observers but did not take part in its proceedings,
he said.
   ``The law is stupid. But we will continue meeting in such a way
that we won't be able to be accused of anything,'' Amirav said,
adding that none of the delegates had been summoned for police
questioning.
   The daily Hadashot reported Amirav actually met with the PLO
officials, but Amirav denied the report.
   Other sources who attended the conference and refused to be
identified said some members of the Israeli delegation did meet
with the PLO officials.
   Amirav said other Israeli delegates included Nitza Shapira-Libai
of the left-leaning Labor Party, a former adviser to then-Prime
Minister Shimon Peres on women's affairs; former left-wing
legislator Meir Pail, and human rights lawyers Naomi Chazan and
David Kretzmer.
   Amirav is a former activist in the right-wing Likud Bloc who was
expelled from his party for advocating direct talks with the PLO
and far-reaching self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   He enraged party leaders last year by meeting with Faisel
Husseini, a resident of Arab east Jerusalem billed by Israeli
authorities as the PLO's representative in the occupied West Bank.
   Amirav, now a member of the liberal Center Party, said the
Israelis found the Palestinian academics surprisingly moderate.
   He said the academics told him the PLO was ready to recognize
Israel and end the Middle East conflict in return for the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   ``We were stunned by their attitude,'' he said. ``They said they
recognized Israel and believed there should be two independent
states.''
   The delegation was the third known group of Israelis to attend a
forum with PLO officials and the first to include moderate
participants more representative of the Israeli consensus.
   The other groups openly defied the law and met directly with PLO
officials, arguing the group was not terrorist.

<HEAD>Dissident Historian Appears At Official News Conference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident historian Roy Medvedev, expelled from
the Communist Party almost 20 years ago and officially silenced
since, emerged Wednesday to espouse his independent Marxism at a
government-sponsored news conference.
   It was the first official appearance in decades for Medvedev,
and occurred less than three weeks after Andrei D. Sakharov, Nobel
Peace Prize winner and former political exile, met with reporters
at the Soviet Foreign Ministry press center.
   The officially sponsored appearances by two men who were leading
figures in the evolution of the Soviet dissident movement would
have been unimaginable a couple of years ago. They reflected not
only the Soviet Union's more liberal atmosphere under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev but an effort to consolidate support for the Soviet
leader's reforms.
   Medvedev said he was not seeking readmittance to the Communist
Party, but that he would accept it if offered.
   ``I would take it with appreciation, but I'm not going to write
to anybody'' to ask for it, he said.
   In his decades of dissident, Medvedev has emphasized reforms in
Soviet society rather than complete changes in its character. But
he was expelled from the party in 1969 and his major works have
only been published abroad.
   Asked how he felt about being given a public forum to state his
views, he said, ``Of course it's hard to obtain the same form after
20 years, but it's pleasant to answer your questions.''
   Best known for his book ``Let History Judge'' _ a work on
dictator Josef V. Stalin never published in the Soviet Union _
Medvedev said he was invited Tuesday by the government news agency
Novosti to take part in a news conference the next day about the
Soviet Union's review of Stalin's purges.
   Despite the review of Stalin's dictatorship, Soviet authorities
have an equal right to govern the Soviet Union as the U.S.
government has to rule its land, he said.
   ``We are reviewing our history very deeply, but the review
wouldn't undermine the legal basis of our state,'' he said. ``It
has emerged and will continue to function in the future.''
   He defended the Communist Party's monopoly on power through the
one-party system, saying the Soviet Union must develop a democratic
spirit both within and outside the party but that ``at the same
time we need centralism, because without subservience to the
decisions of the central organs, without subservience to the local
centers we may have anarchy.''
   But he said minorities must always have the right to their
opinions.
   Medvedev also cited George Orwell's novel of totalitarianism
``1984,'' a reference that until recently would not have been
possible in an officially sponsored meeting. In answer to a
question about the torture of old Bolsheviks killed by Stalin, he
said Orwell understood well the pressure that could be brought on
people to confess to crimes they didn't commit.
   Medvedev and his brother, Zhores, were among the first prominent
members of what eventually evolved into the Soviet dissident
movement. Zhores, a biochemist and gerontologist, was placed in a
psychiatric hospital before being forced to leave the Soviet Union
for London in 1973.
   Sakharov has said that Medvedev's views were an important
influence, even though they later separated and were leading
figures in contrasting dissident movements.
   Roy Medvedev remained in the Soviet Union. Despite being
expelled from the party and being unable to publish, he was
tolerated by authorities and became a valuable unofficial source
for journalists who often sought his views on history and Kremlin
politics.
   On June 12, the weekly paper Moscow News published a commentary
he wrote about the roots of Stalinism. He told the news conference
Wednesday that several state-owned publishing houses were
interested in publishing his books that so far have only been
released abroad.
   His appearance came on the 47th anniversary of the Nazi invasion
of the Soviet Union in World War II. On Monday, the party newspaper
Pravda blamed Stalin for the poor preparation of Soviet forces that
allowed Nazi forces to drive deep into Soviet territory before they
were stopped.
   Medvedev declined to tell reporters which members of the ruling
Politburo he thinks support Gorbachev and which might oppose him.
   But another panelist, philosopher Yuri Koryakin, said Soviets
need much more information about the personal views of Politburo
members and said he was ``very worried about statements by (Kremlin
No. 2 leader Yegor K.) Ligachev.''
   In his public statements, Ligachev has taken a more conservative
line than Gorbachev on the question of how much openness to allow
in Soviet society.

   A limpet mine exploded at a
game arcade in downtown Johannesburg on Wednesday, injuring 10
people, including a pregnant woman and her 2-year-old daughter,
police said.
   The facade of the arcade, featuring video games and pinball
machines, was blown out by the explosion and a fire flared briefly
before being extinguished.
   Police Col. Frans Malherbe said the injured included six blacks,
one white and three people of Indian descent, including the
pregnant woman, her husband and their daughter.
   Malherbe said four of the victims were seriously hurt.
   The arcade, Winning Games Center, is on the ground floor of an
apartment building. Residents were ordered to evacuate as police
searched for evidence.
   There have been more than 20 bombings and hand grenade attacks
in South Africa this year, killing eight people and injuring 59.
   The government has blamed the attacks on the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement. The ANC has not claimed
responsibility for specific attacks in recent months but has said
it seeks to intensify its guerrilla operations.

<TEXT>
   The also-ran Democratic candidates are
pitching in with a $2,500-a-person dinner Thursday to help likely
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis raise the $8.3 million the
party can spend to elect him in November.
   As part of the effort to achieve a Democratic Party first _
raising the maximum allowable general election fund _ three of the
candidates and their finance chairmen were scheduled to attend the
dinner at the Georgetown home of developer Joseph Kaempfer,
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Julie Anbender said
Wednesday.
   She said former candidates Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee,
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois
would attend the event with their finance chairmen. Earlier in the
day, the finance chairmen as well as finance representatives of
Dukakis and candidate Jesse Jackson will meet with DNC officials to
discuss fund-raising plans for November.
   DNC officials said the Democratic candidates have established a
cooperative attitude toward helping the man who beat them all in
the primaries.
   ``There is by all accounts more unity and cooperation than any
time in the recent past that anyone can remmeber,'' said Tony
Blinken, deputy director of the DNC's Victory Fund for November.
   So far, the party has raised about $1.5 million of the $8.3
million that election law allows the party to spend on its nominee,
said Anbender.
   That money is in addition to the $46 million each candidate
receives from the federal Treasury to fund his campaign.
   The party already has more than $4 million in so-called soft
money, which it will distribute to the state party officials to
spend on their own state activities _ which ultimately can help the
national ticket as well.
   Robert Farmer, the Boston money whiz who engineered Dukakis'
successful fund-raising effort, has pledged to raise $42 million in
soft money.
   Soft money refers generally to funds that are banned in federal
elections _ like union and corporate donations _ but that are
permitted in many states and can be used for such activities as
voter registration, which ends up helping the national ticket as
well.
   Among other planned fund-raising events, the Democrats hope to
raise $200 at each of 10,000 televison parties on the last night of
the Democratic national convention next month.
   People will be invited to pay admission to attend one of the
parties nationwide and watch the Dukakis acceptance speech the last
night of the conventon.
   In addition, the party is sending out direct mail and is asking
50 top fund-raisers to pledge to raise $100,000 each, Anbender said.
   ``The soft money is going extremely well,'' she said.
   In 1984, when the hard money limit for the parties was just over
$6 million, the party raised a total of $2.4 million, said Anbender.

   A prosecutor told a jury Wednesday that
a collection of body fragments were sufficient to prove that an
airline pilot killed his wife and disposed of her body with a wood
chipper.
   State's Attorney Walter Flanagan mounted photographs of hair
strands, skull fragments, a thumb, a toe bone and other body
fragments on a picture of a body outlined in charcoal on white
poster board.
   In closing arguments to the 12-week trial, Flanagan acknowledged
that only one tooth recovered by police was positively identified
as belonging to Helle Crafts, but he told the jurors, ``you can put
everything together and you look at other evidence.''
   Mrs. Crafts, a 39-year-old flight attendant for Pan American
World Airways, wasn't the type of person who would have abandoned
her three young children, as the defense has argued, Flanagan said.
   Richard Crafts was upset over his wife's plans to file for
divorce, giving him a motive, and he was the last person to see his
wife alive, the prosecutor said.
   But defense attorney Daniel Sagarin sought to cast doubt on the
evidence, saying that the 75 or so body fragments weighed no more
than two-thirds of an ounce.
   ``Ask yourself what's not there. ... You say to yourself, `Where
is the evidence?' We have a very small amount of evidence we're
dealing with,'' he said.
   Crafts, a 50-year-old pilot for Eastern Airlines and part-time
police officer, is charged with murdering his wife, who was last
seen Nov. 18, 1986, after returning from an overseas flight.
   The prosecution has alleged that Crafts killed his wife, cut up
her body with a chain saw and then fed the body parts through a
rented wood-chipping machine.
   Flanagan told the jurors they could be convinced that the body
parts found by police along the banks of the Housatonic River in
southeast Connecticut and in a U-Haul truck rented by Crafts were
indeed from his wife. He reminded jurors that an expert had
identified a tooth as belonging to Mrs. Crafts.
   But Sagarin noted that Dr. Henry Lee, the state's top forensic
expert, testified that a tooth crown also presented as evidence was
not made at the laboratory where Mrs. Crafts had her dental work
done.
   Flanagan also reminded jurors that Mrs. Crafts had paid an
attorney $2,500 in cash to represent her in divorce proceedings.
``This is an indication that she intended to pursue a divorce, not
to flee,'' he said.
   Sagarin contended there was reasonable doubt whether Crafts
could have committed murder.
   The case is expected to go to the jury Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The discovery that unauthorized
evidence was at the jury's disposal brought to a halt Wednesday
jury deliberations over a delicatessen owner's claims that Paul
Newman reneged on a promise to give him a share of the actor's food
business.
   The jury, which had deliberated for eight hours over two days,
was sent home at 3:30 p.m. after its foreman told the court that it
had received depositions from the plaintiff, Julius Gold of
Westport, and some defendants, and wanted to see Newman's.
   The depositions weren't entered into evidence during the
three-week trial and shouldn't have been given to the jury,
attorneys said. W. Patrick Ryan, Newman's attorney, said it
appeared a clerk who took the exhibits into the jury room
inadvertently also took the depositions in.
   Judge Howard Zoarski said attorneys will have to discuss the
situation.
   ``I'm very upset,'' said Gold's lawyer, Richard Albrecht.
   Gold sued Newman, another Westport resident; his two food
companies, Newman's Own Inc., and Salad King Inc.; Newman's partner
and longtime friend, A.E. Hotchner; and food distributor David
Kalman.
   Gold claimed he helped develop and market Newman's Own salad
dressing and was promised 8 percent of the stock. Gold said he
contributed 30 months' effort to Newman's company and believed his
work led to the corporation's success. There was no estimate of
what the 8 percent interest was worth.
   The defendants have denied all the allegations.
   Newman, president and founder of Newman's Own, testified that
the idea for the company's salad dressing, its label, recipe and
packaging were his.
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity since 1982 and
helped create a camp for seriously ill children in northeastern
Connecticut.

<HEAD>Prolonged Exposure To Heat Can Lead To Serious Ailments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead
to a variety of serious ailments in which the body either loses
fluids too rapidly or body temperature rises to dangerous levels,
doctors say.
   The problem is especially serious in older people, but vigorous
exercise, poor ventilation, heavy clothing and certain prescription
drugs can make anyone more susceptible to heat stroke or heat
exhaustion.
   Among the drugs that can aggravate heat-related disorders are
antihistamines, certain psychiatric drugs and cocaine.
   According to The Merck Manual, a standard reference source for
doctors, heat stroke occurs when the body, during hot weather, is
unable to cool itself and remain at normal temperature. Symptoms
include headache, weakness and sudden loss of consciousness.
   People suffering from heat stroke have hot, red, dry skin,
little perspiration and rapid pulse. The remedy is emergency
cooling with cold water or ice, and immediate hospitalization.
   Heat exhaustion is a very different disorder. It occurs when the
body loses too much fluid, and it is marked by gradual weakness,
nausea, anxiety, excessive sweating and fainting.
   Victims of heat exhaustion have pale, grayish, clammy skin, and
a slow pulse. Appropriate treatment is to lower the head and
replace lost salt and water, usually by mouth.
   Excessive salt loss can cause heat cramps, which are often
experienced by manual laborers in such surroundings as engine rooms
and steel mills.
   The pain of heat cramps comes on suddenly, with the arms and
legs usually affected first.
   Drinking fluids or eating foods containing salt will usually
rapidly relieve the symptoms.

   Novelist and Oscar-nominee Jerry
Hasford pleaded innocent Wednesday to felony charges of theft and
possession of hundreds of stolen books from libraries in the United
States and England.
   Hasford, co-writer of the screenplay for the 1987 movie ``Full
Metal Jacket,'' was taken into custody after appearing before
Municipal Court Judge James Ream, but defense attorney Orlan Donley
indicated the $7,500 bail would be posted, said Deputy District
Attorney Terry Estrada-Mullaney.
   Hasford was charged with two counts of grand theft and 10 counts
of posession of stolen property. A preliminary hearing was
scheduled for Aug. 18.
   The charges stemmed from the discovery of nearly 10,000 books in
a storage locker rented to Hasford, but involve only a portion of
the volumes.
   ``There is evidence that among those 10,000 there are books from
more than 70 libraries from all over the world, but we have filed
charges only from the libraries we believe have the most books that
were taken,'' Ms. Estrada-Mullaney said.
   Hasford has refused to discuss the case.
   Police at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis
Obispo, found the books March 17 when they searched a locker rented
by Hasford. Police were looking for 87 books that were overdue on
Hasford's Cal Poly library card.
   The charges involve approximately $20,000 worth of books from
public libraries in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Sacramento, St.
Louis, Longview, Wash., London, and the city, county and university
libraries in the central California community of San Luis Obispo,
Ms. Estrada-Mullaney said.
   The prosecutor said it was unlikely that Hasford would be
charged in connection with the remainder of the books. The books
are primarily Civil War research volumes, she said.
   Volumes allegedly taken from the London library at St. James's
Square include ``Catalogue of American Books in the Library of the
British Museum,'' by Henry Stevens; ``A Guide to English
Literature,'' by F.W. Bateson, and ``History of the Army of the
Cumberland,'' by Thomas B. Van Horne.
   ``We will have witnesses from several counties, two states and a
witness from London, England, (the) head librarian,'' Ms.
Estrada-Mullaney said.
   After the books were found, it was revealed that a Sacramento
County book-theft warrant for Hasford had been outstanding for
three years.
   Hasford earned an Oscar nomination this year as co-writer of
``Full Metal Jacket,'' based on his Vietnam War novel, ``The
Short-Timers.'' Hasford shared the screenwriting credit with
director Stanley Kubrick and Michael Herr.

<HEAD>NASA Urged To Strengthen Life Sciences Program for Future Missions</HEAD>

   NASA may have to conduct extensive
psychological testing, including some experiments that could last
years, before it can select crews for deep space flights such as a
voyage to Mars, an advisory panel said Wednesday.
   In a study of NASA's future needs for space exploration, the
panel said the agency will have to conduct extensive test programs
and develop new criteria for the selection of astronauts.
   The study, ``Exploring the Living Universe,'' outlines in broad
terms the changes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
must make in order to be ready to staff a space station in Earth
orbit for months at a time, or to develop the equipment and
personnel for exploration beyond Earth orbit.
   ``Life sciences as it has been is inadequate to support the
goals of NASA,'' said Frederick C. Robbins, a Nobel laureate who
was chairman of the study committee.
   Robbins said the space agency must strengthen research areas not
only to learn how to send humans into space for long periods of
time, but also to explore the universe for possible life forms and
to study the planet central to the human species _ the Earth.
   He said the studies should gather more knowledge about the
effect of mankind on the Earth's environment because ``the threat
to our environment is real and is becoming more important to us all
the time. I would suggest that this (research) might provide a
mechanism for our continued existence on this planet.''
   Robbins said NASA will have to gain significantly more knowledge
about the effects of weightlessness and forced confinement on the
human body before the agency can hope to attempt long-term space
flight aboard the space station or to attempt a voyage to Mars.
   U.S. experience in long-term space flight is limited to the 84
days of Skylab 3, and this is not enough data to commit to missions
lasting years, such as a voyage to Mars, Robbins said.
   He said the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko holds the world
space record of 326 days, but the Soviet Union has yet to share the
specific phsysiological data collected on that mission.
   The weightlessness of space causes muscles to atrophy, bones to
lose minerals and become thinner, and the cardiovascular system to
decondition. This reaction, called the space adaptation syndrome,
must be understood thoroughly before long-term space flight is
possible.
   Gerald Carr, a former astronaut who commanded the 84-day Skylab
flight and who helped prepare the report, said NASA also must study
the psychological aspects of long-term space flight.
   Carr said the current astronaut selection methods are not
adequate for choosing crew members for flights that could last
years.
   ``NASA is going to have to conduct very long-term tests in
situations where the test crew knows it can't `king's X' and walk
away from it,'' Carr said. He said what is currently known about
the confinement for years of small group of people in hazardous
situations, such as space flight, is inadequate ``because nobody
has ever done a study.''
   Carr said that the criterion used for selecting astronauts in
the past must be changed because future astronauts will face
stresses far more complex than those known to the people of Apollo
and Skylab.
   William C. Schneider, a former NASA executive who headed the
Skylab program and who also was on the study committee, said it is
``quite likely'' that NASA will have to conduct tests that could
last 500 days to 600 days to determine the criteria for selecting
crew members for long-duration space flight.
   ``There simply is no other way to gather the data,'' he said.
   In other recommendations, the committee said NASA should:
   _Conduct an intensified program of orbital experiments on human
life support in space, including development of self-contained
systems that recirculate oxygen and water.
   _Increase studies on the effects of gravity and weightlessness
on Earth life forms, including plants.
   _Increase studies related to the possible existence of life
forms beyond the Earth and on issues related to the evolution of
life.

<HEAD>FAA Grounds Cargo Airline Over Safety Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered
Ameriflight Inc., a California-based cargo carrier, grounded
Wednesday because of a broad range of alleged safety violations.
   Ameriflight, which has its headquarters in Burbank, Calif.,
operated about 90 aircraft, most of them propellar planes, in cargo
service. It has branch offices in Salt Lake City and Seattle,
according to the FAA.
   The FAA said it has revoked Ameriflight's operating certificate
because of violations of federal air safety regulations that agency
inspectors found in a review in March and April.
   Executives of Ameriflight could not immediately be reached for
comment. A secretary said they were in a meeting.
   The FAA said in its inspection it found Ameriflight had used
pilots who had not had timely proficiency checks, improperly
converted passenger compartments to cargo use in 17 planes, failed
to comply with airworthiness directives on six aircraft and failed
to make checks to determine if maintenance work had been done
properly on 35 aircraft.
   The airline also was found to have operated aircraft for long
periods without performing required repairs, said the FAA. It cited
one instance in which a Piper aircraft flew 540 flights over three
months with 16 maintenance deficiencies not being corrected.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said that while Ameriflight had held a
certificate that would have allowed it to fly passengers, none of
its planes is believed to have been configured for passenger use.

<TEXT>
   A consultant to a defense contractor was given top
security clearance and two days of free travel on a Pentagon VIP
jet after being wrongly identified as an aide to Rep. Bill Chappell
Jr., the Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday.
   Chappell, D-Fla., is one of five House members reportedly under
scrutiny in a massive FBI investigation into allegations that
defense consultants obtained classified and proprietary information
through bribery and fraud. Chappell, who is chairman of the House
Appropriations defense subcommittee, has denied the allegations.
   According to Air Force records obtained by the newspaper, W.
Leonard Killgore Jr., a consultant to Oshkosh Truck Corp., rode
aboard an Air Force C-20 jet from Washington to Daytona, Fla., to
Portland, Ore., and back to Washington on Sept. 27-28, 1987.
   Killgore has been a private consultant to defense contractors
since 1980. But the Air Force order authorizing the flights and
security clearance listed him as ``Legislative Assistant to
Representative Chappell,'' according to the records obtained
through a Freedom of Information Act request.
   Killgore rode in on the jet which picked up Chappell and his
wife in the congressman's home district. They flew to Portland for
the annual meeting of the National Guard Association of the United
States and returned to Washington the next day, travel records show.
   ``I was invited to make that trip and I made it,'' Killgore said.
   Capt. Andrea Shaffron, an Air Force spokeswoman, said Tuesday
that the service was unable to explain immediately how the
authorizing order was issued.
   Killgore and Chappell aide Kay Thomas told the News the order's
description listing Killgore as an aide was an apparent error.
   ``Mr. Killgore was invited by the Guard Association to be a
guest at their convention and to travel on the airplane under
appropriate Air Force orders,'' Ms. Thomas told the News. ``When
the Air Force personnel prepared the aircraft manifest, they
apparently assumed that Mr. Killgore was a member of Chairman
Chappell's staff. Until you raised the issue, no one had noticed
the mistake.''
   Chappell was in a conference Wednesday and was unavailable for
comment, his office told The Associated Press.
   Killgore, a retired National Guard colonel, said the National
Guard Bureau granted him the authority to board the plane.
   But Lt. Col. Jim Ragan, a spokesman for the National Guard
Bureau, said the Air Force C-20 jet is not one the bureau could
authorize private citizens to ride.
   The cost of the 11.7 hours of flight time logged by the aircraft
during the two-day trip was $29,565.90, Air Force records show.
   Killgore was one of three Oshkosh officials at an April 1987
breakfast where several members of the House Armed Service
Committee received $2,000 honorariums only hours before a vote to
force the Army to buy 500 more Oshkosh trucks than the Army wanted.

   A rise in the dollar spurred a rally in the bond
market Wednesday, which in turn propelled the stock market to its
highest level since the October crash.
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed 43.03 points higher at
2,152.20, easily eclipsing the previous post-crash high of 2,131.40
set a week ago.
   Three stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock
Exchange, where 217.51 million shares changed hands.
   The catalyst for the rally appeared to be a surprising surge in
the value of the dollar overseas, which eased worries about
inflation.
   That fed a rally in bond prices that pushed yields on the
closely watched 30-year Treasury bond back under 9 percent, which
buoyed stock prices.

<HEAD>Iranian Official `Very Optimistic' about Freedom for British
Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's ranking diplomat in London said Wednesday
he is ``very optimistic'' that better relations between his country
and Britain will lead to freedom for Englishmen held hostage in
Lebanon.
   Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Akhoond Zadeh Basti made his comments
as the first British lawmakers to visit Iran since the monarchy was
overthrown in 1979 returned to London. The legislators said Tehran
will use its influence with the kidnappers.
   They called the mission a success, but said they could not raise
the question of American hostages because of intense hostility in
Iran toward the United States.
   The Independent newspaper reported Wednesday that Syria has
located the hiding place for 15 foreign hostages believed held by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Shiite Moslem
slums of south Beirut.
   It added, however, that the Syrians said the hostages cannot be
rescued by force and negotiations with Hezbollah are needed.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
said: ``That report is not new. We have never been able to confirm
the exact location of the hostages and we cannot confirm this
latest report.
   ``Although information on the hostages is conflicting and rarely
reliable we have always believed that some of them are in Beirut's
southern suburbs.''
   Eighteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. Held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985, and is reported to be among the 15.
   Basti was asked on Channel 4 television news whether diplomatic
progress could mean the release of the three Britons held _
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy and
teacher Brian Keenan.
   ``I'm very optimistic about the process that has been initiated
... and I believe that there are wonderful areas where the two
countries can talk, can discuss, and I believe that the
opportunities are ample,'' he replied.
   Asked whether it would take months or years, Basti said:
   ``Let us not be hasty. Let us welcome the initiatives as they
take their own course. I think that one has got to be very
optimistic in the context of the latest diplomatic move.
   Both governments reduced their diplomatic representation to
caretaker status last year, but on June 10 announced agreement to
exchange compensation for damaged embassy buildings that will net
Iran about $1.8 million.
   On Sunday, the British legislators flew to Tehran on a private
mission organized by Waite's boss, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie.
   ``I think our mission was a success,'' said Conservative
lawmaker Cyril Townsend, delegation leader. By talking to ``senior
members of the administration, we played some part in putting the
relationship on a better basis,'' he said.
   ``The timing was really rather good because since about
February, the pragmatists in the government have been looking for a
chance, in my view, to patch up the quarrel between our two
countries.''
   Townsend said the delegation met with Alireza Moayyeri, deputy
prime minister; Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karroubi, deputy parliament
speaker, and Mohammed Javad Larijani, deputy foreign minister.
   A church official, John Lyttle, was allowed to visit Roger
Cooper, a British businessman jailed in Tehran since December 1985
on espionage charges. Cooper has not been tried.
   Lord Tordoff of the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party
quoted Larijani as saying: ``We are willing to use our good offices
(to free the British captives). It takes a lot of patience.''
   Iran's official news agency quoted Moayyeri as saying Tuesday
night that Iran ``will ask its friends in Lebanon to help locate''
the Britons.
   Townsend said his group could not deliver a request by a support
group for Anderson that a U.S. delegation to be allowed into
Tehran. He said the proposal ``would have been totally
counterproductive'' and ``frankly daft ... at the present time''
because the Iranians ``have an obsession about the United States.''
   They ``see the United States in a very different category to
Western Europe, so I'm afraid the Iranian lever for American
hostages in the Lebanon is not one one can easily pull,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A badly divided screenwriters guild made
last-minute maneuvers before a bicoastal vote Wednesday on whether
to end a 4-month-old strike.
   Leaders of the Writers Guild of America have urged rejection of
the proposed contract from the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, which claims its offer is worth $71 million
over the next four years.
   A dissident group within the union has urged approval and a
return to work as the new television production season gets under
way. Jobs from craft workers to caterers would be affected by a
prolonged strike.
   The vote, during membership meetings Wednesday night in Los
Angeles and New York, comes on the eve of the television production
season. Results of the vote will be announced Thursday.
   Both sides within the union predicted an angry gathering.
   Brian Walton, the guild's chief negotiator and its West Coast
executive director, found his leadership challenged publicly on
Tuesday by a dissident group within the union that urged approval
of the producers' offer.
   ``The guild is at an important crossroads,'' Walton told members
in a mailed message that forecast the acromony. ``You and your
guild are likely to be bombarded with an intense PR barrage from
the alliance and its allies designed to persuade you that their
third and latest offer is good enough for you to vote up and and
that you have no realistic choice.''
   Members of the loosely formed Writers Coalition said at a news
conference Tuesday they believe the union has already squeezed far
more from producers than most expected.
   The group includes some of Hollywood's top writer-producers such
as Steve Bochco, John Hughes, John Milius, and Stephen Cannell, who
also is a member of the alliance.
   ``Some of us were surprised that as much has been accomplished
as has been in the last 16 weeks,'' Bochco said. ``One wonders how
much further we would go in another four, six, eight, 10 or 12
weeks. It has an economic impact that hits everyone in our
business. People aren't working,'' he said.
   The 9,500-member Writers Guild struck on March 7 over the issue
of payments for reruns of one-hour domestic television shows and a
bigger share in the increased foreign market. They also sought
better guidelines to protect a writer's work and allow writers to
re-acquire unproduced scripts.
   Agreement was reached on matters of creative control, but both
sides remain divided on the economic package.
   Writers agreed with the producers' position that the rerun
payments, known as residuals, for one-hour television shows should
be tied to a sales formula rather than a fixed payment.
   Producers have argued that the market for such shows has grown
soft, and it was unfair for them to pay writers a big residual for
selling the rerun package in only a few markets.
   But Walton has claimed the producers failed to reciprocate with
a more generous offer in the area of foreign distribution
residuals. The union has linked the two economic items.

   Republican George Bush on Wednesday
called for tougher sentences for crimes against law enforcement
officers, saying that for too long politicians and judges held
captive by civil libertarians have controlled the nation.
   The all-but-certain Republican nominee called for establishing
tough mandatory penalties for any violent crime against a law
enforcement officer and said the FBI should have clear authority to
investigate attacks against law officers anywhere in the United
States.
   ``For too many years, we've been held hostage by well-meaning
but misguided politicians and judges who get their legal views from
the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union),'' Bush told a meeting of
the National Sheriffs Association.
   The comment won hearty applause from the audience of sheriffs.
   Later, Bush told local reporters that Dukakis had called himself
``a card-carrying member of the ACLU. That was a quote of his.''
   Bush also said bullet-proof vests should be made available to
every officer in the country who wants it.
   ``A lot of lives could be saved. We owe it,'' Bush said, holding
up a police vest that he said had been fired at three times at
point-blank range without injuring the wearer.
   He did not indicate who would pay for such protective clothing.
   As an aside, the vice president joked when he held up the vest
that the bullets ``were not fired by Carl Rowan, I might add. They
hit right here in the middle.''
   Rowan, a syndicated columnist, last week shot a backyard
intruder in the hand.
   Bush, in a speech he claimed was non-political, took another
swipe at what is becoming a favorite target: a Massachusetts prison
furlough system.
   The vice president claims that the program, administered by his
Democratic rival, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, permitted
convicted first-degree murderers to go free on weekends to
terrorize innocent people.
   He called such a program naive and irresponsible, but without
mentioning Dukakis by name.
   However, one member of the audience, Robert C. Rufo, sheriff of
Suffolk County (Boston), Mass., took issue with Bush's comments.
   ``This is no more than a Republican smokescreen to try to divert
attention from where they are weak,'' Rufo, who was wearing a
Dukakis button on his lapel, told reporters after Bush's speech.
   Rufo claimed Dukakis inherited the furlough program and that it
no longer applies to convicted murderers.
   ``You're never an unmovable object in politics. I'm not and he
(Dukakis) is not. He shares the vice president's views on furloughs
(for convicted murderers),'' Rufo said.
   The vice president also reiterated his support for tougher
sentences for drug offenses and the death penalty for drug
kingpins. ``If this is a war, let's treat it as such. Let's get
these killers off the street,'' Bush said.
   He said drug offenders should be put in prison and that a
federal rule that suppresses evidence obtained in warrantless
searches _ the so-called exclusionary rule _ should be abandoned.
   ``There's someting wrong with the system when the modern-day
version of a prison break is crawling through a loophole,'' Bush
said.
   And he accused ``liberals in the Senate'' of derailing new
sentencing guidelines for a federal death penalty.
   But later, in the interview, Bush said he would not urge the
death penalty for crimes involving drunken driving. In Kentucky,
the issue is an emotional one in the wake of a bus-truck accident
that left 27 people dead. The driver of the truck, who has been
charged with murder, allegedly was drunk.
   ``I don't think a death penalty for drunk driving is proper ...
I don't think a drunk driver is making a conscious decision under
the influence. Do I think drunk driving is bad? Do I think they
ought to pay a penalty? Absolutely. But I draw the line there.''
   Bush also called for a denial of parole of some convicts,
saying: ``The view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not
just naive, it's dead wrong.''
   ``When first-degree murderers sentenced to life without parole
get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences, that
view goes from naive to dangerous, from well-meaning to
irresponsible,'' Bush said.
   Bush recounted details of the case of Willy Horton, a convicted
Massachusetts murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and
accused of raping a woman while he was free.
   Rufo, who is the president of the Massachusetts Sheriffs'
Association, told reporters that ``there were 121,000 successful
furloughs before that incident.''
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force Two, Bush accused
Dukakis of waffling on many issues, including his support for the
prison furlough program and his public statements on the B-1 bomber.
   ``People need to know. Where's the guy coming from?'' said Bush.
``I can't count on others to do this. I've got to spell it out and
then get surrogates, those other people who believe as I do, to
spell it out.''
   Bush denied he was engaging in a negative campaign against the
likely Democratic nominee.
   ``It's the record _ what he favors and what I favor. It's not
name-calling,'' he said.

   President Reagan signed legislation Wednesday
aimed at improving rail safety in the wake of a January 1987 crash
of Amtrak and Conrail trains that killed 16 people.
   The legislation, among other things, requires the licensing and
certification of locomotive operators and prescribes new
requirements for the use of safety-related equipment on trains.
   It also provides for enforcement of subpoenas and orders by the
secretary of transportation in connection with railroad
investigations and revises federal rail safety statutes to increase
penalties for violations.
   Investigators of the crash near Chase, Md., that killed 16 and
injured 175 found that a device had been disabled on the Conrail
train that would have warned the train's operators they had passed
a stop signal.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Wednesday ordered 250
additional military personnel sent to Panama, most of them to
provide logistical and administrative support to the troops already
there.
   Maj. Kathy Wood, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said the
contingent consisted of a 50-man Air Force security team and 200
Army troops. The personnel are being deployed from several bases
around the country and should be in place in Panama by Friday, she
added.
   The soldiers being dispatched will help provide administrative,
communications and logistical support to Army units already in the
field, she said.
   The deployment brings to roughly 2,250 the number of additional
military personnel sent to Panama since early this spring, when the
Reagan administration began pressuring military leader Gen. Manuel
A. Noriega to step down and return the government to civilian rule.
   Most of the earlier deployments involved Air Force, Marine and
Army security and police personnel who were dispatched to ensure
protection for Americans in the country.
   The U.S. Southern Command, which oversees all U.S. military
activity in Central and South America, is based in Panama. About
10,000 military personnel work for the Southern Command at bases in
the Panama Canal Zone.

   Iraq said its troops, backed by
helicopter gunships, on Wednesday recaptured two mountain peaks in
its northern border region. Iran said it repulsed an Iraqi attack
in the area and killed or wounded 3,000 Iraqi soldiers.
   Farther south along the countries' 730-mile border, Iranian
rebels based in Iraq said they withdrew from the town of Mehran
after a three-day offensive, in which they reported capturing
military hardware they estimated to be worth $2 billion.
   In the Persian Gulf, Iran said its navy destroyed an
unidentified Iraqi ship during a clash with ``several enemy
vessels'' in the northern end of the waterway. Iraq denied the
report.
   The offical Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi troops recaptured the
heights of Safrah and Basawa in a three-day battle that began
Monday. The two mountains are about five miles northwest of Mawat,
a town in the Kurdistan mountains of northeastern Iraq.
   Iraq said its helicopter gunships flew 337 missions in the
battle Wednesday.
   The Iraqis last Friday claimed to have recaptured Mawat and
several other peaks, all seized by Iran last summer.
   Iran reported its fighter bombers on Wednesday ``heavily bombed
Iraqi positions and troop concentration sites in the Mawat
region.'' The bombing inflicted ``considerable losses in men and
equipment,'' said the report by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, said Iranian forces on
Tuesday destroyed at least 15 tanks and set ammunition dumps ablaze
and 3,000 Iraqi troops in the region.
   Iraqi forces in recent weeks have driven the Iranians out of
territory captured in southern Iraq earlier in the 8-year-old war
and have been pressing Iranian forces in the Kurdistan mountains
for 10 days.
   On April 16, Iraq seized the initiative in the stalemated land
war with an assault that recaptured the Faw Peninsula in southern
Iraq, ending two years of Iranian occupation.
   A sudden Iraqi switch from years of static warfare behind
formidable defenses caught the Iranians by surprise. Iraq struck
again a month later, driving Iran's forces from their bridgehead
around Salamcheh, east of the southern port city of Basra.
   Two defeats in a row jolted the Iranians and forced them onto
the defensive for the first time since early in the war, which
began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after weeks of
border skirmishes.
   Iran was hit again Saturday night when Iraqi-backed Iranian
rebels of the National Liberation Army crossed in the central
border sector to capture Mehran, which has been fought over several
times and devastated by the war.
   Dispatches from Tehran said the three-pronged assault was
carried out by Iraqi regulars supported by fighter-bombers dropping
chemical bombs, but rebel commander Massoud Rajavi denied the
``hollow claims.''
   Statements from the National Liberation Army said 22 of its
fighting brigades, including armored units and one made up of
women, seized hills around Mehran several miles inside western Iran
on Sunday and occupied the town.
   Jeffrey Ulbrich, an Associated Press correspondent taken to
Mehran by the rebels Sunday, said it was filled with jubilant NLA
fighters.
   A rebel statement received Wednesday from NLA headquarters in
Baghdad said the insurgents withdrew across the border Tuesday
night.
   The offensive, called ``Operation Forty Stars,'' was the biggest
since Rajavi organized the rebel army a year ago around his
Mujahedeen Khalq (People's Holy Warriors), the main movement
opposed to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   According to the statement, 8,000 Iranians were killed or
wounded and more than 1,500 captured in the battle for Mehran, and
about 16,000 Iranians were involved. The NLA gave its own losses as
71 killed and 240 wounded.
   Iran acknowledged the attack but said it was repulsed with
thousands of enemy casualties.
   Conflicting claims cannot be reconciled because foreign
journalists are not allowed into battle areas except for occasional
guided tours like the one on which Ulbrich was taken.
   Rebel units using tanks captured in earlier battles cut the main
Iranian supply routes in the sector and blew up two bridges. The
statement said captured materiel was worth $2 billion and included
40 tanks, 20 armored personnel carriers, scores of 155mm and 130mm
artillery pieces, U.S.-built TOW anti-tank missiles and batteries
of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, also American-made.
   Reporters taken to the area said roads were jammed with rebel
trucks hauling the booty home.
   In the Persian Gulf, an American missile cruiser on patrol off
Saudi Arabia rescued six crewmen from the Greek oil-rig supply boat
Notora, which later sank, U.S. officials reported.
   They quoted the captain as saying the Notora apparently
foundered because of a leak in its engine room.
   Maj. Charles Boyd of the U.S. Central Command said the missile
cruiser Halsey went to the Notora's aid after it radioed a distress
signal at 10:54 p.m. Tuesday from 40 miles northeast of the Saudi
oil port Ras Tanura.

   A 55-pound shipment of gold bullion
disappeared en route from New York to Belgrade earlier this month,
the daily Politika Ekspres reported Wednesday.
   The newspaper said the shipment, worth $363,000, has been
missing since June 10 when it was due to have arrived at Belgrade
airport on a regular Yugoslav Airlines flight.
   A police investigation has turned up no trace of the gold, which
was destined for a major Yugoslav jewelry manufacturer, the
newspaper said. It said police speculate the bullion may have been
accidentally shipped to another destination.

   U.S. envoy Richard Murphy, touring the
Middle East, is expected in Baghdad over the weekend to smooth
diplomatic feathers ruffled by the visit of an Iraqi Kurdish rebel
leader to the State Department.
   Iraq is unhappy with U.S. officials for receiving Jalal Talabani
earlier this month. The visit was perceived here as a diplomatic
slap and unsettled what had been a year of improved U.S.-Iraq
relations.
   Six Kurdish groups formed an alliance in May to fight for
self-rule in northern Iraq and, with Iranian help, have turned the
Kurdistan mountains into another front of the Iran-Iraq war, now
nearly eight years old.
   By publicly meeting with Talabani, who leads the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan, U.S. officials were regarded by Baghdad as dealing
with an enemy of the state and interfering in Iraq's internal
affairs.
   Washington said it was following the policy of listening to
anyone who wants to talk, not sending diplomatic signals. After
meeting with the Kurdish leader, State Department officials said
Iraq had no reason to question overall U.S. policy.
   President Saddam Hussein's government called U.S. regional
policy into question in an editorial attributed to the political
editor of the official Iraqi News Agency and another editorial in
Al-Thawra, official newspaper of the ruling Baath Party.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz canceled a scheduled meeting with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   The news agency editorial recited a list of Iraqi grievances,
including allegations that United States supplied direct or
indirect technical assistance to Iran and gave it intelligence
information about Iraq.
   ``Is this also a fault committed by a junior officer, or is it
once more a badly calculated move pushed by Zionist hatred?'' the
editorial asked, referring to the U.S. explanation of arms sales to
Iran arranged through lower-echelon White House officials working
with Israeli arms dealers.
   ``In essence (the Talabani meeting) was a very grave and serious
mistake which clearly and directly infringes on the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of Iraq,'' it said.
   Murphy, an assistant secretary and specialist in Middle East
affairs, is on an eight-nation tour for talks about Arab-Israeli
peace and the war between Iran and Iraq.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Dukakis' National Health Plan is Insufficient</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson told a labor convention Wednesday that a national health
insurance plan proposed by expected Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis is ``not sufficient.''
   However, Jackson told a news conference later that he would
support Dukakis's health program because ``it is an improvement
over what we have now.''
   Jackson also reaffirmed that he and Dukakis discussed the
Massachusetts governor's selection of a vice presidential running
mate in their private meeting here Tuesday, but again refused to go
into any specifics.
   ``We talked in more detail than I choose to talk about now. The
process is in motion,'' Jackson said.
   Asked if he wanted the vice presidential nomination, Jackson
replied, ``I have not yet made that decision.''
   The head of Jackson's convention team, Ron Brown, was asked by
reporters in Washington if Jackson had asked Dukakis to put him on
the ticket.
   ``He did not,'' Brown replied. ``That has not been his public or
private position,'' he said, repeating the campaign's position that
Jackson deserves serious consideration for the job.
   And when asked if he would be disappointed if Dukakis didn't
offer him the No. 2 spoton the ticket, Jackson said tersely: ``I
choose not to respond to that now.''
   However, Jackson did say that his campaign has received Dukakis'
request for the personal financial information he is seeking from
potential running mates, and that his wife and attorney, among
others, were reviewing the request in Chicago.
   In his address to about 3,500 delegates to the national
convention of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, Jackson cited the same health insurance
statistics and voiced the same concerns Dukakis recited in his
Tuesday address to the AFSCME convention.
   But Jackson offered a much broader health program and criticized
the Dukakis plan.
   Describing heath care as ``the birthright of every family and
every citizen'' Dukakis told the labor convention that as president
he would seek to extend nationwide the program he signed into law
in Massachusetts to require every employer except a few very small
firms to provide health insurance for all of their employees.
   Jackson told the labor convention ``there is no question that
the Massachusetts plan applied nationally would be a great leap
forward,'' but then he suggested it wasn't the best approach.
   ``It's time to jump in another direction. We do not need a great
leap forward throwing more money into our wasteful, public-private
patchwork medical delivery system. We need to ... move away from
the precipice towards a rational comprehensive plan,'' Jackson said.
   Instead of Dukakis' proposal, Jackson outlined a much broader
``federally funded and publicly administered'' health plan for all
Americans which he said ultimately would cost less that Dukakis'
``patchwork'' proposal.
   ``A health care program that is not adequate should not be
supported,'' Jackson said.
   Asked if that meant he would oppose the Dukakis plan, Jackson
said no.
   ``If he puts it forward in legislation, I certainly would
(support it), but I would also seek to amend it and expand it,''
Jackson said. ``It is an improvement over what we have now, but it
is not sufficient.''
   Jackson also charged that the Pentagon procurement scandal ``is
no aberration _ it is systemic,'' and a product of President
Reagan's policies.
   ``What's the result? Cost-plus contracts that remove risk,
sole-source contracts that remove competition, systematic waste,
pervasive corruption,'' Jackson said. ``Reagan loved private
enterprise so much that he even privatized his foreign policy. What
else was the Iran-Contra scandal all about?''

   The armed forces continued to slash
active-duty strength in May to accomodate budget cuts, paring more
than 7,200 positions from the ranks in one month, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
   As of May 31, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps had
2,100,423 men and women on active duty, down 7,232 from the
2,107,655 reported April 30 and 52,246 below the May 31, 1987,
total.
   Three of the four services reported declines in personnel during
May, the Pentagon said. The Marine Corps saw a slight increase.
   The Air Force reported active-duty strength at 579,212 on May
31, down 2,649 from April. The Army reported 755,444 on its rolls,
4,235 below April.
   The Navy reported a decline of 2,100 personnel in May, to a new
total of 570,047. And the Marine Corps reported 195,720 on active
duty, up 1,752 from April.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has ordered a cut of almost
36,000 positions from the active-strength totals reported at the
end of fiscal 1987. The cuts are to be completed and the services
stabilized at the new levels by the start of fiscal 1989 on Oct. 1.
   Carlucci has told Congress he would rather maintain a smaller
force that is properly equipped and ready to fight than a larger,
but ``hollow'' force.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian accused of driving a car
containing arms and explosives onto a ferry bound for Israel was
convicted Wednesday and sentenced to three years in jail, but
claimed he was set up.
   The court in Piraeus, the port of Athens, found Omar Mohammed
Soffareny, a 41-year-old naturalized West German photo technician,
guilty of illegal possession and importation of weapons.
   He also was fined 70,000 drachmas ($522). Soffareny appealed and
was jailed pending an hearing, for which no date was set.
   Soffareny was arrested Monday after port authorities and Israeli
security officers found a revolver and liquid explosives hidden in
his car on the 3,895-ton ferry Paloma.
   The court was told 19 bottles of liquid explosive, 20
detonators, a silenced revolver and 101 rounds of ammunition were
concealed in the car.
   ``I didn't know they were there,'' Soffareny said. ``I had no
idea about this. Somebody else must have put them there.''
   He was arrested shortly before the Paloma sailed for the island
of Rhodes, the Cypriot port of Limassol and the Israeli port of
Haifa with 400 passengers and 100 crewmen.
   About 100 of the passengers were bound for Israel, according to
an official of Afroessa Lines, the ferry owner.
   Soffareny arrived in Greece June 18, driving from West Germany
through Austria and Yugoslavia. He told the court he was going to
Israel to visit his ailing mother in Nazareth. He has lived in West
Germany 20 years.
   ``Every time I think about the things that were in my automobile
and could have exploded at any minute, I start to cry,'' he told
The Associated Press. ``I would never take weapons to Israel
because I go there every year.''
   He said he bought the car second hand in Nuremberg last February
from a Lebanese dealer. He said he returned it to the dealer three
weeks ago for repairs and it was sent to a Syrian mechanic in
Nuremberg.
   ``I've been married to a German woman for 18 years and didn't
even know any Arabs until we moved to Nuremberg from Hanover two
years ago,'' he said.
   Soffareny was born in Nazareth and held an Israeli passport
until becoming a naturalized West German citizen five years ago,
his lawyer told the court.

<TEXT>
   An Angolan leader met with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on Wednesday and expressed hope for success at
talks aimed at ending 13 years of guerrilla warfare that has
inflamed his country and other parts of southern Africa.
   In rare U.S. discussions with a cabinet member of Angola's
Cuban-backed government, Planning Minister Pedro Castro Van Dunem
and Shultz talked about a meeting to be held in Cairo later this
week by South African, Angolan, Cuban and U.S. representatives.
   Wednesday's meeting reflected a stirring of hopes in the Reagan
administration that a settlement leading to withdrawal of Cuban
troops from Angola can be devised.
   Under an envisioned settlement, the peace in Angola would be
accompanied by independence for Namibia, the vast region south of
Angola controlled by South Africa.
   Van Dunem told reporters after his meeting with Shultz, ``let us
hope things will go very well'' at the Cairo session.
   He said Shultz expressed some concern about whether warring
factions within Angola can be reconciled. The factions are the
Angolan government on one side and a U.S.-backed guerrilla
movement, UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi.
   Savimbi is scheduled to hold talks in Washington with Reagan
administration officials next week.
   Angola has been identified by the United States and the Soviet
Union as one of the regional hot spots that needs to be cooled, and
now that Russian troops are pulling out of Afghanistan, the Angolan
question has been receiving more attention.

   A House-Senate conference committee voted
Wednesday to spend $100 million on the multibillion-dollar super
collider, but decreed no money could be spent next fiscal year on
construction of the proposed atom-smasher.
   The committee, however, agreed that money from the appropriation
could be used for research and development, and to purchase capital
equipment necessary for research and development.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the bill would also allow
detailed engineering and design work.
   ``Capital equipment is essential to the research and development
necessary to build the superconducting super collider,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``This is another step forward in our quest to get the SSC built
on schedule and in Waxahachie,'' Bentsen said, referring to the
Central Texas site that is on the Department of Energy's list of
contenders for the project.
   Six other states - Arizona, Michigan, Colorado, Illinois, North
Carolina and Tennessee - are also finalists for the high energy
physics project recommended by the Reagan administration.
   The super collider is expected to provide its host state with
thousands of construction jobs, permanent work for as many as 3,000
people and an annual budget of $270 million.

   Five fishermen came home Wednesday
after 144 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean, vowing to return to sea
despite a grueling odyssey they survived by living off sharks,
turtles and rainwater.
   ``The sea is the source of life for us and our families,'' a
moist-eyed Joel Omar Gonzalez, 27, said, hugging his wife after
arriving at Juan Santamaria Airport from Los Angeles. ``We're sea
dogs. The sea calls to us.''
   A Japanese tuna boat rescued the crew of the 33-foot Cairo III
drifting 700 miles southeast of Hawaii on June 15.
   The Cairo III set sail January 19 from Puntarenas, west of San
Jose, for what was to be an eight-day fishing trip. A storm
disabled the boat five days later, leaving it adrift in the Pacific.
   Capt. Gerardo Obregon, 33, and his crew _ Gonzalez, Juan Cernas
Bolivar, 47, Pastor Lopez Rojas, 30, and Jorge Hernandez Castillo,
22, _ said they survived by catching turtles and sharks and
collecting rainwater.
   Doctors in Honolulu pronounced the five sailors in perfect
health after their rescue.
   Costa Rica's first lady, Margarita de Arias, joined the
relatives, friends, neighbors and fellow fishermen who arrived in
buses from Puntarenas, 95 miles away.
   ``It was a torment for us ... not knowing if he was alive or
dead,'' Mrs. Lopez said as her sons, 3-year-old Alvaro and
2-year-old Roger, clung to their father's knees.
   Obregon was unwilling to discuss the ordeal at length.
   ``Imagine,'' he said, ``our little boat in the middle of the
ocean, directionless. The hot sun of the daytime, the darkness of
the night, the stars and the cold. They were truly terrible days.''
   Gonzalez said the most critical point of the 3,600-mile journey
was being without water for four days. ``There was a moment when
were drinking the blood of a turtle and I looked at Pastor and he
was foaming at the mouth,'' Gonzalez said.
   After a news conference, the sailors headed for the cathedral at
nearby Cartago to give thanks for their rescue.
   The Cairo III was left where the tuna boat found it, drifting in
the Pacific, stripped of much of its wood by the stranded fishermen
desperate for firewood.
   An official at the Puntarenas Naval Base said the Cairo III and
its crew may have broken the record for survival at sea.
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists the record for survival
on a raft as 133 days, set by a Hong Kong man who was adrift in the
Atlantic Ocean from Nov. 23, 1942, to April 5, 1943 after his ship
was torpedoed.

<HEAD>Judge Orders North to Tell Which Secrets He Wants to Reveal</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 6th graf pvs, bgng: The defense, to add dropped letter

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case signaled his
determination Wednesday to bring Oliver L. North to trial by
ordering the fired White House aide to specify which government
secrets he wants to disclose in court.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, provisionally rejecting a
defense challenge to the constitutionality of the Classified
Information Procedures Act, announced what he termed a possible
remedy to the problems posed by reams of secret documents collected
by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Gesell gave North until July 11 to list the classified documents
he wants to disclose in his defense against charges he conspired
with former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord to illegally divert
Iranian arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Gesell's ruling, coupled with last week's finding that Walsh did
not make use of three defendants' immunized congressional
testimony, is a further indication the judge is trying to fashion
procedures for bringing North to trial by this fall.
   Gesell has ordered separate trials for the other defendants.
   The defense contended that a requirement in the classified
information law that it notify the government before trial what
secrets it wants to disclose would tip Walsh to its strategy,
putting the defendants at a tactical disadvantage.
   Lawyers for North and his co-defendants asked Gesell to declare
the law unconstitutional, as applied to the case.
   Gesell acknowledged that a strict application of the 1980 law
would be impossible because of the case's ``broad intrusion into
classified areas of information.''
   Walsh has identified some 50,000 pages of classified documents
that might be relevant to the defense, plus an additional 150,000
pages at various stages of review by an interagency task force.
   ``It probably was never contemplated that classified information
problems of this magnitude would be presented to a trial judge in a
single case,'' the judge said.
   But he said that when Congress enacted the law, it gave trial
judges leeway ``to fashion creative and fair solutions'' to
problems posed by a large number of classified materials.
   ``While afforded this leeway, the court is unable to determine
definitively at this stage whether or not the classified document
problems presented by this case can be resolved,'' Gesell said.
   ``It proposes to make the effort, but the complexity of the
situation defies obvious answers. Final ruling on the (defense)
motion must await further developments.''
   ``A way must be found to preserve defendant's constitutional
rights that still affords adequate protection or national security
concerns,'' the judge said.
   Accordingly, Gesell said he will initially review North's list
of secret documents without consulting with the prosecution.
   The judge scheduled a closed hearing for July 14 to be attended
only by North and his lawyers to hear arguments why certain
government documents are relevant to the case.
   Gesell said the documents deemed relevant will be reviewed by
the interagency task force to determine whether the disclosure in
court of any documents would compromise national security. He gave
the task force until Aug. 1 to complete this task.
   After that, Gesell said he would conduct closed hearings with
both the prosecution and defense to determine a way to disclose the
information contained in the sensitive documents without
compromising secrecy.
   The law empowers the court to order substitution of a document
with a statement of facts it would prove if it were introduced at
trial. But if there is a sufficiently large number of documents
that cannot be disclosed in court, the judge could dismiss the
charges.
   Gesell said he won't review North's trial testimony in advance.
But ``when and if he is about to testify, his counsel will advise
the court if it then appears the testimony will involve classified
national security disclosures beyond those authorized'' in prior
rulings.
   In a statement, Walsh's office said: ``We are pleased with Judge
Gesell's ruling on the constitutionality of the Classified
Information Procedures Act as it applies to this case and we are
prepared to move forward as directed by the court.''
   In a brief footnote, Gesell again rejected the defense's request
for a large array of highly sensitive government documents,
including records of a telephone conversation between President
Reagan and a foreign leader and two meetings Vice President George
Bush had with a foreign leader. Neither leader was identified.

<HEAD>Preliminary Draft Awaits Panel Which Resumes Work Friday</HEAD>

   Democratic officials said Wednesday that a
preliminary draft platform will be waiting for a platform-writing
panel when it resumes work Friday in Denver.
   The draft will incorporate the language from issue papers
hammered out by party staff members and representatives of the
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson campaigns at an earlier session
of the Democratic platform drafting committee.
   The platform committee also released two final working papers on
national security and political empowerment. The former reflects
the Dukakis campaign's insistence that the platform call for
``stable'' defense budgets, not the freeze that Jackson wants; the
latter, in a nod to Jackson, commits the party to removing
``impediments to the one-person, one-vote principle.''
   Rosemary Freeman, executive director of the Democratic Platform
Committee, said the preliminary draft was still being completed.
She said it contains language from the issue papers that emerged
from the June 10-12 sessions on Mackinac Island, Mich.
   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman who is the chief
Dukakis liaison with the platform committee, said, ``There will be
a draft put before the members Friday morning.'' Referring to the
issue papers, he said, ``It pulls them all together.''
   But Barnes added that the two sides have not settled differences
on whether the platform should advocate higher taxes on the rich
and a Pentagon freeze, as Jackson wants.
   Whatever emerges Friday from the 16-member drafting committee
chaired by Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., will be subject to
further discussion and revision when the full 186-member Platform
Committee meets over the weekend in Denver. It will be the first
meeting for the full committee.
   Freeman said the preliminary draft was ``a collective effort''
by the same party and campaign representatives who produced the
earlier papers on the economy, drugs, education, civil rights and
other issues. Gray's group also agreed on Mackinac Island to brand
South Africa a terrorist state.
   The new working paper on national security says:
   ``Our strength has been sapped by a defense establishment that
has wasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of
investing more in readiness and mobility. We further believe that
our strength is enhanced by stable defense budgets and by a
commitment by our allies to assure their fair share of the costs
and responsibilities required to maintain peace and liberty.''
   It says the Democrats ``will promote peace and prevent war _ not
by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to
undefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... not by toasting a
tyrant like Marcos as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a
stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat,
in standing up to any American adversary whenever necessary and
sitting down with him whenever possible.''
   It says the Democrats will promote human rights and ``decry
oppression in nations friendly and unfriendly, communist and
anti-communist.''
   It charges: ``The Republicans abandoned the peace process in the
Middle East and have consistently undermined it in Central
America.''
   It calls for ``maintaining the special relationship with
Israel,'' while promoting a Middle East agreement that reflects the
Camp David accords.
   It says that ``a Democratic administration will end all vestiges
of the failed policy of constructive engagement and will declare
South Africa a terrorist state (and) impose comprehensive
sanctions.''
   The paper on political empowerment would commit the party to
``same-day voter registration'' and registration by mail.
   ``We must remove impedidents to the one-person, one-vote
principle by ending those schemes that dilute the effect of an
individual's vote,'' it says. It also calls for statehood for the
District of Columbia, and promises to ``minimize the domination and
distortion of our elections by moneyed interests.''
   Jackson, who won 29 percent of the primary votes and has 27
percent of the national convention delegates in the latest
Associated Press tally, has complained about the way delegates were
allocated in some states.

<HEAD>Bush Renews Attacks on Dukakis; Jackson Receiving `Serious
Consideration'</HEAD>

   Republican George Bush resumed criticism of Michael Dukakis on
Wednesday, saying he has waffled on major issues and permitted a
murderer to win a prison furlough. Dukakis, his search for a
running mate in full swing, said Jesse Jackson was getting ``very
serious consideration.''
   Bush denied he was engaging in name-calling in his attacks on
Dukakis and said he would continue to point out differences between
himself and the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be.
   ``It's the record _ what he favors and what I favor. It's not
name-calling,'' the vice president and Republican presidential
candidate told reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to
Louisville, Ky.
   Bush also accused Dukakis in his talk with reporters of waffling
on many issues, including public statements on the B-1 bomber.
Dukakis opposed the B-1, but aides say he would not cancel
contracts for purchases.
   ``People need to know: where's the guy coming from?'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, spending the day in Boston, was peppered with questions
about his vice presidential search _ including the polling his
campaign is conducting on the running mate question and requests
for background information from at least two potential candidates.
   The Massachusetts governor also picked up the endorsement of
former rival Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, who dropped out of the
race in September.
   Biden's departure came after Dukakis' top aide John Sasso
distributed an ``attack video'' that depicted Biden borrowing
without credit a speech by a British politician. Biden quit as
other allegations of plagiarism and resume-puffing surfaced; Sasso
left the Dukakis campaign after admitting his role in the incident.
   On the matter of a running mate, Dukakis said Jackson's lack of
government experience does ``not necessarily'' rule him out for the
No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and said he was getting ``very
serious consideration.''
   He sidestepped questions about whether Jackson would be a
liability on the ticket, based on public polls.
   ``I'm not going to be checking a lot of polls, believe me,''
Dukakis said. ``We all have our strengths and our weaknesses.''
   Jackson, refusing to concede the Democratic presidential
nomination to Dukakis despite the Massachusetts governor's delegate
majority, spoke to a union audience in California and later
declined to say if he wanted the vice presidential nomination.
   ``I have not yet made that decision,'' he said, despite earlier
statements that it should be offered to him. Jackson aide Ron Brown
said that when the two met on Tuesday, Jackson did not ask for the
No. 2 spot.
   Appearing before the same union of government workers where
Dukakis stressed increased health care programs a day earlier,
Jackson dismissed Dukakis' plan for national health insurance as
``not sufficient.''
   Jackson offered his own broader program but said he would
support Dukakis' plan as better than nothing.
   Holding a Statehouse news conference, Dukakis said his search
for a running mate would expand beyond the candidates who have been
asked for background information. They include Jackson and Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla.
   One senator popular with Dukakis, Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, has said he is not interested in joining the ticket and,
according to his office, has not been asked to provide background
information.
   But Dukakis said that doesn't mean Bradley has been ruled out.
He pointedly said Bradley ``has not told me personally'' that he
shouldn't be considered. But Bradley's office said flatly the New
Jersey senator is not interested.
   Bush spoke to the National Sheriffs Association, where he called
for tougher sentences for crimes against law enforcement officers
and said bullet-proof armor should be made available to every
officer in the nation who wants it.
   He avoided mentioning Dukakis by name but again pointed to what
has become a favorite target: a Massachusetts prison furlough
system administered by Dukakis as governor.
   Bush recounted details of the case of Willy Horton, a convicted
Massachusetts murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and
accused of raping a Maryland woman while he was free.
   ``The view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not just
naive, it's dead wrong,'' Bush said.
   ``When first-degree murderers sentenced to life without parole
get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences, that
view goes from naive to dangerous, from well-meaning to
irresponsible,'' Bush said.
   Bush also declared that ``for too many years, we've been held
hostage by well-meaning but misguided politicians and judges who
get their legal views from the ACLU,'' a reference to the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Dukakis is a member of the ACLU.
   Dukakis defended himself against Bush's attacks, saying he had
tightened eligibility requirements to exclude first-degree
murderers from the furlough program.
   He charged Bush was focusing on the escape case because he had
no record of his own on crime issues, and pointed to decreased
crime rates in his state.
   Dukakis attended an event touting a Massachusetts state program
that provides job training for welfare recipients. It marked the
graduation of the 50,000th participant.
   In other developments:
   _ In Atlanta, where the Democratic National Convention will be
held in less than a month, host Mayor Andrew Young said the city is
``85 to 90 percent ready'' for the convention that opens July 18.
He dismissed critics who say the preparations aren't adequate.
   ``I don't care what people say about Atlanta,'' Young said.
``Anybody who doesn't like Altanta can go somewhere else. ...
Whatever we need for the convention is going to be ready by the
time the convention gets here.''
   _ Some of the rivals Dukakis defeated for the nomination were
pitching in to help Dukakis raise money by attending a
$2,500-a-person dinner Thursday in Washington. The money will go
toward the $8.3 million the Democratic Party can spend on the fall
election, aside from federal campaign financing.
   Former candidates Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois plan
to attend.
   _ Credentials battles involving several states were resolved in
private negotiations between Jackson and Dukakis campaigns,
increasing the potential for a peaceful Democratic convention. As a
result Jackson will pick up a handful of delegates in Kansas and
Dukakis a few in Maine.

   A former minister's wife who has been in a coma
since she was attacked 14 months ago has improved, but there is no
way to know if she will ever communicate again, a doctor said
Wednesday.
   Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey, who was choked nearly to death in the
garage of her Dallas home last year, entered Baylor Institute for
Rehabilitation under tightened security Tuesday for a comprehensive
recovery program.
   Mrs. Railey is the wife of a former prominent Methodist
minister, Walker Railey, who resigned his ministerial credentials
and moved to California after the April 21, 1987 attack.
   No criminal charges have been filed, but Railey's attorney has
characterized him as the prime suspect in the attack. Authorities
say their investigation is at a standstill.
   Doctors will try to bring Mrs. Railey out of the coma and
develop therapies to improve her long-term comfort and care during
the program, which could last two months, said Dr. William L.
Parker, medical director for the institute.
   ``If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a
response that could be interpreted as functional, then we would
continue to try, through repetition, to improve on that and then
other responses would follow,'' Parker said at a news conference
Wednesday.
   Mrs. Railey, 39, had been in a nursing home in Tyler, 100 miles
southeast of Dallas, since leaving another Dallas hospital last
fall. Parker said his team is making the first comprehensive
evaluation of Mrs. Railey's injuries at the request of her parents.
   ``There has been what looks like some slight improvement in her
condition,'' Parker said.
   Mrs. Railey's eyes sometimes focus and follow movement, he said.
She also can turn her head and hear, but doesn't process what she
hears, he added.
   Parker said he didn't think his team would be able to determine
definitely whether Mrs. Railey will communicate again.
   ``There's no total way to tell,'' Parker said. ``I can't say
that she will never, no. I think the odds are probably going to be
against it, but time is the only thing that's going to tell.''
   Railey, former senior pastor at the First United Methodist
Church in Dallas, said he found his wife unconscious on the garage
floor of their home the night of the attack.
   Not long afterward, Railey attempted suicide. Later, he moved to
San Francisco with a Dallas psychologist, Lucy Papillon, who
admitted a romantic relationship with Railey dating back to 1986.
   Mrs. Railey's parents filed a civil lawsuit accusing their
son-in-law in the attack. Railey failed to respond to the suit and
a judge in April found him financially liable in the incident.
   A jury trial is pending this summer to determine the damages
Railey must pay, Bill Arnold, lawyer for Mrs. Railey's parents, has
said.
   Railey has not been contacted since he was served with notice of
the lawsuit Feb. 2. He is believed to be in California.
   Parker said the hospital had taken ``extra security'' measures
for Mrs. Railey.

<HEAD>Mother's 10-Year Search For Son Ends With Murder Charges Against
Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after Rose Hoffman began her
search among the city's motorcycle gangs for her missing son,
police reported on Wednesday they have charged three men with his
murder.
   ``It had to happen this way,'' said Hoffman, 53, who held a
large framed photograph of Gus Henry Hoffman _ ``my Gussie'' _ who
was 20 when he disappeared off a street.
   ``God knew if I found out then, 10 years ago, I wouldn't have
been able to handle it. I'm having a very hard time of it now,''
Hoffman said in a tearful interview.
   Hoffman never really expected Gus to turn up alive. He was last
seen at an intersection being chased by two other motorcycles and a
car filled with people, police said. They suspect he was killed for
his motorcycle.
   His body has not been found.
   ``I have no grave to go to,'' said Hoffman. ``It won't be over
until I find my son.''
   Hoffman is grateful for the work by Detective Sgt. Jeff Ouimet
and Detective Jack Baxter, who were assigned in February 1987 when
the homicide bureau chief turned over some unsolved murders to
night detectives.
   ``What they did was fantastic,'' said homicide Sgt. John Kracht.
``They just put it all together.''
   Hoffman said she intends to see that the two officers are
honored.
   But she wonders why she had to spend a decade searching for tips
in bikers' bars and other unsavory hangouts before witnesses who
kept silent for 10 years came forward.
   ``I went everywhere,'' she said. ``Night and day I lived this,
and my family suffered.'' She and her husband are considering
holding a memorial service for Gus, the second-born of their four
children.
   San Jose homicide Lt. Richard Gummow said Wednesday afternoon
case files were not immediately available for more details on Mrs.
Hoffman or how she investigated her son's death.
   ``We reinterviewed a number of people, many of them, and some of
those previously interviewed modified their statements. And someone
else came forward who had not come forward before,'' Gummow said.
   Police charged Michael Allen Hodges, 36, of Sunnyvale, and
Richard Morris Dollar, 32, with murder in the case. Both are being
held in Santa Clara County Jail on $1 million bail.
   A third man, John Michael ``Sluggo'' Stelle, 47, has been a
fugitive since February, when he failed to report to his parole
officer after serving time at San Quentin Prison for a drug
conviction and parole violation.
   One of the tips Hoffman received during her investigation
involved a fourth suspect, Michael Lee Stevenson, a biker linked to
the Hells Angels and the now-defunct Forgotten Few. Stevenson was
shot to death two years ago at age 37 by an elderly man Stevenson
tried to extort for property, police said.
   ``That animal,'' said Hoffman. ``A biker girl told people who
told me that Stevenson said my son was dead and we'd never find his
body.''
   Stevenson was convicted in 1981 of sexually assaulting and
killing a Modesto man who owed him money.
   ``The suspects had come up before,'' said Ouimet. ``But the
witnesses were afraid to talk before'' Stevenson was killed.
   ``I know the witnesses were fearful,'' said Hoffman. ``But they
should turn it around and feel as a mother would. Then they would
say, `Please, tell it like it is.'''
   Among the scraps of paper in Hoffman's boxes of notes is a
yellowed newspaper clip telling how Stevenson was arrested in 1977
and accused of holding a woman cative and torturing her while she
was chained in a closet for a month. The woman escaped to tell her
story, but Stevenson, who was bound over for trial, was never
convicted.
   ``The girl he captured wouldn't testify against him because she
feared for her life,'' said Hoffman. ``If he had been put away
then, my son would be alive today.''

   Farm lawmakers responded to reports of a
worsening drought by approving a broad blueprint for aid to the
Grain Belt on Wednesday but cautioned that producing actual
legislation would take longer.
   ``The bad news is that the drought is spreading, it's worsening,
something has to be done,'' House Agriculture Committee Chairman E.
``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, told a congressional drought task
force.
   Approval of the battle plan came after chief Agriculture
Department meteorologist Norton Strommen warned lawmakers that rain
must come to the central Corn Belt in three weeks or so to avoid
the type of drought damage currently hitting the Grain Belt.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
issued a sharply worded warning to food companies not to take
advantage of the drought to raise prices.
   He noted that beef and pork prices actually are falling and said
there was no reason to raise consumer prices, although eventually
there may be.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said President Reagan did
not mean that he opposed federal aid to drought-stricken farmers
when he suggested at a Toronto news conference that there was
little he could do.
   Lyng said Reagan merely ``exhibited some of the frustration that
some of the rest of us have that you can't do anything to make it
rain.'' He said the president actually favors some form of
assistance.
   The task force was formed a week ago to search for ways to
combat the drought after Lyng told lawmakers to be ready to pass an
assistance package but not to make anything final until the full
scope of the problem was known.
   The battle plan approved by the task force contained a number of
features that would not require congressional action.
   It did call for action to guarantee the income of farmers in
drought-stricken areas, a move that eventually could wind up as the
central feature of any drought bill approved by Congress. But it
offered no specific means of doing so. A number of ways have been
suggested.
   The blueprint called for speeded up action by the Agriculture
Department to allow farmers in disaster counties to get 92 percent
of their normal income-support payments, even if they were
prevented from planting a crop because of drought conditions.
   This would be part of USDA's ``zero-92'' program designed to cut
the link between the amount of a farmer's production and the amount
of his federal payments, believed by some to contribute to farm
surpluses.
   The task force plan urged ``maximum flexibility'' in applying a
requirement that farmers must plant cover crops, such as perenniel
grasses, on land idled for conservation uses.
   The plan also would:
   _Search for ways to make sure producers will have sufficient
herds to resume livestock breeding when the drought ends. Breeders
are selling off stock because of lack of feed.
   _Assess the need for supplemental feeding programs for the poor
next winter with an eye toward possible food scarcity caused by
drought.
   _Find ways to expand participation in the Federal Crop Insurance
program.
   _Use all authority provided in last year's bailout bill for the
financially troubled Farm Credit System to restructure loan
repayments for farmers hard hit by drought.
   _Provide emergency loans to farmers if drought conditions
persist.
   Task force members have been attempting to discourage their
fellow lawmakers from dumping a spate of election-year drought aid
bills in the hopper, but two Michigan lawmakers pushed ahead
Wednesday, saying there was no time for delay.
   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., and Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., offered
a measure that would use in-kind payments to reimburse farmers for
up to 50 percent of their major losses. Traxler said the
legislation had no dollar limit and that it might not pass this
year.

   President Reagan acknowledged Wednesday that
many items on his agenda will be left to his successor and he urged
the next administration to continue his push for freer markets and
more open trade.
   ``We must leave whatever part of our agenda is unfinished to
those who will follow us, trusting that they will benefit from the
lessons we have learned,'' Reagan told a dinner gathering of the
nation's leading business executives.
   The president used the speech to review the outcome of this
week's seven-nation economic summit in Toronto, but he also touched
upon his legacy _ an issue that has been creeping into his comments
in recent weeks.
   Reagan, who has less than seven months left in office, asserted
that his philosophy of free enterprise and belief in the creative
power of the individual must be allowed to flourish if the United
States is to retain a robust economy and a position of leadership
among the economic powers.
   The president spoke to the Business Roundtable, an organization
of top executives of the nation's leading 200 corporations.
   In his speech, Reagan pointed to the U.S.-Canadian free trade
agreement as an example of what remains left to be accomplished in
his term, as wel as something the nation's future leaders should
build on.
   He called the pact one that ``will show the better way'' because
it will do away with ``all the bitterness _ all the destructiveness
_ of round upon round of trade battles.''
   ``I would hope that those who follow me will not view it as an
item of finished business, but rather as only a beginning,'' Reagan
said. ``I would hope that America's leaders will fix upon the
vision of a day when all borders become what the U.S.-Canadian
border so long has been: a meeting place, rather than a dividing
line.''
   He said he even hoped that ``the free flow of trade'' will come
to envelope the entire Western Hemisphere ``in a bond of mutually
beneficial exchange.''
   Reagan said his years in office have ``done much ... to act upon
the vision of economic freedom'' and the proof is that his
administration has paved the way to ``new jobs, lower taxes, steady
growth.''
   Saying the nation stands ``on the verge of an economic and
technological future of vast promise,'' Reagan warned against
``those voices that would construct barriers on this road of
economic prosperity.''
   And with a nod to November, Reagan intimated that the choice
between a Democratic or Republican president may be a referendum on
his beliefs.
   ``These are the decisions that will be made over the next
several months _ individual opportunity and incentive or renewed
government restriction and burden,'' he said.
   His policies, Reagan asserted, have gotten attention even in the
communist bloc.
   Around the world, Reagan said, ``state control of the economy is
loosening in favor of freer markets. The lesson is clear. If you
want economic growth, work for economic and individual freedom.''
   ``After my visit to Moscow, it's my belief that human
creativity, expressed in economic freedom, can transform even the
nations of the Soviet bloc,'' he said.
   But Reagan acknowledged that he didn't always get his way during
his three-day session in Toronto with the leaders of the world's
most powerful democracies. The president's call for the total
elimination of agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 was rejected
by his summit colleagues.
   ``In Toronto, the other leaders and I confirmed once more that
free markets must be our goal. That doesn't mean that areas of
disagreement don't remain,'' Reagan said.
   He acknowledged that many believe the meetings ``are just so
much sound and fury,'' but he insisted that the leaders are working
more closely together than ever before and the summits are a key
reason why.
   Even during last year's stock market crash, ``the international
economy stayed steady. Working together, we guided the world ship
through the storm,'' he said.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
praised Canada's trade agreement with the United States on
Wednesday, and opposition legislators accused her of interfering.
   Mrs. Thatcher, addressing Parliament, was cheered repeatedly by
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservatives as she also urged
NATO to modernize its nuclear arsenal despite Soviet moves toward
liberalization.
   ``On the basis of Britain's experience of joining the European
Community, you need have no fear that Canada's national personality
will be in any way diminished,'' the British Conservative Party
leader said of the trade agreement with Canada's giant southern
neighbor.
   ``Fifteen years of EC membership have left our people no less
British and no less proud of their history and independence,'' said
Mrs. Thatcher, who stopped in the capital for a day on the way home
from the seven-nation economic summit in Toronto.
   After the speech to a joint meeting of the House of Commons and
Senate, her second in five years, Mrs. Thatcher signed agreements
on drugs and air services with Mulroney.
   Ed Broadbent, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party,
said Mrs. Thatcher ``abused her diplomatic status'' by praising the
Free Trade Agreement before Parliament.
   The pact signed by Mulroney and President Reagan in January,
which must be approved by Parliament and Congress, would eliminate
trade barriers over a 10-year period and more closely integrate the
two economies.
   Opposition leaders claim Canada sacrifices soverignty in the
agreement, including control of its energy and natural resources.
   Along with opposition Liberals, the New Democrats also sat in
silent disapproval while Mrs. Thatcher urged NATO to modernize its
nuclear and conventional arsenals. The New Democrats oppose
Canadian membership in the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Canadian television carried the address live, underlining Mrs.
Thatcher's high profile during the three-day summit of the United
States, France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada.
   The drugs agreement was part of a British bid to get some 40
nations to sign a reciprocal agreement allowing for the seizure of
trafficking profits and making money laundering an offense. Britain
and the United States have signed a similar agreement.

   House Republican Leader Robert H. Michel on
Wednesday requested a House vote on a Senate-passed welfare
overhaul bill, saying there isn't enough time to work out a
compromise with a much more expensive House bill.
   ``Normally, I would not be inclined to suggest such a course of
action,'' Michel, R-Ill., said in a letter to House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   But Michel said ``the time and the opportunity for welfare
reform and the hope it holds out for many American families is
slipping beyond our grasp'' because the end of the 100th Congress
is approaching. He said the needs of welfare families could be best
served ``by setting the House bill aside.''
   But Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., chairman of the House subcommittee
that handled the welfare bill, dismissed Michel's concerns as
``nonsense.''
   The $2.8 billion Senate bill and the $7 billion House bill, both
centered on a major new jobs, education and training program for
welfare recipients, are awaiting reconciliation in a House-Senate
conference committee.
   Michel said only 25 working days at most are left before the
last push of the Congress in September, after which members will
return home to campaign for re-election.
   ``Such constraints make the prospects for a successful
conference and a presidential signature very dim,'' Michel wrote.
   Michel cited last week's 93-3 vote for the Senate bill sponsored
by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., as evidence of a powerful
bipartisan consensus.
   He said the House, which passed its bill much more narrowly and
along party lines, could muster similar broad support ``if we can
bring ourselves to relinquish pride of authorship as well as some
both controversial and costly provisions.''
   ``I believe that I could convince the president to sign such a
bill,'' Michel said.
   Sticking points between the House and Senate negotiators are
likely to include:
   _A House provision giving states financial incentives to raise
cash benefits, not included in the Senate bill.
   _Cash benefits to poor two-parent families, which the House
requires year-round and the Senate requires for only six of any 12
months.
   _The amount of federal money available for the jobs, education
and training programs the states will have to set up. The Senate
bill starts at $500 million and moves gradually to $1 billion; the
House bill is uncapped.
   Downey said he and Moynihan ``are the best of friends and can
deal with these problems thoughtfully and quickly.''
   He added, ``There is no need for House to somehow suggest that
welfare reform can only be dealt with by the Senate. We have a
better bill and I think we will make their bill better.''

   Joan Galvin, the daughter of a defense
consultant under investigation in the Pentagon fraud case, will no
longer handle military issues for Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla., an
aide to Ireland said Wednesday.
   But Ms. Galvin, 28, remains on Ireland's staff as a legislative
assistant dealing with labor, tax and veterans matters, among other
things, said Doug Hattaway, Ireland's spokesman.
   Hattaway said the congressman and Ms. Galvin agreed it would put
her in an ``untenable position'' to continue dealing with military
affairs since her father, William Galvin, ``is a principal in the
investigation.''
   Moreover, Ms. Galvin would face a possible conflict of interest
if the House Armed Services Committee, of which Ireland is a
member, investigates the allegations of fraud at the Pentagon,
Hattaway said.
   Federal agents searched Galvin's office as well as that of his
stepson, Ken Brooke, in their investigation of allegations that
consultants provided defense contractors with information obtained
illegally from the Defense Department. No charges have been brought.
   Galvin, who has links to several of the subjects of the
wide-ranging investigation, has not returned several telephone
calls placed to his office.
   Joan Galvin joined Ireland's staff in 1985, 18 months before the
congressman was named to the Armed Services panel. He sits on a
procurement subcommittee.
   She was hired through a job-placement service on Capitol Hill
where she formerly worked for Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., Hattaway
said.
   Ireland is one of five congressmen who have been reported as
under scrutiny in the probe, though all have said they are not part
of the inquiry.
   The others are Reps. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the
House Appropriations defense subcommittee; Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.;
Samuel S. Stratton, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Armed Services
procurement subcommittee; Roy Dyson, D-Md., a member of Stratton's
subcommittee, along with Ireland.
   Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Virginia who is heading the investigation, told congressional
leaders Wednesday that ``no subpoena has been sought for any member
of Congress, no wiretap has been directed at any member of Congress
and no search warrant has been directed at any member of
Congress,'' according to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.

<HEAD>House Allots $10.7 Billion to NASA in Approving $60 Billion
Appropriations Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The House beat back an attempt Wednesday to
divert $400 million from space station funds to social programs and
voted to appropriate $10.7 billion to run the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration next year.
   The measure still must pass the Senate, whose appropriations
committee on Wednesday also voted $10.7 billion for NASA. The
Senate bill, however, assumes that $600 million will be transferred
to the space station from unspent defense funds.
   That proposed fund transfer was called unacceptable in a letter
that President Reagan sent to Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., and
Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., the chairman and ranking minority member of
the appropriations committee.
   At the same time, however, the president said that letting the
space station wither for lack of funds would be ``totally
unacceptable.''
   NASA had asked for $967 million in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1 to start the design phase of the $16 billion space station.
Under the bill passed by the House, the agency would get $902
million.
   The NASA funds are part of a $59.7 billion appropriation bill
for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 15
independent agencies that passed the House 377-40.
   That appropriation is 4 percent, or $2.4 billion, more than the
current level and 2 percent, or $1 billion, more than the Reagan
administration had requested. It provides substantially more
funding than the administration requested for low-income housing
assistance, community development block grants, Environmental
Protection Agency construction grants and pollution control, and
veterans' medical care.
   Before voting on the appropriations bill, the House turned down,
256-166, an amendment by Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. that would
have distributed $400 million from space station funds among
programs for the homeless, veterans and the elderly, and urban
development.
   ``This amendment is a disaster,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Tex.,
whose district includes the Johnson Space Center.
   On the Senate side, one appropriations subcommittee had voted
only $200 million last week for starting the design phase of the
$16 billion space station, a level that would not allow the program
to go forward. On Tuesday, another Senate subcommittee acted to add
$600 million by transferring unspent defense funds.
   The full Appropriations Committee on Wednesday voted the $200
million. The committee was expected to approve the $600 million
transfer from defense funds on Thursday.
   ``I wish the administration would work with us on this,'' Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told reporters. ``Frankly, I think we have
a way of accomplishing the objective. I was very pleased to see the
House beat back an amendment that would have, in effect, gutted the
space station. It shows there is strong support for it.''
   In his letter, Reagan recalled that he had made the space
station a priority and that he had asked nearly a billion dollars
for it next year.
   ``This is not the time to turn our backs on the future or on
needed defense spending,'' the president said.
   Funding the station with only $200 million ``would be totally
unacceptable,'' Reagan wrote, adding, ``Equally unacceptable,
however, would be any plan that takes critical funds away from
another national priority, our country's defense budget.''
   He said such a money shift would be not only counterproductive
for both the defense and space station programs, ``but funding the
space station at the expense of national security violates the
budget agreement that the White House reached with the
congressional leadership last November.''
   The president offered no substitute money source.
   The United States is about to sign agreements with the European
Space Agency, Canada and Japan for their participation in the
station _ agreements that call for the partners to spend a total of
$7 billion.
   ``The Congress' failure now to fund adequately this vital
project will significantly undermine our national space effort and
raise serious questions about our reliability as a leader and
partner,'' Reagan said.

   Police returned a 4-day-old boy to his
joyful parents Wednesday, two days after a woman dressed as a nurse
carried him out of his mother's hospital room, authorities said.
   Renee McClure of Lexington clung tightly to her sleeping son,
Jason Ray McClure, and said she would not ``take my eyes off him''
after the infant was returned.
   The alleged abductor and a second woman were taken into custody,
police said.
   The baby was ``in perfect health,'' said Meredith Eanes,
spokeswoman for High Point Regional Hospital, where employees
cheered when the baby's return was announced.
   ``I had my (older) son on my lap,'' Mrs. McClure said at a news
conference after the baby was returned. ``He said, `Mommy, I want
to see my baby brother.'''
   ``It wasn't five minutes (later) they were coming around with my
baby,'' she said, her voice breaking. ``We're just so glad and so
thankful.''
   Brenda Joyce Nobles, 37, hometown unknown, was to be charged
with kidnapping, according to police Capt. Earl Whitaker. He would
not comment on a possible motive.
   Police said officers went to a house here after receiving a tip.
They decided to raid the house after a woman answered the door and
police could hear an infant crying in the background. They found
Ms. Nobles in a closet with the abducted baby, authorities said.
   The woman who answered the door was also taken into custody and
charges were expected, Whitaker said.
   Mrs. McClure, 27, had told police that a woman dressed as a
nurse entered her room at about 9:30 a.m. Monday, told her she
needed to weigh the baby and then carried him from the room.
   At the news conference, Mrs. McClure sat holding a sleeping
Jason on her lap, flanked by her husband, Richard; 3-year-old son,
Kevin; the baby's paternal grandparents and maternal grandmother;
and more than a dozen other relatives.
   The baby, wrapped in a blanket, wore a blue and white striped
hat, which his mother removed to show where the child's hair had
been cut during the abduction in an attempt to disguise him.
   Mrs. McClure said she had mixed feelings about Jason's kidnapper.
   ``I really feel sorry for her that she felt she had to go in a
hospital and take a baby that was not her own,'' she said.
   ``I'd like to ask her why,'' she said.
   ``We live in a rather cruel world,'' Mrs. McClure said. ``I was
just afraid she would hurt him.''
   Asked by photographers to hug the infant for a picture, Mrs.
McClure said, ``I sure don't mind that!''
   Wednesday was the due date for Jason, the baby's father said.
   Pat Pegram, executive secretary to the hospital president, said
the hospital operator ``was all choked up'' trying to make the
announcement on the hospital's public address system that the baby
was found. Staff members then began cheering.
   ``Everybody is joyous,'' she said. ``It's hard to conduct any
work. It's just been wild. We're happy. We're joyous.''
   The return of the baby came almost 24 hours after Mrs. McClure
made a tearful appeal for the return, saying, ``We love our son
very much and we need him so desperately.''
   The infant was the first baby born on Father's Day at the
hospital and was the subject of a feature story on a television
station.
   At least $9,000 in reward money was offered by police, the
hospital, the company where the baby's father works, and others,
according to Whitaker.

<HEAD>Three Men Sentenced For Smuggling Bomb Into Vermont</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Lebanese-born Canadians who the
government alleged were members of a Middle East terrorist group
were sentenced Wednesday to up to 16 years in prison for smuggling
a bomb into the United States.
   U.S. District Court Judge Albert Coffrin told the men it didn't
matter to him whether they belonged to an extremist political
party. But he said there was little doubt that the explosive device
the men had been carrying could have caused serious damage.
   ``The lethal potential, however, is clear,'' Coffrin said. ``Any
victim of a bombing is an innocent victim.''
   Coffrin sentenced George Younan and co-defendant Walid Kabbani
to 16 years each in federal prison. Walid Mourad, who pleaded
guilty before the others went to trial, was sentenced to eight
years in prison. The men faced maximum sentences of as much as 35
years.
   The defense attorneys claimed victory with the sentences, saying
they were less than 20-year terms that the government had offered
in a plea bargain that the defendants rejected.
   The attorneys had described their clients as bunglers rather
than terrorists, but even they say they have no idea what the men
were planning to do with the bomb. Younan and Kabbani pleaded
innocent but never testified in their trial.
   U.S. Attorney George Terwilliger III said the sentence was
appropriate, saying their acts attacked the country at its very
foundations and that ``violence in the pursuit of any goal is
unsatisfactory.''
   The three were arrested last October and charged with smuggling
a homemade bomb into the United States through Richford, a small
town on the Vermont-Canadian border.
   The U.S. government claimed the men were members of the Syrian
Social Nationalist Party. The party was founded in the 1930s and
was devoted to the formation of ``Greater Syria,'' which would have
united Lebanon and what was then Palestine, but is now Israel,
under Syrian hegemony.
   Floyd Clarke, an assistant director of the FBI's criminal
investigative division, said members of the group have claimed
responsibility for the 1982 assasination of Lebanese
President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
   Last month, Justice Department spokesman John Russell said the
men were believed to be the first alleged Middle Eastern terrorists
arrested in the United States carrying explosives.
   Attorneys for Kabbani and Mourad have denied their clients were
members of the SSNP. A cousin of Younan's said Younan belonged to
the party but denied that it was a terrorist group.
   None of the three defendents addressed the judge Wednesday.
Their attorneys said the government's allegations of their
political affiliations were greatly exaggerated.
   ``He says `I'm not a terrorist,' '' Kabbani's attorney Mark
Keller said. ``He simply says I know what I am ... He asked me not
to beg on his behalf, not to grovel on his behalf.''
   But Terwilliger dismissed defense claims that the men were
amateurs.
   ``There is a real naivete at work when you look at these
individuals as bumblers or amateurs or whatnot or that they don't
look like terrorists,'' he said. ``What do terrorists look like?
What someone out of central casting out of Hollywood would decide?''

<HEAD>EPA Moves to Order Tighter Controls Over Pesticide</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to clarify why states were selected for EPA
action</NOTE>

   In its first proposal aimed at protecting
groundwater from pesticides, the Environmental Protection Agency
said Wednesday it will require at least 10 states to adopt
additional controls on highly toxic aldicarb or lose use of that
chemical.
   Aldicarb, sold under the trade name Temik, has been found in
groundwater in 16 states, in 11 of them in concentrations above
what EPA considers safe.
   The proposal published for public comment contained an
alternative that could require as many as 24 states to act.
   The 24 were not identified, but EPA said the 10 from which it
plans to require ``pesticide management plans'' are Pennsylvania,
Michigan, North Dakota, Georgia and Alabama, where aldicarb has not
been found; and Maine, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Florida,
where it has been found in concentrations above EPA's ``health
advisory'' of 10 parts per billion _ sometimes 50 times greater.
   But EPA considers the 10 states it selected the most vunerable
because of the characteristics of the groundwater and the pattern
of aldicarb use in those states. The proposal comes as a result of
EPA's draft groundwater strategy, which would leave most key
decisions to the states.
   Aldicarb also has been found in California, Massachusetts, North
Carolina, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Virgina in concentrations
above 10 ppb and in Arizona, Arkansas, Oregon, Texas and Washington
below that. Overall, one-third of some 35,000 groundwater samples
tested by EPA contained some aldicarb.
   Florida, New York and Wisconsin have aggressive aldicarb
programs of their own, said John A. Moore, EPA's assistant
administrator for pesticides.
   The only manufacturer, Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co. of Research Triangle
Park, N.C., would be required to monitor groundwater in 16 other
states where EPA considers it highly vulnerable.
   Those states are Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Vermont.
   The draft would forbid use of aldicarb within 300 feet of a
well, and would add label warnings that would force state training
programs for applicators to discuss groundwater.
   EPA said it was still checking residues on food, but
Rhone-Poulenc said a new study showed ``residues were rarely
present.''
   The company said EPA's plan reflects ``sound principles for
drinking water protection,'' and said it would cooperate.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which frequently argues
for tighter pesticide controls, attacked the agency's plan as
``insufficient to prevent contamination of future drinking water.''
Much of the criticism was directed at the agency's draft
groundwater strategy, which would permit states to decide that some
groundwater should not be protected.
   Asked if states could submit plans that permit aldicarb
contamination of groundwater, Moore said, ``I would say yes. But we
would require them to clearly state that to the citizens of the
state, and the citizens would have to have a chance to comment.''
   If a state refuses to submit a plan, ``I would say we would
cancel the use of adlicarb in that state,'' Moore told reporters.
   EPA's decision is not a ``license to pollute'' up to 10 ppb,
Moore said. `If you've got 10 ppb, you've failed. I would expect at
1 ppb (about the limit of detection) ... you would kick in step two
of the management plan, more heroic surveillance, additional
restrictions on use, and things like that.''
   State plans might also ban use in certain areas or at certain
times like rainy months, reduce per-acre use, limit frequency of
application or other measures.
   Because their own wells are often contaminated, ``There is such
an interest on the part of people that use this, I think (the
chance of compliance) is very high compared with a lot of things we
do,'' Moore said.
   EPA expects to adopt aldicarb requirements in about a year and
state plans under it should take effect two years from then.
   As much as 5.7 million pounds of aldicarb are used each year to
protect potatoes, citrus, peanuts and other crops against insects,
root worms and mites. EPA said banning aldicarb could cost farmers
$135 million.
   Widespread contamination of groundwater, frequently at 200 ppb
or more, led Suffolk County on New York's Long Island to ban its
use, and 3,100 homes have costly activated carbon filters on their
wells.
   More than 1,000 people were reported poisoned in 1985 in seven
western states and Canada from California watermelons contaminated
with aldicarb. Two babies were stillborn.
   Aldicarb breaks down in soil in a few weeks, but in groundwater
it can last decades.
   It works by inhibiting nerve transmission and can cause
digestive upset, dehydration, blurred vision, disorientation,
seizures, unconsciousness and eventually death.

   Residents of this southern Illinois town
thought they were building for the future when they loaned $63,000
to attract a new doctor, but the intended doctor developed cancer
and filed for bankruptcy before completing his training.
   ``I'm losing a lot of sleep about some of these widows that
helped recruit a doctor,'' said James Rowland, 45. ``I just can't
pay them back.
   ``I just don't know what to say.''
   The town has other doctors, but residents aren't happy about
losing the money.
   ``Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose,'' said investor
Edward D. Taylor Sr., adding that the city ``just had some bad
luck.''
   Residents of this town of 5,100 contributed $63,000 in loans and
outright donations to the Vandalia Civic Advancement Association to
attract Rowland. At least 45 investors loaned between $250 and
$10,000 each.
   The association loaned the money to Rowland, who came to town in
1980 with his wife, Ann, a registered nurse with the county health
department, and two daughters aged 10 and 13.
   However, Rowland developed cancer in his left kidney and had it
removed by July 1983. Cancer has spread since into his bones and
cannot be treated. Rowland believes he has little chance for
recovery.
   The illness kept him from completing a residency program or
repaying his loans. A former chemical engineer in Pittsburgh,
Rowland enrolled at the American University of the Caribbean for
four years or medical school in 1975. He said he subsequently
received clinical training at three Chicago hospitals.
   The civic association has no cash to repay the investors,
President Steve Stombaugh said. It tried to recoup the money by
suing Rowland in Fayette County Circuit Court in April for
$131,151.76 to cover the loans and interest.
   But Rowland stalled the lawsuit by filing for bankruptcy May 18.
His first meeting with creditors is set for Thursday at the Keller
Ramada Inn in Effingham.
   ``There's no argument I owe the money,'' Rowland said. ``They
raised it in good faith and I came here in good faith. But I had an
illness.''
   Documents on file in U.S. District Court in East St. Louis show
Rowland has earned no income since 1986. His wife made $22,684 in
1987.
   About the only way investors appear likely to recoup their money
is if Rowland dies. The civic association has $100,000 in life
insurance on Rowland and his wife, he said.
   They didn't take out disability insurance.

   Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh began
returning to work Wednesday after a month-long strike, but held
another demonstration for the disputed territory's annexation to
Soviet Armenia, residents said.
   In another ethnic disturbance in the southern Soviet Union, a
dissident source said at least 5,000 Crimean Tatars were on strike
to demand the return of the homeland that dictator Josef Stalin
took from them in World War II.
   Armenians make up more than three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's
160,000 residents. Some of them apparently were swayed to end the
strike by the legislature's request Tuesday that the territory be
made independent until its future is settled.
   A resident of Stepanakert, the territorial capital, said about
half of the original 30,000 strikers continued the walkout.
   Agitation began early this year in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh
for annexation of the territory, which was assigned to the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan in 1923. Azerbaijan has refused
to give it up.
   The chairman of the legislature read the resolution on
television Wednesday in Stepanakert and answered questions from a
reporter in the studio and from people who telephoned, the resident
said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the chairman urged people to return to work. Other
residents have said the strike and daily street demonstrations
began May 23, shutting down most retail and agricultural production
in the region.
   A strike also began this month in Yerevan, capital of Armenia,
in support of the demand for annexation. The newspaper Socialist
Industry reported Wednesday that the strike was ending and said
Yerevan factory managers had urged employees to make up for lost
time by working Saturdays.
   Not all was quiet in Yerevan. A dissident who lives in Moscow,
Valery Senderov, said up to 10,000 people gathered outside KGB
headquarters in Yerevan on Wednesday evening to demand the release
of a jailed Armenian activist.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan was arrested in March. He led an Armenian
nationalist group and had informed foreign journalists about
demonstrations in February.
   According to the resident of Stepanakert, ethnic Armenians held
another demonstration Wednesday but organizers decided to stop the
protests until Moscow acts on the legislature's request. The
Kremlin has not said whether it will decide the fate of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters
Wednesday: ``We have an address to the Supreme Soviet on the side
of Armenia, and on the side of Azerbaijan. We can guess this
question will be on the agenda of the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, but it won't happen overnight.''
   The Supreme Soviet is the national parliament and the Presidium
its executive council.
   Dissident historian Roy Medvedyev told reporters Wednesday the
territory is ``a historic part of Armenia'' that ``should belong to
Armenia.''
   In a telephone interview about the Tatar strike, Alexander
Podrabinek, an editor of the dissident journal Express-Chronicle,
said Tatars met on Sunday at Nizhnaya Bakanka near Krasnodar to
plan it, then returned to their homes throughout the region to
begin the walkout.
   Tatars are Turkic-speaking descendants of Mongols. According to
Podrabinek, the strikers plan to stay off the job until the
national government returns the homeland taken from them because of
alleged collaboration with the German invaders in World War II.
   He said police were not interfering.

   Boston declared a heat emergency Wednesday, and officials in
some Illinois towns say they might cancel July 4 fireworks because
of tinder-dry vegetation, as much of the nation wilted for still
another day in Sahara-like weather.
   A cold front reduced temperatures in parts of the Northeast and
upper Midwest, but scattered showers and thunderstorms brought only
limited comfort to farmers and ranchers suffering a severe drought.
   The drought left the Ohio River closed to barge traffic
Wednesday morning at Mound City, Ill. The river was mottled with
exposed sandbars, some larger than football fields. Dozens of
barges lined the shore and dozens more sat motionless in the river
waiting for dredging to deepen the channel.
   By midafternoon Wednesday, the National Weather Service reported
that two dozen cities had already set high-temperature records. In
Philadelphia, the temperature reached 100 degrees for the first
time in more than 10 years.
   Not to be outdone, Arizona posted triple-digit temperatures even
before noon. Tucson, which reached an all-time high of 112 on
Tuesday, had already hit 108 by noon MST Wednesday.
   But good news was forthcoming for the northeastern quarter of
the nation as a cold front out of Canada promised cooler weather
across the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, New England and the
mid-Atlantic region. Early afternoon temperatures behind the front
were up to 15 degrees cooler than the same time Tuesday.
   Much of the Great Lakes region got scattered showers Wednesday.
   Members of a Roman Catholic parish in Kewaskum, Wis., who held a
day of fasting Tuesday to coax rain, got an answer to their prayers
Wednesday when the area around town received as much as an inch or
more. But elsewhere in the state there was only a trace of rain,
and the flow on the Wisconsin River hit a 100-year low level.
   Rain also fall on parts of Iowa, Michigan and other states. But
officials stressed it was nowhere near enough to make up for weeks
or even months of below-normal rainfall. And it wasn't just in the
Midwest that farm officials were worried.
   ``We're getting some signs that the drought is spreading into
the state,'' said Ray Christensen, public affairs director for the
farm bureau in Colorado, where the mercury has topped 100 this week.
   ``We're beginning to see signs of heat stress for cattle and for
crops,'' Christensen said. ``It's beginning to pose a serious
threat in the state.''
   Other problems created by the weather were varied.
   Health officials in Boston, where 12 people died from the heat
last week, declared an emergency and set up air-conditioned
shelters for the elderly at two public schools as temperatures
climbed above 90 again Wednesday.
   The city's Commission on Elderly Affairs also began distributing
100 donated fans to shut-ins, established a hot line for elderly
residents to get free transportation to shelters, and distributed
40,000 fliers, printed in six languages, offering tips on how to
avoid heat stroke.
   In Columbus, Ohio, officials initally canceled ``Operation Cool
Down'' the traditional fire hydrant program for inner-city children
stay cool, but Mayor Dana Rinehart ordered that 14 hydrants be
opened a few hours on days when the temperature reaches 90 degrees.
   Residents also will be allowed to wade in fountains at two city
parks. The fountains previously were off-limits because of a city
law.
   Community leaders in several Illinois towns said they were
considering a ban on Fourth of July fireworks.
   ``Our fire chief is concerned that the parched grass could
easily ignite from spent shells,'' said Village Manager Peter
Burchard of Hoffman Estates. ``With 25,000 people in close
proximity, it's not a risk we want to take.''
   The drought is also affecting Illinois' wildlife, conservation
officials say. Ducks have stopped breeding, and the lack of
backwater nesting areas has affected the survival rates for young
ducks.
   ``We just completed a survey of northeastern Illinois
wetlands,'' said Carl Becker, chief of the Illinois Conservation
Department's natural heritage division. ``It was hard to find any
wetlands. A number were so dry you could plant corn in them. It's a
bleak situation for this year.''

<HEAD>Mourners Pay Tribute To Six Soldiers Killed In IRA Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBURN, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 8,000 people gathered
Wednesday night to pay tribute to six British soldiers killed by an
Irish Republican Army bomb explosion.
   In another development, a sniper shot a British soldier in the
arm Wednesday in Belfast, but the man was not seriously wounded,
police said. The outlawed IRA claimed responsibility for the
shooting.
   Security forces checked all cars entering this town seven miles
from Belfast, and armed soldiers patrolled from rooftops as
townspeople gathered for a memorial service in Lisburn's market
square.
   Mourners, many weeping, laid wreaths at a simple monument by the
traffic lights where the soldiers' van blew up June 15 as they were
returning to their barracks after taking part in a charity footrace.
   A bugler played taps as Mayor Billy Bleakes laid a wreath on
behalf of Lisburn, home of the British army headquarters in
Northern Ireland.
   The Rev. Howard Cromie, former Presbyterian moderator for the
province, observed that both Protestants and Roman Catholics turned
out for the service.
   ``There is no difference between Catholic tears and Protestant
tears when tragedy strikes,'' he said.
   ``The way forward,'' Cromie added, ``is certainly not down the
blind alley of retaliation, reprisals; for that is something which
must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms.''
   Three of the six soldiers killed in the bombing were buried with
full military honors Wednesday in their hometowns in mainland
Britain.
   In claiming responsibility for the bombing, the IRA vowed to
wage ``unceasing war'' against British security forces in the
province.
   The guerrilla group, in its modern form, has been fighting for
nearly 20 years to force the British from Northern Ireland and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Catholic
Irish Republic to the south.
   Earlier Wednesday, Sir John Hermon, the province's police chief
for eight years, announced that he will retire next year.
   Hermon, 59, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
could have stayed on until 1994 _ the mandatory retirement age is
65 _ but he said that after 38 years on the force he felt it was
time to retire.
   He said his decision had nothing to do with allegations that his
force operated a shoot-to-kill policy six years ago.
   John Stalker, a police officer from England appointed to inquire
into the six killings by the police, was suddenly pulled out of
Northern Ireland before completing his task.
   Stalker later quit the police and wrote a book claiming Hermon
refused to cooperate with him and that there was a conspiracy to
conceal the truth.
   At his news conference, Hermon repeated his earlier dismissal of
the book as ``rubbish.''

<HEAD>South Africans Charged in Botswana For Border Incursion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two South Africans were charged in
court Wednesday in connection with a border incursion earlier this
week that left three policemen wounded, one critically, officials
said.
   Johannes Basson, 25, identified by Botswanan police as a South
African army corporal, and Theodore Hermansen, 30, said to be a
South African police or army reservist, were charged in a
magistrate's court with endangering Botswana's security, committing
grievous bodily harm and attempting to cause death.
   They were denied bail and will be held in police custody for two
weeks until their next court appearance.
   The South African military said an army unit crossed into
Botswana Monday night on an intelligence mission linked to efforts
to combat the outlawed African National Congress. It did not
elaborate.
   The ANC is a black guerrilla movement fighting to topple South
Africa's white minority government because of its policies of
racial separation, or apartheid.
   The South African military has neither confirmed nor denied that
the two arrested men are security force members. It has admitted
its unit fired shots at a Botswanan police patrol but said the unit
fired only after the police shot first.
   Botswana's police commissioner, Simon Hirschfeldt, insisted the
Botswanan police were unarmed. He said police in Botswana do not
carry arms on routine patrols and his men could not have fired
``with empty hands.''
   Three Botswanan policemen were injured in the shooting incident.
Hirschfeldt said one was in critical condition after being hit by
10 bullets.
   Botswana says five other South African commandos who fired the
shots escaped back into South Africa. The two arrested men
attempted a getaway in two Botswana police cars and were arrested
at a roadblock, police said.
   South African commandos have staged numerous border raids in the
past on suspected ANC facilities in Botswana and neighboring
countries. In none of the previous raids have any commandos been
captured.
   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Wednesday condemning the
South African raid. ``By firing on and wounding unarmed policemen,
the South African government has once again shown its disregard for
international law,'' the statement said.
   At the United Nations Wednesday, Botswana's Ambassador Joseph
Legwaila said he will seek a meeting of the Security Council to
condemn the incident.
   The ambassador said Botswana has been plagued by raids from
South Africa because it supports the African National Congress.
``Botswana is and will always remain a friend of the ANC and an
enemy of South Africa,'' he said.
   Government-run Radio South Africa said Wednesday that 23 African
National Congress guerrillas who were recently captured in South
Africa between June 10 and 13 had received their instructions and
weapons in Botswana.

   Summer heat grilled the nation Wednesday from the central Plains
eastward to the mid-Atlantic states and the Carolinas, with
temperatures in the 90s. Two dozen cities, from Des Moines to
Washington, D.C., had record highs for the date.
   A few cities reached the 100-degree mark, including Washington,
D.C., Philadelphia. Tucson, Ariz., which reached an all-time record
high of 112 degrees Tuesday, reached 108 degrees along with Phoenix.
   Pittsburgh had a 98-degree reading; Indianapolis reached 99
degress; and Milwaukee had its 10th day this month of 90-degree
readings; normally, the city reaches 90 degrees only 8 times in an
entire year.
   A Canadian cold front promised cooler weather across the Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, New England and the mid-Atlantic regions. Early
afternoon temperatures behind the front were 10 to 15 degrees
cooler than Tuesday over the Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley
and the upper Great Lakes.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along the front from New
York across lower Michigan and southern Iowa into southwest
Nebraska, but rainfall was not nearly enough to break the drought
in the Plains and the Ohio Valley.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered across the
Southeast from the Carolinas to Florida and westward along the Gulf
Coast to Texas, as well as over the central Rockies and portions of
the Southwest,
   Temperatures along the northern Pacific Coast were only in the
50s and low 60s as cloudy skies and cool winds off the Pacific kept
temperatures down.
   The low temperature for the nation Wednesday morning was 42
degrees at Truckee, Calif. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m.
EDT ranged from 56 degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 108 degrees
at both Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.
   In the national weather forecast for Thursday, showers and
thunderstorms will be scattered from the upper Texas coast to
Florida. Isolated to widely scattered showers and thunderstorms
will develop from the mid-Atlantic states, across the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the mid Mississippi Valley, and the northern
central Rockies. Isolated afternoon and evening thunderstorms will
develop across the remainder of the Southeast and eastern Texas.
   High temperatures will again be in the 90s to near 100 degrees
across much of the nation; between 100 and 105 over eastern
montana; 100 to 115 for the desert Southwest and Southern and
central California valleys; in the 70s and 80s from New England,
across the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes to the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Pacific Northwest and along the California coast. A few
locations across upper Michigan will remain in the 60s.

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy unveiled a scaled-down
proposal Wednesday to increase the federal minimum wage $1.20 to
$4.55 an hour over the next three years.
   The labor-supported proposal from the Massachusetts Democrat
came as the Senate Labor Committee began deliberations on Kennedy's
earlier minimum wage bill. Republican Sens. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina and Dan Quayle of Indiana immediately expressed their
opposition.
   Kennedy's original bill would have boosted the minimum wage, now
at $3.35 per hour, by 50 cents next year, 40 cents in 1990 and 40
cents in 1991, with automatic increases tied to inflation to keep
it at 50 percent of the average wage nationally.
   The House Labor Committee already has completed action on a
measure that would raise the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour
over the next four years. It is understood, however, that the House
panel's chairman, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., will offer
the Kennedy proposal as a substitute when the measure gets to the
House floor sometime after the July 4 recess.
   In its brief meeting Wednesday, the Senate Labor Committee
rejected 12-4 an amendment by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who wanted
Puerto Rico to be required to keep the federal minimum wage.
   Kennedy's proposal includes Puerto Rico, but permits the country
to exempt itself if the island's minimum wage board certifies to
the labor secretary that there is a ``substantial finding of
unemployment.''
   In introducing his substitute bill, Kennedy said the current
minimum wage has fallen to its lowest point since its inception 50
years ago, with today's minimum of $3.35 per hour representing only
36 percent of the average hourly earnings.
   Historically, he said, the minimum has been maintained at a
figure of one-half the hourly average.
   ``Congressional action to restore the minimum wage is long
overdue,'' he said.
   Thurmond said, however, said he was opposed to a significant
increase in the minimum wage because ``it is inflationary, it
reduces entry-level and part-time jobs for teen-agers and unskilled
workers, as well as decreases services to consumers.''
   He said only ``big labor'' would benefit from an increased
minimum wage.
   ``Minimum wage legislation has always been promoted by labor
unions and other special interest groups for their purely
self-serving political considerations,'' Thurmond said. ``The labor
unions in our country are looking to this measure as a means of
securing their positions and turning around a decline in membership
that they have experienced in recent years.''
   Quayle said he would propose an amendment which would increase
the minimum wage to $4 and combine it with a reform of the earned
income tax credit, similar to an approach presented in the House
Labor Committee by Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis., but rejected by the
panel.

   James Gaines, a key Navy procurement official
whose offices were searched last week, is cooperating with the
government in the Pentagon bribery probe, sources familiar with the
investigation said Wednesday night.
   Another Pentagon official whose offices were searched, Victor
Cohen, also is negotiating with the government on whether to
cooperate with authorities, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The two-year probe included wiretaps on the telephones of Gaines
and Cohen.
   Shortly after the investigation became public June 14, federal
investigators sounded out Gaines about the possibility of
delivering information to the government, said the sources.
   Gaines made an appointment to hire a Washington-area defense
lawyer, but then abruptly canceled the meeting after getting a call
from a federal investigator who told him that ``you have until 9
a.m. tomorrow to decide whose side you're on,'' according to one
source. Gaines decided several days ago to cooperate, said the
sources.
   ABC News reported that the government has made no deal with
Gaines for lenient treatment in a possible prosecution, but that
such an arrangement is expected later. ABC News also reported that
another key figure in the probe, former Pentagon-official-turned
consultant Melvyn Paisley, has so far refused to help authorities.
   Paisley's attorney, Lawrence Barcella, refused to comment.
   Gaines was deputy assistant Navy secretary for acquisition
management while Cohen was deputy assistant Air Force secretary in
charge of buying tactical command, control, communications and
computer systems. Because of the bribery investigation, both men
have been reassigned to jobs having nothing to do with procurement.
   The offices of both men were searched and sealed last week by
FBI agents as investigators obtained 38 search warrants in 12
states to seize documents at the offices of 15 defense contractors
as well as consultants and Pentagon personnel.

<HEAD>House of Commons Approves Accord Recognizing Quebec As Distinct
Society</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons gave overwhelming approval
Wednesday to a 1987 accord recognizing Quebec as a ``distinct
society'' and bringing the French-majority province back into the
Constitution.
   But the vote of 200 to 7 was not the final hurdle for the
controversial Meech Lake Accord, signed by the federal government
and all 10 provinces at Meech Lake, Quebec.
   The historic change also requires ratification by the 10
provinces and so far only five have done so. At least two have
demanded amendments before putting the accord to a vote.
   Eighty-one percent of Quebec's population speaks French, the
province's official language. Quebec has its own system of civil
law established by its French founders, and proponents of the 1987
accord want constitutional guarantees their legal and social
traditions will not be altered by the federal government.
   Prominent opponents of the pact include former Liberal Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau who claims it will erode Ottawa's power and
lead to the disintegration of the Canadian federation.
   Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a native of Quebec,
has made a constitutional settlement with Quebec one of his main
priorities. He says arguments over special rights for other
minority regions, native groups and women can be settled later.
   The Liberal-dominated Senate, an appointed body, held up the
accord for months but all of its proposed changes were defeated
when the measure was sent back to the elected House of Commons.
   The leaders of both opposition parties, John Turner of the
Liberals and Ed Broadbent of the socialist New Democrats, voted for
the accord and persuaded most of their followers to do likewise.
   However, members from the Northwest Territories and Yukon
Territory voted against Meech Lake because it will make it more
difficult for their remote regions to become full provinces.
   Under the accord, the approval of all provinces will be needed
before the territories can obtain provincehood. At present, it only
requires approval by two-thirds of the provinces containing at
least 50 percent of the Canadian population.
   The House of Commons originally ratified the accord 242-16 in
October but the Senate sent it back with amendments, requiring a
second final vote.
   Quebec has boycotted constitutional affairs since 1981 when
Trudeau repatriated the Constitution from Britain and added a new
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but failed to recognize Quebec's
distinct culture.

<HEAD>Low Water Leads To Limits On River Barges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard set limits Wednesday on
the number of barges towboats can work on the drought-shoaled
Mississippi River, while a growing backlog of hundreds of delayed
barges accumulated at Memphis.
   The new rules, which apply from Caruthersville, Mo., to
Greenville, Miss., are the first such restrictions set for a major
portion of the Mississippi, though temporary barge limits have been
imposed for small areas, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Donohoe.
   With the new limits, southbound towboats must have no more than
20 barges while northbound boats will be limited to 25, only 16 of
which can be loaded. Barges can draw a maximum of 8.5 feet of water.
   Mississippi River workboats, which are called towboats even
though they push their loads, generally can handle 40 or more
barges each. Industry officials say they lose $4,000 to $10,000 in
income for each barge left behind.
   The limits were sought by barge company representatives and are
aimed at preventing towboats operators from running their loads
aground in the shrunken Mississippi, Donohoe said.
   A continuing lack of rain throughout the Mississippi River
region has dropped the river to more than 20 feet lower at Memphis
than it was last June, and most towboat operators already have cut
their loads to 20 barges.
   Donohoe said industry officials worry that some boat captains
might take on more than they can safely handle in the low water.
``We're got to make sure that somebody doesn't get out there and
mess it up for everybody,'' he said.
   The barge limits will apply as long as the low water persists,
Donohoe said, and could be tightened further if the river continues
to drop.
   The barge limits were set as towboats with more than 600 barges
lined up on the river near Memphis. The Mississippi has been closed
six miles above the city while the Lenel Bean, a 240-foot dredge,
scoops out a 1,500-foot-long buildup of sand on the river bottom.
   Authorities said the dredging would take until Friday afternoon,
and more than 1,200 barges, many of them recently freed from
similar backlogs to the north and south, were expected to stack up
in the Memphis area.
   Brig. Gen. Thomas Sands, president of the Mississippi River
Commission, said the Army Corps of Engineers has located more than
30 spots on the Lower Mississippi that will likely need dredging
this summer.
   Sands said the river will remain open to commercial traffic
throughout the summer even though dredging will cause temporary
barge backups from time to time.
   Sands said controlled runoff from reservoirs on the Missouri
River and other rivers feeding the Mississippi will keep it open.
   Mississippi tributaries are low too, however, and Sands said a
continuing lack of rain could at some point shut down commercial
traffic on the river. But he said that was unlikely.
   ``There's got to be a doomsday point out there somewhere. Right
now, I don't know anybody that I've talked to who can give me any
idea where that is. ... Right now, we are not on the brink of
disaster,'' he said.
   The river measured 8.6 feet below zero on the Memphis river
gauge Wednesday. Zero on the gauge was set in the 1800s at 183.91
feet above sea level, and the river measured more than 12 feet
above zero last year this time.
   The record low before the latest drop was set in 1981 at 7.3
feet below zero, and the Corps of Engineers said the reading could
be more than nine feet below zero by next week.

<HEAD>Thousands of Workers Protest Low Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 striking auto workers
rallied for a second day Wednesday to protest low wages, the state
Tanjug news agency reported.
   Workers of the TAM company, Yugoslavia's largest producers of
trucks and vehicles, gathered on a square in the northern city of
Maribor in Slovenia to demand a 50-percent pay increase, the news
agency said. They were joined by workers from a nearby textile
mill, it said.
   The protesters, who staged another rally on Tuesday, elected a
strike committee to voice their grievances after Slovenia's Vice
Premier Janez Bohoric told them Wednesday that ``nobody has the
money needed to fulfill your demands,'' the news agency said.
   Last month the Yugoslav government linked wages to productivity
as part of an economic recovery program designed to cut inflation,
currently running at 170 percent, and overcome a severe economic
crisis.
   The austerity measures have sparked a wave of labor unrest.
   In Belgrade Wednesday, Vice Premier Janez Zemljaric attended a
meeting at an agricultural machinery plant whose striking workers
staged a noisy demonstration last Friday in front of Parliament,
protesting low wages and demanding government assistance for their
firm, Zmaj.
   Zemljaric reportedly said the government was determined to
introduce a more market-oriented economy, adding that ``the
consequences of the market forces (for loss-making companies) will
be very serious.''
   An estimated quarter of all Yugoslav enterprises are loss-makers
that have so far been kept afloat with substantial government
grants.
   Under the terms of an agreement signed with the International
Monetary Fund, the Yugoslav government has pledged to phase out the
subsidies. Officials claim there is no alternative if the country
is to repay its $21 billion foreign debt.

<HEAD>Liberia Bans Washington Post Reporter For Story On Graft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has banned a Washington
Post reporter from this West African country because of a critical
report he wrote on graft, but the correspondent said Wednesday he
stands by his story.
   Information Minister Emmanuel Bowier called the May 29 article
``erroneous and misleading.''
   But Bowier said it was not surprising because of ``extremely
cordial relations'' that existed between the newspaper and former
President William Tolbert, assassinated in an April 1980 coup led
by Gen. Samuel K. Doe.
   A person who answered the telephone at the office of Washington
Post managing editor Leonard Downie on Wednesday said comment would
come only from Katharine Graham, the newspaper's chairman of the
board. A message for Mrs. Graham to return a call was not answered.
   ``I stand by my story,'' Post correspondent Blaine Harden told
The Associated Press in Nairobi, where he is based.
   Harden, who has reported in Africa since 1985, wrote an article
describing how Doe and his close associates allegedly circumvent
U.S.-imposed spending controls. American experts were invited by
Doe's government to curb crippling official corruption.
   The report quoted Liberian businessmen as arguing the invitation
is another example of Doe's manipulation of Washington.
   At a news conference Monday, Bowier denied Harden's assertions
that 17 American economists, accountants and consultants hold
deputy ministerial rank and cosigned government checks.
   But a U.S. Information Services document explaining the two-year
$18.4 million ``economic stabilization project'' said the
technocrats ``will be assigned at the deputy minister or equivalent
level and will co-approve revenue and expenditure documentation.''
   Bowier said Harden's article was part of ``blatant distortions
and the misinformation campaign launched against the Doe
administration'' because he said Mrs. Graham was decorated by
Tolbert's government.

   Technicians began readying the Space
Shuttle Discovery on Wednesday for attachment to external fuel tank
and booster rockets for the first shuttle flight since the
Challenger disaster 2{ years ago.
   One day after Discovery was moved 1,000 feet to an assembly
building, workers were preparing a giant sling to lift the 80-ton
vehicle so it can be joined to its external fuel tank and two
126-foot solid fuel booster rockets.
   The hookup, which should be completed by Friday, is to be
followed by five days of tests among the components. Rollout to
Launch Pad 39B is set for June 30.
   The Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its crew of
seven.
   ``This is like a rebirth,'' said Discovery flow director John
``Tip'' Talone. ``We're in business again and we're going to stay
in business. It's got to be a tremendous boost to the workers
here.''
   The newest launch date is Sept. 3, but National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials said a late August liftoff is still
possible.
   ``A lot of things have to go right to make the end of August; if
not, we'll go a few days after that,'' Forrest S. McCartney,
director of the Kennedy Space Center, said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A New Orleans construction worker was found
guilty on a federal kidnapping charge Wednesday in his trial for
the Mardi Gras abduction of a North Carolina woman who died trying
to escape from him.
   The jury deliberated for three hours in U.S. District Court
before returning the guilty verdict against Cyril Melton, 27, who
faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. No sentencing date was
set.
   Prosecutors contended Melton posed as a cab driver in New
Orleans Feb. 14 and persuaded Marjorie Cox, 35, of Highlands, N.C.
and a male companion to let him give them a ride to Gulfport.
Melton was not driving a cab, however.
   Melton took the witness stand in his own behalf Tuesday and was
cross-examined by prosecutors Wednesday morning.
   Melton testified that he tricked Cox's companion into getting
out of the car during the trip and was driving alone with Cox when
she jumped out and was killed.
   Melton said he tried to convince Cox that he had no intention of
hurting her and was looking for a phone so she could get another
ride. Prosecutors said Melton had other motives and passed several
phones before she jumped.
   Melton said Tuesday, the second day of in his trial, his car was
traveling about 65 mph along Interstate 10 and had just passed a
tractor-trailer rig when Cox jumped and was killed by oncoming
traffic.
   Melton said he continued driving because ``I didn't think the
lady got hurt.''
   Police said Cox died after being struck by several vehicles. Her
body was found Feb. 15.
   Prosecutors say a Hancock County grand jury may consider a state
manslaughter charge in addition to the kidnapping charge.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Urges Probe Into Claims Of Tear Gas Misuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International, in a report for publication
Thursday, urged the Israeli government to investigate reports that
army misuse of tear gas in quelling Palestinian unrest has caused
``the deaths of men, women and babies.''
   The London-based human rights group said it was concerned the
gas, although made for use in the open air, ``has been thrown into
houses, clinics, schools, hospitals and mosques'' during the
six-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The gas ``has frequently been used in high concentrations in
residential areas where it can drift into people's homes,'' the
report said.
   Amnesty International cited seven cases in which Palestinians
ranging from five days to 57 years old died as a result of inhaling
tear gas, and said local doctors had reported more than 40 such
deaths.
   It said the U.S.-made CS and CN gases carried strict
instructions against their use in enclosed areas, and noted that
the United States last month announced it was halting their export
to Israel because of reports of their misuse.
   Eviatar Manor, an Israeli Embassy spokesman in London, said:
``Amnesty International reports are always studied carefully by the
Israeli authorities and once this report arrives in Israel it will
be given the usual serious study and an authoritative reply will be
forwarded to Amnesty International.''
   The organization cited reports from various sources that Israeli
soldiers were using tear gas not only for riot control but ``also
in such a way as to constitute a punitive measure, to harass and
intimidate Palestinian residents.
   ``The gas has sometimes been used at night as a punitive measure
against residents of villages or refugee camps who had clashed
earlier in the day with Israeli army soldiers,'' it said.
   ``It has been used when Israeli soldiers have been pursuing
demonstrators, often when they have taken refuge in hospitals or
near people's homes. There has been at least one case in which an
individual was deliberately shut in a room which was then sprayed
with tear gas,'' the report said.
   Amnesty International expressed concern that Israeli authorities
made no public statement condemning the use of tear gas in confined
spaces and that the Israeli army appeared to have made ``very few
investigations ... to ascertain whether there is any truth in the
allegations.''
   It also accused the Israelis of failing to inform hospitals of
the gases' contents and of ways to treat victims.

<HEAD>Noriega Denies Cuban, Libyan Soldiers In Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on
Wednesday again denied reports that Cuban or Libyan soldiers are in
Panama, saying his own armed forces have no need for them.
   Rumors of Cuban or Libyan troops in Panama have circulated here,
in Washington and elsewhere for more than two months, but U.S.
officials have tended to discount them.
   The latest report of armed Cuban involvement in Panama surfaced
in the United States earlier this week in a syndicated column by
Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. The writers quoted unidentified
intelligence sources.
   But Noriega scoffed at the report. He called alleged incursions
by Cuban commandos onto U.S. military bases near Panama City
earlier this year ``the phenomenon of the palm trees.''
   Panama's government-controlled press has long referred to the
incidents as the ``battle of the palms,'' claiming that U.S.
Marines shot at shadows and waving palm trees.
   ``There are no Cuban commandos, no Libyans or other foreigners
in this territory,'' Noriega said, ``because the (Panamanian)
Defense Forces do not need them.''
   Noriega spoke at the closing session of the Third Assembly of
Anti-Imperialist Organizations of the Caribbean and Central America.
   The more than 100 delegates attending the three-day meeting
adopted a resolution denouncing the ``aggressive and destabilizing
campaign of the Reagan administration against the people and
constitutional government of Panama.''
   Washington has been seeking Noriega's ouster since last fall.
The general, who is chief of the Defense Forces and Panama's de
facto ruler, was indicted on federal narcotics charges in Florida
earlier this year.

   Hanging from windows and balconies, perched
on trees and ladders and eight-deep on downtown sidewalks,
thousands of Lakers fans applauded basketball's world champions
Wednesday during a victory parade.
   The single-word headline in Lakers purple said it all:
``CHAMPS!'' splashed across the top of the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner in 2{-inch type, and the parade route was clogged with
vendors hawking T-shirts, pennants and hats.
   The Lakers, with a 108-105 victory over the Detroit Pistons in
Game 7 of the National Basketball Association championship series
Tuesday night, became the first team to win back-to-back titles
since the 1969 Celtics.
   Gia Neil of Panorama City, wearing one purple sock and one gold
sock and waving pompons, carried a homemade sign that read: ``Back
to Back, Mission Accomplished.''
   The traditional downtown parade in their honor drew more than
40,000 Laker lovers, most wearing hats, T-shirts or socks in bold
purple and gold team colors. Others carried signs, banners and
balloons, waved towels and munched on purple cotton candy.
   ``It's party time once again,'' Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson told
the cheering throng at City Hall. ``How do you like us now? Let's
do it again next year.''
   ``We've got the best team and God knows we've got the best
fans,'' said James Worthy, the most valuable player in the
championship game.
   Byron Scott urged fans to join him in chanting ``Repeat, Repeat,
Repeat,'' echoing cheers that rippled across the crowd as Mayor Tom
Bradley declared it Lakers Day in the city.
   Police spokesman Don Lawrence, who provided the crowd estimates,
described the crowd as well-behaved.
   Chick Hearn, the 68-year-old ``Voice of the Lakers,'' emceed the
rally. It was during a similar celebration last year that Riley
``guaranteed'' a repeat championship.
   Kevin Anthony, 33, of Long Beach waved a banner that matched his
shirt, shoes, armbands, hat, pins and towel while carrying his
8-year-old son, Kareem Jamaal on his shoulders.
   He said he was at the tribute ``to cheer. I love it. I've been
with them since 1980. We should have more next year and the year
after that.''
   His son was named after Lakers Captain, 41-year-old Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and former Laker Jamaal Wilkes.
   As the Lakers floats approached fans along the one-mile route to
City Hall, they were greeted by the slow clap, a team tradition.
Shredded paper rained on the players and they waved, passing to
cheers, hoots and hollers. The fans danced in the streets and
swayed back and forth to carry on another Laker tradition despite
the absence of music until they got to City Hall.
   The championship game drew a huge television audience, with the
final game seen in an estimated 20.2 million homes, according to
the Nielsen ratings.

   Michael Dukakis said Wednesday that Jesse
Jackson's lack of government experience did ``not necessarily''
rule him out for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and said
his search for a running mate would expand beyond people who have
been asked for background information.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis was endorsed by a former Democratic rival _
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, who dropped out of the race last
fall, before the primary season began.
   Biden quit amid allegations of plagiarism and puffing up his
academic record. Dukakis' top aide, John Sasso, resigned after
admitting to being the source of an ``attack video'' showing clips
of Biden giving a speech that had been largely lifted from from
British politician Neil Kinnock.
   At a Boston news conference, the Massachusetts governor was
peppered with questions about his search for a running mate but
offered little insight into the process.
   ``I don't think it's helpful ... to do it with press conferences
at the end of the driveway everytime you talk to somebody,''
Dukakis told a Statehouse news conference. ``We've just begun the
process.''
   Dukakis danced around repeated questions about whether Jackson's
lack of government experience and whether polls showing that
Jackson might hurt the Democratic ticket would affect his choice.
   ``I don't know that you have to have held public office to in
fact be qualified to be president,'' said Dukakis. ``It helps.''
   He said Jackson was under ``very serious consideration.''
   Later, pressed about whether he thought Jackson would be a
liability, Dukakis said:
   ``I'm not going to be checking a lot of polls, believe me. ...
We all have our strengths and our weaknesses.''
   According to sources, Florida Sen. Bob Graham and Jackson have
been asked to supply the Dukakis campaign with background and
financial information. Campaign sources indicated similar requests
were made of at least several more members of Congress, including
Ohio Sen. John Glenn and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn. Spokesmen for Glenn
and Nunn declined comment.
   One source said House Majority Leader Thomas Foley of Washington
was also among those being asked for background information but
another source said no decision had been made regarding Foley.
   One senator considered mentioned frequently as a possible
Dukakis running mate, New Jersey's Bill Bradley, said through a
spokesman that he had informed the Dukakis campaign that he was not
interested.
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's office said Tuesday that it had
not been asked to supply the Dukakis campaign with background
information.
   Dukakis answered with a quick ``no'' when asked if that meant
Bradley would not be considered. He added that Bradley, who has
said he is not interested in the vice presidency, ``has not told me
personally'' he did not want to be considered.
   But Bradley spokesman Nick Donatiello said that Bradley had
``made it absolutely clear, both publicly and privately'' to
Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas that he was not interested
in the No. 2 slot on the ticket. Brountas is heading the search for
Dukakis.
   ``He's absolutely unambiguous about this,'' Donatiello said.
   Dukakis was asked about a statement by Jackson's campaign
manager that his rival would not concede the nomination before the
roll call vote at the convention.
   ``It's over,'' Dukakis responded, adding: ``That's a decision he
has to make.''
   Dukakis continued to defend himself against certain Republican
nominee George Bush's attacks on a Massachusetts furlough program
that allowed for the release of a murderer who then escaped while
on furlough and raped a Maryland woman.
   Dukakis noted that he had since tightened eligibility
requirements for furloughs to exclude first-degree murderers and
that 45 states and the federal government have some form of
furlough system.
   He said Bush was focusing on the furlough-escape case because he
had no record of his own to promote on crime issues.
   Before the news conference, Dukakis attended a celebration
marking the graduation of the 50,000 participants in Employment
Training, a Massachusetts program that provides job training for
welfare recipients. He said the program had helped reduce the
state's welfare caseload by 35 percent in five years.
   ``I think of all the things that I've been involved in, ET is at
the top of the list,'' Dukakis said.
   He called the welfare reform bill before Congress a ``major,
major step forward,'' and took credit for job training provisions
he said were modeled after the Massachusetts program.

<HEAD>NTSB Says Cruise Industry Safety May Be Below Par</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety standards may not be stringent enough in the
cruise industry, the chairman of a federal agency investigating the
March engine-room fire aboard the Scandinavian Star said Wednesday.
   ``The cruise ship industry is generally not operated under the
U.S. flag. You do have visits by the Coast Guard, but those are
paper certifications,'' said Jim Burnett, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   ``There may not be sufficient safety standards,'' he said,
adding that his agency has probed fires aboard four cruise ships in
the past five years. ``The potential for loss of life is enormous.''
   The March 15 engine-room fire aboard the Star, carrying 439
mostly American passengers, was discovered by a crew member as the
ship returned from Cozumel, Mexico to its Tampa home port.
   Smoke detectors apparently failed, as did an automatic system to
douse flames. Also, the ship's emergency generators didn't work for
an hour, leaving the vessel without power in rough seas in the
Yucatan Channel, according to NTSB reports released as the agency's
three-day hearing opened here.
   ``Although there were no injuries or deaths, the failure of the
vessel's safety systems highlights the potential for a catastrophic
loss of life in this accident and future vessel fires,'' Burnett
said.
   The safety board will examine whether the existing Coast Guard
procedures and international regulations are adequate to protect
passengers or whether more rigorous standards are needed.
   Because the NTSB lacks regulatory authority and because cruise
ships are often registered outside the United States, he said his
agency can only make recommendations. These might have to be
followed up with congressional action or with new treaties with
nations where ships are registered, Burnett said.
   The 465-foot Star, operated by Miami-based SeaEscape Limited, is
registered in the Bahamas. Its engine room was badly damaged by the
fire, and there was smoke and water damage throughout the
17-year-old French-made ship, which has since been repaired.
   Burnett estimated damages at about $20 million, but SeaEscape
officials did not answer questions at the hearing.
   SeaEscape lawyer Nils Linfors Jr. vowed to challenge in court
the NTSB's authority to hold such public hearings as Wednesday's.
Atissue is that the board does not permit cross-examinations and
contentions that the Bahamian-registered ship is outside the
agency's jurisdiction.
   An NTSB report said the fire ignited when pressurized fuel
leaked from a line and sprayed against a hot engine exhaust
manifold. The leak continued for 13 minutes after the fire was
discovered, feeding the flames, the report said.
   Because smoke detectors apparently weren't working, Capt. Peter
Schaab said he had to send an officer to the engine room to confirm
there was a fire.
   Firefighting efforts were hampered when an automatic carbox
dioxide extinguishing system failed, and had to be operated by
hand. But the fire was contained to the engine room.
   ``There was no further spreading,'' said Schaab, who was praised
by Burnett for his 268-member crew acting quickly to move
passengers from ship discos, bars, shows and dining rooms. There
were no serious injuries to passengers or crew.
   NTSB records show that between September 1987 and February 1988,
there were at least six leaks in fuel pipes that feed the engines.
   The official analysis of the fire and any recommendations that
come out of the hearings will be adopted by the full NTSB board in
Washington later this summer.

<HEAD>Two Devices Detonated in Rare Nuke Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YUCCA FLAT, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two nuclear devices were detonated
simultaneously Wednesday in a rare experiment just 40 miles from a
tiny desert town where 33 Soviet scientists are preparing for a
historic series of joint nuclear tests.
   Unlike some larger tests that send shudders through highrise
hotels, Wednesday's blast was not noticed in Las Vegas, 85 miles
from ground zero.
   One of the tests was listed as a safety test, which is designed
to confirm that a nuclear explosion will not occur in case of an
accidental detonation of the explosive used to trigger the device.
   The test was conducted 40 miles from Mercury, Nev., the hub of
the Nevada Test Site where the Soviet nuclear scientists are based.
The devices were detonated at 7 a.m. in a 750-foot vertical shaft
drilled in Yucca Flat.
   The shock measured 3.1 on the Richter scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., according to
spokesman Waverly Person. A quake of 3.5 magnitude can cause slight
damage.
   Many previous tests have registered 5.5 and above.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said he felt ``very, very
slight motion'' at a control point 17 miles from ground zero.
   He said the devices tested Wednesday were ``very, very small''
and little ground motion could be expected away from the site.
   The two devices were listed as having a combined force of less
than 150 kilotons of TNT. Boyer said the exact size of each device
was classified information.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West said a check of DOE
records dating back to 1968 showed only one occasion when two
devices were detonated simultaneously, in September 1982.
   Soviet scientists are at the remote desert site to prepare for a
blast in mid-August that will determine the ability of the Kremlin
and the U.S. to measure the size of each other's nuclear tests.
   The devices detonated Wednesday are the sixth and seventh tested
this year at the Nevada site. Six of the Soviet scientists have
been at the Nevada site for three of those previous tests, with 25
arriving at Mercury Monday.
   The United States has 34 technicians at the Soviet test site
preparing for a joint verification experiment in Russia a month
after the U.S. test.
   Wednesday's test brought to 682 the number of devices tested at
the remote desert site since testing began in Nevada in January of
1951.

   How many ways are there to look at immigration?
Playwright Joanne Akalaitis has found a great many and written them
into ``Green Card'' as scenes and vignettes.
   It's interesting and well played by a versatile cast that keeps
switching accents and becoming new characters. But the production
doesn't build the way a play with a narrative line does. Impact
also is lessened because the evening has an over-all sense of
classroom learning about it.
   ``Green Card,'' first performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles in 1986, is now running at the off-Broadway Joyce Theater.
The play is part of the First New York International Festival of
the Arts and is the first entry in this summer's American Theater
Exchange at the Joyce.
   ``Green Card'' opens with Jesse Borrego as a stand-up comedian
specializing in racial-insult remarks. From that startling
beginning, ``Green Card'' moves to the expected _ a Jewish
immigrant at Ellis Island telling of Lithuania's pogroms, then
running a sewing machine in New York and finally proclaiming ``next
to work the most important thing is learning.''
   Dana Lee appears from time to time as a well-dressed Vietnamese
Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky, who says he went on the lecture circuit
because his agent told him that he'd only be good for a year. A
young woman lists events of her day as an illegal alien, cleaning
houses. A boy tells of being arrested as an illegal and of being
held and mistreated before deportation to San Salvador.
   Repeatedly, somebody says, ``He was a victim of spirits of this
country. Last night when he died he was watching the Incredible
Hulk.'' Light touches are inserted by two women who cross the stage
burbling Beverly Hills rich matron chitchat: ``He combines massage
with mantra.''
   Act 2 becomes much more heavy, with a history of Vietnam's
conquerors, a travelogue of Cambodia, faded Vietnam War films, a
lecture on the Latin American ``disappeared'' and torture methods.
   Miss Akalaitis seems in Act 1 to disparage the values of
Americans whose ancestors immigrated some time ago and to say that
America is better than the other countries she mentions in Act 2.
   The playwright, who also directed, developed her material over a
two-year period. With a Rockefeller Foundation
playwrights-in-residence grant, she lived among Hispanic,
Vietnamese, Salvadoran, Panamanian and Indo-Chinese immigrants in
Los Angeles. The daughter of immigrants, she grew up in a large
Lithuanian neighborhood in Chicago.
   The other actors in ``Green Card'' are Abraham Alvarez, Raye
Birk, Rosalind Chao, Pamela Dunlap, George Galvan, Jim Ishida,
Josie Kim, Alma Martinez and Jessie Nelson.

<HEAD>Mountain, Company Found Guilty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Houston political consultant and his
firm were convicted Wednesday of forging signatures on petitions
that put former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont on the state's
Republican Party presidential primary ballot.
   Jurors found the consultant, Rocky Mountain, and his firm,
Southern Political Consulting, Inc., guilty of 38 counts each of
misdemeanor forgery after about four hours of deliberations.
Punishment phase of the trial was to begin Thursday.
   Mountain, 27, allegedly masterminded a ``forgery party'' at
which workers signed phony signatures on petitions to put du Pont
on the March 8 primary, which was won by Vice President George
Bush. Du Pont withdrew from the race.
   Mountain, who testified he did not intend the petitions to be
submitted, faced a fine of up to $2,000 per counts and a year in
jail. The company faced a fine of up to $10,000 on each 38 count.
   Mountain said he was ``disappointed'' after the verdict but did
not comment further. Kevin Burnette, president of Southern
Political, declined comment.
   Martin testified Tuesday that he instructed temporary employees
to forge the signatures only as an angered reaction after a du Pont
official goaded him about the inability to get legitimate
signatures.
   ``Was there an intent to defraud or harm? I don't think so,''
Joe Bailey, Mountain's lawyer, said in Wednesday's closing
argument. He said Mountain told the du Pont official not to submit
the phony petitions.
   Du Pont and his campaign officials have denied any knowledge of
the forgeries and no one from the du Pont campaign testified.
   Prosecutor Casey O'Brien dismissed Mountain's claim that he did
not intend to deceive anyone.
   Charles Soechting, attorney for Southern Political Consulting,
told jurors the company was innocent because Mountain, though a
vice president of the firm, was working as a du Pont volunteer when
he masterminded the forgeries.
   Soechting also argued that Mountain and the firm were being
singled out for prosecution because they are not liked by Texas GOP
officials.
   The defense tried to show that supporters of Bush's presidential
campaign were upset because Mountain's firm helped organize a 1987
Houston presidential debate in which Bush did not want to
participate.
   Under Texas GOP rules, candidates needed 5,000 signatures to get
on the presidential primary ballot.
   Seven people testified during the trial that Mountain bought
them beer and showed them how to forge signatures at a Dec. 19
party.
   Mountain and the company also were implicated in possible
forgeries on petitions submitted for GOP presidential candidates
Sen. Robert Dole and Alexander Haig, but no indictments were
returned in those cases.

   The Pentagon corruption investigation focuses
on 75 to 100 defense contracts worth ``tens of billions of
dollars,'' the chief prosecutor told congressional leaders
Wednesday, and he said indictments might not be returned until
after the November election.
   ``A lot of individuals are involved and people will be shocked
when they hear all the information,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., after hearing from prosecutor Henry Hudson. ``It appears
they have very good evidence.''
   In another development, a major figure in the probe, Deputy
Assistant Navy Secretary James Gaines, is cooperating with
authorities by providing information, sources told The Associated
Press. Gaines' phone was tapped by the FBI as part of the
investigation.
   ABC News, citing sources it did not identify, said authorities
have made no deal with Gaines for lenient treatment in a possible
prosecution, but they expect that later.
   Hudson, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia,
made an unusual trip across the Potomac River from his office in
Alexandria, Va., for two closed-door briefings of House and Senate
leaders on the case which has caught Washington's full-time
attention.
   Hudson also said the investigation is pursuing three areas of
potential misconduct, chiefly involving the sale of inside
information by private consultants who were acting as middlemen
between the Pentagon and defense contractors, said House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   The prosecutor said it was possible no indictments would be
returned until after the Nov. 8 election.
   ``I'm hopeful that if indictments are appropriate in the case,
they will be secured by the end of the year,'' Hudson told
reporters. ``If we can proceed at a faster pace, we'll attempt to
do it.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said last week that he expected
indictments in 30 to 90 days.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said Hudson told the House group
that 75 to 100 contracts are under scrutiny in the 2-year-long
probe. The total value of the contracts is in the ``tens of
billions of dollars,'' Dingell said.
   Elsewhere, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in an
interview with The Associated Press, denied responsibility for
whatever corruption may be found by the investigation _ just as
President Reagan had one day earlier at a news conference in
Toronto.
   ``I had briefings regularly, once a week or every two weeks, on
the major weapons programs,'' Weinberger said. ``But no matter how
careful you are, you're not going to be able to eliminate
dishonesty.
   ``We need to keep a sense of proportion without jumping to
conclusions. The Pentagon awards 52,000 contracts every single day,
and inevitably there may be some faithless or dishonest people.''
   Weinberger headed the Defense Department at the time a private
consultant offered to sell confidential bid-related information to
a former Navy employee working for a defense contractor. The
ex-Navy man reported the incident to the Naval Intelligence
Service, touching off the investigation.
   Said Weinberger: ``You don't close a bank because there's been a
bank robbery. And you don't conclude that we don't need a strong
defense because of the actions of some faithless employees.''
   The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that
Weinberger wrote Meese a letter last August complaining about the
comments by then-Assistant Attorney General William F. Weld before
a House subcommittee about problems presented by the often close
relationships between Pentagon procurement officials and defense
contractors.
   In the Aug. 11, 1987 ``Dear Ed'' letter, Weinberger called
Weld's ``statement that military officials overlook infractions of
defense contractors ... most objectionable'' and a ``disservice to
the administration, to the Department of Defense, and to the many
men and women involved in Defense acquisition,'' according to the
Post, which obtained a copy of the missive.
   Weinberger added a handwritten postscript that said, ``Ed, we
are, understandably I think, very sensitive to charges such as
this.''
   At the time, Weld already was directing the investigation into
possible corruption in defense contract procurement. Weinberger and
Meese had not been told of the probe at that time.
   Reagan on Tuesday had said, ``It should be understandable how
such things can happen in something as big as our government is.''
   About Weinberger, Reagan said, ``I think he was one of the
finest secretaries of defense this country has had, and I think he
was doing all that he could to bring a national security out of
chaos, the kind that we inherited.''
   Meanwhile, Joan Galvin, 28, the daughter of a defense consultant
under investigation and an aide to Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla., was
relieved of handling military issues for the Florida congressman,
one of five members of the House whose names have come up in the
case.
   Hudson told the congressmen that none were implicated, the
members reported later, but, ``It was like pulling teeth to get
them to make this statement,'' said Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala.
   Ms. Galvin remains on Ireland's staff as a legislative assistant
dealing with labor, tax and veterans matters, among other things,
said Doug Hattaway, Ireland's spokesman.
   Hattaway said the congressman and Ms. Galvin agreed it would put
her in an ``untenable position'' to continue dealing with military
affairs since her father, William Galvin, ``is a principal in the
investigation.''
   William Galvin's offices and those of his stepson, Ken Brooke,
were searched eight days ago, when the FBI conducted searches
across the nation in pursuit of evidence of defense procurement
wrongdoing.

   USA Today reported in Thursday's editions that BDM
International, Inc. of McLean, Va., has been served with a subpoena
by federal agents investigating the case.
   Robert Bennett, a lawyer for the company, said the subpoena
demands any business records that may relate to probe suspects, but
said BDM was not a target of the investigation, the paper reported.
BDM employs Vicki Paisley, the wife of Melvyn Paisley, a key figure
in the investigation.
   Wright said Hudson indicated the investigation is focused on
three areas:
   _``The first involves the deliberate sale of proprietary
government information by consultants to individual corporations
and contractors;
   _``The second involves the manipulation of bid specifications in
ways to favor certain contractors over their competitors;
   _``The third involves indications of collusive bidding on the
part of individual contractors.''
   Wright said Hudson said that ``no subpoena has been sought for
any member of Congress, no wiretap has been directed at any member
of Congress and no search warrant has been directed at any member
of Congress.''
   Five House members have been reported as being under scrutiny,
although all have said they aren't involved.
   The five are Reps. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the House
Appropriations defense subcommittee; Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.; Samuel
S. Stratton, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Armed Services
procurement subcommittee; and Roy Dyson, D-Md., and Ireland, both
members of Stratton's subcommittee.
   Before meeting with Hudson, Wright had criticized leaks naming
the House members.
   ``I think it's thoroughly outrageous that people would be
leaking statements that (are) thoroughly untrue, absolutely
unfounded,'' he said. ``I don't think it is in any way honorable
for members of the executive branch ... to maliciously leak the
names of innocent members of Congress with the expectation they can
start rumors. ...
   ``The rumors are deliberately planted, it appears, and without
foundation and it is a despicable thing, in my opinion,'' the
speaker said.
   Wright did not say who he thought planted the rumors.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten agreed with Wright,
saying in an interview: ``We too find that practice to be
completely unacceptable. It is not only unfair for anyone's name to
be dropped, but it is completely against Justice Department
procedures. We absolutely condemn any such action.''
   Meantime, the Pentagon said in a statement that former Navy
Secretary John Lehman Jr., had not been briefed on the
investigation, which was started by the Naval Investigative Service
in September 1986.
   ``When he was still in office, the scope of the investigation
did not indicate that it was necessary to brief him,'' the Pentagon
said in a statement. ``Only later did it become clear that the
matter warranted the attention of the secretary of the Navy.''
   Lehman resigned his post and returned to private industry in
April 1987.
   One of the wiretaps recorded a conversation that can be
interpreted as suggesting that Lehman warned his former Navy aide,
Melvyn Paisley, about the investigation, according to sources who
would speak only on condition of anonymity.
   Paisley also quit in April 1987 and quickly was hired as a
consultant by a number of major defense contractors. Paisley has
emerged as a key figure in the investigation.

   The meeting may also show whether Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand of France, who will become the first leader ever to

   Shuttle Discovery traveled just
1,000 feet in 25 minutes, from one hangar to another. But it was a
major step toward the first space shuttle flight since the
Challenger disaster 2{ years ago.
   Tuesday's move to an assembly building ended 600 days during
which Discovery underwent an extensive overhaul of many of its
systems in a hangar.
   Hundreds of space workers applauded as a tractor towed the
gleaming white and black shuttle over the short route. Today, they
were to begin joining the 80-ton vehicle with its external fuel
tank and two 126-foot solid fuel booster rockets.
   ``This is like a rebirth,'' said Discovery flow director John
``Tip'' Talone. ``We're in business again and we're going to stay
in business. It's got to be a tremendous boost to the workers
here.''
   The mating of the spaceship with its tank and boosters is
scheduled to take nine days. Discovery then will be transported to
Launch Pad 39B to be readied for launch. The latest launch date is
Sept. 3, but National Aeronautics and Space Administration
officials said it is still possible to achieve a late August
liftoff.

   In the past few weeks, merchants have imported 2,400 tons of

   In addition, about 40 barrels inscribed ``Cairo Oil'' and
containing suspicious-looking pink and gold powder were discovered

Tabarjah in the north.
   It was not clear where the barrels came from.
   The discovery of the mystery barrels sent shock waves through

   Nadezhda Nuzhnaya will bid her son and
husband goodbye Thursday and board a train for Moscow. This month,
the woman who paints tea sets for a living is one of the 5,000 most
important people in the Soviet Union.
   Ms. Nuzhnaya, 36, has been chosen to represent her fellow
Communist Party members in the northern Ukraine at a national party
conference, the first in 47 years, that will pass judgment on a
program designed to make Soviet political life more democratic.
   ``This will be one of the most important events in my life,''
the shy woman, a party member since 1978, said in an interview.
``But it will also be an important event for every Communist, for
every citizen of our country.''
   Mrs. Nuzhnaya, whose candidacy was supported by co-workers in
the porcelain factory where she has worked for 19 years, is one of
the winners in a Soviet electoral process unlike any in recent
memory, but whose choices often seem to differ little from past
party elections.

<HEAD>50th Anniversary of Nazi Exhibit on Banned Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Hungarian composer Bela Bartok
found out in 1938 that his works were not included in a Nazi
exhibit on ``degenerate'' music, he protested to German authorities.
   Bartok, an opponent of racism, wanted his works included in the
show because he did not want to be seen as favored by the Nazis,
even by implication.
   This incident is related in an exhibit compiled by two West
German music experts, re-creating the 1938 Nazi display. The
exhibit was in Zurich through June 30, then moved to West Germany.
   The 1938 Dusseldorf exhibition, part of a larger Nazi music
festival, condemned atonal music, jazz and works by Jewish
composers as ``un-German.''
   It did not draw large crowds and was not really a propaganda
success, according to the Zurich exhibit. Jazz, for example,
remained popular despite being formally banned in the Third Reich.
   But the exhibit shows how Adolf Hitler tried to dominate the
arts in an attempt to keep them purely German and Aryan.
   In music, this translated into anti-Semitism and anti-modernism
that led to the banning of works by such composers as Felix
Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Giacomo Meyerbeer and Jacques Offenbach.
   Conservative Germans had already displayed anti-Semitic musical
tastes in the 1920s, partly due to jealousy of the success of those
composers, the exhibit says.
   They also hated what they considered ugly music, a prime example
being Arnold Schoenberg's 12-tone system, or atonalism, a modern
system of harmony in which there is no key.
   Atonal music was viewed by conservatives as a musical equivalent
of ``Bolshevism and Jewish internationalism,'' the exhibit says.
The 1938 catalog put it this way: ``Atonality signifies
degeneration.''
   The exhibit includes scores by Schoenberg and Paul Hindemith,
who were considered two of Germany's best and most daring new
composers during the Weimar Republic, which preceded the Third
Reich.
   The caption from the 1938 exhibit describes them as ``the most
dangerous destroyers of our popular and racial instincts for clear,
pure, real and organic'' music. It branded them ``international
rootless charlatans.''
   Also described as degenerate and ``frivolous spiritual-artistic
Bolshevism'' were works by Kurt Weill, who collaborated with
Bertolt Brecht on ``The Threepenny Opera,'' and Austrian-born
Jewish composer Gustav Mahler.
   ``Unfortunately, German musicologists seemed in large numbers to
tolerate or even approve the defamation and ban on `degenerates,'''
the catalog says. ``There were no clear public protests, though
these would not have been possible anyway.''
   Many musicians fled Germany to escape persecution, including
Schoenberg and Weill, who went to the United States.
   During the war, banned music was broadcast to Germany on
shortwave by the British Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of
America. At the exhibit, visitors can listen through headphones to
some of those programs, and to other selections including speeches
by Hitler and Richard Strauss' 1936 Olympic music.
   Strauss is an example of the dilemma facing non-Jewish German
musicians at the time. In February 1934, he was appointed head of
the newly created Reichsmusikkammer, or music department, which
Hitler set up to try to control German musical development.
   Strauss was distrusted by the Nazis because of his collaboration
with Jewish librettist Stefan Zweig, but they accepted him because
of his worldwide reputation. Strauss took on the post because he
liked the idea of organizing German musicianship into a single
unit. But he was forced to resign a year later, after the Gestapo
intercepted a letter he wrote to Zweig criticizing the Nazis'
anti-Jewish policy.
   Strauss continued to conduct at Third Reich musical events,
however, including the 1936 Olympics and the opening of the 1938
music festival, the Reichsmusiktage, that included the degenerate
music exhibit.
   But his fall from favor continued, eventually prompting party
chancellor Martin Bormann to instruct the Nazi press in 1944 not to
celebrate Strauss' 80th birthday because he had ``failed seriously
in his duty toward the requirements of the German community.''
   As the exhibit says, the Nazis could never explain why, despite
their theory of a ``superior Aryan race,'' so much great music was
written by Jews.
   And some opposition did exist. Friedrich Blume, a professor in
Kiel, questioned the Nazi's racial purity theory, writing in 1938:
``All the music which we know and understand grew from different
nationalities and is therefore racially mixed.''

<HEAD>Smoking Not an Issue in Zimbabwe where Tobacco Kindles Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds, dollar figures are U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When one of Harare's main hotels banned
smoking at selected restaurant tables last year the local
anti-smoking lobby hailed it as a breakthrough.
   But the no-smoking signs were soon removed when free-spending
foreign tobacco buyers threatened to boycott the hotel.
   While government and private agencies vigorously crusade against
public smoking, the tobacco industry is a king-size earner of
export income for Zimbabwe, formerly the British colony Rhodesia.
   Anti-smoking lobbies here concede their efforts have not become
a burning issue at a time when smoking in public is being stubbed
out in many parts of the world.
   ``Our lobbying is gaining little ground because of the economic
importance of tobacco and because people are not aware of the
dangers,'' observes Kindness Paradza, research officer at the
privately funded Zimbabwe Consumer Council. ``One of our main aims
is to stop children from smoking.''
   ``We are very much affected by the anti-smoking campaign,'' says
Maurice Rooney, chief executive of the Tobacco Industry Council
(TIC), the umbrella body for private companies in Zimbabwe. ``Every
cigarette not smoked simply means less business for us.''
   Rooney, a non-smoker, sits at a desk with a calendar published
by the Montreal-based Smokers' Freedom Society featuring cartoon
caricatures of great men in history puffing on cigarettes and
cigars _ among them Winston Churchill, Sigmund Freud, Orson Welles,
Oscar Wilde and Vincent van Gogh.
   Official statistics offer a clue to the importance of tobacco in
Zimbabwe, the world's third biggest exporter.
   The annual crop of 100,000 ton earns 22 percent of all export
income, accounts for 12 percent of the gross domestic product and
keeps a tenth of all employed Zimbabweans in jobs, from pickers on
the tobacco farms to sales teams that travel the world.
   The industry also pumps $24 million annually in excise duties
into the state coffers, revenues that help finance the socialist
government's education and health programs.
   While President Robert Mugabe discourages smoking in his
presence he boosted the 900 full-time commercial growers' morale
when he officially opened the $10 million-Willowvale auction
complex in Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, two years ago.
   ``When we were growing up our parents ... and teachers forbade
us to smoke,'' Mugabe said. ``But one thing they never said was,
`Don't sell tobacco.' If we sell it we must grow it as well. It is
our industry, and we must support it.''
   The World Health Organization, which spearheads global
anti-smoking campaigns, takes a back seat in Zimbabwe. ``We don't
get involved in that sphere,'' a WHO spokesman said in Harare.
   Private tobacco companies routinely spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars each year promoting sporting events, including soccer
clubs in poor black residential areas.
   The industry also helps fund the local Cancer Association, an
independent organization, to the extent that it recently decided
against pressing for a national symbolic no-smoking day.
   Smoking is banned in cinemas and theaters, but for safety not
health reasons.
   One restaurant in Harare reserves four tables for non-smokers.
   But cigarettes are permitted on public buses, the state airline
and even in some doctors' waiting rooms.
   While lobbies caution on radio, television and in newspapers
about the reported hazards of smoking, local manufacturers
advertise freely in the media and are not required to carry health
warnings on cigarette packs.
   Researchers estimate that half of the men in this country of 8.2
million people are smokers who pay about 50 cents for packs of 20
cigarettes. But they consume only 2 percent of all tobacco grown in
Zimbabwe.
   About half of all tobacco exports are sold to European countries
where manufacturers fear tougher curbs coupled with a growing
anti-social stigma toward smokers will shrink the market.
   As a result, the exporters are looking more to Africa and the
Far East to keep sales up.
   ``If every Chinese smoked one more cigarette a day,'' says
Jeremy Webb-Martin, president of the Tobacco Trade Association,
``our problems would be over.''

<TEXT>
   At Workers Hotel No. 6 near the Ursus
tractor plant on the outskirts of Warsaw, men mill in the lobby or
sprawl lazily on couches in their small rooms watching television.
   Girlfriends may visit until 10 p.m. and one movie theater is in
the district, but for the most part the men have little to do,
especially on a salary the equivalent of about $100 a month.
   These are young, single Polish workers trapped, they say, with
virtually no chance for upward mobility in what was supposed to be
a workers' state _ frustrated not only off the job but by the
tedium and low pay on the job.
   For Poland's communist authorities, they are a tinderbox.
   Thousands of Ursus workers live in hotels like Workers Hotel No.
6 or small privately rented rooms because of the shortage of
apartments in Poland.
   ``You have to be very strong psychologically to avoid
drinking,'' said one of them, 20-year-old Mariusz Szulecki. ``For
some, it's the main recreation.''
   At Workers Hotel No. 6, five men cram into a two-room suite,
sharing a small kitchen and bathroom. The building is modern and
clean, but the conditions are like those of a college dormitory.
   During a wave of labor unrest across Poland April 25-May 10,
activists of the banned Solidarity trade union said they were
surprised by the militancy of younger workers who rallied to the
strike actions.
   Zbigniew Bujak, a dismissed Ursus worker who led the national
underground of the banned Solidarity union during the martial-law
years in Poland of 1981-83, describes the life of the young workers:
   ``First of all, they are not paid enough to make a living. They
can't afford even a bicycle. ... They would have to pay the entire
monthly salary to buy a normal, good bicycle. They can't even dream
about buying a motorcycle, unless they get some big money from
their parents in the countryside. ...
   ``They can't see any chance of getting an apartment. They mainly
drink. When I ask them, `Well, how long are you going to keep
getting drunk?' they say: `What else can we do? What can you
suggest? We have no chances.'''
   Bujak added that workers are demoralized by inefficiency in the
factory and embarrassed by the shoddiness of the goods they are
told to produce.
   ``They feel that if we are supposed to be making changes, then
we should change everything. Only then can they see the chance for
them to mean something in this country.''
   The assessment is shared to some extent by Alfred Miodowicz,
member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers Party, as the
Communist Party is called, and the leader of the officially
recognized All-Poland Trade Union Alliance.
   ``We, unfortunately, are losing these youths,'' he was quoted as
saying in a recently published interview in the weekly Przeglad
Tygodniowy.
   ``A big group is growing of impatient people. ... They want to
act. They are full of determination. ... One has to create a chance
for them.''
   Official trade unions launched after the banning of Solidarity
have tried to provide an outlet for the frustration. Though still
derided by Solidarity activists as subservient to the authorities,
the unions in recent months have spoken out for higher wages and
better housing.
   Membership in official unions nationwide is about 7 million,
compared to Solidarity's 10 million in 1981.
   In an evening's conversation, four Ursus workers active in
unofficial organizing activities at the plant spoke about the poor
pay, lack of housing, lack of efficiency in the plant, a feeling
that they have no future.
   ``Thinking about marriage, about families, is out of the
question,'' said Henryk Tachasiuk, 26. ``The wages provide a
vegetation existence for one person, and it spoils life for me and
my girl.''
   He added that if he and his girl got married, they would have to
continue to live separately because he could not find an affordable
apartment.
   ``To get married just to be married makes no sense, so we are
all bachelors.''
   The workers said they have trouble earning enough for stereos or
television sets.
   The tiny Polish Fiat 126 _ designed as the car for the common
man when the government started producing it in the 1970s _ is now
for them the ``utmost dream.''
   At the plant, ``there is no organization at all,'' said
28-year-old Marek Jarosinski.
   He said his department is idled in the first two weeks of the
month by lack of materials.
   ``In the second half they will bring them, and we will have to
make it up by the end of the month.''
   Only about a third of the plant's 14,000 workers are directly
involved in production and one-fifth are in administration and the
rest are ``supporting personnel,'' said Tachasiuk.
   ``Our work has to provide for all these clerks,'' he said.
``It's discouraging.''
   Nevertheless they stay on, basically because they have no place
else to work. Ursus is one of the country's biggest factories and
the men said they don't think the situation is any better at other
plants. The only option would be to emigrate.
   ``To quit the job means to ask for a passport,'' said Tachasiuk.
   Jarosinski said he wants to stay and try to change things, even
if it means suffering defeats like workers in past years.
   ``Every generation gets its whipping, at least in our country,''
he said.
   But Tachasiuk conceded, ``It's a dream of many young people to
leave and earn some real money. That's their only real chance to
get an apartment or a car.''
   During the April-May labor unrest there was an attempted strike
at Ursus, but it fizzled after a protest march through the plant
and a rally in a factory canteen. According to Bujak, older workers
were reluctant to join in and most of the would-be strike leaders
had been detained. Tachasiuk said another strike was certain.
   ``There will be one and probably soon. Definitely this year.''
   The four said virtually everybody in the plant feels as they do,
and that workers join the official union only because it controls
benefits ranging from vacation facilities to day-care services and
waiting lists for housing.
   Asked if government attempts to reform the economy and
authorities' stated desire for dialogue would change their outlook,
the workers were skeptical.
   Said Zbigniew Budukiewicz, 29, who has been working at Ursus for
seven years, ``The greatest enemy of the people's government is the
working class.''

<HEAD>New Rules in Prospect for Home-Equity Loans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires. John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

   Congress appears close to passing legislation
designed to take some of the potential pitfalls out of the business
of borrowing on the equity in a home.
   But even with a consumer protection measure on the books,
prospective home-equity borrowers will need to proceed with caution
before they commit themselves to a deal.
   Home-equity loans have become a financial boom town of sorts
over the past couple of years, thanks in part to changes in the
nation's tax system.
   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, federal income tax deductions
for interest on most forms of consumer borrowing, such as on credit
cards, is being phased out. By contrast, interest on up to $100,000
borrowed against a taxpayer's house can still be deducted.
   Total equity loan balances grew from $20 billion at the end of
1985 to $64 billion at the end of 1987, according to the American
Bankers Association. A further increase of 40 percent has been
projected for this year.
   As in any booming new market, the potential for excesses and
abuses runs high.
   A bill passed by the House is aimed at cracking down on what one
congressman called ``carnival-type advertising'' that features
artificially low initial interest rates on adjustable-rate loans.
   Among other things, it also would restrict lenders' ability to
demand a speedup of repayments or reduce arbitrarily the amount of
credit extended.
   The House bill must still be reconciled with legislation
approved earlier by the Senate. So the measure in its final form is
not yet ready for scrutiny.
   Whatever it provides for, however, financial advisers say a good
deal of the responsibility will still fall on individual borrowers
to make certain they are making a sensible move.
   The typical home-equity loan setup is a line of credit that can
be tapped at any time by simply using a credit card or writing a
check.
   This can plainly be a handy and useful arrangement, allowing you
to borrow only as much as you need when you need it. Furthermore,
since they are backed by a property of known value as collateral,
the loans usually come at relatively low interest rates.
   But the cost of borrowing this way can be higher than it looks.
Depending on the lender, fees may be charged when you open the
account, when you borrow on it, or even when you don't borrow on it.
   That last is called an ``inactivity fee.'' If a lending
institution has agreed to make credit available to you, it doesn't
want the money to sit there for extended periods of time earning no
interest.
   ``Be sure high annual fees and other costs do not outweigh the
tax advantage of the home equity loan, especially if you are
borrowing only a small amount,'' advises the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants in a ``consumer's guide'' booklet it
has published on the subject.
   If the loan comes with an adjustable interest rate, the rules
already require that the lender set a specified cap, or maximum
rate. The House bill would require the lender to calculate changes
in adjustable rates on the basis of some interest-rate index that
it doesn't control.
   The AICPA also urges borrowers to evaluate carefully how they
expect to pay off a home-equity loan, both principal and interest,
and to have a contingency plan for a sudden change in their
circumstances such as the loss of a job.
   The institute also sounds the by-now-familiar, but still
important, caution that home equity shouldn't be put at risk for
purchases that have no lasting value.
   Single copies of the AICPA booklet are offered at no charge to
those who request them by writing the AICPA Order Department, P.O.
Box 1003, New York, N.Y. 10108-1003.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer Aaron Spelling said when he made his
first series pilot deal with NBC, he had no idea how to get there
to sign the contract.
   ``I didn't know how to get to Burbank and NBC,'' joked Spelling,
who, until recently, had an exclusive contract with ABC since 1970.
   Spelling, the prolific producer of such hit shows as
``Dynasty,'' ``Hotel,'' ``The Love Boat,'' ``Fantasy Island,''
``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Family,'' did find the offices of NBC,
and the welcome mat was out.
   ``They led me to the elevator, and when it opened (NBC
Entertainment President) Brandon Tartikoff was inside,'' he said.
``They had a band playing `Yellow Rose of Texas,' in honor of my
home state, a red carpet and a banner saying, `Welcome to NBC.'''
   The deal Spelling reached with NBC was for a possible series,
``Nightingales,'' about a group of young nurses in training. The
two-hour pilot will air Monday. It stars Mimi Kuzyk, Susan Walters,
Britta Phillips, Chelsea Field, Kristy Swanson and Galyn Gorg.
   Spelling has also produced a theatrical movie, ``Satisfaction,''
financed by NBC.
   ``The idea for the series was young student nurses who come to a
big city hospital for training,'' he said. ``It's very hard to
recruit nurses, so each student has a secret reason why she wants
to become a nurse. Brandon even suggested one of the secrets. He
suggested Chelsea Fields for a role. He participated in virtually
every meeting. I was amazed at his hands-on participation.
   ``Once we got the go-ahead we had to work around the clock
because of the impending writers' strike. The second draft was
delivered on a Saturday. The writers struck on Monday.''
   Susan Walters was an actress he had released from ``Hotel'' to
star as Priscilla Presley in the movie ``Elvis and Me.'' She had an
agreement to return to ``Hotel,'' which has been canceled, or do a
pilot.
   Another casting suggestion came from Spelling's 15-year-old
daughter, who saw Kristy Swanson in ``Flowers in the Attic'' and
insisted he had to see her.
   ``This is a show that's aimed at young people,'' said Spelling.
``It will be a serial. It would be difficult to schedule.''
   Although all the secrets are revealed in the movie, there are
unresolved questions that would fuel a series.
   The future of the series depends on the reception the show gets.
A couple of cautionary signals _ NBC is airing the show in the
summer at a time of low ratings and, as the air date drew near, no
review tapes were being made available.
   Spelling currently has two series on the air, ABC's durable
``Dynasty'' and ``HeartBeat,'' a midseason replacement that did
well in the ratings and is on the fall schedule.
   ```HeartBeat' is the first time I ever did a medical show,'' he
said. ``It's a very realistic show. People sent us letters with
money to help keep the show on the air. That hasn't happened since
`Family.' `HeartBeat' deals with unique medical problems.
`Nightingales' is sheer entertainment. It deals with medicine, but
there isn't a life-and-death case every few minutes.''
   Spelling said he has a series commitment at NBC, but he doesn't
know yet whether it will turn out to be ``Nightingales'' or another
show. He also has a deal with ABC for five more series and with CBS
for one series.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. plans to have ``Angels '88,'' a new version
of ``Charlie's Angels,'' on its schedule next season, but it has to
wait until the writers' strike ends.
   Spelling said he has also been approached by Ted Turner, the
Atlanta entertainment entrepreneur, about doing some shows for
Turner Broadcasting.
   And Spelling has a movie for CBS called ``Day One,'' which tells
of the Manhattan Project and the first atomic bomb dropped on Japan.

<HEAD>Looking For A Bargain Vacation? Get Packing!</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bargain vacation this summer doesn't
necessarily mean pitching a tent at a nearby campground or driving
out to see Grandma in Florida.
   But it may mean packing in a big hurry.
   A growing number of discount travel programs has emerged in
recent years, offering travelers savings of anywhere from 5 percent
to 80 percent for exotic and not-so-exotic vacations worldwide.
   The catch is travelers have to wait almost to the last minute to
book these trips _ in some cases as little as three days _ since
they're buying distressed merchandise: deluxe or standard hotel
rooms left vacant from late cancellations, leftover airline
tickets, cruise-ship cabins or tours.
   For annual fees ranging from $30 to $50, companies such as
Vacations to Go Inc. in Houston, Stand Buys Ltd. in Chicago and
Encore Marketing International Inc. in Lanham, Md., offer travelers
telephone hotlines listing several discounted trips, most broken
down regionally. Many also regularly mail newsletters and postcards
with other details.
   They say the average savings are about 30 percent to 40 percent.
Each has about 100,000 members nationwide.
   And about a year ago, Miami-based Eastern Airlines started an
11-city Weekender Club for those looking for short, last-minute
getaways. The carrier sends out a regional weekly ``travelgrams''
listing two- to four-day trips about a week in advance. The annual
fee is $100 for a single member and $175 per couple, but the
airline says most, if not all, that fee could be recouped after
just one trip.
   ``Essentially they're liquidators,'' said James V. Cammisa, Jr.,
publisher of the monthly newsletter Travel Industry Indicators.
``They liquidate perishable inventory for airlines cruise ships and
hotels and provide a service to the consumer who can plan on short
notice and effect the savings.''
   ``Once a ship sales away its empty cabins are valueless,'' said
Jackie Clarke, a vice president at Encore. ``Anything they can get
is better than nothing.''
   But experts say there are some drawbacks to investing in such
clubs, aside from the fact that the average departure dates are
about two weeks after booking.
   For one thing, tickets are rarely refundable. And the fast-paced
hotline messages can sometimes be a bit confusing.
   Callers often don't find out the suppliers' name until they make
reservations or contact the broker separately. (While airlines,
cruise ships, hotel and tour guides like to make money on otherwise
empty space, they don't like advertising these bargain-basement
rates.)
   Cammisa also warns, ``There's no exclusivity on bargains. The
thing that you need to make clear ... is that the inventory is in
constant change and subject to supply and demand fluctuations.''
   Sometimes, equally good bargains can be found through retail
travel agents who deal with ``air consolidators,'' companies that
purchase airline seats by bulk and offer discounts for advance
purchases, noted Ron Kurtz, senior vice president for Miami-based
Windstar Sail Cruises, who also is researching a book on affordable
vacations.
   ``The key to traveling today is shopping around and comparing,''
Kurtz said.
   Still, many consumers feel its worth investing in at least one
discount-travel club for the chance at a top-notch vacation at a
fraction of the normal price.
   Encore's Preferred Travelers-Short Notice Club, for instance,
recently offered an all-inclusive, seven-night trip to Jamaica from
St. Louis for an average $400 per person. It said the regular price
runs about $750 per person.
   Among the biggest supporters of these programs are retirees like
Dorothy and Kent Cox, of Austin, Texas, with plenty of time on
their hands for leisurely travel at a moment's notice.
   ``We traveled with some (non-member) relatives once ... on one
Caribbean cruise and their fare was at least 25 percent more than
ours,'' said the 64-year-old Mrs. Cox, a Vacations to Go member.
``I candidly told them that we were paying much less.''
   E. Gordon Seiler, a 61-year-old market planning manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in Atlanta, likes jetting off for long
weekends in different cities every three months. He said one recent
trip to San Francisco, booked through Eastern's club, cost $175
round trip. ``The cheapest (comparable) airfare I was able to find
was $268,'' he said.
   But Seiler concedes, ``You have to have a job that allows you to
pick up at a week's notice and you have to have freedom. I'm just
very flexible.''
   ``People think they're more flexible than they really are,''
said Vacations to Go President Alan Fox, adding that only about 10
percent of his company's members actually go on at least one
advertised trip a year.

<HEAD>Hispanic Theater Company Scores Big in San Francisco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 10 years, El Teatro de la Esperanza
toured the United States with a mission: to reach theater-starved
rural audiences and show middle America that not all Hispanics are
farmworkers.
   But the members of El Teatro decided their company needed to
change its focus and find a home where a regular audience could
appreciate its original, bilingual plays. The rag-tag theater
ensemble brought its act to San Francisco.
   Two years later, El Teatro has established itself as the only
professional Hispanic theater company in San Francisco and has
produced three plays, including its latest, ``Teo's Final Spin,'' a
pun-filled play that follows the misadventures of Teo from
collecting garbage to fumbling about in Nicaragua.
   ``We wanted to develop kind of a consistent audience that at its
core was Hispanic,'' said Rodrigo Duarte Clark, El Teatro's
artistic director.
   El Teatro set down roots in the heavily Hispanic Mission
District, the South-of-Market neighborhood filled with Latino
restaurants, car repair shops and liquor stores.
   Despite its success with a regular audience, El Teatro de la
Esperanza, or The Theater of Hope, has not completely abandoned
touring, because its members continue to feel a responsibility to
take theater to rural areas, mental institutions and prisons.
   Last month, El Teatro ended a six-week tour of ``Teo's Final
Spin'' to the Southwest and Midwest.
   Inside El Teatro's plain, small office in a three-story building
that also houses a day-care center, the 39-year-old Duarte Clark
fondly recalled his troupe's semi-annual treks to Del Rio, Texas,
where they always enjoyed good audiences.
   ``The reaction from the Latino audiences is appreciative,
because it's a rare thing,'' said Duarte Clark, a member of El
Teatro since 1973. ``It has a certain authenticity to it because
it's done by Latinos.''
   On the other hand, reaction from non-Hispanics sometimes ranges
from curiosity to confusion, because people outside the Southwest
may never have seen a play that portrays Hispanics as everyday
people, not just farmworkers or recent immigrants.
   ``In general, it opens up their vision of what Latinos are
like,'' Duarte Clark said.
   In 1970, El Teatro was founded as a student group at the
University of California-Santa Barbara. Five years later, the
nonprofit company moved toward establishing itself as a
professional theater group with full-time paid staff.
   Since the mid-1970s, El Teatro had mostly been a touring
company, making regular spring and fall tours throughout the
Southwest and Midwest. In some cases, the theater group took its
production abroad to various international festivals.
   In 1985, the company adapted Dario Fo's ``We Can't Pay, We Won't
Pay.'' Called ``No Se Paga? No Se Paga!,'' it was performed in
tours to San Francisco and Mexico.
   The following year, the theater group inaugurated its move to
San Francisco's Mission Cultural Center with a revised production
of ``Loteria de Pasiones,'' a bilingual play about an old woman's
memories of love and guilt, centered on the Mexican bingo game
``loteria.''
   Not everything has gone well for El Teatro since its relocation.
Financial woes have plagued it for years, and Duarte Clark pointed
out that company members are often forced to work several jobs to
keep productions going.
   Ruben Castro Ilizaliturri, an actor from Mexico City who joined
El Teatro in 1979, said that when the company first moved to San
Francisco, the facility where they were to perform was unfinished.
Company members had to work as carpenters to help complete
construction.
   ``Right now, we have to do everything _ direct, write, be
technicians, carpenters,'' he said. ``And that's hard.''
   The ideal situation for El Teatro would be the availability of
sufficient funds to allow the artists to concentrate on their work,
according to Duarte Clark.
   ``To some extent, financial limitations create artistic
limitations,'' said Duarte Clark, a UC-Santa Barbara graduate who
last summer directed El Teatro's production of ``Hijos: Once a
Family,'' which examined a troubled Chicano family.
   El Teatro plans to take ``Teo's Final Spin'' to San Antonio for
a July 8 show as part of the 14th annual Tenaz Festival of Chicano
Latino Theater.
   Booking manager Nancy Levidow said the play will return to the
San Francisco Bay area July 22, when it will appear at San Rafael's
Dominican College as part of the Performance at Forest Meadow
summer festival.
   Next spring, the company plans to produce two plays, ``La
Victima,'' a story about the immigration and migration of a Mexican
family in the United States, and ``La Cantata de Santa Maria de
Iquique,'' which deals with a miners strike in Chile that ended in
the South American country's bloodiest massacre.

<HEAD>10 Years After Bakke: Affirmative Action is Part of American Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Curtis Crawford, a black man, owes part of his success to
affirmative action _ a process that a decade ago denied Allan
Bakke, a white man, admission to medical school.
   Both men are symbols of the evolving struggle for racial
equality in America.
   Crawford, who runs a $3.5 billion annual program for IBM, says
affirmative action played a big part in his rapid rise to
high-powered executive with one of the nation's corporate giants.
But he says hard work and personal sacrifice were essential as well.
   ``IBM's commitment to affirmative action played a very major
role in providing a place for me to develop to my fullest,'' he
said. ``At the same time, I think I earned everything based on my
abilities. I put in a lot of hard work and pain.''
   In the 10 years since the Supreme Court first endorsed the
concept in the case of Bakke, a would-be medical student,
affirmative action has become even more of a fixture in American
society _ in private enterprise, in law and medical schools, in
local police and fire departments.
   But preferences based on race and gender remain highly
controversial, particularly fixed quotas that spark heated debate
over ``reverse discrimination.''
   The Supreme Court on June 28, 1978, ruled that Bakke, then a
37-year-old engineer, wrongly was denied admission to study
medicine at the University of California at Davis.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, said a fixed quota for racial
minorities at the medical school unlawfully excluded Bakke because
he is white. He had been passed over while less-qualified
applicants were admitted under a special program.
   But a different 5-4 alignment said colleges may consider race as
one factor in deciding who gets admitted.
   The Bakke case galvanized public opinion as have few legal
battles in the nation's history.
   But it marked only the start of a continuing debate on how far
the nation should go to redress past discrimination.
   Bakke himself has since graduated and become a doctor, while
studiously avoiding the limelight and declining to discuss his case.
   Bakke said he has been working as an anesthesiologist at the
Olmstead Medical Group in Rochester, Minn. for about the past two
years. He said the multi-speciality group is not associated with
the Mayo Clinic, where he took residency training beginning in
1982. Asked if he would consent to an interview he said, ``I just
really don't want to do it at all.''
   IBM executive Crawford started with the company 15 years ago,
about a year out of college.
   Today he is a vice president at the company's plant in Montvale,
N.J., in charge of marketing its line of new personal computers,
the Personal System II. Yearly sales are around $3.5 billion.
   Crawford, son of factory-worker parents and reared in what he
describes as the poor part of Joliet, Ill., is no friend of racial
quotas.
   ``I've never been in favor of specific numbers. That's not the
way to achieve equality,'' he said.
   He is a strong supporter of American institutions that
demonstrate steady commitment to equality by providing
opportunities for minorities and women to get ahead.
   ``We believe affirmative action makes good business sense,'' he
said. ``The company also is fulfilling its social responsibility.''
   Crawford is a symbol of the boon affirmative action can be to
middle class blacks, Hispanics, other minorities and women.
   On the other hand, civil rights leaders say it has failed to
ease spiraling unemployment that helps hold the nation's inner
cities in the grip of poverty, despair and drugs.
   The Reagan administration has fought a losing rear-guard battle
for the past eight years to restrict back pay or other compensation
in suits based on claims of affirmative action violations to
individuals who can prove they were victims of bias.
   The nation's highest court rejected that argument in a series of
cases. But fragmented voting among the justices and the advent of
new Reagan appointees on the court could mean an uncertain future
for affirmative action.
   In recent rulings, the court has embraced preferential treatment
for women and minorities in hiring and promotion. It even has
endorsed quotas, as long as they are narrowly tailored to overcome
proven past discrimination and do not trammel unnecessarily the
rights of white males.
   American business also has demonstrated support for affirmative
action, particularly big corporations and industry leaders like IBM.
   ``We're allowing people in this country to participate in the
economic process. It's well worth it,'' says Walton E. Burdick,
IBM's vice president of personnel.
   IBM began recruiting at black colleges in the early 1950s, and
Burdick emphasized the continuing need for long-term commitment.
   ``There has to be a sustained effort,'' he said. ``You can't
decide on Friday night to be a leader in the fight for equality and
be there Monday morning.''
   The National Association of Manufacturers, in its official
policy, regards affirmative action ``as an effective method of
achieving civil rights progress. Industry realizes that it is good
business policy to encourage and promote programs that enhance
minority and female participation at all levels within the
workplace.''
   Clearly defined legal standards for such preferences also can be
a bulwark against lawsuits by white males who believe they were
denied jobs or promotions unfairly.
   Still, many companies are reluctant to talk about their
affirmative action programs.

   Bakke's alma mater is one institution proud of its civil rights
record and willing to discuss it openly.
   ``We have actually a diverse class. We think it's of great
academic benefit,'' said Dr. Hibbard E. Williams, dean of medicine
at the University of California's Davis campus.
   After the Bakke ruling there was drop in minority enrollment for
five years at Davis. Minorities seemed to believe the school was
not for them even though college officials had defended quotas all
the way to the Supreme Court.
   Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, American Indians and other minorities
comprise nearly half of the enrollment at the medical school today.
There is no fixed quota, but recruitment of minorities is intense
and is intended to produce a model of the diverse racial make-up of
California.
   ``Students in general learn a great deal from their own
colleagues,'' says Williams. ``They get a more accurate view of
life out there _ from alcoholics to the destitute, aged individual
who is demented to the wealthy businessman with a heart attack.''
   The sentiment is hardly universal.
   Officials at AT&T recently were embarrassed by a white
supremacist group that called for the telecommunications giant to
phase out its affirmative action program.
   The proposal was supported by those voting 8.6 percent of the
company shares, while a counter-proposal to expand affirmative
action won 6 percent of the vote. Neither resolution will be
implemented since neither won a majority vote.
   Ironically, some resistance to preferential treatment is coming
from black executives and professionals, seemingly the leading
beneficiaries of these programs.
   The Wall Street Journal reported this month a growing exodus of
talented blacks from mainstream white businesses.
   Many are leaving to join black-owned businesses or start their
own firms, the newspaper said. Their reasons include social
polarization and discrimination at white-owned companies;
unrelenting pressure there to prove themselves; and a need to
demonstrate they can make it on their own without an
affirmative-action boost.
   Whatever the problems of black professionals, some civil rights
leaders say they are nothing compared to the growing ghetto poverty
that remains untouched by affirmative action.
   A commission on America's minorities reported last month that
the nation is moving backwards in efforts to achieve equality.
   The panel, which included former Presidents Jimmy Carter and
Gerald R. Ford, said 31 percent of blacks and 27 percent of
Hispanics were living in poverty, nearly three times the rate for
whites. Black unemployment is nearly triple and Hispanic
unemployment about double that for whites.
   David Ginsburg, who was executive director of the Kerner
Commission that reported on racial inequality 20 years ago, said
the nation needs to rededicate itself to an expanded vision of
affirmative action.
   It's impossible for the inner-city poor to escape poverty by
``pulling up their socks'' without outside help, he said. ``The
notion they can do it themselves I regard as a total absurdity.''
   On the positive side, one measure of growing equality in at
least some sectors of American society is the number of elected
black officials.
   There were only 200 holding office in 1965 _ a time when
exuberance over the civil rights movement was at its peak. By 1986
that figure had grown to 6,500.
   Blacks and other minorities also have made significant progress
in highly visible areas, ranging from the media and law enforcement
to business and the professions.
   Yet some controversial issues remain unresolved.
   While there may never be another case like Bakke's to rivet the
nation's attention, key aspects of affirmative action and alleged
discrimination will continue to be argued before the Supreme Court.
   The justices will examine the power of local governments to
require minority participation in public works projects. Supporters
of such local quotas note that the court in 1980 upheld the power
of Congress to require 10 percent of federal public works contracts
be earmarked for minority-controlled businesses.
   The court also has agreed to decide whether sexual stereotyping,
even if unconscious, is grounds for a finding of discrimination.
The case involves a woman denied partnership in a leading
accounting firm. She said she was discriminated against for not
behaving in a sufficiently ``feminine'' way.
   The court also has said it will explore anew the right of white
males to challenge court-approved voluntary affirmative action
agreements between public employers and minorities. The case
involves white firefigthers who say they were denied promotions
unlawfully by Birmingham, Ala., officials
   The cases are on the court agenda for the new term beginning in
October with decisions likely in 1989.
   The role of the newest member of the court, Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy, will be watched closely. He succeeded retired Justice
Lewis F. Powell, the man whose vote controlled the outcome of the
Bakke case. Powell also proved to be a pivotal figure in subsequent
affirmative action decisions by the court.

<HEAD>Conference on How to Teach College Students About World Hunger</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year later, the student's question still
disturbs philosophy professor Jeffrey Barker.
   ``Why do we have to study world hunger?'' the student asked
Barker, who teaches a course on ``Contemporary Moral Problems,''
including a unit on hunger, at Albright College in Reading, Pa.
``We've already solved that problem. We had `Live Aid.' It's no
longer in the news.''
   Barker's anecdote became a favorite at a conference on how to
teach undergraduates about world hunger held at Colgate University
this month. It drew 68 college professors from 50 schools in 21
states.
   The student's question also illustrated two sad truths. Apart
from attending benefit concerts like ``Live Aid,'' which sent
millions of dollars to starving African nations in 1985, American
students seem barely aware of world hunger and where and why it
occurs. And most colleges do little to end that ignorance.
   The conference enabled college professors to swap lesson ideas,
such as assigning students to spend only a dollar a day on food to
experience how poor people have to stretch their money.
   They also got firsthand reports on food problems and solutions
in Ethiopia, India and other hungry nations, presented by veteran
relief workers from eight religious organizations.
   Frank Conlon, program director for Africa with Lutheran World
Relief, showed how simple technologies are helping West Africans
survive: animal power harnessed for irrigation, cow manure turned
into natural gas to fuel stoves and lanterns, special ditches dug
to keep goats from gardens.
   Alan Berg, nutrition adviser to the World Bank, told of the
baffling insistence of Javanese mothers to nurse their infants only
with their left breasts, which commonly leads to malnutrition.
   Such hard realities of other countries' efforts to feed their
people seldom reach college classrooms in the United States.
   ``Step 1 is information _ many of my students don't even know
where these countries are,'' said Barker.
   ``Hunger at the college level is dealt with by taking walkathons
or swims. We've let hunger on campus but not in the classroom. We
want it in the official curriculum,'' said Monsignor Robert J.
Coll, executive director of Interfaith Hunger Appeal, a New
York-based umbrella organization representing Roman Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief services which cosponsored the meeting
with Colgate.
   The point of such courses is not to create legions of altruistic
student volunteers flocking to Third World countries. ``Hunger
field work is no place for amateurs,'' said Coll. ``It's expensive
and it's dangerous.''
   What's needed, said Coll and other conference organizers, is
activism steeped in knowledge of how U.S. corporate and
governmental policies affect hungry nations, sometimes for the
worse.
   ``I'm not training Peace Corps volunteers. I'm training citizens
of the world,'' said Gary Larson, himself a former Peace Corps
worker in Gambia who now teaches biology at Bethany College in West
Virginia.
   Such courses should also lead students and teachers to ponder
that universities may themselves be culprits in worsening world
hunger, said Jack Kloppenburg, a rural sociologist from the
University of Wisconsin.
   Kloppenburg gave an example: university and corporate
biotechnologists have collaborated for years to develop heartier
seeds for various crops, and they've often gathered rare varieties
from Third World countries. They claim such genetic resources are
mankind's ``common heritage,'' like the air we breathe, and resist
the idea that countries should be compensated for those resources.
But the companies eventually turn around and claim patent rights
and make hefty profits from the resulting products.
   ``It is hardly surprising that (less developed countries) see an
asymmetry _exploitation, gene robbery,'' said Kloppenburg.
   Conference participants stressed that the teaching solution
wasn't as simple as concocting new courses titled ``Hunger 101.''
Faculty members, especially younger ones with no tenure, could risk
their careers by pushing for courses that don't fit neatly into
academic departments.
   Larson said a course he's planning at Bethany College next
spring, which will examine nutrition around the world, may not earn
him favor at his school.
   ``I may now be looked upon as an oddball in my biology
department for teaching out of my field,'' he said.
   ``And the other problem is, how am I going to present the
subject of world hunger to kids who are paying $12,000 a year and
whom I'm supposed to be equipping for the jungles of New York or
medical school? I have to work this through, so as not to
overemphasize it, but to make students more aware of the world and
how to solve a problem,'' Larson said.
   There is no shortage of literature on hunger. The conference
displayed more than 100 books and a dozen periodicals on the
subject. But the plentiful information means little unless a
department head or dean backs a new course with time and money.
   Many agreed that world hunger lends itself to an
interdisciplinary approach: teachers from 22 disciplines were
represented at the Colgate conference, including social and natural
scientists, philosophers, geogragoal. It's mainly a question of whether
working with the hunger problem is a moral obligation, rather than
just charity.''

   Eight years ago, anyone living in
this community would have laughed at the suggestion that one day
there would be more people than available houses, more jobs than
people to fill them, more school children than classrooms to hold
them.
   But then came Honda.
   Since the early 1980s, the presence of Honda of America
Manufacturing Inc. _ the fourth-largest automaker in the nation _
and the arrival of its numerous suppliers have beefed up coffers in
14 Ohio counties, but nowhere more noticeably than here in Logan
County.
   ``Nobody knows what's going on here,'' said Leland Dorsey,
executive director of the Logan Area Chamber of Commerce. ``You
just have to come see for yourself. It's pretty unbelievable.''
   Bellefontaine, which is between the Honda auto complex in
Marysville and its engine plant in Anna and a mile or two west of a
new Honda auto plant under construction in East Liberty, is a prime
growth target, he said.
   ``We're becoming the center of Honda because of where we are,''
Dorsey said.
   Suppliers have begun moving in, and a new warehouse called Honda
Express, specifically aimed at warehousing parts for Honda, is
planning to open a 1 million-square-foot operation on the
Logan-Union County line.
   Honda's growth has caused problems, as well. This community of
11,500 at the beginning of the decade had enough housing to serve
its needs, but a recent survey showed the county was at least 2,200
units short of demand, Dorsey said.
   There is not an apartment to be had in the city, said Doug
Zimmerman of LeVan and Zimmerman Realty. Zimmerman said his office
gets about 20 inquiries about apartments every day.
   ``There isn't a one available. I've never seen anything like
it,'' he said. ``I was a farmer for 10 years before I got out of
it. I guess if I've made one right decision in my life, this sure
is it.''
   Although he would not say what has happened to the price of
purchasing a home, he said the number of listings the two LeVan and
Zimmerman offices in Logan County handle have soared.
   ``Honda buyers can now buy houses in the $60,000 to $80,000
range, whereas a few years ago they just couldn't afford that,'' he
said. ``This is a really exciting place to be right now. Builders
are in here every day looking for land, people are moving in. It's
a real seller's market. The sky's the limit.''
   But Dorsey said there are other problems. Even though
unemployment has dropped from an early 1980s high of almost 8
percent to around 5 percent, smaller employers are having trouble
filling lower-paying jobs because Honda and its suppliers pay more.
And traffic is becoming a problem.
   Logan County Sheriff Michael Henry says his 12 road officers
have seen a significant increase in traffic problems, vandalism and
drug trafficking as the population has risen.
   The construction of the new Honda plant and a projected county
population of 42,000 by 1990 _ up 9 percent from 39,155 in 1980 _
will create more patrol problems, he said. Population in the city
also has grown, In 1980, census figures show the count was 11,880.
Since then it has risen to about 12,500 and estimates show that it
could reach 13,500 by the end of the decade.
   The attitude in the Benjamin Logan School district on the
county's eastern border remains nonetheless optimistic. Once one of
the poorest school districts in the state, Honda's planned East
Liberty expansion will add $2.4 million into the district's annual
budget. The district's annual budget currently is $5 million, said
Anne Schrader, district treasurer.
   Officials who have watched Honda and other Japanese firms around
the state say Bellefontaine's attitude toward growth and the
Japanese helped make it grow.
   A study commissioned last year by the Institute for Japanese
Studies at Ohio State University cited Bellefontaine's
International Friendship Center, opened to help the Japanese and
other foreign investors learn American ways, as a model for other
communities hoping to attract foreign investment.
   The center, organized in 1986 and funded by churches, private
organizations and donations, assists Japanese families in the

<HEAD>Snapshot '88: Even With Family Aid, Bush Never Made It `Big Rich'
In Oil</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush arrived in Texas in 1947 with his
wife, his Studebaker and a job lined up by his investment banker
uncle. He learned the ways of the oil patch and helped establish
tiny Zapata Petroleum Co. Much later Zapata grew into the giant
Pennzoil Co., but Bush was long gone to politics. Here's a look at
Bush's years as an oilman.

   In 1952, a young oilman just getting his feet wet
in politics drew the task of arranging an airport campaign stop for
Richard Nixon.
   He set up a stage, decorated it, brought out a crowd. Then
George Bush stood in the back with his business partner, John
Overbey, as the vice presidential candidate spoke.
   ``Nixon said a few words when a couple of seedy-looking
characters started yelling at him and waving signs,'' Overbey
recalled. ``Bush took one look at them and tore over there. He
ripped up their signs and told them to get the hell out.
   ``He can be a pretty aggressive guy, you know,'' Overbey said.
   The vice president isn't known for such forcefulness in
Washington, but in the Texas oil patch, he is remembered as an
energetic businessman who headed West to make his mark in the
corporate world. He succeeded _ not only by quickly learning the
ins and outs, but also by relying on generous amounts of family
money for backing.
   The Republican presidential contender was known then _ as now _
as a ``team player'' who built decisions by consensus and was
considered a faithful friend.
   Bush, who went to Congress in 1966 tagged with the label ``Texas
oil millionaire,'' saw some risky drilling ventures pay off during
his oil career, but he actually left the wheeling-dealing days of
the 1950s West Texas oil boom with only modest success by local
standards.
   ``George made a comfortable amount of money out of it,'' said
his friend and one-time partner, Pennzoil Co. Chairman J. Hugh
Liedtke. ``It was a substantial sum, but he's not what in Texas is
called `Big Rich.'''
   At age 24, after a tour as a Navy pilot and three years at Yale
University, Bush decided against joining the family business,
investment banking. He wrote in his autobiography that he was
turned down for a job at Procter & Gamble and considered farming,
but thought it too risky.
   So he set out to make it in oil. He began as a trainee for an
equipment supply company in 1948 _ a job arranged through the
family and one that included long days painting scalding hot pump
jacks and pipe. He became an equipment salesman, moving from Odessa
to California then to Midland, Texas.
   It was there that he quit the company and went out on his own
with Overbey, a neighbor and pal from touch football games and
barbecues, in a venture called the Bush-Overbey Development Co.
   ``I was trading minerals and royalties. He decided he wanted to
get involved in exploration and he suggested he could raise the
money,'' Overbey said. ``We didn't set the woods on fire but we
stayed in the black for three years.''
   Bush and Overbey bought and sold portions of other firms'
projects instead of drilling their own wells. The financial backing
of $350,000 was arranged through Bush's uncle, George Herbert
Walker Jr., and the investors included Bush's father, Prescott, and
Eugene Meyer, owner of The Washington Post.
   After three years, Bush and Overbey decided to join forces with
Bill and Hugh Liedtke, who also had their own trading company. The
Liedtkes raised $500,000 in Tulsa, Okla., their hometown, Bush
raised $500,000 on the East Coast, and they named their venture
Zapata Petroleum after the famed Mexican rebel leader portrayed by
actor Marlon Brando in ``Viva Zapata!''
   The partners tried to be conservative, Liedtke said, and never
made a move unless all agreed.
   ``I think George has always been kind of a team player and I
think the rest of us were kind of that way,'' he said. ``When
you're young, you don't have enough sense to get scared.''
   Zapata's first play was a $1 million bet on one oil field. Hugh
Liedtke was convinced the oil under a series of six wells spread
across Coke County, Texas, was actually part of one huge source.
Zapata threw its entire $1 million into the Jamieson field, took on
$4.5 million in debt, and raised a second $1 million from the same
investors.
   For a time it seemed the company was imitating the movie _ it
wasn't clear whether Zapata was a hero or bandit. Then slowly but
surely, the Jamieson field came out a winner.
   ``We drilled around 130 wells and never got a dry hole,'' said
Liedtke, now a corporate legend who steered Pennzoil to an $11
billion court judgment against Texaco over Texaco's takeover of
Getty Oil.
   But the toughest business decision for the partners came when
they found they had to fire employees _ most of whom were also good
friends _ before the fields paid off. Bush often refers to that
painful experience on the campaign trail.
   Eventually, Zapata split. Bush and his East Coast investors took
over Zapata Off-Shore, based in Houston, and the Liedtkes and their
backers stayed in production.
   In Houston, the Bushes and their five children settled into a
comfortable lifestyle, although Bush at one point developed a
bleeding ulcer.
   ``Dad shielded us from his business activities,'' said Jeb Bush,
now Florida commerce secretary. ``He spent a lot of time away, and
when he was there, we didn't talk about business, we talked about
baseball and sports.''
   Bush moved up quickly in local politics, which were dominated at
the time by Democrats. He became Harris County Republican chairman
in 1962 and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1964. In
February 1966, he resigned as chairman of Zapata Off-Shore to wage
a full-time campaign for the House, and he won a seat in November.
   On his way to Washington, he sold his 6 percent stake in Zapata,
netting $1.1 million. Within 18 months, the Zapata stock, under new
management, took off, doubling in value. Liedtke's Zapata gave
birth to Pennzoil.
   ``If he had stayed in ... he could have made an enormous amount
of money if that had been what he really wanted to do,'' Liedtke
said.
   ``That was not his aim, I don't think. I think he wanted to
prove to himself and perhaps to others that he could, and once that
was accomplished, well, I don't think he was really interested in
it.''

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has revived the
Communist Party Conference _ last used by Stalin 47 years ago _ in
an effort to promote the ``perestroika'' reforms he wants. The
conference opening June 28 will be a testing ground for Gorbachev
and his ideas. Here is a report.

<TEXT>
   Forty-seven years after Josef Stalin dominated the
last Communist Party Conference, Mikhail Gorbachev is reviving the
forum in an attempt to break the party's chokehold on society and
wrest control from entrenched bureaucrats.
   The conference will provide a political arena for Gorbachev's
battle to modernize the Soviet Union, come to grips with the
Stalinist legacy and improve the living standards of the country's
284 million people.
   Selection of the 5,000 conference delegates shows how Gorbachev
has changed the political atmosphere and opened up new areas for
discussion. A stormy debate over alleged ballot-rigging sent
hundreds of demonstrators into the streets of Moscow and Leningrad
to protest the delegate-selection process.
   ``For the first time since before the First World War, and the
early 1920s, some of these things are being debated openly,'' one
veteran Western Kremlin watcher observed. ``That's really very
extraordinary.''
   Among the delegates to the 19th All-Union Conference of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be a substantial number
Gorbachev counts as opponents. And there are indications the
57-year-old party chief has scaled back some of the original goals
of the conference.
   Both Soviet and Western analysts have suggested that the
delegate-selection procedures, which by Soviet standards were
surprisingly open, enabled Gorbachev's conservative opponents to
gain enough seats to prevent implementation of radical measures.
   Gorbachev nonetheless is expected to open the proceedings
Tuesday in the Kremlin's glass and marble Palace of Congresses with
a call to limit the tenure of party officials and their authority
over the conduct of government and the economy.
   But as the first party conference since 1941 drew near,
Communist officials sought to dampen expectations that the
delegates representing the country's 20 million Communist Party
members would do more than debate a list of recommendations or
consider the personnel issues that could decide the fate of
Gorbachev's reform program.
   Some observers said Gorbachev may have decided, after watching
the delegate-selection fight, not to risk secret ballots on his key
projects.
   Thirty pages of theses put forward by the party's policy-making
Central Committee as a platform for discussion at the conference
bear the imprint of Gorbachev's own ideas.
   One theme that clearly emerges is the effort to come to terms
with and overcome the Stalinist past. The theses blame the late
dictator for stifling debate in the party, a ``vicious practice''
that continued through the rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   In calling for a limit of two five-year terms for elected party
positions, the proposals strike at the foundation of a system of
personal power and privilege built for decades by party officials.
   ``Some executives started thinking that they had been appointed
to their posts for life,'' the theses said. ``They considered
themselves infallible, abused power and neglected the interests of
rank-and-file party members and working people.''
   In its new role envisaged by Gorbachev, the Communist Party
would retain its dominant role in Soviet society but exercise its
power less directly.
   ``The Communist Party shall steer its political course via
communists working in bodies of state authority in all spheres of
society's life,'' the program said.
   Vladimir Kluyev, party leader of the Lenin district of Moscow
and a conference delegate, said the plan would leave day-to-day
management to government officials and economic administrators.
   But proposals to diminish the party's control over the
government and economy raise the question whether the party can
control strategic decisions if it gives up its authority to decide
everyday matters.
   Kluyev told reporters it is clear that ``no organizational
questions will be considered at the conference,'' indicating
Gorbachev will not attempt to cement his leadership position by
making major personnel changes, as Stalin did 47 years ago.

   Other party sources, however, speaking privately, said there may
be some new appointments to the 300-plus-member Central Committee
to replace officials who have died or retired since their election
at the last party congress in February 1986.
   But rules governing the rarely used party conferences are vague
and apparently give the leaders latitude to discuss what they want
at the conference.
   The way the conference is conducted will be one indication of
how open the Gorbachev leadership is prepared to be. Will
freewheeling debate be allowed and how much of the debates and
speeches be made public?
   Although Gorbachev will make a report to the conference, little
is known about who else will speak or how the meeting will be
structured. Soviet press reports indicate the opening and closing
sessions will be televised, and some official press reports of the
speeches and actions of the conference are expected to be published
after the fact.
   But most of the proceedings probably will take place in secret.
   When the conference was announced last June, it was assumed
Gorbachev would use the forum to attack resistance to his reforms
and sweep some of his opponents off the Central Committee.
   But some prominent Gorbachev supporters have been left off the
delegate slate as local party officials rammed through their
personal choices. The party hierarchy had to scramble early this
month to find spots for such well-known reformers as historian Yuri
Afanasyev and filmmaker Elem Klimov.
   Others, including outspoken editor Vitaly Korotich of the weekly
magazine Ogonyok, found safe seats from their home districts far
from Moscow after being denied slots from Moscow.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party chief who was sacked
after criticizing the slow pace of reform, was elected a delegate
from Karelia, a region bordering Finland.
   Economist Nikolai Shmelev, a leading proponent of radical
changes, and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, regarded as an
influential Gorbachev adviser, failed to be named delegates.
   Some reports circulating in Moscow predict Gorbachev will use
the conference to institute major economic changes to hasten the
impact of his modernization program known as ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring.
   Soviet consumers have yet to feel any major effects of three
years of talk about reform.
   For instance, some sources have said, Gorbachev may attempt to
win endorsement of a system that would permit families to lease
sections of collective farms from the state and sell their produce
back to the collective at prevailing prices. Such a step could have
a relatively quick impact on the country's notoriously inefficient
agricultural system that in recent years has forced the Soviet
Union to import food.
   Other sources anticipate some party statement on nationalities
problems, which have broken into the open in recent months as
Armenians have sought to claim a territory held for 65 years by the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   There also is unrest in the three Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
   Among those seeking the attention of the party conference to
redress grievances are a group that wants to build a memorial to
Stalin's victims and Crimean Tatars campaigning for restoration of
the homeland Stalin took from them to punish them for alleged
collaboration with Nazi forces in World War II.
   Otto Latsis, deputy editor of the theoretical journal Kommunist
and a conference delegate, said he sensed ``an expectation of an
instant miracle at the conference.''
   ``Common people, to some extent, expect that all the problems
that haven't been solved will be solved, and that there will be a
firm guarantee that perestroika will become irreversible,'' Latsis
said.
   But he added, ``I don't think that after three days of the
conference we are going to be in quite another world. We'll have a
better understanding of our progress on perestroika.''

<HEAD>Reagan's Forced Retirement Leaves Summit Club Leaderless</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The club of economic summitry is viewing with
apprehension the forced retirement of President Reagan, aware that
none of its remaining members can fill the void and uncertain about
who might.
   If seniority were the only key, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
might certainly be voted most likely to assume the summit
leadership. But she is clearly aware that taking the job requires
more economic wherewithal than her country has.
   The United States ``is the largest most prosperous nation in the
world, and let's be thankful she has taken a leadership role,'' the
three-term British leader said in a March radio interview. ``None
of us can substitute for it. We could all help with it.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand, the host of the 1989
economic conclave, has not shown any inclination to don the mantle
of world leadership. His country is not even a member of NATO's
military structure, although it does participate in the alliance's
political bodies, and his left-leaning economic policies are at
odds with those of the other allies.
   Japan, fast overtaking the U.S. economy in many ways, cannot
assume leadership of the summit seven; its markets are virtually
closed to the outside world, its ability to expand militarily is
limited by constitutional restraints and it is not a member of the
NATO alliance to which the other summit countries belong.
   ``There is no evidence of any country in the world anxious to
replace us in our leadership position,'' said Penelope
Hartland-Thunberg, an international affairs scholar at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ``The cost
and responsibility of leadership is something they wish to avoid.''
   Still, the economic decline that has turned the United States
from the world's biggest creditor in 1982 to its biggest debtor in
1988 has left a leadership vacuum begging to be filled.
   Even at this, his final summit, Reagan was unable to sway his
partners on his agenda priority _ the elimination of all
agriculture subsidies by the end of the century.
   The summitteers are hoping Reagan's successor can turn things
around.
   But the stakes are high, and many of the summit leaders would
prefer that Reagan be replaced with a known quantity like George
Bush, his vice president who has pledged to carry on the
president's program, said Simon Serfaty, an academic at the School
of Advanced International Studies of John Hopkins University in
Washington.
   This was underlined by the newest member of the summit club,
Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita, who emphasized to the other
leaders the importance of continuity in U.S. policy.
   ``Obviously, the current policy has been so successful, we want
to ensure it goes on,'' said an Italian official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Some of the other leaders feel a Republican like Bush also would
be more likely to maintain the free market policies that led to a
surge of prosperity in the summit countries during the Reagan
administration, said Serfaty.
   But the other presidential hopeful, Michael Dukakis, also
appears to be an economic moderate. In a broad-ranging foreign
policy speech recently, Dukakis stressed the importance of
cooperating with America's allies.
   Regardless of who wins the November election, Reagan has left
for his successor little maneuvering room, given the U.S.
indebtedness that resulted from his economic policies of deep tax
cuts and enormous military buildup.
   The heavy debt to Japan and other summit countries, growing
foreign investment and bulging budget and trade deficits virtually
ensure the continued closeness that has characterized the club in
the Reagan years.
   ``Reagan leaves a difficult legacy,'' Serfaty said.

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Trade Negotiators Flexing Muscles After Japanese Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some recently developed muscle was used in
reaching a new agricultural trade agreement with Japan, and U.S.
negotiators are hoping the rest of the world is suitably impressed.
   The pact will open Japan's door to more U.S. beef and citrus
over the next few years, gradually edging away from the restrictive
quota system that has been in effect.
   Fresh from the victory in Tokyo, U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter swirled through news conferences last week to
explain what was done and how it was accomplished.
   The United States had demanded that Japan move immediately to
remove all quotas. This brought emotional protests from Japanese
farm groups, including threats to boycott U.S. grain and warnings
to Japanese consumers that American beef could be contaminated by
chemicals.
   But Yeutter said the U.S. pressure for total and immediate
removal of quotas was a negotiating tactic.
   ``It would have been impossible for the (Japanese) government to
make that agreement and survive,'' he said. ``So we had to work out
a way to achieve full market liberalization as quickly as
possible.''
   As it turned out, Japan agreed to phase out quotas on imported
beef and fresh oranges within three years and orange juice in four
years.
   Yeutter said there had been a fundamental change in the attitude
of Japanese leaders who showed a new willingness to reach an
agreement.
   If there was a sudden dawning or enlightenment among Japanese
officials it was helped along by stepped up U.S. pressure for
agricultural trade liberalization.
   ``The pressure came from two sources, in my judgment,'' Yeutter
said. ``The first is a generic one, the fact that we've just been a
lot more aggressive in opening up markets around the world over the
last three years or so than we have in the past.
   ``And the government of Japan finally has concluded that we're
serious about this, and they couldn't stall us off. In other words,
they successfully procrastinated on this for 20 years and finally
concluded that we were coming after them this time.''
   The second source of pressure, he said, resulted from U.S.
decisions to push hard for settlement of trade disputes under the
94-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has is
headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
   ``We have finally begun to use the GATT, challenging import
restrictions like this that we believe to be inconsistent with the
GATT and illegal internationally,'' Yeutter said.
   Late last year a GATT ruling on a complaint by the United States
held that Japan should ease import restrictions on a dozen
agricultural products, including dairy products, fruit purees,
tomato juice, ketchup, dried peas and beans, sugars and syrups, and
prepared beef and pork products.
   With this victory, Yeutter said Japan was served notice that the
United States was prepared to go again to GATT for relief of the
beef and citrus restrictions.
   Yeutter and others are hopeful that the successful pursuit of
the Japanese agreement on beef and citrus will provide momentum in
dealing with the European Economic Community and negotiations of
new GATT terms for agriculture.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, as well as Yeutter and
many others, has been a steady critic of EEC policies and has
plugged heavily for reforms of subsidy programs worldwide.
   In September 1986, a GATT meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay,
agreed to seek new trading rules for agriculture. In July 1987, the
United States formally proposed phasing out all subsidies, direct
or indirect, that affect agricultural trade, and all tariff and
non-tariff barriers, over a 10-year period.
   Lyng continues to be optimistic that ``the process of
negotiations has been moving along'' on the U.S. proposal but
acknowledged last week ``it will take a lot of work'' to convince
other countries during the so-called Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations.
   In Europe, leaders of the 12-nation trading bloc have denounced
the U.S. no-subsidy as unworkable and unrealistic.
   But Yeutter, echoing Lyng's resolve, said the proposal makes
sense and ``ought to be faster'' than the 10 years proposed for the
subsidy phase-out. The EEC and the world would better off if it
were, he said.

   WASHINGTON _ The health of the nation's worst savings and loan
institutions worsened during the first three months of the year,
overwhelming modest gains made by solvent thrifts, the government
has reported.
   Losses by the 3,118 federally insured S&Ls were down slightly
from the record set during the last three months of 1987, and Texas
thrifts continued racking up huge losses, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board reported Tuesday.
   Despite a significant improvement in earnings by thrifts
considered solvent under regulatory rules, economists predicted the
industry as a whole will lose more than $8 billion and set a record
in 1988.

   Inflation slowed for the second month in a row
to an annual rate of 4.2 percent in May, with the Farm Belt drought
yet to reach the grocery shelves and consumers balking at paying
more for clothing, according to the Labor Department.
   Retail prices overall rose just 0.3 percent in May as women's
apparel prices fell after two straight months of hefty increases,
the department said Tuesday.
   Despite the slowdown, economists cautioned that inflation could
begin heating up as early as next month as the midwestern drought
forces higher food prices.

   Leaders of the seven richest nations have
concluded their annual summit with a debt-relief plan for the
world's poorest countries, proclaiming optimism about the global
economy but spurning President Reagan's plea to abolish farm
subsidies.
   Despite the rebuff on subsidies, Reagan basically got what he
wanted from the summit in terms of tougher action against terrorism
and illegal drug trafficking.
   The three-day summit that ended Tuesday was Reagan's last and

   The Senate has voted to curb the huge bonuses
called ``golden parachutes'' that sometimes are paid to corporate
managers ousted after their companies are acquired in hostile

   The lawmakers on Tuesday inserted the provision into legislation

limiting hostile takeovers.
   The golden parachute amendment is aimed at payments, sometimes
amounting to tens of millions of dollars, that can be made to
executives who are fired by new corporate owners. The provision
would require such bonuses to be approved by a majority vote of
shareholders.

   Heavy rain fell on part of the drought-ravaged farmland of the
northern Plains, but the heat wave gave it little chance of soaking
in.
   Thunderstorms over northwestern Minnesota and eastern North
Dakota dumped as much as 1.7 inches of rain in spots Tuesday, not
enough to overcome the rain deficit. Experts said the heat worsens
the drought by evaporating what little moisture remains in the soil.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard planned to close the Mississippi
River at Memphis, Tenn., to commercial traffic for up to three days
so a dredge could deepen and widen the river, which is at a
record-low level.

   One person implicated through wiretaps in the
Pentagon procurement bribery and fraud probe agreed to cooperate
with the government and another is on the verge of agreeing,
sources familiar with the investigation said.
   Also on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci reassigned
six Pentagon officials under scrutiny in the investigation. He
ordered that anyone under investigation be moved to new jobs that
have nothing to do with procurement.
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could help win contracts.

   A new agreement with Japan to accept more
imports of U.S. beef and oranges should help other trade
negotiations, especially with the European Economic Community, U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yuetter said.
   Yeutter said Tuesday that the deal struck this week with Japan
puts additional pressure on the Europeans to be more accommodating.
   The agreement could lead to a doubling of U.S. oranges and beef
exports to Japan by 1991 to more than $1 billion a year.

   Union Carbide Corp. will negotiate with
private lawyers for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, a
company representative said.
   An Indian law makes the government the sole legal representative
of the victims, but a lawyer for Carbide who spoke Tuesday on
condition of anonymity, said the case could be settled in the
United States. The Indian government last week asked the Bhopal
court to block such a move.
   About 523,000 people have filed claims in connection with a
toxic gas leak from a Union Carbide subsidiary's plant that killed
nearly 3,000 people and serious injured 20,000.

   A better-than-usual flow of taxes cut the
federal budget deficit in May to $22.5 billion, but the cumulative
deficit for the first eight months of the fiscal year was still
ahead of last year.
   The Treasury Department said Tuesday that personal income tax
collections for May were nearly double those of last year, rising
to $18 billion from $9.3 billion.
   The May deficit, representing the difference between what the
government took in and what it spent last month, boosted red ink
for the year to $127.5 billion, 6.3 percent greater than for the
same period of fiscal 1987.

   Stock prices advanced sharply late Tuesday after erratic and
mixed trading through most of the day. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 25.24 points to 2,109.17.
   Bond prices were little changed.
   The dollar was lower against most major foreign currencies amid
expectations European interest rates would rise.
   Drought fears drove corn futures prices up their daily limit for
the sixth consecutive day on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean
futures also rose sharply while wheat futures retreated.

   A rush of buying in gasoline futures contracts
has provided some support for an otherwise bearish energy market.
   The July contracts for crude oil, which were due to expire, came
under immediate pressure when trading began Tuesday and dragged
down the rest of market, observers said.
   But prices recovered late in the day as contracts for wholesale
unleaded gasoline made strong gains.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 11 cents
lower at $15.89 per barrel. Contracts for delivery in later months
generally were higher.
   July unleaded gasoline gained 0.52 cent to 49.99 cents a gallon,
while home heating oil gained 0.10 cent to 43.28 cents a gallon.
   The buying in gasoline was sparked by traders staking positions
in advance of the release of new supply figures. Traders believe
demand will be high and supplies tight for gasoline during the
summer driving season, analysts said.
   But analysts said the fundamental tone of the market remained
bearish following the lack of new initiatives to contain production
by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

<HEAD>Icahn's Options Keep Texaco, Market Guessing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s management may be turning its
focus back to the oil patch, but corporate raider Carl C. Icahn is
likely to remain a thorn in the oil giant's side for some time.
   He lost a critical proxy battle for five seats on Texaco's
14-member board, but Icahn still owns 14.9 percent of the company's
outstanding shares, a formidable force to reckon with.
   And if a parallel can be drawn to his encounter with USX Corp.,
Icahn may buck popular wisdom and hang onto his Texaco shares.
   When the steelmaker stymied his buyout overtures last year,
experts predicted Icahn would sell out his stake. But he did
nothing of the sort and continues to be USX's largest single
shareholder.
   Right now Icahn is a passive investor in the Pittsburgh-based
steel and energy company. ``But with 10 percent (of the outstanding
shares), there's always the possibility that if he's not satisfied,
he might try to acquire the company,'' said Dennis Sperduto, an
analyst with Argus Research Corp.
   Texaco, Sperduto said, is far more vulnerable to criticism than
USX was at the time, and Icahn's exchanges with Texaco management
have been frosty at best.
   Both sides have swapped barbs, ``and Icahn has been on record as
saying he has no intention of staying with existing management,''
said Paul Ting, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   After conceding defeat Monday in the proxy contest, Icahn
announced that he was weighing his options, including making a
hostile tender offer, holding his shares or selling them to a third
party.
   Time is not of the essence. If Icahn is to sell his stake, he
must wait until July 20 before pocketing the profits. Under the
``short-swing'' profit rule, a holder of more than 5 percent of a
company's stock must keep those shares for at least six months,
otherwise any profits earned revert back to the company.
   Because a significant amount of stock was voted for Icahn,
Texaco management is under the gun to perform, said Rosario
Ilacqua, vice president of equity research at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc.
   ``They have to live up to all of the things that the
shareholders who voted for them are expecting,'' he said.
   Icahn is taking at least some credit for the reorganization
Texaco has embarked upon.
   A keystone of the company's plan was a $3 billion payment to
Pennzoil Co. to settle a lawsuit resulting from Texaco's 1984
acquisition of Getty Oil Co. after Pennzoil had made earlier moves
to acquire Getty.
   In addition, Texaco has begun selling off up to $5 billion worth
of marginally profitable assets and says it will distribute $1.7
billion of the proceeds to shareholders.
   A source close to Texaco said that with the restructuring
underway and the proxy battle over, ``some stability is offered
now, and the management can return to the oil patch.''
   Management also is considering a stock buyback program, which,
coupled with the regular quarterly dividend Texaco has resumed
paying, could amount to a handsome return for Icahn if he decides
to hold his stake.
   One thing most experts agree Icahn will not do is dump his
shares on the open market, a move that would have a depressing
effect on Texaco's stock price.
   More likely would be the sale of his shares in a block to a
third party. But selling the stake could pose a problem for Texaco
management, particularly if Icahn lined up another oil company as
the buyer, or even the New York investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.
   Kohlberg Kravis ensured Icahn's defeat in the proxy fight by
voting its 12 million shares for Texaco management. While the firm
no longer owns that 4.9 percent stake, it stated it might consider
purchasing shares in the future and that remained ``interested in
the company's progress.''
   In Tuesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco jumped
$1.62{ a share to close at $48.50 amid rumors that the company was
about to unveil the buyback program and that Kohlberg Kravis was
purchasing more shares or mulling a leveraged buyout of the oil
company.

<HEAD>Arbitron Plans National TV Rating, Product Buying Measurement
Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arbitron Ratings Co. plans to offer a national
television ratings service in the fall of 1990 that will be the
first to also keep tabs on what the survey families are buying.
   The announcement Tuesday comes as budget-conscious advertisers
increasingly are looking beyond the major TV networks to
alternatives such as cable television, special event sponsorships
and in-store promotions to boost sales.
   The national television ratings services already being offered
by A.C. Nielsen Co. and AGB Television Research measure who watches
specific shows, but not what those viewers end up buying.
   A.J. Aurichio, president of Arbitron, a unit of Control Data
Corp., said his service would help national advertisers and ad
agencies relate what they are spending on television commercials to
sales results.
   He said the service should give the networks information to
convince advertisers of the selling potential of their medium.
   Arbitron calls its service ScanAmerica and has been operating in
the Denver area since April 1987.
   At a news conference, Aurichio said Arbitron plans to begin
operating the ScanAmerica National Service in the fall of 1989
using a sample of 1,000 households in five major markets.
   He said the size of the sample would be increased by the fall of
1990 to 2,600 households that would be representative of the
national population. The sample would be increased gradually to
5,000 households by the end of 1992.
   Aurichio said Arbitron expected to lose $125 million over the
next four to five years introducing the system, which would not be
not expected to break even until 1995.
   Arbitron's announcement comes as AGB, another newcomer to the
national ratings business, is putting on a push to get the three
major networks to subscribe to its ratings service.
   AGB reportedly has told the three major networks it will cease
operations unless they buy its service this season. AGB took on
Nielsen head-to-head this past season for the first time. CBS
signed up, but ABC and NBC did not.
   Nielsen, a unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp., has been the leader
in compiling national audience ratings for 30 years. Arbitron has
never done national ratings, but has compiled local market ratings
for nearly 40 years.
   Aurichio said Arbitron expects to get as much as 40 percent of
its revenue from advertisers, 35 percent from the networks and
other television outlets and 25 percent from ad agencies.
   The rates for the networks and ad agencies will be comparable to
those being charged by Nielsen, he said.
   Advertisers will be charged about $75,000 for each product
category, he said. In return, they will get ratings and sales data
as well as information on what brands people bought compared with
what they watched.
   Arbitron, Nielsen and AGB each collect viewing information with
what are known as ``people meters.'' Viewers register when they are
watching television by punching buttons on a device that resembles
a remote control handset. The meter records who is watching
specific shows.
   Arbitron's ScanAmerica system also includes a product scanner
that families are asked to use to record what they have purchased.
They pass the wand over the Universal Product Code symbol on each
package.
   The viewing and purchase information is collected electronically
overnight by Arbitron's computers.
   In addition to creating the national ratings service, Arbitron
said it plans to use the ScanAmerica system in at least 20 top
local markets by the end of 1995, including six that currently use
handwritten diaries and 13 that use meters.

<HEAD>Survey: Familiar Corporate Names Can Be Best; Nobody Doesn't Like
Sara Lee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the fast-paced, high-tech world of the 1990s,
companies thinking about name changes may be better off sticking
with something old and familiar.
   That's one bit of advice from Landor Associates, a San
Francisco-based consulting firm that recently completed a survey of
consumer perceptions of the names of some of the nation's biggest
corporations.
   Landor asked 1,000 consumers in shopping malls in 12 cities to
rate 672 different names in terms of familiarity and esteem.
   Sara Lee ranked in the top 15 percent in the latest survey. That
was a marked improvement from the days when it was known as
Consolidated Foods and ranked in the bottom 10 percent of the
Landor sample.
   Allegheny Airlines once ranked in the bottom 20 percent in the
Landor survey, but placed in the top 40 percent after changing its
name to USAir.
   ``In the '90s, major corporations will rediscover the raw image
power of their established names and may find it much more
efficient to modify or add meaning to them rather than start from
scratch,'' said John Diefenbach, president of the image management
and strategic design consulting firm.
   The survey said consumers thought none too highly of some of the
high-tech names _ such as USX, Primerica and Unisys.
   The old names of those corporations _ U.S. Steel, American Can
and the pre-merger Burroughs and Sperry, respectively _ each had
placed higher in previous surveys.
   The recently abandoned name Allegis, as another example, ranked
in the bottom 5 percent of the latest Landor survey. But the name
of Allegis' biggest subsidiary, United Airlines, placed in the top
15 percent.
   Shareholders recently dumped the Allegis name and returned to
UAL Corp., as the parent company previously was known.
   ``The message is very simple,'' Diefenbach said. ``Meaningless
names and symbols can confuse and alienate the consumer.''
   So how can companies avoid similar pitfalls?
   Diefenbach says when new names are considered, companies need to
remember the long-standing equity built up in long-standing brand
images.
   When new names are required, he recommends they provide
``genuine, favorable and recognizable meaning to the consumer.''
   ``Otherwise, ill-conceived name changes can destroy good will
and obscure consumer recognition,'' Diefenbach said.

<TEXT>
   Proclaiming that safety features are becoming a
new competitive battleground for automakers, Ford Motor Co. has
announced it will make passenger-side as well as driver-side air
bags standard equipment on its 1989 Lincoln Continental.
   The move will make Ford the first domestic automaker to offer
the dual bag system, Ford spokesman Bill Peacock said Tuesday.
   Chrysler Corp. already offers a driver-side air bag system as
standard equipment on six models built after May 15, and has been
touting the devices heavily in advertising. By 1990, Chrysler plans
to have driver-side bags as standard equipment on all U.S.-built
models.
   Ford executives scheduled a news conference today in Washington
to give details on which other models would receive the dual bag
system for 1990, and how the automaker planned to meet government
requirements for passive restraint systems.
   West Germany's Porsche has offered dual air bags on its
four-cylinder cars since 1987 as standard equipment on 944 Turbo
and added the 944 S and 944 Turbo S for 1988, Porsche spokeswoman
Martha McKinley said.
   Ford last year requested and won for the industry a delay in a
federal passive restraint regulation that would have required air
bags on both sides of cars not equipped with automatic seat belts.
   Instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
allowed automakers to count the single-bag, driver-side-only
systems as passive restraints while they developed the dual-bag
systems.
   Peacock said the decision prevented slower passenger-side bag
development from holding up installation of driver-side bags. Since
1985, Ford has offered air bags as an $815 option on its small Ford
Tempo-Mercury Topaz cars.
   ``We're phasing in the right front air bag in much the same
fashion we did the driver-side bag,'' Peacock said.
   In the dual system, the driver-side and passenger-side bags
share a single set of sensors, which detect impact, and computer
controls, which set off an explosive charge that inflates the bags
in a fraction of a second.
   The NHTSA rule required all automakers to include passive
restraints _ air bags or automatic front seat belts _ on 10 percent
of their cars in 1987, 25 percent in 1988, 40 percent in 1989 and
100 percent in 1990.
   Ford offers motorized automatic front seat belts on some of its
smaller cars.
   On the Tempo-Topaz, the driver-side air bag is an $815 option.
Peacock said Ford has sold about 12,000 of the air bag-equipped
Tempo-Topaz models a year since 1985 and expects to sell 50,000
Lincoln Continentals in 1989.
   The dual system is a $3,500 option on the base Porsche 944,
McKinley said. Porsche has never offered a driver-side-only air bag
system.

<HEAD>Lipton-Celestial Tea Acquisition Blocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.C. Bigelow Inc. said Tuesday a federal
appeals court injunction has blocked Thomas J. Lipton Inc. from
acquiring Celestial Seasonings Inc., pending Bigelow's appeal of
the dismissal of its challenge to the acquisition.
   In reversing a U.S. District Court ruling and granting a stay,
the 2nd District U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York was
required to find that Bigelow has a substantial chance of
prevailing on the merits of its appeal, Bigelow said in a news
release.
   Bigelow, a family-owned maker of herbal teas, has contended the
combination of Lipton's 32 percent market share with Celestial's 52
percent share would constitute an effective monopoly created for
the specific intent of eliminating competition.
   Norwalk-based Bigelow has a 13 percent share of the U.S. herbal
tea market.
   The appeals court noted Bigelow's citation of an internal Lipton
memorandum in which a senior Lipton executive stated that
``eliminating competition is the course we should pursue.''
   Bigelow also noted Lipton's agreement to acquire Celestial for
$55 million to $75 million, more than twice the valuation
established by Kraft Inc., Celestial's parent.
   ``They are cheaply buying a monopoly not just a company, and it
would be naive to believe they won't use in any way they can the
power for which they are paying such an enormous premium,'' Bigelow
chairman David Bigelow stated.
   Lipton, a subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products
conglomerate Unilever Group, said the large premium it would pay
for Celestial was justified by efficiencies that would be achieved
through consolidation of operations, Bigelow stated.
   Lipton is based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s plans to build a
parts plant aimed at supplying foreign automakers is a big step for
the auto giant, analysts say, but there is some skepticism GM can
make it work.
   GM's Delco Products Division announced Tuesday it would build an
82,000-square-foot plant that would utilize high technology and new
management techniques to make struts for smaller front-wheel-drive
cars in this Dayton suburb.
   Plant manager James A. Bridenbaugh said the low-mass strut
dampers will be aimed at Japanese automakers locating plants in the
United States, although he also expects interest from domestic
automakers.
   Production is scheduled to begin next year with 60 people,
expanding to 150 by 1992, said Delco spokesman Charles W. Kronbach.
The plant will feature flexible manufacturing cells, instead of the
traditional assembly line, and increased responsibilities for
workers.
   ``It is a bit of a surprise. It's a big step for them,'' said
Thomas O'Grady, industry analyst and president of Integrated
Automotive Resources Inc.
   Kronbach said the struts already had been accepted for use on
GM's new Saturn models and on Toyota Camrys to be built in
Georgetown, Ky.
   Delco executives consulted officials of the International Union
of Electronics Workers Local 755, which represents many of the
3,000 Delco employees at Delco's main Kettering plant and
headquarters, Kronbach said.
   Both sides agreed ``that we needed to find a green-field site
like our Japanese competitors here'' with few ties to the main
plant, Kronbach said. ``It gives us a fair shot to try our new
teamwork and technology approach.''
   GM's competitors _ Kayaba, Showa and Tokico _ are building
plants in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, close to Japanese auto
assembly plants known as ``transplants,'' he said.
   Kronbach said the new plant would be unionized.
   Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz &
Birney, was skeptical, saying she had heard ``a lot of sweeping
statements'' about selling to the Japanese, not only from GM, but
from Chrysler Corp.
   ``I hope they do it. I think working with the transplants will
create a discipline that they probably lack,'' she said.
   ``They sell to the transplants now, they just never put up a
green-fields site with the specific intention of selling to the
transplants,'' Ms. Keller said.
   Kathleen Heaney, an analyst with Nikko Securities International,
warned there may be limits to how often GM can establish a new
plant and new work culture.
   ``They can probably get away with this once. The more that they
try to start building new plants, while they're talking about their
other plants...not being competitive and trying to close those
down, I think they're going to have a hard time,'' she said.

   The drought is bearing down hard on farmers,
but Agriculture Department experts say consumers won't feel much of
the pressure as they do their grocery shopping this year.
   ``If the drought continues, food prices will rise, but the
increases are likely to be moderate,'' a senior USDA economist said
Tuesday. ``The effects of such higher food prices on the overall
rate of inflation would be negligible.''
   Although the forecast will be revised next month, a preliminary
analysis shows that 1988 food prices may rise by an average of 3
percent to 5 percent, the report said. Until the drought, USDA
economists predicted the increase would be in the range of 2
percent to 4 percent, compared with a 4.1 percent gain in 1987.
   The report was prepared by Assistant Secretary for Economics
Ewen M. Wilson, who acknowledged that ``much of the nation's
cropland has been gripped by a searing drought which threatens to
imperil this summer's crop harvests.''
   No forecast was issued for 1989; predictions for the following
year traditionally are not released by USDA until late November or
December.
   But many economists believe some drought-related price increases
will not appear until next year, particularly in meat prices. Large
livestock sales by drought-plagued farmers this summer and fall
could create an initial market glut but could also lead to shorter
supplies and higher prices later.
   Wilson said the prospect of reduced production has driven up the
farm prices of crops and that shriveled forage supplies already
have forced many producers to reduce their livestock inventories.
   As a result, there has been apprehension over the possibilities
of food price increases and even renewed inflation, Wilson said.
   ``We will see some price run-ups in certain foods,'' he said.
``For example, pasta products made from durum wheat and oats-based
cereals, but overall food price inflation in 1988 will be held to
moderate levels.''
   Wilson added: ``The upward adjustment of our food price estimate
will have a negligible impact on the overall rate of inflation in
the United States.''
   It is still too early in the crop production cycle to assess the
full extent of drought damage, he said. However, the impact on 1988
food prices ``will be modest'' for a number or reasons, including:
   _Accelerated marketing of livestock will add to already record
supplies of meat and poultry.
   _Large inventories of corn and other feed grains can help ease
the damage to livestock and poultry feeding operations.
   _Diverse production areas and irrigation mean that fruit and
vegetable prices will be largely unaffected, even though production
in some of the Great Lake states will be down.
   _Soybeans and wheat will be affected, but the farm price of
these account for a relatively small share of the retail value of
their products such as shortening and bread.
   _Record large global supplies of vegetable oils will moderate
the price impact on cooking and salad oils.
   _The most seriously affected crops, such as oats and durum
wheat, will have a retail impact, but products made from these
crops represent only a small part of the government's inflation
indicator.
   Food accounts for about 16 percent of the government's Consumer
Price Index, or CPI, used to gauge changes in living costs for
urban consumers, the most widely used measure of inflation, Wilson
said.
   Food prepared at home accounts for about 10 percent of the
overall CPI, while food purchased or consumed away from home,
mainly restaurant meals, accounts for 6 percent.
   ``Since food accounts for 16 percent of the overall CPI, a 1
percent boost in food prices translates into an increase of less
than two-tenths of 1 percent in the overall CPI,'' Wilson said.
``However, inflation is a monetary phenomenon dependent upon
monetary policy. There is no reason to believe that a one-time
drought-induced boost in farm commodity prices will lead to higher
overall inflation. The metal markets and oil prices continue to be
well behaved and wage increases are moderate.''
   According to USDA records, a rise of 3 percent to 5 percent
would be the sharpest since food prices rose an average of 7.9
percent in 1981 as the nation's general inflation spiral was
winding down.
   Wilson said higher commodity prices this year ``will bring about
a production response'' in 1989.
   More than 78 million acres of U.S. farm land have been taken
from production this year under federal programs, including 24
million acres in a long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   ``The immediate problem is not one of food shortages or food
price inflation, except in certain specific instances, but rather
the problem is one of responding in a compassionate way to the
losses faced by American farmers,'' Wilson said.

<TEXT>
   Anti-union laws, Japanese work
techniques and a scarcity of jobs have begun to transform Britain's
once-militant labor unions.
   Single-union and no-strike deals are spreading, provoking a
bitter fight among the country's declining unions and threatening
to split their umbrella organization, the Trades Union Congress _
the TUC.
   In this ugly red-brick, Yorkshire city of 59,000, a new
$93-million plant being built jointly by Coca-Cola Co. and Cadbury
Schweppes PLC is bringing 500 new jobs to a region where
unemployment is 12.7 percent, nearly 4 percentage points above the
national average.
   The plant's work force will be represented by a single union,
where past practice would have meant each worker category would
have had its own union.
   But while that may be bad news for the 120-year-old TUC, it is
no big issue in places like Wakefield, where the decline of
traditional coal and textile industries makes getting a job much
more important than defending union rights.
   ``Unions are on the way out,'' said Wakefield's Nigel Bilton, 22
years old and unemployed. ``I think unions should be abolished.''
   Thirty single-union deals, 10 of which include no-strike
provisions, have been struck in British industry, up from six
single-union deals and zero no-strike agreements five years ago,
according to the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU).
   ``The number is growing. We envision it doubling by the end of
this year,'' says John Mann, the union's research manager.
   Such deals, under which one union represents all the workers at
a plant and arbitration replaces strikes, are expected to multiply
even faster after a stunning defeat for the unions in Scotland this
past March.
   Japanese, then American, and now British companies have sought
these new single-union deals because they find it simpler and
cheaper to negotiate with one union rather than several.
   The 42,000 workers at Ford Motor Co. in Britain, for example,
have 12 different unions.
   Ford has scrapped plans to build an electronics plant in Dundee
in Scotland because it couldn't get its unions to accept the
single-union deal it had reached with the Amalgamated Engineering
Union.
   The dramatic reversal scuttled what would have been Ford's 23rd
British plant, cost 450 new jobs and provoked widespread anger
against what Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind termed the unions'
``neanderthal attitudes.''
   Opponents of single-union deals maintain, however, that one
union cannot adequately represent a work force ranging from
engineers to typists.
   Championing the new union deals are the 800,000-member AEU and
the 360,000-member Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and
Plumbing Union (EETPU).
   Membership in the 84-union TUC has shrunk from 13 million to 9
million since 1979, and the government can now boast that the days
when Britain could be crippled by strikes are over. Days lost to
strikes have fallen from 29 million in 1979 to just 2.5 million in
the year up to March.
   Unemployment is one reason, but another is Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's legislation, which forces unions to take strike
votes and obtain a 55-percent yes-vote before calling a walkout.
The legislation also outlaws secondary picketing, and no longer
requires employers to recognize a union even if employees have
chosen it in a vote.
   The Trades Union Congress is threatening to expel the EETPU
electricians at its annual meeting in September over single-union
deals.
   At the same time, the EETPU is asking its members in a ballot
whether to pull out of the TUC and talking to the AEU about joining
forces to form their own breakaway organization that would take
away one-ninth of the TUC's membership.
   ``Such a split in the union movement would change the face of
industrial relations and have serious implications for the Labor
Party,'' the Independent newspaper wrote.
   The Labor Party is the main opposition to Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party government, and the unions are the Laborites
power base.
   The Wakefield factory, which is Europe's newest soft-drink
plant, ``is going to mean a lot for the community of Wakefield,''
said Mayor George Parkinson.
   Dick Croft, a local official for the engineering union that will
represent the Wakefield plant workers, said the community was lucky
that Coke and Cadbury decided to have any union at all.
   The new style has been introduced largely by egalitarian-minded
Japanese companies that have abolished separate dress codes, put in
employee canteens and provided parking lots for hourly workers as
well as for management.
   They offer enticing wages in return for high productivity and
shopfloor moderation. British workers have embraced the change,
confounding those who accuse them of resisting change and upholding
class distinctions.
   Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, argues that
single-union deals encourage damaging competition among unions for
a smaller pool of members in the trade union movement.
   The 1.35-million-member Transport and General Workers Union,
Britain's largest, also is a major opponent of the new style for
pretty much the same reasons.
   But up here in Yorkshire, the engineering union's Croft said,
``The world is changing. We don't enjoy the same franchise we had a
few years ago.''

   The company disclosed its intention in a reorganization plan
filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Allegheny International said most company products carry the

<HEAD>Ashland Oil, Officers Appeal $70 Million Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. attorneys have asked a
federal judge to set aside a nearly $70 million civil award to two
former vice presidents, citing trial errors and excessive damages.
   The motions, filed Monday, asks that U.S. District Judge William
O. Bertelsman hold a new trial if he won't overturn the verdict.
   After an eight-week trial, a jury earlier this month awarded
former Ashland Oil vice presidents Bill E. McKay $14.4 million and
Harry Williams $7.7 million in lost earnings and benefits.
   The two claimed they were fired in 1983 for refusing to bribe
foreign officials to obtain crude oil or to help cover up such
illegal payments.
   Lawyers for Ashland and the other defendants _ Chairman John
Hall, Senior Vice President Richard Spears and former Chairman Orin
Atkins _ dispute the verdicts in the documents filed Monday.
   The filing claims Ashland deserves a new trial because the
defendants weren't given time to present their case, Bertelsman
allowed improper evidence to be introduced, and the damages awarded
were beyond what McKay or Williams could have earned with Ashland.
The motions also say Bertelsman gave confusing instructions to the
jury.
   The amount of the awards had been tripled because jurors also
found Ashland had engaged in a pattern of illegal interstate
activity _ paying bribes to foreign officials. The two men were
awarded punitive damages on top of the triple damages.

<HEAD>Inflation Slows Again; Stock Market Gains</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Grafs 1-5 new to UPDATE with durable goods report; picksup
2nd graf pvs: The Dow ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods
plunged 2.2 percent in May, the steepest dive in nine months, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durables goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$114.8 billion last month.
   The report, which showed the biggest drop in new orders since
August, surprised economists. The entire May decline can be
accounted for by a precipitous 9 percent decline in orders for
transportation equipment.
   Many experts had predicted a rise of more than 2 percent in
orders on the strength of two big orders late in May to Boeing
Commercial Airplanes Co., one from United Airlines, the other from
American Airlines. But those orders apparently were not recorded in
the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate of durable goods.
   On Tuesday, a government report of lower-than-expected inflation
during May encouraged the stock market, but the good news was
offset by a surge in commodity prices related to the Farm Belt
drought.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.24 points to
2,109.17 on Tuesday. Bond prices were flat and the dollar was
narrowly lower.
   The Labor Department said consumer prices rose a modest 0.3
percent in May.
   But drought fears drove corn futures prices up their daily limit
for the sixth straight day on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean
futures also rose sharply while wheat futures retreated.
   The drought will push up food prices this summer, but costlier
food will add only about half a percentage point to the overall
rise in the Consumer Price Index, predicted John Hagens, an
economist for the Wefa Group of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   For the first five months of 1988, consumer prices have risen at
an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the same pace as in 1987.
   ``Where is the inflation bear?'' Sandra Shaber, an analyst for
the Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm, said. ``His
footprints are not in much evidence right now.''
   But Ms. Shaber and several other economists warned that
inflation was only hibernating.
   Higher prices for gasoline and medical costs were behind most of
the inflation in May, but they were offset somewhat by a leveling
off of clothing prices.
   In a related report Tuesday, the Labor Department said
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
fell 0.3 percent in May. The decrease follows an increase of 1.0
percent in April and a drop of 0.6 percent in March.
   The changes left American's inflation-adjusted earnings 0.7
percent below a year ago.
   In the commodity markets, analysts said the National Weather
Service's latest six-to-10 day forecast for hot, dry weather in the
Midwest through the end of the month threatened further damage to
corn, oat and soybean crops and inspired new buying of futures
contracts.
   ``With the corn crop, each week that goes by without rain means
another 10 percent is lost,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago. Some experts estimate anywhere
from 10 to 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop already has been ruined
by lack of rain.
   In a report on the nation's savings and loan industry, the
government said S&Ls overall continued losing huge amounts of money
in the first three months of this year.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the 3,118 federally
insured S&Ls lost $3.78 billion, only slightly below the $3.81
billion record set in the last three months of 1987.

   Rain answered some prayers in the parched Midwest, where
neighbors informed on water wasters by the hundreds, but as the
nation buckled under record heat Eastern farmers began worrying
that drought conditions were heading their way.
   More record high temperatures today were expected to burn
lingering moisture from drought-choked soil in the nation's farm
belt. Temperatures topped the 100-degree mark in 23 states Tuesday,
the first day of summer, and set 67 records.
   However, ``it looks like things will be not quite as hot as they
were the last couple days,'' said Hugh Crowther of the National
Weather Service in Kansas City, Mo.
   Meteorologists forecast no major rainfall in the next few days,
although widely scattered showers and thunderstorms dampened the
central Plains and Great Lakes region this morning, while strong
thunderstorms lashed parts of Wisconsin and Michigan.
   The heat and lack of rain also continued to shrink water levels
on rivers, staunching traffic on parts of the Mississippi and Ohio
as barges ran aground or became snagged in bottlenecks.
   ``I can't keep the (Mississippi) river open,'' said Cmdr.
Michael Donohoe with the Coast Guard near Memphis, Tenn., where
officials expect a towboat traffic jam of up to 1,800 barges.
``Mother Nature is going to make that decision for us.''
   In an interview today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
Donohoe said the Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river
Tuesday night, and ``we hope to have the channel re-opened by
Friday at noon.''
   Tuesday, the Army Corps of Engineers managed to free a 26-barge
tow that ran aground near Rosedale, Miss., reopening 730 miles of
the Mississippi downstream from Memphis to the Gulf of Mexico.
   Heavy rain fell Tuesday on part of the drought-ravaged northern
Plains, but it was scarcely enough to quench dusty pastures.
   Lightning ignited dry timber and grass in northwestern South
Dakota, where firefighters were trying to control two fires that
burned a total 6,500 acres.
   At the Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, Jack Wilson,
director of the Bureau of Land Management, told ``Good Morning
America'' he was concerned about the coming forest fire season
because of the drought and expected ``a considerable number'' of
forests to be closed as the season progresses.
   Regis Krebs, a farmer from Beckemeyer, Ill., near St. Louis,
discovered the fire risk when a spark from his combine set part of
his wheat field ablaze.
   ``He lost a couple acres of wheat in about 10 minutes,'' said
Fire Chief Vincent Pollman. ``Everything is bone dry and it went up
quickly.''
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, drought worries Tuesday drove
corn futures prices up to their daily limit for the sixth straight
day. Soybean futures also rose sharply while wheat futures
retreated.
   Commodities analysts said the weather service's latest six-to-10
day forecast for hot, dry weather in the Midwest threatened further
damage to corn, oat and soybean crops.
   ``With the corn crop, each week that goes by without rain means
another 10 percent is lost,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago. Some estimate anywhere from 10
percent to 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop already has been ruined.
   Marion Hartman, director of the Ohio Corn Growers Board, said
today on the ABC-TV program, ``I don't want to call this a
disaster, but it's approaching a disaster. Let's say it's getting
critical.''
   Hay was so scarce that a hay hot line was started in Dayton,
Ohio, for farmers seeking fodder from as far away as Kansas. For
the most part those with livestock face the choice of feeding hay
stored for the winter, buying feed at higher prices or selling
their herds in a falling market.
   ``I see tears. I see anger,'' said Laura Koenig of Stratford,
Wis., who runs a program to help farmers deal with stress. ``I see
very tired men, women giving up and walking away, children saying,
`I don't want to go in the barn.'''
   ``There's no hay, no prospect of getting any,'' said O.H.
Campbell, 71, of Henderson, Ky. ``I cut about 50 bales. I'm going
to use that to feed this summer and then I'm going to sell the herd
off.''
   Many utilities hit record peak loads Tuesday and asked customers
to cut back on electricity. Water use restrictions were widespread,
prompting many residents of Oakland County, Mich., to inform on
neighbors who violate them, officials said.
   ``The people have begun to realize the severity of this,'' said
Al Beanblossom, assistant manager for the Waterford Township Water
and Sewer Department. ``That's why I think people are turning in
their neighbors.''
   ``We laugh about it,'' Beanblossom said. ``We say, `Here comes
another squealer.'''
   There was little laughter in the East, however, where signs of
drought began appearing. Pennsylvania authorities on Tuesday warned
the next two weeks are critical.
   ``Things are drying out pretty quickly out there,'' said Gene
Schenck, spokesman for the state Agriculture Department. ``The hot
sun and the breeze take the moisture right out of the soil.''
   A weekly state survey of 225 farmers and county extension agents
showed 80 percent reported their soil was short of moisture last
week, Schenck said.

   A Japanese subsidiary of Daimler Benz AG of West

Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan to market Mercedes-Benz
automobiles in Japan.
   Kazuhiro Joh, a spokesman of Mercedes-Benz Japan Co., said the

Mercedes-Benz Japan and 49 percent by Mitsubishi Motors.
   Joh said the new company plans to sell more than 5,000
Mercedes-Benz passengers a year in Japan through its own and
Mitsubishi Motors' sales networks. That figure could rise to 30,000
cars annually by 1992.
   Joh said 18,749 cars were sold in Japan last year mostly through
the Japanese distributor, Yanase and Co.

<TEXT>
   Britain's commercial banks, heeding a signal from
the Bank of England, raised their base lending rate by half a
percentage point Wednesday to 9 percent.
   It was the third increase in the benchmark rate in less than
three weeks and represented a concerted effort by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government to curb inflationary
pressures and boost the pound.
   The Bank of England signaled the increase by raising a key money
market intervention rate.
   Barclays Bank PLC responded immediately by raising its base rate
from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, effective Thursday. Midland Bank
PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC quickly
followed suit.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans from commercial banks at 1
percentage point above the base lending rate.
   There was little reaction in financial markets to the increase.
The pound was slightly higher but dealers said the currency's
response was restricted because the rate hike had already been
discounted.
   Commercial banks increased their base lending rate from 7.5
percent to 8 percent on June 2 and then to 8.5 percent on June 6.
The base rate had been cut from 8 percent to 7.5 percent on May 17
in an attempt to restrain a strong rise in the pound at the time.
   Government figures for inflation, jobs, growth and output have
highlighted the fact that the British economy continues to boom,
despite last October's stock market crash.

<TEXT>
   For the millions of people who daily board
the Mexico City subway system, the price of a ticket is sticking at
100 pesos _ less than a nickel _ a ride.
   A stack of tortillas, the mainstay of the Mexican diet, can
still be bought for about a nickel a pound, and the prices of milk,
gasoline and a host of other products haven't changed much.
   The government's ``shock'' program has jolted the worrisome
triple-digit inflation out of the economy _ at least temporarily.
   Government officials are boasting the accomplishments of their
plan, which has frozen the prices of government-regulated goods,
the minimum wage and the exchange rate of the peso currency. It
also calls for federal spending cuts, a tight monetary policy and
opening the economy to more foreign trade.
   So far, the results of the Economic Solidarity Pact have been
impressive. Consumer prices skyrocketed a record 15.5 percent in
January but rose 1.9 percent in May for the slowest gain in 6{
years.
   Still, some analysts say it's too soon to tell whether high
inflation has been permanently chased away.
   ``We're in the honeymoon (stage),'' said Jonathan Heath,
coordinating director of the forecasting firm, Macro Asesoria
Economica.
   ``You cannot say it is successful nor a failure because the pact
has only one objective, that is to reduce inflation permanently,''
said Heath. ``What's been done so far is reduce inflation
temporarily. ... The only real verdict we'll be able to give of the
pact is down the road.''
   Rogelio Ramirez de la O of the Ecanal consulting firm agreed:
``It's too early to say whether there's a permanent reduction in
inflation.''
   To the man on the street, not much seems to have changed.
Construction worker Ismael Carrasco, waiting for a job in the
downtown Zocalo plaza, dismissed the goverment's program as ``a
lie.''
   ``Instead of helping us, they are grinding us down day after
day, more and more. ... Everything is going up,'' he complained.
   Across the street, at Monte de Piedad, the national pawnshop,
dozens of people lined up early on a recent morning to hock their
valuables for a little money to meet expenses.
   ``It is still very difficult,'' said Norberto Godinez, a watch
repairman who pawned a watch to get 35,000 pesos _ about $15.50 _
to buy parts for his work. ``Inflation is the same.''
   President Miguel de la Madrid unveiled the Solidarity Pact in
mid-December after officials became worried that Mexico was on the
verge of spinning into the hyper-inflationary swirls of other Latin
American countries.
   Consumer prices rose a record 159.2 percent last year, well
above the 105.7 percent posted in the previous year. Analysts were
predicting the 1988 pace could well hit the 200 percent mark.
   Moreover, the stock market, once one of the world's top
performers, collapsed. Speculation in the peso currency was
widespread.
   ``It was a wise thing to do something when the situation went
out of control in November 1987,'' said Ramirez de la O. ``It is
probably the only thing that could have been done.''
   Analysts are predicting an inflation rate in the range of 40
percent to 50 percent for 1988, if the government maintains its
tight clamp on wages, prices and the exchange rate through the end
of November when de la Madrid's six-year term ends. The government
has already said the program will run through August.
   De la Madrid is virtually certain to be succeeded by Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, the standard-bearer of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party. Salinas de Gortari has said in campaign
speeches that he intends to press the inflation fight.
   ``We feel that the new administration will continue the
anti-inflation policy to eradicate inflation, hopefully bringing it
below double-digit inflation (in 1989),'' said Abel Beltran del
Rio, executive director of the Mexican forecasting project
Ciemex-Wefa in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``We feel this is the program that is going to end the inflation
decade-and-a-half of Mexico,'' he said.
   ``Mexico is at the cutting edge in terms of macro-economic
policy of high-debt countries,'' said a knowledgeable analyst, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Mexico's foreign debt is $100
billion, the second highest in the developing world after Brazil.
   The initial goal of the Solidarity program was to trim the
inflation rate to 2 percent a month by year's end.
   Government officials have said in recent weeks the price pace
should be similar to that of Mexico's trading partners. Inflation
is running just over 4 percent in the United States, Mexico's No.1
trading partner.
   Under the Solidarity Pact, prices on goods and services
regulated by the government have been frozen since March.
Government officials have applied pressure on business leaders to
keep a lid on their prices, resulting in a virtual economy-wide
freeze.
   Before the freeze, the government nearly doubled some official
prices, giving a sharp kick to costs throughout the economy.
   The government also ordered in March a hold on the exchange rate
of the peso currency. It has ranged between 2,240 pesos and 2,280
pesos to the dollar since then. The peso lost about a fifth of its
value in a sharp devaluation in December.
   The minimum wage in Mexico City has been maintained at 8,000
pesos a day _ about $3.50 _ since April. Unskilled workers got
raises of a cumulative 38 percent before the freeze.
   With the wide-ranging holds, analysts say the inflation rate had
to ease.
   But some worry that once the freezes are lifted, prices could
resume their upward climb. Argentina and Brazil, which have used
shock programs in recent years, have still been unable to lick high
inflation.
   Heath suggests that the Mexican government thaw its frozen
prices at the depths of the economic downturn now beginning to be
felt. With low economic activity, there would be little need for
businesses to boost their prices sharply.
   ``We don't expect an explosion of prices,'' Beltran del Rio
said. ``We anticipate increases, sure, but not increases of 30, 40
or 50 percent.''
   Analysts also say the government needs to stick to efforts to
pare its spending.
   ``If the government does not adjust its public finances, we will
see that inflation will pick up again,'' said Ramirez de la O. ``If
the government does adjust, we can take for granted controls can be
removed without inflationary consequences.''
   But, he said, ``it's too early to say the government has taken
the pill of austerity.''

<TEXT>
   The Mexican stock exchange, one of the
world's hottest before October's global collapse, is regaining some
of its lost luster.
   The Index of Prices and Quotations, the main gauge of market
activity, has recently surpassed the 200,000 mark, surging more
than 90 percent from the start of the year.
   But the index, made up of the prices of 50 stocks, is still far
off the high of 373,216.24 posted on Oct. 6. The index fell to
86,606.75 on Jan. 7 before beginning its slow rebound.
   Rogelio Ramirez de la O of the private Ecanal forecasting firm
describes the market as ``cautiously up.''
   Other analysts say the exchange may be reflecting the initial
success of the government's Economic Solidarity Pact, the
anti-inflation program put in place in mid-December by President
Miguel de la Madrid.
   The program has frozen the minimum wage, the prices of
government-regulated goods and services and the peso-dollar
exchange rate. It also has promised to cut government spending,
restrain monetary and credit policy, and open the economy to more
foreign trade.
   Since its inception, interest rates have tumbled sharply. The
interest rate on 28-day treasury bills has plunged from a high of
nearly 160 percent in February to about 40 percent. Bank interest
rates have taken a similar dive.
   With a steady exchange rate, Mexicans have been bringing their
money back from foreign, mostly U.S. banks and investing in
short-term instruments and the stock market, analysts said.
   A breakdown of index figures by sector shows the value of mining
stocks soared 51 percent from the end of January to the end of May;
manufacturing stocks were up 40 percent; construction stocks
increased 17 percent; and communications and transportation issues
climbed 59 percent. The stocks of service companies were off 8
percent during the same period.
   The index gained 124 percent in all of last year, off from the
stunning 321 advance of 1986.

<HEAD>Fast-Growing Subway Sandwich Chain Offers Taste Of American Dream</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entrepreneurs who believe the American
Dream can be found in a foot-long submarine sandwich travel here
each month to learn how to make mounds of money stuffing pounds of
food into fresh-baked buns.
   Their teacher and inspiration is Fred DeLuca, the man who would
be, and is, the King of Subs.
   Twenty-three years after DeLuca opened his first sub shop in
nearby Bridgeport to raise money for college, his fast-food chain
has grown to more than 2,200 stores, and new shops are opening at a
rate of between 20 and 30 a week.
   His company, Subway Sandwiches & Salads, is one of the fastest
growing fast-food chains in the country and was recently named
America's top franchise by the magazine ``Entrepreneur,'' which
compiles a Franchise 500.
   Subway subs are being gobbled up at quite a clip. The chain says
it is selling 1.5 million feet of sandwiches a week to customers
who like to watch their meals take shape before their eyes and to
their specifications.
   Last year, gross sales totaled $360 million _ an 89 percent
increase over the year before, when there were only about half as
many franchises.
   Subway has its origins in Pete's Super Submarine Sandwiches, a
business DeLuca opened in 1965 at age 17 with the help of a family
friend, Peter Buck. As the story is told, Buck suggested the idea
to DeLuca as a way for him to make money for college, gave him
$1,000 in starting capital and agreed to be his partner.
   Aided by the decision in 1975 to start franchising, the company
was able to meet its 10-year goal of 32 stores and begin expanding
in earnest. Subway opened its first store in Alaska this spring and
will soon have franchises in every state except Wyoming and South
Dakota.
   Subway shops can also be found in Canada, the Bahamas and
Bahrain, and starting sometime this month folks Down Under will be
able to try out such specialties as the Subway Club, a combination
of roast beef, turkey and ham, when several stores open around
Perth in western Australia.
   The recent explosion in growth is the result largely of
franchisees investing in additional stores, DeLuca said.
   New franchisees learn about bookkeeping, hiring, management,
cost-control and the finer points of making subs during two-week
courses that begin every other Monday at the company's headquarters
here, now spread out over four locations but soon to be
consolidated in a new building.
   The students spend half their time at stores where the owners
have agreed to help take part in training.
   The students of submarine-making come ``from all walks of life
and from all over the world,'' said Alexander Dembski, the director
of training.
   Many recent immigrants and other people who are short on cash
and long on ambition are attracted to the relatively low start-up
costs. A typical first store can be opened for about $65,000, or as
much as $20,000 less if equipment is leased, DeLuca said. The
franchise fee itself is only $7,500.
   The students are typically a motley group. A salesman,
draftsman, fast-food restaurant employee, computer consultant,
Postal Service worker, and lumber broker were among the trainees
enrolled in a recent class.
   DeLuca addresses each class at least three times, drumming into
the trainees' heads the importance of such simple notions as
increasing sales while decreasing costs. His dress and his manner
are casual.
   ``Why am I here? Because they are really joining a new
society,'' said DeLuca, as several students waited patiently to be
photographed with their leader after class. ``It's important people
get an orientation as to what the company, and its president, are
like.''
   DeLuca knows why the trainees have come to his school _ and it
is not because they have always dreamed of making subs (or hoagies,
heroes, torpedos, grinders or poor boys, as the sandwiches are
variously called in different parts of the country.)
   ``Who, ever since they were kids, wanted to grow up and make
sandwiches?'' he asks his class, prompting a wave of chuckles.
   ``OK,'' he continues, ``why do you want to open a sandwich
shop?'' The trainees unabashedly declare their true motives: ``To
make lots of money.'' ``To get incredibly wealthy.'' ``To be my own
boss.''
   Subway officials say much of the success of their business is
due to the emphasis placed on individualized service, on letting
customers watch as many stages of the sandwich-making process as is
feasible _ including the baking of the rolls, about four times
daily, in ovens with glass doors.
   ``The visual appeal of the process is important. People want to
be able to say, `Can I have a little more lettuce,''' said training
chief Dembski. ``People like to see their food prepared expressly
for them.''
   Added DeLuca: ``Certainly our growth would not have been
possible if it had not been for companies like McDonald's leading
the way and going out and showing the importance of eating
continuously. But let's face it, people get burgered out.''

<HEAD>Surge In Knitting Machine Sales Revives Homework</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the time it takes to read this sentence, six
rows of knitting or about 1,000 stitches can be knit on even the
cheapest home knitting machine.
   Revolution or evolution? The experts aren't quite sure, but all
agree that the recent surge in knitting machine sales is changing
the face of home knitting in the United States.
   ``The growth has already started _ we're in the infancy of a
knitting machine boom,'' said Rick Drainville of White Knitting
Machines Co., a division of VWS Inc. in Cleveland. ``If you asked
someone what a knitting machine was five, 10 years ago they would
have looked at you.''
   ``I will increase my business at least tenfold in the next four
years,'' agreed Gjoko Ruzio, president of the Kimberly Market Co.
of Stockton, N.J., which imports the lightweight Bond knitting
machine. ``I'm aiming to sell 250,000 units per year by 1992.''
   U.S. knitting machine sales rose from about 5,000 in 1980 to
50,000 in 1986, according to figures compiled by White Knitting
Machines. It is estimated that about 70,000 machines will be sold
this year.
   For the uninitiated, knitting machines come in several distinct
models and price ranges:
   _Lightweight or hobby machines range from $200 to $350, not
including accessories.
   _Punchcard machines, which are able to automatically repeat a
pattern of up to 24 stitches, range from $400 to $850 without
accessories.
   _State-of-the-art electronic machines, some of which can take a
photocopy of a design and reproduce it on a knitted fabric, range
from $950 to almost $1,600.
   Accessories vary widely, from $2 weights that ensure even
knitting to ribbers that can knit and purl in the same row to
motors that cost almost as much as the machine itself. Perhaps the
most advanced accessory is a computer that allows knitters to
design their own patterns in color on their television sets.
   ``Electronic machines are driving the market demand,'' said
Allen Tuchman, vice president of Knitking Corp. in Los Angeles.
``Each machine with more hoots and bells really does allow you to
use it more.''
   All machines save one, the Harmony Auto-Knitter of Maine, are
imported. European knitting machines are imported by Passap, VWS
and Kimberly Market Co. Japanese machines are imported by Brother
International Corp., Knitking Corp., Singer Sewing Co., Studio
Products Inc. and Newton's Knits, Inc.
   Lightweight machines are beginning to be sold through mass
market retailers like J.C. Penney Co. Inc., but individual dealers
still sell the vast majority of machines. Dealers and importers
offer a number of support systems to help machine knitters expand
their expertise, including lessons and seminars, newsletters,
800-numbers, service centers, patterns and clubs.
   Experts hail the growth of machine knitting as the salvation of
an industry that has been on the wane.
   ``Our lifestyle is not what it used to be. Hand-knitting is
fading because of demands on people's time,'' said Lynne Higgins, a
former yarn shop owner in Chattanooga, Tenn., who now produces and
distributes videotape knitting machine lessons.
   ``Machines are the best thing happening to the yarn industry,''
agreed Karen Ancona, editor of Craft & Needlework Age in
Englishtown, N.J. ``Yarn sales, which had been dropping, have
stabilized.''
   Who is buying knitting machines?
   Many lightweight machines are being purchased for or by teens,
or by women in their mid-20s who have more limited time and income
than women in the 40-to-60-year-old bracket, according to Higgins.
   Cynthia Monsky of the Singer Sewing Co. says about 40 percent of
the people who buy Singer knitting machines do so in order to sell
their work. Some of these knitters supply the Colorado and New
England ski industries.
   Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Vogue Knitting, says sewers and
weavers are attracted to knitting machines, the former because of
their familiarity with machines and the latter because they can
obtain results so quickly.
   ``You can finish a project in less than a day, '' said Marlene
Cuniberti, owner of the Machine Knitting Studio in Englewood, N.J.,
and editor of Macknit, a magazine for machine knitters. ``I've
knitted a quilt for a twin bed in a couple of hours.''
   Machine knitting sales are particularly strong, but not limited
to, the Northeast, Midwest and California.
   ``Knitting used to be dictated by climate, but that's no longer
true,'' said Carol Nepton, spokeswoman for Brother International
Corp. in Piscataway, N.J. ``Florida and Texas are in major growth
patterns because of the popularity of cotton yarns and short-sleeve
sweaters.''
   ``Our hopes and dreams are to make the knitting machine as
essential to the home as a sewing machine,'' said Nepton, adding
that 80 percent of U.S. homes own a sewing machine. ``We need to
get it into the school systems, the home economics classes. We
haven't even cracked that area yet.''
   Speed and the potential for creativity are cited as the main
reasons for purchasing a knitting machine.
   ``We want to speak to the lady who is looking for a hobby in
which she can become creative,'' said Kimberly's Ruzio. ``We teach
her to paint by numbers, and then give her the tools to become a
Warhol or a Da Vinci.''

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders unnerved by rain
forecasts took profits on drought-driven gains.
   Prices on some contracts for future delivery of soybeans dropped
sharply on forecasts for rain today and tomorrow in some parts of
the Farm Belt.
   But the showers were expected to be light and spotty, and
another day of 100-plus-degree temperatures was predicted for many
major grain-producing areas, said Steve Freed, a grain analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Thirty percent of the belt has a chance for 50 percent
coverage of a quarter- to a half-inch'' of rain, Freed said. ``To
me, that's not enough when we're losing half an inch a day.''
   Freed said some price consolidation was healthy in the corn and
soybean markets, which have rocketed to four- and 11-year highs,
respectively, in the past month on fears of crop damage from the
dry weather.
   Wheat futures continued to decline on harvest pressure while
corn was mixed.
   In early trading, wheat was 4 cents lower to 1 cent higher with
July at $3.85{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents lower to 8{ cents higher
with July at $3.43 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 10{ cents higher
with July at $3.31 a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 22{ cents
lower with July at $10.46 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .62 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August
at 64.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.25 cents lower to .70
cent higher with August at 71.50 cents a pound; hogs were .07 cent
lower to .23 cent higher with July at 46.30 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.25 cents lower to .70 cent higher with July at
42.75 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Brazil: Agreement on Foreign Debt Reached with Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil has reached agreement with
international bankers on its huge foreign debt, the country's
finance minister said.
   ``We have concluded all points of the accord,'' Finance Minister
Mailson Da nobrega said Tuesday. ``Brazil is satisfied with the
agreement. It is the best accord reached so far with bankers.''
   The agreement, which gives Brazil $5.2 billion in new loans, was
not immediately signed but a communique would be issued in New York
and Brazil within the next two days, Da nobrega said.
   Brazil's 700 creditor banks must still work out the exact amount
each would give the country. However, Brazil is not involved in
that part of the agreement, Da nobrega said.
   Brazil's owes its creditors a total of $120 billion, making it
the largest debtor among developing countries.
   Finance Ministry representatives and a committee representing
the creditors have been negotiating for months on an accord that
would satisfy all parties.
   Brazil is to receive $4.6 billion this year and $600 million
during the first three months of 1989. The last installment is
contingent on Brazil's compliance with an economic agreement being
drawn up under International Monetary Fund guidelines, da Nobrega
said.
   There is a 12-year payback period with a five-year grace period
on the new loan.
   In February 1987, Brazil announced a moratorium on interest
payments and said it needed to restructure its debt. At that time,
President Jose Sarney said the country's reserves had fallen to
less than $4 billion and it could not afford to make the payments.
   Under the agreement, the interest owed to private bankers on $70
billion of its overall debt would be paid back over a 20-year
period with an eight-year grace period.
   Brazil also will pay bankers $300 million to $400 mmillion that
was due in March.
   After Brazil announced its moratorium on payments, many large
U.S. banks made large additions to their reserves for bad loans.
The additions resulted in heavy losses for U.S. banking companies
during 1987.

<HEAD>Ford First US Automaker to Offer Dual Air Bag System</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede DETROIT</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: also moved on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will make passenger- and
driver-side air bags standard equipment on 1989 Lincoln
Continentals, the company said today.
   The move will make Ford the first domestic automaker and the
second in the world to offer the dual bag system, Ford Vice
President Helen Petrauskas said at a news conference.
   West Germany's Porsche has offered dual air bags on its
four-cylinder cars since 1987 as standard equipment on 944 Turbo
and added the 944 S and 944 Turbo S for 1988, Porsche spokeswoman
Martha McKinley said.
   In May, Chrysler Corp. announced it was including driver-side
air bags as standard equipment on six models built after May 15. By
1990, Chrysler plans to have driver-side bags as standard equipment
on all U.S.-built models.
   Ford last year requested and won for the industry a delay in a
federal passive restraint regulation that would have required air
bags on both sides of cars not equipped with automatic seat belts.
   Instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
allowed automakers to count the single-bag, driver-side-only
systems as passive restraints while they developed the dual-bag
systems.
   Petrauskas said the decision prevented slower passenger-side bag
development from holding up installation of driver-side bags. Since
1985, Ford has offered air bags as an option on its small Ford
Tempo-Mercury Topaz cars.
   Petrauskas said safety had become an area of intense competition
among the nation's automakers.
   ``That safety race is in high gear,'' she said.
   In the dual system, the driver-side and passenger-side bags
share a single set of sensors, which detect impact, and computer
controls, which set off an explosive charge that inflates the bags
in a fraction of a second.
   The NHTSA rule required all automakers to include passive
restraints _ air bags or automatic front seat belts _ on 10 percent
of their cars in 1987, 25 percent in 1988, 40 percent in 1989 and
100 percent in 1990.
   Ford said 11 of its 1990 car lines will have driver-side air
bags as standard equipment with projected sales of 1 million
vehicles, Petrauskas said.
   On the Tempo-Topaz, the driver-side air bag is an $815 option.
Ford said it has sold about 12,000 of the air bag-equipped
Tempo-Topaz models a year since 1985 and expects to sell 50,000
Lincoln Continentals in 1989.
   The dual system is a $3,500 option on the base Porsche 944,
McKinley said, adding that Porsche has never offered a
driver-side-only air bag system.

   Stock prices surged this morning in heavy
trading, bolstered by the momentum of a late rally in the previous
session and a strengthened dollar overseas.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which advanced
25.24 points late Tuesday, rose another 32.90 points to 2,142.07 by
noon on Wall Street, putting it at the highest level since the
market crash eight months ago.
   The Commerce Department's report of lower-than-expected durable
goods orders for May also helped ease concerns about inflation and
encouraged some stock buying, brokers said.
   ``Everything just came into play this morning,'' said Philip C.
Puccio, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading
at Dillon Read & Co. in New York.
   Broader market barometers also gained. The New York Stock
Exchange composite index of all listed issues rose 1.84 to 155.13.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.41 to
308.29.
   Gaining issues outnumbered declines by 3-to-1 on the NYSE, with
1,058 up, 350 down and 416 unchanged. Volume totaled 119.12 million
shares in the morning, nearly double the 65.58 million traded
Tuesday morning.
   IBM led the NYSE's most-active list, jumping 2{ to 122} on

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods plunged 2.2 percent in May, the steepest dive in nine
months, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durables goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$114.8 billion last month.
   It was the biggest drop in new orders since August, when orders
plummeted 2.3 percent, and followed a 1.8 percent increase in
April, revised upward from a previous estimate of 1.0 percent.
   The entire May decline can be accounted for by a precipitous 9
percent decline in orders for transportation equipment.
   At the White House, spokesman B. Jay Cooper called the report on
new orders ``volatile. May's decline should not be cause for
concern. Shipments continue to show strength and the backlog of
unfilled orders remains high.''
   ``More news that inflation remains under control. It is good
news,'' Copper added.
   Economists were surprised by the report. Most had predicted a
rise of more than 2 percent in orders on the strength of two big
orders late in May to Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co., one from
United Airlines, the other from American Airlines. But those orders
apparently were not recorded in the Commerce Department's
preliminary estimate of durable goods.
   Excluding transportation, orders increased 0.3 percent.
Excluding just aircraft, overall orders increased 0.6 percent.
   Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at Data Resources
Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, said excluding aircraft
and defense, order levels are ``not half bad.''
   ``I think what we're seeing is what we want to see, which is
continued growth, but maybe some moderation of the pace,'' she
said. Stronger growth would inject inflation pressure into the
economy, she said.
   Orders in the volatile defense goods category fell 16.6 percent
to $8.3 billion, following an increase of 1.9 percent a month
earlier.
   Excluding defense, orders declined 0.9 percent following a 1.8
percent rise in April.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a sign
of business expansion plans, fell 6.9 percent last month, following
a 3.4 percent rise a month earlier. Despite the setback in May,
analysts still expect export-producing manufacturers to spend
heavily on modernization and expansion.
   Orders for primary metals, such as steel, zoomed 5.5 percent
following a 1.6 percent rise in April.
   Orders for electrical machinery also posted a strong gain, 3.5
percent, following a 5.0 percent rise a month before.
   There was a 2.4 percent decline in orders for non-electrical
machinery, more than erasing a 1.2 percent gain in April.
   Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent in May to $114.4
billion, following a 0.9 percent decline in April.

<HEAD>Film Company to Pay $33 Million to Settle Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cannon Group tentatively agreed to a $33
million settlement of class-action lawsuits that accused the firm
of inflating its stock price.
   The settlement, announced by the company Tuesday, was $13
million greater than a partial agreement announced in April.
   Cannon said it would be required to pay $9 million of the
settlement, with the rest paid by insurance carriers for directors,
officers and former outside auditors who also were defendants.
   The tentative agreements ``will not constitute any admission of
any liability or wrongdoing,'' the company said, adding that its
board found it in the best interests of Cannon and its shareholders
to settle the suits at this time.
   The suits were filed by shareholders last August after Cannon
disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was
conducting an inquiry into how the firm accounted for its film
costs.
   That inquiry turned into a formal investigation in November when
the SEC filed a fraud complaint.
   Control of the independent production group shifted in April to
a consortium of European stockholders led by Giancarlo Parretti,
who was named chief executive. Former top executvies Menahem Golan
and Yoram Globus, were named to head the firm's movie-making
subsidiary.
   Cannon may be required to change its accounting procedures under
the agreement, the firm said.

   A federal judge ruled today that a government
agency can't force the financially ailing LTV Corp. to reassume
more than $2 billion in pension obligations simply because a new
labor contract restored previously cut benefits.
   ``Since the agency's decision is not sustainable on the
administrative record, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the
restoration decision (giving back responsibility for the pensions
to LTV),'' ruled U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet, sitting in
New York.
   But Sweet also found that while the federal Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. hasn't proved on the administrative record that LTV
should take back the plans, the agency might be able to do so at
trial and sent the issue back to the PBGC ``for further
consideration.''
   Separately, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York approved the
sale of subsidiary LTV Steel Co.'s Warren Works to Renco Group Inc.
despite an apparent higher cash bid offered by BMAC Corp., a
California company. The Renco offer included about $112 million in
cash, a $30 million promissory note and $5 million in assumed
liabilities.
   LTV, a giant steel, aerospace and energy company, filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in July 1986.
   Sweet also said LTV wasn't entitled to block the move restoring
its pension obligations simply because it is in Chapter 11
proceedings, and denied the company's request for an order
enforcing an automatic stay of the pension plan restoration.
   The PBGC, which insures the pensions of 30 million U.S. workers,
took over LTV's steel industry pension plans last January after the
company terminated them. The plans were $2 billion in debt, making
the PBGC LTV's largest creditor.
   But when a new LTV labor contract restored to workers some
benefits previously cut, the agency claimed that the company was
taking unfair advantage of federal funds to cut costs and gain
labor peace.
   ``There is no factual or legal basis for the PBGC's finding that
LTV has abused the pension termination insurance program,'' Sweet
said in a 126-page opinion, adding that the court record ``is not
sufficiently developed to permit a finding that LTV Steel's
financial condition has improved to the point where it can afford
to sponsor its previously terminated plans.''
   LTV, the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, claims that restoring the
plans and their deficit will seriously hamper its ability to
reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.

   Stocks surged today in heavy trading and pushed
the Dow Jones average to its highest level since the October crash,
bolstered by the momentum of a late rally in the previous session
and a stronger dollar.
   Brokers said lower-than-expected rises in May consumer prices
and durable-goods orders reported by the government also helped
stock prices by easing fears about inflation.
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 25.24 points
late Tuesday, gained more than 50 points by early afternoon,
automatically triggering a New York Stock Exchange post-crash ban
on a computerized trading strategy called index arbitrage. The

   Share prices rose sharply Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange, boosted by a solid Wall Street opening, but
finished slightly below their best levels of the day.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 19.2 points, or 1.03 percent, at 1,879.3, marginally below
the day's high of 1,879.8.
   Trading volume was a relatively robust 521.6 million shares, up
from Tuesday's 380.2 million shares.
   The London market jumped after Wall Street opened strongly
higher. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 34.32 points
at 2,143.49 by the end of the London trading session.
   In addition, analysts said, the market was reassured after the
Bank of England signaled a hike in British interest rates by
one-half percentage point to 9 percent, with the major commercial
banks following suit around midday.
   Banking shares ended on a strong note on news that Brazil and a
committee of its major creditor banks have reached agreement in
principle to reschedule $62 billion in bank credits and provide
Brazil with $5.2 billion in new loans.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts for rain
slowed the drought-driven rally.
   Oat futures advanced their daily limit to a new record high of
$3.34 a bushel, and corn for July delivery also closed limit-up.
But soybeans finished mixed and wheat closed mostly lower on hedge
selling as the winter wheat harvest accelerated.
   Forecasts for light, scattered showers in the eastern Corn Belt
prompted a wave of profit-taking in soybean futures, said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   But corn prices were strong all day on fears that damage to the
crop was bound to worsen if the Midwest continued to swelter in
hot, dry weather.
   ``There was a little nervousness about the rain but there was
enough commercial buying to offset that,'' Gustafson said. ``Corn
has a much shorter time frame (than soybeans) for it to get some
beneficial rains.''
   Oat futures soared on reports that 50 percent of the U.S. crop
had been lost to the drought.
   At the close, wheat was 4{ cents lower to 8 cents higher with
July at $3.85 a bushel; corn was 4 cents to the limit 10 cents
higher with July at $3.44{ a bushel; oats were 7 cents to 15 cents
higher with July at $3.33 a bushel; soybeans were 11{ cents lower
to 9{ cents higher with July at $10.53 a bushel.

   Stocks surged today on news of a strengthened
dollar and lower interest rates, boosting the Dow Jones industrial
average to the highest level since the crash eight months ago.
   ``We had a beautiful fire under the stock market today,'' said
Robert O'Toole, head of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``There's just a lot of cash out there, it's coming
into play.''
   Brokers said the heavy volume and demand for big-name stocks
suggested that large institutional investors and money managers
were buying to enhance their client portfolios before the
second-quarter expires June 30, a phenomenon called ``window
dressing.''
   Lower-than-expected rises in May consumer prices and
durable-goods orders reported by the government also helped stock
prices by easing fears about inflation. That news helped rally bond
prices and pushed yields on the closely watched 30-year Treasury
bill back under 9 percent.
   But the catalyst for the rally appeared to be a surprising surge
in the dollar overseas, caused partly by an impression that leaders
of the seven major industrialized nations, who concluded a summit
Tuesday, would tolerate a higher value for the U.S. currency.
   ``The strength of the dollar this morning was what really got
things going,'' said Leigh Stevens, a strategist at PaineWebber

<TEXT>
   Nabisco Brands Inc., a major U.S. food
manufacturer, began producing Ritz crackers and other biscuits at a
plant here Wednesday, in a joint venture aimed mainly at the
Chinese market.
   Nabisco Brands Chairman James O. Welch Jr., speaking at the
inauguration of the plant in southwest Beijing, said Nabisco and
its Chinese partner ``have created one of the finest bakeries of
its kind in the world.''
   Welch said the bakery was built at a cost of $9 million, with
RJR Nabisco Inc., the parent of Nabisco Brands, providing 51
percent and Beijing Yili Food Co. the rest.
   The plant is designed to produce 40 million packages of Ritz,
Premium, Escort and Maria biscuits and crackers a year, with a
retail value of $20 million. It will employ 150 people.
   Nabisco provided the equipment and technology while Yili, a
Chinese food manufacturer with an 80-year history, supplied the
land, building and utilities, Welch said.
   Ralph Donner of RJR Nabisco China said the company will try to
export about 15 percent of its product, mainly to other Asian
countries.
   Two other RJR Nabisco companies, Del Monte and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, also have ventures in China.
   Del Monte has a pilot project near Shanghai where sweet corn is
grown, canned as creamed corn and exported, primarily to Asian
markets. R.J. Reynolds plans to open a joint venture plant in the
southeast China city of Xiamen later this year to manufacture RJR
and jointly-owned brands of cigarettes for sale in China and abroad.

<HEAD>Partnership Acquires State in Zenith</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware partnership said Wednesday it has
acquired a 7.1 percent stake in Zenith Electronics Corp. and may
seek to acquire the computer and television maker.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Brookhurst Partners Limited Partnership said it believes its
holding of 1.85 million Zenith shares makes it the company's
largest single shareholder.
   Brookhurst said in a statement that it ``does not consider
itself a passive investor and intends to encourage management to
enhance stockholder values.'' To that end, the partnership said it
was considering purchasing more Zenith shares and ``making a
proposal with respect to a business combination with Zenith.''
   A spokesman for Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith had no comment. On
Wall Street, the company's stock rose 87{ cents to close at $29.25
a share.
   Brookhurst began accumulating Zenith shares on April 25 for
about $19 a share. The partnership steadily continued its purchases
until late June, when the shares were trading in the $28 range,
according to documents provided by the partnership.
   Zenith had revenue of $2.36 billion in 1987, but reported a loss
of $19.1 million, its third consecutive annual loss. The company
attributed the shortfall to sharply reduced operating results in
its consumer electronics division as well as the ``slow and
costly'' introduction of new picture tube technology.
   Earlier this month Zenith announced it was ``continuing to
examine all options to restore overall corporate profitability to a
satisfactory level.'' Among the options the company hinted at was
the sale of the consumer electronics operations, which generated
about $1.1 billion in revenue last year.
   The consumer electronics division makes television sets,
videocassette recorders and cable products. The company's other
main business is in personal computers and computer components.
   Analysts note that Zenith is highly debt-ridden and has little
cash on hand, making it not a particularly attractive takeover
candidate.
   Zenith strengthened its shareholder-rights provision in April,
saying the takeover defense was intended to ``guard against abusive
tactics such as the gradual accumulation of shares and partial
tender offers.''
   Brookhurst said it was formed expressly to acquire Zenith
shares. The group is headed by Herbert Abelow, a former managing
director of the investment firm First Boston Corp., and Nicholas
Ihasz, who from 1976 to 1980 directed the floor trading operations
of Ivan F. Boesky & Co. The two now head Abelow Ihasz & Co. of New
York.

   The dollar took a sharp step upward Wednesday as
a wave of fresh bullish sentiment erupted in early trading overseas
and spilled over to propel the U.S. currency higher.
   Gold prices slipped. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price of $448.80 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down from $451.70 late Tuesday.
   Currency traders expressed some surprise at the jump in the
dollar, after its slightly weaker finish in Tuesday's trading. They
attributed the move to momentum that gathered force when currency
trading began in Tokyo.
   ``There was a groundswell of (dollar) buying in the Asian
trading session,'' said William Sullivan, director of money-market
research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. That set the stage for the
dollar's continued strong showing as currency trading followed in
Europe and New York.
   Traders appeared very satisfied with the outcome of the economic
summit meeting of the seven major industrialized countries in
Toronto. They focused on the communique the leaders issued Tuesday
at the meeting's conclusion, which hinted that there is room for
the dollar to continue its upward move.
   ``That statement gave the market a signal to buy dollars,'' said
Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago.
   ``This was a big jump considering the quiet trading of the past
couple of weeks,'' he added.
   The economic environment has been ripe for a stronger dollar,
considering the better-than-expected U.S. trade report for April as
well as rising interest rates.
   Curtis Perkins, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets
Group, noted that there was some profit-taking during the session.
``The dollar still finished on a strong note, even though some
profit-taking took it away a bit from the top,'' he said.
   Bullish sentiment is likely to prevail, at least in the short
term. Traders say that if corporations decide the dollar has
bottomed out, they could step up their dollar purchases and give
the currency a further lift.
   The dollar rallied strongly in European dealings. In Frankfurt,
West Germany, currency dealers said limited sales of dollars by
that country's central bank failed to halt the dollar's rise, which
they interpreted as a sign that the Bundesbank tolerated a further
rise in the U.S. currency's value.
   But European dealers late in the day said they noticed some
signs of nervousness about whether the dollar could hold at its
current, elevated levels.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar jumped 1.27 Japanese yen to close at 127.60 yen. Later
in London, it was quoted higher at 128.52 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed at 128.95 yen, up from 126.42 yen late Tuesday.
   Tokyo traders speculated that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to
intervene to support the yen until the dollar threatens to climb
above 130 yen.
   In London, a long-awaited half-percentage point rise in British
interest rates was announced, but the move had only a modest impact
on the pound, dealers said.
   By late in the trading day, the dollar had edged up against the
British pound, which was quoted at $1.7710, down from $1.7855 on
Tuesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.7658, cheaper than
Tuesday's $1.7903.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.7818 West German marks, up from 1.7550; 1.4747 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4581; 6.0025 French francs, up from 5.9223;
1,320.75 Italian lire, up from 1,301.75, and 1.2102 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2063.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.7740 West German marks, up from 1.7548; 1.4720 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4623; 5.9747 French francs, up from 5.9245;
1.9975 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9755; 1,314.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,304.00, and 1.2100 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2079.
   Gold bullion declined on the Commodity Exchange in New York. It
finished at $449.50, down from $451.80 late Tuesday.
   Gold also fell overseas, retreating in London to a late bid of
$448.50 a troy ounce, down from late Tuesday's $451. In Zurich,
Switzerland, the bid was $448.50, down from 451.50 late Tuesday.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at a bid of $451.46.
   Silver was unchanged on New York's Comex, closing at $7.177 a
troy ounce. In London the metal was quoted at a bid of $7.06 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $7.19.

   Stocks surged Wednesday on news of a
strengthened dollar, positive economic reports and eased pressure
on interest rates, boosting the Dow Jones average to the highest
level since the crash eight months ago.
   ``We had a beautiful fire under the stock market today,'' said
Robert O'Toole, head of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``There's just a lot of cash out there, it's coming
into play.''
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks jumped at the opening
bell and advanced strongly. At 1:53 p.m. it surged past the
50-point barrier that automatically triggers the New York Stock
Exchange's post-crash ``collar'' restriction on computerized
trading, aimed at curtailing market volatility.
   The restriction helped dampen the rally but by the close the Dow
average remained 43.03 points higher at 2,152.20, easily eclipsing
the previous post-crash high of 2,131.40 set a week earlier.
Broader market indices also rose.
   The catalyst for the rally appeared to be a surprising surge in
the dollar overseas, caused partly by an impression that leaders of
the seven major industrialized nations, who concluded a summit
Tuesday, would tolerate a higher value for the U.S. currency.
   ``The strength of the dollar this morning was what really got
things going,'' said Leigh Stevens, a strategist at PaineWebber
Inc. in New York. ``Everything just kicked in.''
   Others said the relatively heavy volume and demand for big-name
stocks suggested that large institutional investors and money
managers were buying to enhance their portfolios before the
second-quarter ends June 30, a phenomenon called ``window
dressing.''
   It also suggested that foreign investors, lured by the dollar's
sharply higher value, were moving back into U.S. stocks after a
prolonged absence.
   Government figures showing a lower-than-expected rise in May
consumer prices, reported Tuesday, and a decline in May
durable-goods orders, reported Wednesday, also benefited stocks by
easing fears about inflation and higher interest rates, brokers
said. Those reports helped rally bonds and push yields on the
closely watched 30-year Treasury bill back under 9 percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about an 11-to-4 ratio
in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 1,144 up, 413
down and 420 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 217.51 million shares,
up from 155.06 million the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
250.53 million shares.
   Blue-chip leader IBM was the most prominent NYSE issue, jumping
2} to 123. Analysts generally have welcomed the company's new line
of mid-range computers, unveiled Tuesday.
   Other blue chips also made notable gains. Boeing rose 1} to 57~,
Du Pont rose 4] to 92}, International Paper rose 1~ to 48\ and
Woolworth rose 1[ to 54].
   Interest-sensitive stocks advanced broadly. Chase Manhattan rose
1 to 29, First Boston rose 2] to 37|, Household International rose
1[ to 58] and Merrill Lynch rose 1 to 26\.
   IBM's advance helped some other technology stocks, including
Compaq, up to 2 to 62{, and Motorola, up 1 to 53~. But Honeywell
fell 3} to 70{ on investor disappointment that the company will
take a $23 million second-quarter charge against earnings.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and over-the-counter issues, rose $33.45 billion or 1.24
percent.
   The NYSE index of all listed issues rose 2.06 to 155.35
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 4.63 to 318.50,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 3.99 to 275.66.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.71
to 308.59. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 390.53, up 2.78.

<HEAD>Grain Price Rally Slows As Rain Enters Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for light rain in the eastern Corn Belt helped slow
the rise of grain and soybean futures prices Wednesday, but
meteorologists held out little hope for drought-breaking showers by
the July 4 weekend.
   On other markets, precious metals futures plummeted while
Treasury bond and stock-index futures posted sharp gains; livestock
and meat futures fell sharply; and energy futures advanced.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, oat futures advanced their daily
limit to a record $3.34 a bushel, and corn for July delivery closed
up the permissable limit for the seventh straight day. But the
forecasts for rain left soybeans prices mixed, and wheat was mostly
lower as harvesting of the winter crop accelerated.
   Analyst Steve Freed of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said the
predicted rainfall was unlikely to amount to much.
   ``Thirty percent of the belt has a chance for 50 percent
coverage of a quarter- to a half-inch,'' Freed said. ``To me,
that's not enough when we're losing half an inch a day.''
   The National Weather Service issued a new six-to-10-day forecast
Wednesday afternoon extending its prediction of hot, dry Midwestern
weather through July 2.
   Oat futrues soared on reports that as much as 50 percent of the
U.S. oat crop had been lost to the drought.
   Wheat settled 6{ cents lower to 5 cents higher with July at
$3.83 a bushel; corn was 4 cents to the limit 10 cents higher with
July at $3.44{ a bushel; oats were 7 cents to 15 cents higher with
July at $3.33 a bushel; soybeans were 15 cents lower to 8 cents
higher with July at $10.54{ a bushel.
   A stronger dollar and an unexpected 2.2 percent drop last month
in orders to U.S. factories for durable goods pummeled the precious
metals markets and underpinned sharp gains in stock-index and
Treasury bond futures.
   Both developments appeared to discourage inflation. That was
good news for consumers but bad news for precious metals prices,
which generally rise with inflationary expectations, analysts said.
   Platinum, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, took the
biggest hit. Platinum futures settled $14.70 to $15.10 lower with
July at $567.60 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was $2.30 to $3.60 lower
with August at $453 a troy ounce; silver was 17.5 cents to 21.8
cents lower with July at $7.02 a troy ounce.
   Treasury bond futures soared on the Chicago Board of Trade with
the contract for September delivery up 1 14-32 points at 88 3-32.
   Stock-index futures surged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Por's
500 index settled 2.55 points higher at 277.95.
   Livestock and meat traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
received a report after the close that underscored the plight
facing cattle and pork markets.
   The Agriculture Department reported there were 111.5 million
pounds of frozen pork bellies in cold storage on May 31. The figure
was 91 percent larger than last year's May 31 total and the third
largest on record for that date, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in
Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In addition to the overwhelming supply of frozen pork bellies,
which are sliced to make bacon, frozen supplies of other pork
products, poultry and beef also were up, indicating prices will
fall as the summer goes on.
   Live cattle settled .58 cent to 1.03 cents lower with August at
63.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to the limit 1.50
cents lower with August at 70.65 cents a pound; hogs were .42 cent
lower to .03 cent higher with July at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.07 cents to the limit 2 cents lower with July
at 42 cents a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 2 cents to 10 cents higher with August at $16.44
a barrel; heating oil was .34 cent to .43 cent higher with July at
43.62 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .32 cent to .50 cent
higher with July at 50.40 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>USAir: Flight Attendants Union Violated Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir Group Inc. officials told a federal
judge Wednesday that the Association of Flight Attendants persuaded
its members to refuse overtime during the Memorial Day holiday in
violation of federal labor law.
   ``It was their position that this is what the union wanted them
to do,'' USAir's Pittsburgh flight attendant supervisor, Robert
Fuhr, said of his futile attempts to call employees to work over
the three-day holiday.
   Airline managers told U.S. District Judge Robert Standish in a
courtroom overflowing with flight attendants that notices were
posted in crew lounges encouraging the overtime boycott.
   The airline, with executives based in Washington and operations
based in Pittsburgh, is asking Standish to award $2 million in
damages and to bar the union from instigating a repeat of the
disruption during the Independence Day holiday period.
   USAir said it lost at least $1 million in revenue when it was
forced to cancel 180 flights and paid at least $100,000 to
accommodate displaced holiday passengers.
   Officials of the flight attendants union deny any wrongdoing.
They have complained about a proposed lower pay scale for flight
attendants entering USAir through its merger with Pacific Southwest
Airlines.
   ``We didn't promote this action at all. We were shocked this
happened,'' Dee Maki, an AFA spokeswoman, said during a break in
the hearing.
   The hearing is expected to continue Thursday.
   The Railway Labor Act makes it illegal for a union to organize
disruptive job actions during contract negotiations, USAir
spokesman David Shipley said. Talks between USAir and
AFA-represented flight attendants at PSA got underway before
Memorial Day, he said.
   The airline has proposed bringing PSA flight attendants into the
USAir system at a 10 percent salary disadvantage that would
disappear as their pay rises over three years, Ms. Maki said.
   ``They deserve the same money,'' she said. ``They work the same
as anybody else.''
   USAir has a two-tier pay system for its flight attendants, and
the proposal for PSA workers would create two additional tiers, Ms.
Maki said.
   Shipley declined comment on the issue.
   USAir has about 3,000 flight attendants whose base salary is
$40,000 after 10 years on the job. PSA has about 1,000 flight
attendants, Shipley said.
   The union spokeswoman also said USAir does not have enough
flight attendants, and those it has are frequently called in from
off-hours and holidays. They haven't had a pay raise since 1985.
   However, in its complaint, USAir said more than a third of its
flight attendants choose to work beyond 85 hours per month, the
maximum they can be required to work by the airline. They may
volunteer to work an additional 10 hours at straight pay, but their
contract, a two-year pact expiring in August 1989, prohibits
further hours.
   ``Without the regular and predictable willingness of flight
attendants to fly over 85 hours per month, USAir would have to hire
an additional 150 flight attendants,'' Fuhr said in a deposition.
   The Federal Aviation Administration requires a minimum number of
flight attendants on board each plane, depending on the number of
passengers and other factors.

<HEAD>New Televisions Should Be Compatible With Old, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-based organization that includes Japanese
television makers has agreed that a coming generation of improved
televisions should be compatible with the existing broadcast
system, it was announced Wednesday.
   The agreement reached by a committee of the Electronic
Industries Association, while leaving many questions unanswered,
helps resolve a key point of conflict between Japanese TV makers
and the U.S. broadcasting and equipment industry.
   The committee agreed that any system which is finally adopted
should be compatible with the existing broadcast system, and that
``there should be no discernible degradation in the NTSC signal
finally received by the home viewer.''
   NTSC stands for the National Television System Committee and
refers to the existing broadcasting format, which will eventually
be replaced or relegated to a secondary role.
   The committee also agreed that there should be a smooth
transition to the new standard for high-definition television to
protect both the consumers' and broadcasters' investments.
   Japanese television makers have created a version of
high-definition television that is incompatible with the existing
U.S. broadcast system. Since Japanese TV makers are represented on
the committee of the Electronic Industries Association that met
Wednesday in Atlanta, the agreement seems to indicate their
willingness to compromise.
   Sidney Topol, chairman of Atlanta-based Scientific-Atlanta Inc.,
who is chairman of the committee on advanced television, was
scheduled to testify before a congressional committee on the issue
Thursday.

   Two ailing Texas thrifts were taken over Wednesday
by an Arizona savings bank after Federal Home Loan Bank Board
officials guaranteed $83.9 million in assistance to complete the
transaction, a part of the Southwest Plan.
   MeraBank Federal Savings and Loan, with $6.4 billion in assets,
took over First Financial _ A Savings Association, based in El
Paso; and Brownfield Federal Savings and Loan Association in
Brownfield. MeraBank, based in Phoenix, Ariz., is the largest
thrift institution in that state and the 25th-largest in the United
States.
   First Financial has seven branches in El Paso, three in
Amarillo, two in Lubbock, one in Canyon and one in Pampa.
Brownfield Federal has no branches.
   The transaction was the third under the terms of the Southwest
Plan, which aims to consolidate and recapitalize Texas' savings and
loan industry.
   MeraBank, which already has seven branches in Texas, is
contributing $8.8 million in new capital to the deal to acquire
First Financial, with $330 million in assets, and Brownfield, with
$40 million.
   MeraBank also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent Texas
thrift later this year as part of the transaction. It is forming a
separate subsidiary, MeraBank Texas, to hold the three Texas
institutions.
   The subsidiary will be based in El Paso with administrative
headquarters in Dallas. Bank board officials said they expect
MeraBank Texas to consolidate all its operations in Texas within
six to nine months.
   MeraBank officials still don't know how much in outstanding
loans they will have to write off, said Arthur Gonzalez, president
of MeraBank's Texas division.
   He said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts' loan
portfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inherited
from the ailing thrifts.
   ``This acquisition ... was a little unusual in what we agreed to
do with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board without lots of
information,'' Gonzalez said.
   ``We had to diversify ourselves,'' said Gene Rice, chairman and
chief executive officer of MeraBank. ``Any time a bank has all its
eggs in one basket, it can get in trouble. Our long-term objective
is to have 20 percent of our bank in Arizona, 20 percent in Texas
and the balance in other places.''
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures S&L
deposits up to $100,000, will hold warrants for 20 percent of the
subsidiary's stock, officials said.
   First Financial and Brownfield are the ninth and 10th savings
and loan cases resolved by federal regulators in Texas this year,
while 40 nationwide have been resolved.
   The state's institutions, hard hit by slumps in the oil industry
and Texas real estate, accounted for $3 billion of the industry's
$3.8 billion loss in the first three months of this year.
   Regulators say 133 of Texas' 279 thrifts are insolvent under
generally accepted accounting rules. The bank board hopes to reduce
the number of savings and loans in Texas by about 150 this year.
   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said MeraBank's expansion in
Texas ``will benefit Texas, the thrift industry and FSLIC.''
   Rice called the transaction ``a tremendous time-consuming
process.''
   ``They (FHLB) didn't just walk out there with a tray full of
fruit and let us pick our fruit,'' said Rice.``We had to work
together.''
   The third thrift to be acquired by MeraBank, which is based in
Phoenix, Ariz., would create a deal worth about $1 billion, he said.
   Thrift industry officials said a $1.2 billion loss at Sunbelt
Savings Association of Dallas boosted losses by Texas' savings and
loans to $3.5 billion during the first three months of 1988.
   Analysts and industry officials said the losses were not
unexpected. But House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee
Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., said Tuesday the report
raises ``extremely serious questions about the rosy scenarios being
peddled by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.''
   Operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five states
served by the Dallas office of the bank board widened during the
first quarter of 1988 to $1.1 billion from $623 million in 1987.
   Non-operating losses, primarily funds set aside to cover
non-performing assets, increased to $2.8 billion from $609 million.

<HEAD>Volvo Buying 20 Percent Of Hertz</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tomas in 6th graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ROCKLEIGH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volvo North America Corp. announced
Wednesday it is buying 20 percent of Hertz Corp., the world's
largest car rental company, for $100 million.
   The U.S. branch of the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo said it is
buying the stake from Ford Motor Co., which had held 80 percent of
Park Ridge Corp., the holding company for Hertz. The purchase is to
be completed by July 31.
   Ford now holds 60 percent of Hertz, based in Park Ridge, and the
remaining 20 percent is owned by Hertz executives.
   A Volvo statement said the purchase would allow the company,
based in Rockleigh, to increase its share in the Hertz fleet of
400,000 rental cars. A Volvo subsidiary already runs the Hertz
business in Sweden.
   Hertz has 30,000 employees in 120 countries and last year rented
20 million cars. It has about 33 percent of the U.S. car rental
market.
   Tomas Ericson, a Volvo spokesman, said Hertz's U.S. fleet now
includes between 2,000 and 2,500 Volvos. He said a ``supply
agreement'' would increase the number in the United States and
Europe but declined to disclose the figures.
   ``We felt it was a good investment in a good company,'' Ericson
said.
   ``A spinoff is that more people will experience driving Volvo
cars,'' he said. ``But we're not looking to be the major supplier.
Ford will keep that.''
   Ford and the Hertz employees formed Park Ridge Corp. and bought
the car rental company from Allegis Corp. in December 1987.
Allegis, the parent of United Air Lines, since has changed its name
to UAL Corp.
   Volvo North America was in the picture at the time of that
transaction and kept talks alive until it reached an agreement to
buy part of Ford's stake, Ericson said.
   When Ford bought into Hertz, it said it ultimately planned to
reduce its investment and become a minority owner.
   Ford officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Calls
to the company's Detroit office were not returned.
   Joe Russo, a spokesman for Hertz, said Ford wanted to ``bring in
others that would be acceptable to both Ford and Hertz.''
   He said Volvo was attractive because it is part of the car
industry, manufactures a high-quality product and already has cars
in the Hertz rental fleet.
   Ford autos make up more than half of the company's U.S. fleet
and are featured in its advertising, Russo said. The fleet includes
cars by other makers but for competitive reasons Hertz does not
disclose figures, he said.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Stock Exchange Investigating Possible Improper
Dealings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The executive vice president of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange said Wednesday the exchange is
investigating whether deadline rules were violated last week in
stock options traded for Farmers Group Inc.
   In a statement, Richard T. Chase said the investigation focuses
on possible improper dealings in stock options, which may have been
exercised after a 5:30 p.m. deadline last Friday.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in Wednesday's editions that
traders may have made up to $4 million in profits.
   The story said by exercising the stock options after the
deadline traders profited from an unexpected decision by
California's Insurance Commissioner concerning BAT Industries PLC's
$4.5 billion hostile takeover bid for Farmers. The commissioner's
decision was announced about 7 p.m. EDT.
   Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie ruled that London-based BAT is
barred from acquiring a California insurer such as Farmers because
slightly more than 10 percent of BAT's shares are owned by
government entities, including British local-government pension
funds, according to the newspaper.
   Mrs. Gillespie said in an interview that she delayed the
announcement of her decisions to make sure that Farmers securities
were no longer trading on any exchanges.
   On Monday, Farmers stock plunged $5.25 to $56.75 a share,
creating sizable profits for holders of certain options to sell
Farmers stock, the newspaper story said.
   Chase's statement said the exchange issued a special memo
Friday, ``in response to numerous inquiries,'' that rules required
customers to tell their brokers whether they wanted to exercise the
June Farmers options by 5:30 p.m. Friday.
   ``At this point the exchange believes it has identified all
member firms who exercised options,'' Chase's statement said.
   The exchange is now examining specific transactions, he said.
   The statement said that violators could face ``sanctions, which
include fines, censure or suspension.''
   The June Farmers puts were the most active stock option on the
Philadelphia Exchange on Friday, trading 7,253 contracts, according
to the report. Each contract represents 100 shares.
   William Uchimoto, the acting general counsel for the exchange,
told the newspaper the exchange is investigating dealings in about
10,000 put options, or about one million Farmers shares.

   July 17 _ Dallas-based LTV Corp., a giant steel, aerospace and
energy concern files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code reorganization
in New York.
   Dec. 16 _ LTV's steel subsidiary, Cleveland-based LTV Steel Co.,
tells the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. that it will no
longer contribute to three steel industry pension plans.

<TEXT>
   Jan. 12 _ The PBGC, saying the three plans are underfunded by
some $2 billion, terminates them and takes over as trustee of the
pensions for some 77,000 retirees.
   The PBGC, LTV's largest creditor by virtue of the pension plan
takeover, also eliminates benefits that are not covered by its
guarantees, trimming monthly benefits for about 7,000 LTV
pensioners by as much as $400 a month.
   Jan. 16 _ The United Steelworkers of America sues in bankruptcy
court to restore the cut benefits, claiming they have placed severe
hardships on retirees and their families.
   April _ With bankruptcy court approval, LTV Steel makes a single
hardship payment to each retiree, totaling $6.7 million.
   June 25 _ Steelworker local presidents approve a collective
bargaining agreement with LTV Steel, replacing most of the benefits
lost when the PBGC took over the plans. LTV says the pact is
necessary to avoid a crippling strike.
   July 30 _ Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland approves the
LTV-union pact, over the objections of the PBGC which claimed the
company was taking unfair advantage of federal funds to cut costs
and gain labor peace.
   September _ The PBGC shifts responsibility for the pension plans
back to LTV. LTV, claiming the action violates the automatic stay
against actions against debtor companies in reorganization, gets a
bankruptcy court order compelling the PBGC to show why it shouldn't
be held in contempt. The PBGC, in turn, moves to have the issue
heard on the higher, district court level.
   Nov. 24 _ U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet rules the dispute
should be heard in district court level because of ``issues of
national importance ...''

   June 22 _ Sweet throws out the PBGC decision to turn
responsibility for the pension plans. He says the agency can't
force LTV to reassume the pension obligations based on the evidence
it presented, but says it might be able to establish, at a trial,
LTV's ability to handle the pension funds.

<HEAD>Exchange Reorganized, Officials Resign in Wake of Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The director of the Mexico Stock Exchange and
its operations chief, who has been in a coma since attempting
suicide, have resigned after the disappearance of $7 million
through what exchange officials have called ``administrative
regularities.''
   The stock exchange, which announced the resignations Wednesday,
has issued statements reassuring investors and rejecting persistent
suggestions of fraud.
   The exchange's governing council accepted the resignations of
director-general Mario Segura Quiroz and operations director
Reynaldo Hernandez Balsaldua at a special meeting Tuesday night, it
was announced.
   The government newspaper El Nacional said Hernandez has been in
a coma since shooting himself on May 13 at the exchange. It did not
explain how he tendered his resignation.
   Stock exchange president Alfredo Harp Helu issued a statement
saying an internal inquiry will be continued. Officials say the
shortage could reach about $8.5 million.
   Harp Helu pegged the missing money to a single account but said
that ``unfortunately, the personal events affecting the director of
operations have blocked a precise understanding of the problem.''
   The council appointed Guillermo Nunez the interim director and
increased the dues of exchange members to finance the
reorganization. Details of the restructuring were not announced.
   The Mexican stock exchange was one of the world's hottest
markets last year but went into a drastic skid after the worldwide
fall in October. Exchange officials have been struggling to restore
confidence in the market since.
   As rumors about the missing money grew, nervous stock exchange
officials insisted the shortage had not affected investors and said
the members of the exchange have chipped in to replace the funds.
   Asked last week to explain the difference between fraud and a
mere shortage Harp Helu said that ``fraud is when there is a
criminal question that judicial authorities must assess. `Missing'
is when we don't have something and we replace it right away.''
   He also said the exchange had drawn up a code of ethics.
   Despite the growing controversy, the stock exchange has
continued to operate normally.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has passed a law that makes ``Scotch''
a protected trademark.
   Under the measure, no whisky can be called Scotch unless it
conforms to standards set by the Scotch Whisky Association: matured
for at least three years, in oak casks with charred insides, and
using only Scottish ingredients like Highland water.
   The law passed the House of Lords on Tuesday and now awaits the
formality of the Queen's signature, said Bill Walker, a Scottish
lawmaker for the ruling Conservative Party and sponsor of the bill.
   The new law would empower whisky distillers to prosecute anyone
violating Scotch standards, Walker said Wednesday. He said it was
modeled on a law that prevents drinks being called champagne unless
they come from the province of Champagne in France and conform to
its standards.
   Walker said more than 90 percent of Scotch is exported, and
earns Scotland $1.8 billion a year.

<HEAD>Suit Over Suzuki Samurai Filed In Federal Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey man has filed a class-action
suit against the maker of the Suzuki Samurai, which has been the
subject of claims that it can roll over when steered sharply to
avoid an accident.
   Paul Asarian said in his federal court suit that American Suzuki
Motor Corp. of Brea, Calif., knew of a design defect as far back as
1985 but didn't tell the public.
   The defect can't be fixed, and even if it could, the value of
his Englewood-bought Samurai would be diminished, Asarian charged.
He is seeking to represent other Samurai owners as a class, damages
and a requirement that the company buy back the vehicles.
   He said 150,000 of the four-wheel drive vehicles have been sold
in the past three years.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, gave the model
an ``unacceptable'' rating.
   Other suits against Suzuki have been filed in Philadelphia and
Chicago.
   The company could not be reached for comment Wednesday. It
referred calls to its public relations firm, and no one returned a
message from the firm, Rogers & Associates of Los Angeles.
   Suzuki says the vehicle is safe.

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allis-Chalmers Corp. announced Wednesday an
agreement to sell its pump business to International Telephone and
Telegraph Corp. for $71 million in cash.
   Allis-Chalmers, a once-giant farm equipment manufacturer, filed
for Chapter 11 under the federal bankruptcy code last year.
   ``The agreement, which contemplates completion of the sale
during the fourth quarter of 1988, is the final agreement necessary
to complete our reorganization plan strategy for the sale or merger
of our principal businesses as going concerns,'' said Wendell F.
Bueche, chairman and chief executive officer of Allis-Chalmers.
   The purchase price of the pump business is subject to review by
parties in the Chapter 11 proceedings and approvals by the
Allis-Chalmers and ITT boards of directors.
   The business is operated by Cincinnati-based Allis-Chalmers Pump
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allis-Chalmers Corp. There are
about 315 employees in Cincinnati and Milwaukee and another 150 in
Canada.
   The primary manufacturing facilities are in Cincinnati and
Guelph, Ontario, with other plants located in Brampton, Sudbury and
Elliott Lake, Ontario.
   ITT said its new acquisition will be incorporated in its current
form into ITT Fluid Technology Corp., producer of a broad range of
fluid handling and control products. ITT Corp., a diversified
conglomerate, makes and sells a range of products, including
automotive, defense and space equipment.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 200 retired miners fearing the loss of
their health care benefits next month in the bankruptcy court
reorganization of LTV Corp. picketed the offices of the United Mine
Workers Health and Retirement Fund here Wednesday.
   The miners, some accompanied by their wives, complained that the
UMW fund has not yet promised to pick up their health care coverage
when a bankruptcy court-ordered mandate for LTV to continue it
expires July 15.
   However, UMW officials said the company and the union reached an
agreement last week for LTV to continue financing the coverage
until the issue of who is responsible is resolved in either the
bankruptcy or other courts.
   The agreement still has to be approved by a bankruptcy court in
New York, where LTV is being reorganized while seeking protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Wearing placards protesting ``Why do we have to beg for our
health cards?'' some of the miners directed their ire at UMW
President Richard Trumka, while others met with officials at the
union's headquarters five blocks away.
   ``Mr. Trumka sold us down the river on this,'' complained
Raymond Rush, a retired miner from Carmichels, Pa. ``We don't know
whether they are going to pick up our coverage or not.''
   The demonstration was planned before the union was able to
notify the affected UMW-covered LTV retirees and their spouses,
according to John Duray, a union spokesman.
   In a letter dated Tuesday, Trumka told the retirees, ``I have
every reason to believe your medical benefits will continue
uninterrupted and indefinitely.''
   Affected are 1,485 retired UMW members, and their spouses, who
formerly worked at 11 mines in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West
Virginia that were owned at one time by the giant steel, aerospace
and energy company.
   LTV has left the coal business entirely since filing its
bankruptcy court petition in July 1986. But it has agreed to
continue the benefits forever to about 600 of the miners and their
spouses who worked at five mines sold to other companies.
   LTV, however, maintains that the UMW Health and Retirement Fund
has the obligation under the union's contract with the coal
industry to pick up the health care costs for retirees at five
mines that the company has retained ownership of but closed in the
past two years.
   ``While several legal issues are involved, the bottom line is
simple,'' Trumka said.
   ``Unlike other companies which have refused to pay those
benefits while the issue is being decided in court, LTV will ask
the bankruptcy court to allow the company to continue those
benefits until the issue of responsibility is ultimately resolved.''
   Courts in the past have shifted the obligation for continuing
lifetime health coverage provided under UMW contracts to a benefit
trust established by the union in 1974 as a ``safety net'' to
handle cases where companies go out of business. The industry now
pays 8 cents for every hour worked by a miner into that fund, Drury
said.
   Robert Waime of Nemacolin, Pa., one of the picketing retirees,
said their fear was that they may be without any health coverage
``for weeks'' between the time LTV stopped the benefits and the UMW
fund picks them up.

<HEAD>ICC Directs Regional Railroad to Take Over D&H Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission moved
Wednesday to assure that shippers on the Delaware & Hudson Railroad
will continue to have rail service after the ailing railroad shuts
down.
   The Delaware and Hudson filed for protection from creditors
under the federal bankruptcy laws earlier this week and had given
notice that it would stop service within days.
   ICC Chairman Heather Gradison said the railroad planned to stop
service at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.
   As a result, she said, the commission directed in an emergency
order that the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway, another
regional rail line in the Northeast, assume the service of the D&H.
   The D&H, a subsidiary of Guilford Railroad Co., provides service
over nearly 1,700 miles of track in Vermont, New York,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia.
   In Cooperstown, N.Y., David Soule, executive vice president of
Delaware & Otsego Corp., parent of the New York, Susquehanna &
Western, said the railroad would take over the D&H operations
whenever it officially stops operations.
   ``At that time we are all set to begin operating on D&H
tracks,'' he said.
   The New York State Department of Transportation had asked the
ICC to take the emergency action, saying the shutdown of the D&H
``will create a transportation crisis in the Northeast.''
   The New York department said in a petition to the ICC that
continued operation of services over the D&H rail network was
essential for the economic well-being of New York State and the
surrounding region.
   The ICC ordered the New York, Susquehanna and Western to provide
the service without compensation for 45 days, during which the
commission would determine what essential services should be
further continued on an emergency basis.
   Both railroads had offered to provide the service without
compensation, as had Conrail. But the ICC said it selected the New
York, Susquehanna and Western over Conrail because the selection
``would raise fewer potential competitive issues during the interim
period.''
   The D&H said last Friday that it planned to file for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act and did so on
Monday. The railroad cited the collapse of efforts to win labor
concessions as a key reason for the filing, saying that under
current labor contracts it could not run the railroad profitably.
   Guilford officials claimed that the D&H lost $8.1 million last
year and at least $8 million so far this year. Guilford, based in
North Billerica, Mass., bought the railroad in 1984.
   The D&H listed assets of $75.9 million and liabilities of $108.4
million.
   Dennis Watson, an ICC spokesman, said the commission is inviting
offers from other railway lines to take over the D&H lines after
the term of the temporary operation has expired.
   ``The ICC will be conducting an analysis of the D&H lines for
essential service and at least the temporary continuation of
service to critical shipping points that do not receive other
railroad service,'' he said.

<HEAD>Batus Sues California Insurance Regulators Over Rejection of
Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc. sued the California Insurance
Department Wednesday, seeking to reverse the department's ruling
that Batus cannot take over Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
   The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that
state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie misinterpreted the
law in denying Batus permission to operate a California insurance
company.
   Ms. Gillespie found the Louisville, Ky., company unfit because a
significant amount of the stock of its parent, BAT Industries PLC
of Britain, is held by government entities.
   The suit also alleged that if Ms. Gillespie's interpretation of
the law were correct, the law would be unconstitutional.
   California is one of nine states where Batus' hostile $4.5
billion takeover effort must be approved by insurance regulators.
Arizona, the only other state to rule, has approved the takeover.
   A spokeswoman said Ms. Gillespie was unavailable to comment on
the suit.
   On Friday, after she issued her ruling, Ms. Gillespie said the
ruling on government ownership was in keeping with previous
commission decisions.
   Farmers' management is resisting a merger with Batus, which is
offering stockholders $63 a share for Farmers stock.
   About 13 percent of BAT stock is owned by more than 100
government and government-related entities, including city councils
and government pension funds in Britain, Batus said.
   Batus noted the commissioner's report didn't find any indication
the government shareholders ever had attempted to influence
business decisions of BAT or Batus.
   The commissioner found Batus met other criteria for ownership of
a California insurer. The commissioner ruled a takeover would not
substantially lessen competition in the industry and that Batus did
notintend to sell Farmers' assets or make substantial management
changes.
   The commissioner discounted arguments that Batus, a tobacco
company, might discontinue non-smoker discounts at Farmers and that
cigarette product liability suits might drain its resources.
   Batus owns paper, tobacco and retailing operations, Saks Fifth
Avenue stores and the maker of Kool cigarettes.
   Farmers is the nations third-largest home and auto insurer and
seventh-largest property and casualty insurer.

<HEAD>Murdoch Modifies Propsal To Put Station In Trust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Rupert Murdoch modified his proposal
to put his Boston television station in an independent trust after
concerns were raised by a public interest law firm.
   Murdoch's News America Publishing Inc. last week proposed the
trust agreement to comply with Federal Communications Commission
rules barring single ownership of a TV station and a daily
newspaper in the same city.
   Under those rules, Murdoch faces a June 30 deadline to dispose
of WFXT-TV, a Boston UHF station, or the Boston Herald newspaper.
   Under terms of the trust agreement, Murdoch would relinquish
control of the station to former Sen. Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts and former New York Gov. Hugh Carey. The station
could be sold for more than $35 million if Murdoch agrees to the
financial terms.
   Murdoch's lawyers amended the proposal this week to add that the
trust managers ``shall use their best efforts'' to sell the station
for a price Murdoch considers reasonable. Additionaly, it adds the
purpose of the trust is not only to comply with the cross-ownership
rules, but also to permit continued operation of the station while
the trust managers find a buyer.
   Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access
Project, a Washington, D.C.-based public interest law firm, had
raised concerns that the initial proposal lacked emphasis on the
trust managers' efforts to sell the station.
   Schwarztman, in a filing with the FCC Wednesday on behalf of the
Committee for Media Diversity, a coalition formed to support
retention of the cross-ownership rules, said the group is satisfied
that Murdoch's amended proposal meets the terms of the FCC's policy
on trusts. But the group still questions the ``wisdom and
legality'' of the policy, he said.

   Brazil on Wednesday reached agreement on
a $5.8 billion refinancing of its foreign private debt, the largest
in the Third World, but said the pact did not formally end its
moratorium on interest payments.
   The accord with the nation's private bankers, the first major
agreement since the moratorium was invoked in February 1987,
includes $5.2 billion in new loans.
   ``After eight months of long and difficult negotiations, Brazil
concluded one of the best refinancing accords ever reached by a
debtor nation,'' Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega said at a news
conference.
   He said the accord, which was simultaneously announced in New
York, did not `formally revoke'' Brazil's foreign debt payment
moratorium.
   Da Nobrega said ``it is possible'' the moratorium would end
formally once Brazil's 700 creditor banks agreed to Wednesday's
refinancing plan, which was closed in New York with the committee
of 14 banks representing all the country's private creditors.
   ``The accord is not a solution to the country's foreign debt
problems,'' da Nobrega said. ``But it removes the biggest obstacle
in our relations with the international financial community and
eliminates uncertainties over the national economy.''
   The agreement covers interest due in 1987, 1988 and the first
half of 1989. It gives Brazil $5.2 billion in new money to be paid
back over a 20 years, with an eight-year grace period.
   That money will go toward paying the interest on the long-term
debt with private banks, which is $63.6 billion.
   Brazil owes a total of $121 billion to private bankers and
government institutions.
   The accord also gives Brazil an additional $600 million in
short-term credit lines towards the financing of exports and
imports.
   Da Nobrega said the accord eliminates links with the
International Monetary Fund, a politically sensitive issue.
However, a $600 million payment is dependent on Brazil meeting IMF
economic guidelines currently being worked out with the fund in a
separate agreement.
   ``Brazil is the first country to sign a medium-term accord
without having to have any rigid links with the fund,'' said the
finance minister.
   He said Brazil would make a $345 million payment on its March
private debt interest on Friday. Through the end of June, Brazil
will then pay $1 billion in interest due in April and May.
   The agreement's interest rate spread _ the extra interest
charged to high-risk clients above international interest rates _
of 0.8125 Percent, is one of the lowest worldwide, da Nobrega said.
   In addition, da Nobrega said banks holding Brazilian debt would
be able to swap it for investments in local enterprises. This
applies mainly to smaller banks and will go into effect one year
after the 700 creditor banks approve the accord.
   Banks have three years to make the transfer of debt for
investments at a maximum rate of $50 million monthly and with a
limit of $1.8 billion.
   Da Nobrega said the accord allows Brazil to pull out of the
agreement if there are any ``external economic shocks that impair
Brazil's ability to meet interest payments.'' He said this could
apply to even a drop in Brazil's trade surplus, which has been
averaging more than $1 billion monthly.

<HEAD>Oil Companies May Get Partial Court Costs in Price-Fixing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four states that accused the oil industry of
conspiring to create the gasoline shortage of the mid-1970s may
have to pay eight oil companies $1.3 million in court costs
stemming from an adverse court ruling, attorneys said Wednesday.
   The states and the companies agreed to the $1.3 million amount
in a settlement approved here by U.S. District Judge William P.
Gray, who dismissed the states' price-fixing suit in November 1986.
At the time, Gray awarded the companies court costs, but there was
protracted wrangling over the amount.
   However, the states of California, Arizona, Oregon and
Washington have appealed the dismissal of the suit to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Gray's order approving the payment of court costs doesn't take
effect unless the companies prevail on appeal, said Mary Elizabeth
Alden, the assistant California attorney general handling the case.
   The $1.3 million award, announced Wednesday by defendant Mobil
Corp. of New York, would be split among Mobil; Atlantic Richfield
Co. of Los Angeles; Chevron Corp. of San Francisco; Gulf Oil Corp.,
now a part of Chevron; Exxon Corp of New York; Shell Oil Co. of
Houston; Texaco Inc. of White Plains, N.Y.; and Unocal Corp. of Los
Angeles.
   The settlement didn't specify how much each state would pay, Ms.
Alden said.
   The states, in suits filed separately between 1973 and 1977,
accused all 16 major U.S. oil companies of conspiring to fix prices
by creating the oil crisis of the mid-1970s. The states sought
unspecified damages that attorneys believed would have totaled
billions of dollars.
   The suits were consolidated before Gray, who ruled in dismissing
the suit that the states hadn't presented any evidence of a
conspiracy.
   The state of Florida originally was a party to the case but
withdrew. Eight of the oil companies settled out of court.
   The appeal is scheduled for a July 15 hearing in Pasadena.

<HEAD>Utility Gets Bankruptcy Plan Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire
on Wednesday received a seven-month extension during which it will
have the exclusive right to offer a bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   Financial problems stemming from its investment in the stalled
Seabrook nuclear power plant prompted company to seek federal
bankruptcy reorganization protection earlier this year.
   The company's period of exclusivity was extended until Dec. 27,
a month less than the utility sought. The original 120-day period
of exclusivity expired May 27.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge James Yacos also ruled that the
state will have full intervenor standing in the case. He allowed
limited standing to the state's consumer advocate and the Business
and Industry Association on certain issues.
   ``The intended result of this ruling is to grant the state ...
an unquestioned place at the bargaining table,'' Yacos said.
   Standing was denied to the state of Connecticut, Seacoast
Anti-Pollution League, Campaign for Ratepayers' Rights and Citizens
Within a 10-mile Radius, an anti-Seabrook group.
   Nicholas Ashooh, a company spokesman, said the utility was
satisfied with the extension.
   ``We have a lot of work to do between now and then. We'll do our
very best'' to meet the new deadline, he said.
   Yacos said the company has until Feb. 28 to get its
reorganization plan accepted by other parties and creditors.
   The complexities of the finances, regulatory questions and the
uncertain fate of the $5.4 billion Seabrook plant _ completed but
held up in regulatory challenges _ made the extra time essential,
Yacos said.
   He said the case, apparently the fourth-largest in terms of
assets and liabilities, which exceed $2 billion, was unprecedented.
   The utility employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of more
than $50 million. The utility serves nearly 75 percent of New
Hampshire's population of more than 1 million.

<HEAD>Papermaker Gets Buyout Overture From Executives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fort Howard Corp. said Wednesday some of
its executives have indicated they want to purchase the
paper-making company, sending its stock price sharply higher.
   A company statement disclosing the overture did not identify the
people seeking to develop a leveraged buyout proposal, and
indicated no formal offer had been submitted.
   The managers considering a buyout may get backing from interests
outside the corporation, and there was no guarantee the company
would endorse the move, the statement read.
   Fort Howard's stock leaped $8.12{ a share to close at $48.37{ on
the New York Stock Exchange, on the heels of a $1.12{ a share rise
on Tuesday amid buyout speculation.
   Based on Wednesday's closing stock price and Fort Howard's
approximately 67.4 million common shares outstanding, the company
has a market value of about $3.3 billion.
   Fort Howard went public in 1970. Company directors and
executives hold an estimated 7 million of its outstanding common
shares, about 10.4 percent.
   The Green Bay-based company employs 17,000 people worldwide,
including about 3,200 in Wisconsin. It reports annual sales
exceeding $1.5 billion.

<HEAD>Pillsbury's Restaurant Head Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Pillsbury Co.'s full service
restaurant subsidiary has resigned, the company announced Wednesday.
   The resignation of Kyle T. Craig, chairman and chief executive
officer of S&A Restaurant Corp., comes amid a major management
shakeup and follows Pillsbury's loss of a significant market share
in key consumer food businesses to General Mills Inc. and others in
recent months.
   Craig joined Pillsbury's Burger King Corp. in 1978 and has had
responsibility for Pillsbury's full service restaurants, which
include the Steak and Ale and Bennigan's chains, since August 1985.
   Pillsbury Chairman William Spoor recently abolished Pillsbury's
restaurant group superstructure and shuffled executives, who now
report directly to him.
   On Monday, Pillsbury said J. Jeffrey Campbell had resigned as
chairman and chief executive of its restaurant group, which he had
headed since May 1987.
   In a statement on Wednesday, Spoor said Craig had made
significant contributions to the full-service restaurant group and
the company was ``grateful'' to him.
   In recent months, Pillsbury experienced declining sales at
Burger King and its other restaurants.
   In response, the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant business
has closed weak stores, deposed its former chairman, eliminated
more than 200 white-collar employees and taken $141 million in
after-tax charges to restructure around its cornerstone businesses.
   Spoor had reiterated on Tuesday that the company would not sell
Burger King and would resist any takeover attempts. Pillsbury has
been the subject of takeover rumors since last winter, partly
because of its financial performance.
   Next week, the company will report drastically lower net
earnings of about $70 million for fiscal 1988 and slightly improved
sales of $6.2 billion. Operating profits, before writeoffs, will be
up slightly from fiscal 1987.
   Pillsbury plans to invest heavily in its remaining, core
businesses: Burger King; Bennigan's; Distron, its troubled fast
food distribution service; Green Giant; refrigerated dough; frozen
pizza; dessert mix; fish and ice cream.

<HEAD>Large Sale of Savings Units Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large Phoenix savings institution may be
allowed to buy a number of insolvent Texas savings and loan
associations, according to savings industry officials quoted in a
report published Wednesday.
   The New York Times reported that the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board is close to completing a deal that would eventually let
Merabank F.S.B. of Phoenix, a $6.5 billion savings institution,
acquire Texas associations with assets totalling several billion
dollars.
   Merabank plans to enter into an initial agreement to acquire a
few insolvent Texas institutions now, and more soon if the initial
transactions are successful, The Times quoted industry sources as
saying.
   The sources said the first part of the transaction is expected
to be announced soon, as early as Wednesday. It would be the third
in a series of deals announced by the bank board to sell off more
than 150 insolvent thrifts in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana with
assets of $50 billion, which have been suffering huge losses due to
depressed real estate prices.
   Officials of both the bank board and Merabank declined comment
on the negotiations, The Times said.
