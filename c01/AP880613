   Louis L'Amour, whose Old West novels about
gunfighters, lawmen and drifters drew on his colorful past as a
gold prospector, roustabout and jack-of-all-trades, died Friday of
lung cancer. He was 80.
   He wrote 101 books, nearly all of them Westerns, including
``Hondo,''``How the West Was Won,'' ``The Iron Marshal,'' ``The
Quick and the Dead,'' ``Sackett's Land,'' and ``Ride the Dark
Trail.''
   Nearly 200 million copies of L'Amour's books were printed; his
works were translated into 20 languages, according to his
publisher, Bantam Books.
   L'Amour left home in Jamestown, N.D., when he was 15, working as
prize fighter, deckhand, longshoreman, lumberjack, gold prospector,
coal miner, circus roustabout, fruit picker, elephant handler and
amateur archaeologist.
   He became a prolific contributor in the 1940s and 1950s to pulp
magazines and his first novel, ``Hondo,'' was published in 1953. It
was followed by 85 more, along with 14 short story collections and
one non-fiction book.
   In 1984, President Reagan presented L'Amour with the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
   L'Amour is survived by his wife Kathy, and a son and daughter.

   Robert Bruce Stewart, retired Purdue
University treasurer and executive who administered billions of
dollars in GI Bill veterans benefits, died Friday in Vero Beach,
Fla. He was 92.
   Stewart's 36 years with Purdue began in 1925 as its controller.
In 1945 he was named vice president and treasurer, a post he held
until his retirement in 1961.
   After World War II, as administrator of Veteran Affairs Advisory
Committee on Vocational Rehabilitation, Education and Training,
Stewart coordinated $14.5 billion in G.I. Bill benefits for 8
million veterans.
   He successfully fought President Harry S. Truman's request that
the Veterans Administration examine all textbooks used by veterans
to make sure they did not support communist doctrine.
   Born in Duluth, Minn., Stewart graduated from the University of
Wisconsin, earned his doctorate from Butler University and taught
in Minnesota and Wisconsin. He was business manager of Albion
College before coming to Purdue.
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Simon Stewart.

<HEAD>China's Presence In Hong Kong Is Everywhere _ And Expanding</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High above Hong Kong's imposing skyline, the
final girders are swinging into place atop the Bank of China's
striking prism-shaped building.
   The 70-story glass-and-steel building, to be the local
headquarters of mainland China's official bank, is a
none-too-subtle symbol of China's unrivaled influence and growing
activity in this British colony which reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
   Communist China's soaring presence is a result of
market-oriented economic reforms championed by Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping in Beijing and the part of the agreement with Britain that
says Hong Kong can keep its capitalist system for 50 years after
1997.
   Chinese officials of various ranks are invading Hong Kong for a
crash course in capitalism and to secure money-making deals. The
big Chinese companies are wheeling and dealing in Hong Kong's
high-flying property market, investing in major construction
projects and even buying large blocks of local stock.
   Chinese diplomats are busy too.
   Xu Jiatun, China's top diplomat in Hong Kong, shows up at pop
concerts and cocktail parties. He heads the local branch of China's
official Xinhua News Agency but is viewed by many as the colony's
shadow government.
   Xu's main task is to promote stability and prosperity in Hong
Kong, and he is full of kind words for its capitalist society.
   ``We have some comrades who always fear capitalism, but in fact
they don't understand that the modern capitalist system is a great
creation of human civilization,'' he has told reporters.
   No official figures are available to show how many China-backed
companies are in Hong Kong, but estimates run into the thousands.
China is widely regarded as the largest foreign investor in Hong
Kong, with estimates ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.
   The investments include department stores, factories,
supermarkets and real estate. Much of the activity is financed by
the 14-member Bank of China group, which saw profits rise by 30
percent to 60 percent in 1987, according to the Capital Information
Services financial research firm.
   China's property purchases in Hong Kong totaled about $1 billion
last year, exceeded only by Japanese and local investors, according
to William Kwan of Chesterton Petty, an international property
consulting company. China snatched up hotels, office buildings and
residential high-rises.
   ``They have to support the political confidence of people'' in
the years before 1997, Kwan said, noting that the injection of
Chinese capital creates demand and raises real estate prices.
   Some deals reflect the need for more space by expanding Chinese
companies while other deals are strictly to make money.
   China International Trust and Investment Corp., for example,
bought an office building near the central business district for
about $45 million in May 1987 and then sold it to Japanese
interests five months later for a 35 percent profit, according to
Chesterton Petty.
   Other Chinese moves that have turned heads in Hong Kong include:
   _Bailouts of financially troubled Hong Kong banks and a pledge
by the Bank of China of the equivalent in Hong Kong dollars of $128
million to save the colony's teetering futures exchange after the
global stock market crash in October.
   _The purchase by CITIC, which is China's premier international
investment company, of 12.5 percent of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.,
the territory's profitable flag carrier.
   _Participation of three Chinese companies in three competing
consortia bidding for a multimillion-dollar tunnel project through
the suburban New Territories.
   Matching China's flurry of economic activity in Hong Kong has
been its expanded political work.
   From the Xinhua headquarters across the street from the Happy
Valley race track, a staff of several hundred stay in touch with
nearly every sector of society.
   Hong Kong's Chinese-language Wide Angle magazine reported that
the news agency has separate departments responsible for keeping in
touch with the Hong Kong government, students, grass-root
organizations and the colony's elite.
   Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political science lecturer at Chinese
University of Hong Kong, says China's plan to win over local
residents is ``a longtime process of befriending us, of co-opting
us, so when the Chinese come (in 1997) there's a very good chance
of us being immobilized or at least neutralized.''
   One group that China has successfully cultivated is the power
elite, who believe toeing the Beijing line is the best way to keep
their businesses healthy after 1997.
   China also can count on several local organizations to support
its policies here.
   For example, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, which
represents about 170,000 workers, mobilized its members last year
to support China's opposition to general legislative elections in
Hong Kong this year.
   This, along with the colonial government's decision to delay
elections until 1991, has led some local activists to believe China
already is calling the shots in Hong Kong.

   Tiffany, the 16-year-old pop star who sued
for freedom from her mother, believes she and her mother will
overcome their differences.
   In an interview conducted before she agreed to withdraw her
petition to be legally recognized as an adult, Tiffany vowed she
wouldn't go home again, but not because she doesn't like her mother.
   ``I love my mom and my mom loves me,'' she said. ``We'll
overcome this. Hopefully I'll be emancipated. I still want to be
emancipated and have not at all changed my mind. But I don't think
my mom at all is saying, `If you get emancipated I'll never talk to
you again.' That's just not my mom.''
   Terms of Tuesday's settlement between Tiffany and her mother,
Janie Williams, were not disclosed.
   ``This whole court thing in some people's eyes has been made out
to be such a bad thing, but it's really reality,'' said Tiffany,
who filed emancipation papers for legal status as an adult in March
after her mother refused to approve a management contract between
the singer and George Tobin, her manager.
   Tiffany has scored on the pop charts with remakes of '60s hits
such as ``I Saw Her Standing There'' and ``I Think We're Alone
Now.''

   Heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson, whose wife,
actress Robin Givens, is pregnant, says he hopes his children never
have to take the punches he's had to.
   ``I can't wait to have a little baby so I can strap her into one
of those pouches and walk her around,'' the 22-year-old Tyson said
in July's Life magazine.
   ``It will be good to see my kids have some things I never had
and see how they respond to it,'' he said. ``That's why I take the
punches, so they'll never have to.''
   ``He's the only man I know who can articulate what he truly
needs,'' said Givens, 23, star of ABC-TV's ``Head of the Class.''
   It's the closeness of this couple, who have been married five
months, that Life magazine says has people in the boxing world
worried that Tyson may be distracted and never achieve his full
potential in the ring.
   But Tyson, who has won 34 straight and will defend his crown on
June 27 against Michael Spinks in Atlantic City, isn't worried.
   ``I don't own the title, I just borrowed it for a while,'' Tyson
said. ``There's life beyond that.''

   The country-music band Alabama drew
35,000 people to its seventh annual charity concert, and lead
singer Randy Owen says past problems won't stand in the way of
future June Jams.
   Saturday's crowd was far below the 61,000 who attended in 1986,
when Alabama was at the peak of its popularity. But last year's
June Jam was hit with heavy rain and paid attendance fell to
20,000, leaving no money for charity.
   The first five June Jams raised $1.5 million.
   Because of last year's problems, Owen and other band members
fought rumors that this year's concert would not occur. Once plans
became final, band members had to dispel rumors that this would be
the last.
   Entertainers joining Alabama for the daylong concert included
the Charlie Daniels Band, Exile, K.T. Oslin, Carl Perkins, the
Bellamy Brothers, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Dan Seals, Gary Morris
and Ricky Van Shelton.
   Owen says he's making plans to mark the state's homecoming
celebration, Alabama Reunion, at June Jam VIII. Festivities will
include having the Alabama Symphony Orchestra join the band on
stage to perform its hit ``My Home's in Alabama.''

   Lily Tomlin, whose humor is as sly as Bette
Midler's is raucous, says she and Midler, her co-star in the newly
released comedy ``Big Business,'' have a ``similar heart'' despite
their differences.
   The two comedians pointed out their contrasting acting styles in
this week's People magazine. ``I immerse myself totally in the
character and prepare everything before hand,'' said Tomlin, 47.
   ``I don't like to think too much,'' said the 42-year-old Midler.
   In ``Big Business,'' the actresses play two sets of identical
twins who were mixed up at birth by a shortsighted nurse.
   Tomlin says of her opposite number, ``Obviously she's a
fantastic performer. But there's a lot more to Bette than the
Divine Miss M. There's this tenderness and frailty and a wonderful
kind of dearness that's truly touching.''
   She adds, ``There is something about us that has a similar
center, a similar heart. We're both kind of outrageous but with a
down-to-earth core. I like Bette tremendously because she's out
there, bawdy, then sweet and real.''

   Nearly 2,000 people brought their
motorcycles, motor homes and pickups to a three-day rock revival
featuring the New Riders of the Purple Sage, Big Brother & The
Holding Company, Canned Heat, Spirit and Black Oak Arkansas.
   The festival, dubbed The Boondock Bikers Bash, started Friday in
a remote cow pasture near this tiny eastern Utah town.
   Law enforcement officials had braced for potential problems, but
most of those in attendance seemed content to listen to the music
and make an occasional sojourn into neighboring towns.
   ``We're not here to prove anything to anybody,'' insisted Jim
Baker of the sponsoring group, American Bikers Aiming Toward
Education, which opposes mandatory motorcycle helmet laws.
   ``But I think the public would be surprised by what they'd see
here,'' he said. ``I think they'd see that we're no different than
any other diverse group of people _ cowboys, Mormons or whoever.''

   Ending a trans-Pacific boat ride, 16 bleary-eyed
performing pachyderms were greeted at a Tokyo pier by
confetti-tossing Shinto priests.
   Cranes at Tokyo Bay unloaded the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and
Bailey Circus performers on Sunday from a cargo ship that left
Oakland, Calif. June 1.
   The elephants, whose weight ranges up to 14,000 pounds,
dutifully lined up for photographers. One youngster executed a
polite bow.
   A pair of Shinto priests in ceremonial caps and robes waved
twigs at the pachyderms and threw confetti across their trunks, a
slight departure from traditional purification rites. The ritual
also bestowed hopes for success and safety for the circus' 15-week
tour of Japan.
   Ringling's lions, horses, camels, llamas and chimpanzees arrived
earlier to meet quarantine requirements. A circus official said
humans and elephants were the only animals Japanese authorities
exempted.
   The elephants continue on to the northern city of Sapporo, where
the American circus opens its first overseas tour on July 1.

   Jiang Qing, the ailing widow of the late
Communist Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and a key figure in the
tumultuous Cultural Revolution, is still in prison and not living
in a villa, an official Chinese report said.
   The China News Service, in a dispatch published in Hong Kong
newspapers on Sunday, said a spokesman for the Justice Ministry had
denied unconfirmed press reports that the 74-year-old Jiang was
released from jail, where she is serving a life sentence, and lives
with her daughter in a villa in a Beijing suburb.
   The Justice Ministry spokesman said Jiang is receiving special
medical care in jail, the China News Service reported.
   Chinese officials said earlier this year that Jiang was
suffering from an unidentified ``geriatric disease.''
   Recent unconfirmed reports have said she is suffering from
throat cancer but had refused treatment because it would leave her
voiceless.
   Jiang was a member of the notorious ``Gang of Four,'' who were
accused of ordering illegal arrests during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution and trying to seize power in China after Mao died in
1976.
   Members of the gang were convicted in 1981 and Jiang was
sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life
imprisonment in 1983.

   Puli is a well-behaved Hungarian sheepdog
that spends most of his time lying in front of a fireplace, never
jumps on the furniture and never makes any noise. Puli has been
dead four years.
   But his owners, Suzanne and Rob Fleming, continue to enjoy their
preserved dog.
   ``It's sort of like Puli is still alive because of all the
laughs he gets,'' Mrs. Fleming said.
   The Flemings once left the fluffy white dog in the back seat of
their car while they went sailing. Upon returning, they asked a
friend to let the dog out.
   ``Larry kept whistling, `Come here, boy,' took a closer look and
said, `Uh, Rob, I think you might have left your dog in the car too
long. He's not moving.' We were in tears we were laughing so
hard,'' Mrs. Fleming said.
   The Flemings' teen-age daughter had a different reaction when
she learned her parents had decided to have the family pet
freeze-dried instead of buried. The dog was diagnosed with spinal
cancer and the Flemings had him put to sleep in 1984.
   Mrs. Fleming understood her daughter's fury. ``I mean, how do
you tell your friends that your parents are having (the family) dog
freeze-dried?'' she asked.
   For $650 a taxidermist in Portland, Ore., posed the dog lying on
its side with head up and looking alert. The dog weighs about 10
pounds and needs only occasional cleaning with acetone.
   The Flemings say they made the right decision, and enjoy having
their dog around the house.
   ``He was like a child to us,'' Mrs. Fleming said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the dust storms come, Kabul
vanishes from sight behind a white cloud that grittily obscures all
sense of what is and is not real.
   Then the winds die down, and the dust suspended in the air
drifts to the ground. The sun breaks through and the city of mud
brick houses and 2 million people shimmers back into view.
   It's a bit like stepping into a magic spell and visiting
``Brigadoon,'' the Scottish Highlands town in the Broadway musical
that appears for a day once every hundred years before fading away
into the mist again.
   Kabul has that same sense.
   The distinction between reality and fantasy blurs.
   The Afghan capital is at once communist and capitalist.
   The government of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
is one of the Soviet Union's most successful attempts to impose
communist rule on a Moslem nation.
   But here, the United States has entered the fray by supporting
and helping arm the anti-communist guerrillas who are fighting
Afghan and Soviet soldiers.
   And in spite of the Soviet-style government, Kabul is a
capitalist city. Dollars are avidly sought by merchants who sell
everything from century-old handwoven Afghan carpets to gaudy lace
stockings from Far East sweatshops.
   Kabul is a city full of life and, increasingly, of death.
   Teen-age girls strive for the latest styles as their tailors
stitch government-issue blue cotton into school uniforms patterned
on the skirts and jackets shown in European fashion magazines.
   The markets bustle with more traditionally clad women wearing
the ``chadri,'' an all-enveloping veil that descends in pleats from
a skullcap with only a coarse mesh panel over the eyes to let the
wearer see out.
   Small boys in pajama-like tunics and pants turn cartwheels in
grassy traffic circles, dodging sprays of water from tanker trucks
that keep the geraniums blossoming.
   At night, streets are virtually deserted. The rare motorist is
suddenly stopped by an Afghan soldier who emerges from the gloom to
wave his rifle and check the traveler's identity.
   Soviet soldiers have started withdrawing from other cities as
part of a pullout the Kremlin says will by Feb. 15 end its
eight-year military intervention. But they still surround Kabul
with a ring of tanks, armored personnel carriers and fortified
bunkers.
   Guerrilla rockets hit Kabul several times a week, usually at
night. Often they land near Afghan and Soviet military posts, but
rockets are notoriously inaccurate and many of the casualties are
civilians asleep in their homes.
   One of these victims was carried into a hospital X-ray room a
few days ago. The white-haired man lay unconscious on a narrow bed
of ropes woven across a wooden frame. His right eye was closed, his
left concealed by a bloody bandage. Blood stains covered the
shoulders of his brown tunic, and one leg lay at an improbable
angle under a red plaid blanket.
   He had been brought to the hospital, bed and all, by three men
wearing turbans, baggy trousers and layers of robes.
   The old man lived, according to a hospital staff member who said
such victims arrive almost every morning. But the staffer refused
to give specific numbers, reflecting a reluctance to make
statements not authorized by the government.
   Death is tangible at Tapa-e-Shuhadan, ``the Hill of the
Martyrs,'' Kabul's cemetery for government troops who have died in
the decade of fighting the mujahedeen, or Moslem holy warriors.
   Tapa-e-Shuhadan is off-limits much of the time, even to
mourners, for it is in a military zone. A visit to the hill quickly
reveals the reason:
   Tapa-e-Shuhadan sits atop a huge ammunition dump, evident from
the concrete doorways and little ventilation chimneys built into
the slopes below the graves.
   The members of the Peace, Solidarity and Friendship Organization
who escort foreign visitors to the cemtery were at a loss to say
how many men are buried there. But a rough reckoning, achieved by
counting graves in one quadrant and extrapolating, made 10,000 seem
a conservative estimate.
   These escorted visits add to the blurring of reality and
unreality in Kabul. But there are other encounters that seem
genuine, like the one with a man in a crocheted white skullcap who
declared himself a ``mujahed,'' one of those seeking to oust the
government.
   He spat on the ground to express his contempt for the Afghan
government, communism and the Soviet Union.
   Speaking in Arabic he said he had learned from the Koran,
Islam's holy book, and from three pilgrimmages to Mecca in Saudi
Arabia _ one of the countries arming the mujahedeen, he said: ``God
willing, the brotherhood of Moslems will see victory in
Afghanistan.''

   A drug widely used to treat adults with AIDS
appears to dramatically reverse the devastating effects of the
disease on the brains of children, new research shows.
   The AIDS virus frequently robs young victims of their ability to
talk and walk and lowers their intelligence.
   The latest research shows that the drug AZT seems to bring back
children's speech as well as other functions controlled by the
brain.
   ``Functional ability returned to normal in many kids,'' said Dr.
Philip Pizzo, who directed the study at the National Cancer
Institute.
   His research was presented Sunday at the opening of the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS.
   AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only medicine
routinely used to suppress the AIDS virus, called HIV. In adults,
it can slow the progression of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
but does not cure it.
   Pizzo's findings were made unexpectedly during the testing of a
portable pump to administer the drug to children. He found that
among other changes, the youngsters' IQ scores rose about 15 points
after they got the medicine.
   ``Everybody who looks at this data has to get excited,'' said
Dr. Daniel Hoth of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. ``We are all nervous by small numbers (of
patients studied), but the data itself is very exciting.''
   Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston
also cautioned that the preliminary study did not include a
comparison group.
   ``It's intriguing,'' he said of the results. ``I would have
liked to have seen a control group who were not treated.''
   Pizzo tested AZT on 21 AIDS-infected children who ranged in age
from 14 months to 12 years. About two-thirds got the virus from
blood products, while the rest were infected by their mothers
before birth.
   Pizzo said that 62 percent of the patients had suffered clear
neurological damage from the virus, and ``in every case they were
improved'' after taking AZT.
   The IQs of those who had obvious brain impairment rose from
about 70 to 85. Among those who were judged to be mentally normal
when the study began, the IQs improved from about 95 to 105,
suggesting that they had probably already suffered subtle mental
injury from the infection.
   Pizzo said the youngsters' continued to improve steadily nine
months after the treatment started.
   Brain scans also showed that missing tissue seemed to be
restored in the infected youngsters' brains. Pizzo speculated that
cells that had been shrunken by the virus were restored to their
normal size.
   He cautioned that further study will be necessary to learn how
long the improvement lasts and whether the children eventually
worsen again.
   In a separate study, Dr. Catherine Wilfert of Duke University
Medical Center in Durham, N.C., described a preliminary three-month
study of the drug's safety in children.
   She said the work shows that youngsters tolerate the treatment
well, and while it's too soon to draw firm conclusions, ``our
feeling is that the number of opportunistic infections is
substantially reduced.''
   Research by Dr. Maxime Seligmann of Hopital Saint-Louis in Paris
suggests that combining AZT with the herpes drug acyclovir
significantly improves its effectiveness in people with AIDS.
   In four months of testing on 130 patients, there were 25 deaths
among patients who got AZT alone, compared with 11 among people who
got both drugs.
   ``These preliminary data suggest that acyclovir may have
additional benefit without additional toxicity in patients with
full-blown AIDS,'' Seligmann said.

<HEAD>After A $13 Million Facelift, Blair House Now Fit For A King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president's guest house is meant to be fit
for a king, but when explosive gas leaked in and a chandelier
crashed onto the bed where visiting heads of state sleep, some work
was clearly in order.
   Six years and $13 million later, Blair House is now a ``guest
house worthy of this great nation,'' says Ambassador Selwa
Roosevelt, the chief of protocol, who oversaw the restoration.
   Mikhail Gorbachev couldn't stay there last December for his
summit with President Reagan because the house was closed for
repairs. But should he return this year he would find a new wing,
renovated kitchen, plumbing, fire and safety systems, new
electrical heating and air conditioning.
   Not a palace, perhaps, but not the dilapidated antique it was in
June 1982. Then the house was judged uninhabitable after gas leaked
into the boiler room and a chandelier fell on the bed, fortunately
then unoccupied.
   ``We all realized that the house was in very bad shape. All you
had to do was look at it,'' says Mrs. Roosevelt. ``It had a veneer
of looking all right because it had a certain warmth and all of
that. But the minute you started looking, the rugs were threadbare,
the steps were sagging. The plumbing was unbelievable. The kitchens
were like kitchens at the turn of the century.''
   Blair House actually predates the turn of the century, and it is
an architectural gem rich in history. It consists of four
connecting buildings across from the White House on Pennsylvania
Avenue and around the corner on Jackson Place.
   The original house dates from 1824 and was long owned by Francis
Preston Blair, a member of the powerful, intimate group around
President Andrew Jackson that was called the ``kitchen cabinet.''
   Later, the house was a meeting place for leaders on both sides
of the conflict that became the Civil War. In a small room to the
right of the front door, Col. Robert E. Lee was offered the command
of the Union Armies and declined in favor of his native
Commonwealth of Virginia.
   President Roosevelt approved the acquisition of the house in
1942, saying the government needed it ``for the entertainment of
distinguished visitors.''
   On Nov. 1, 1950, an assassination attempt was made on President
Truman at Blair House by two Puerto Rican nationalists who
attempted to force their way in. The attempt failed, and one of the
nationalists was killed. Leslie Coffelt, a White House guard, died
in preventing the assailants from gaining entrance, and a plaque
outside the house commemorates his heroism.
   In more recent times, columnist Diana McLellan got into hot
water in 1981 when, writing her column for The Washington Post, she
carried an item that then-President Carter had ``bugged'' Blair
House where President-elect Ronald Reagan was staying before the
inaugural. The Post retracted the item after Carter threatened to
sue for libel.
   When the General Services Administration decided in 1982 that
Blair House was so dilapidated it was dangerous, the agency said
millions of dollars were needed to repair the structure.
   ``The alternative was to tear it down. There was nothing in
between,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said.
   Congress appropriated $8.6 million, and another $4.8 million was
raised from private sources to pay for the project. Mrs. Roosevelt
hopes to have more than $1 million left for a fund to maintain the
house.
   There has been little skimping in the refurbishing. The
collection of antiques has been expanded, many of them donated
along with china, silver and fabrics. The room where visiting heads
of state receive the press is an uncommonly elegant pressroom with
its two fireplaces, blue damask upholstery, red serabend rugs and
view of the White House across Pennsylvania Avenue.
   The State Department sees the house as one of its diplomatic
assets. Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said the ``feelings
of being truly welcome, which staying at the presidential guest
house foster, can tip the balance in our favor with many nations
where personal relationships are vitally important.''
   ``When people feel well-treated and warmly treated, this makes
it much easier,'' Mrs. Roosevelt says.
   She believes the American people can be proud of the house,
which she says is neither ostentatious nor ``plebian.''
   ``They don't want pretensions because the American people aren't
that way. This house sort of straddles a very nice line. It's not
too grand, but it has elegance,'' she says. ``It's really just the
right degree of grandness.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: British Cop Describes Frame Over Northern Ireland
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British police have a new expression in their
vocabulary. ``He's been Stalkered,'' they say, meaning, ``He's been
framed.''
   The term also has become synonymous with abuse of power by
British authorities in Northern Ireland.
   For instance, when policemen shot and killed three unarmed
guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army in the British colony of
Gibraltar in March, the media raised the specter of another
``Stalker Affair.''
   The man whose gave rise to such expressions is John Stalker, a
former detective with Britain's national police agency who has
written a book about his official inquiry into suspicions that the
police in Northern Ireland had a ``shoot to kill'' policy toward
suspected guerrillas of the outlawed IRA.
   ``The Stalker Affair,'' which chronicles Stalker's investigation
of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and his subsequent downfall,
has swiftly risen to the top of England's best-seller charts and
was published in the United States in May. It will be published in
paperback in Britain this fall.
   Stalker, tall and lean, was in Washington recently to promote
his book.
   ``The book has become a handle to attach to the issue of the
accountability of police and security services in Northern
Ireland,'' he said in an interview.
   With unassuming calm, Stalker discussed the furor his book has
stirred in Parliament and the embarrassment it caused the
government of Margaret Thatcher by describing clumsy handling of
the tensions between majority Protestants and minority Roman
Catholics in Northern Ireland.
   Aptly named, Stalker made his career hunting moors murderers,
thieves and prostitutes. In 1984 he was asked to investigate the
RUC after one of its members reported that fellow officers had lied
in court about the 1982 shooting deaths of six suspected IRA
guerrillas. The six were unarmed.
   ``The circumstances of those shootings pointed to a police
inclination, if not a policy, to shoot suspects dead without
warning rather than to arrest them,'' Stalker wrote.
   His investigation took a bizarre twist when, on the verge of
obtaining a secret tape to prove his suspicions, Stalker was pulled
off the case and suspended from the force. Over the next three
months, in the summer of 1986, he endured a humiliating and much
publicized investigation into what now appear to have been
trumped-up charges.
   Stalker was accused of consorting with a suspected criminal and
of impropriety in the use of police cars. A police board
subsequently exonerated him and he was reinstated as the deputy
chief of the Manchester police _ Britain's second-largest urban
police force. He resigned seven months later, saying his commander
did not want him on the force.
   In an interim report, Stalker had recommended that 11 police
officers be prosected for perjury and conspiracy to pervert the
course of justice by lying under oath about the Northern Ireland
shooting incidents.
   The government has since said that although ``serious criminal
breaches'' were found in the affair, prosecution of the 11 would
damage security and would not be in the public interest.
   In the course of his probe, Stalker discovered the existence of
a tape which recorded events in the hayshed where one of the six
victims, Michael Justin Tighe, 17, was shot dead. Stalker was told
by informants that the tape would prove Tighe had been killed
without warning.
   Stalker battled for months to get the tape of the electronic
surveillance of the hayshed, which was believed to be an arms depot
for the IRA. About to get the tape, Stalker was called off the
investigation.
   ``The decision that resulted in my removal was, I think, a
political one,'' he wrote. ``My interim report was read with anger
and fear at senior levels within the RUC,'' he said.
   The investigation also disturbed the delicate balance between
Catholics and Protestants in the volatile province. ``The RUC has
tried very hard to shed its sectarian image'' as a predominantly
Protestant force, but the investigation was ``a setback,'' Stalker
wrote.
   Stalker said he decided to write the book ``as a purge for me
and my family'' after the harrowing experience they underwent.
   Stalker said he felt partly vindicated by a government
announcement that changes had been made in the RUC regarding the
accountability of its anti-terrorism squads, based on his report.
   Now, he added with resignation, he wants to get on with his new
career in journalism.
   ``There is no one I can sue, no one I can name,'' he said. ``I
am just another casualty of the political situation in Northern
Ireland.''

<HEAD>Newington Tries To Solve Problem Of Poorly Surveyed Subdivision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of a subdivision have mowed
each other's lawns for years but they never knew it until a
surveyor's error was recently discovered and showed that all 104
lots were improperly plotted.
   Due to the surveyor's miscalculation more than a decade ago when
the Little Brook subdivision was laid out, none of the lots in the
subdivision of the Hartford suburb was correctly mapped out,
officials said.
   For example, while one homeowner may have built a fence on what
appears to be his lot, it technically sits on his neighbor's
property. Early indications are that some the boundaries are off as
much as 3 feet, said Town Manager Frank B. Connolly.
   The error was discovered during the construction of an adjacent
condominium project.
   ``The acreage is right, it's just not where you think it is,''
Connolly said last week.
   All the houses, which range in value from $200,000 to $300,000,
and built-in swimming pools appear to be on their proper lots. But
shrubs, fences and sidewalks aren't.
   Town officials have intervened because of the number of
homeowners involved and because the town's right-of-way, which
includes the sidewalks, may have to be moved.
   As a first step, the town appropriated $17,500 to resurvey the
subdivision, and the results are expected in August.
   ``We're preparing a map showing all the trees and all the
fences,'' Connolly said.
   Once they have the map in hand, officials will try to sort out
the problem. Officials say they might just leave everything as it
is and file new deeds, or they might make everything conform to
existing deeds.
   Connolly said that because of legal obligations, such as
mortgage agreements, things can't be left alone. Both solutions
undoubtedly will prove difficult and involve banks, title insurance
companies, attorneys and lots of paperwork.
   ``We don't know which is more practical, which is more
economical. It can get ticklish if you move boundaries,'' Connolly
said. ``You're talking about a community effort.''
   So far, Little Brook residents have cooperated and have reacted
calmly to the situtation.
   ``Obviously, people are nervous about it. I call it a
sleeping-dog issue,'' said P. Joseph Harpie Jr., a Little Brook
resident and town councilman. ``No one wants to be the first to
draw their gun. I'm hopeful that once the town determines its
right-of-way, the neighbors will work something out.''
   One resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some
neighbors are willing to rewrite deeds, if necessary, to conform to
what exists. But, two are fighting over the location of a fence
that may have to come down.
   Vinny Hayes, another subdivision resident, laughed about the
situation.
   ``It's unfortunate,'' he said, ``the city is going to spend a
lot of money resurveying.''
   Hayes became serious only when talking about the possible
expense of refiling his deed.
   The surveyor, Walter E. Peters of W.E. Peters Land Surveyors, is
dead. A developer of the subdivision said his company has no stake
in the matter.
   ``The ironic part is that if there wasn't additional development
going on (in Newington) it would never have been picked up,''
Connolly said.

<HEAD>It's the `Gramm Slammers' vs the `Hot D'Amatos' in Congressional
Softball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each summer, members of Congress and their
staffs get to sum up their identities in two or three words. They
do this by naming their softball teams.
   Some of the titles are revealing.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., calls his team ``Strom's Right
Swingers.''
   The squad fielded by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., is the ``Buy
Americans.''
   In all, there are about 320 teams in three congressional
leagues. Many of the team titles are derived from lawmakers' names.
   There is the ``Boren To Run'' of Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.; the
``Hot D'Amatos'' of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y; the ``Dollar
Bills'' of Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.; the ``Bumpers Stickers'' of
Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark; the ``Graham Crackers'' of Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla.; the ``Gramm Slammers'' of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas;
and ``Arlen's Darlin's'' of Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   On the House side, Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., heads the ``Whooping
Cranes;'' Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., captains the ``Wheat Germs;''
Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., is the inspiration for the ``Hot
Peppers;'' and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., is the mentor of the
``Congressional Franks.''
   The ``Penny Pinchers'' are named after Rep. Timothy Penny,
D-Minn.; and ``Dingell's Dingbats'' are derived from Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich.
   The team of Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., is the ``Minnesota
Knee-Jerk Liberals.''
   While many of the teams are manned by congressional staffers,
the leagues are notoriously loose on who can play.
   ``We let lobbyists and trade associations in,'' said Gary
Caruso, commissioner of the 200-team Congressional ``B'' League,
which neither uses umpires nor calls balls and strikes.
   ``Sometimes we have to stretch it to, `If you pay taxes, you're
in,''' Caruso said. ``We're the `B' League _ beer-drinking league.''
   A congressional ``A'' league has about 40 teams, while a third
league fields about 80 more and consists mainly of Senate staffers.
   Former members of Congress, and even the staffs of former
presidents, are welcome.
   John Murphy, a former New York congressman from Staten Island,
still has a team called the ``Staten Island Ferries,'' according to
Caruso.
   A team of former staff members of the presidential
administration of Gerald Ford is the ``Outhouse Gang.''
   Committees and agencies also field teams. The House Select
Committee on Aging is the ``Silver Streaks.'' The Export-Import
Bank is the ``Debt Busters.''
   Some names have stories attached.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, fields a team called ``The Right
Stuff,'' which was the title of a best-selling book and movie about
Glenn and other early astronauts.
   The ``Greatest Hits'' of Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., is derived
from the congressman's country guitarist namesake.
   The team of Rep. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, is the ``No Ways, No
Means,'' reflecting his membership on the House Ways and Means
Committee. Some team members want to change the name to ``Ways, But
No Means.''
   But some names are incomprehensible, at least to outsiders.
   ``There's one team called `Shoot The Wounded,''' said Vince
Morelli, a commissioner of the ``A'' league. ``I have no reason to
understand that one.''

<HEAD>Medicare Benefits Bill Contains Tax-Increase Surprise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The politicians taking credit for passage of a
new program to protect the elderly from the financial ravages of
catastrophic illness have been less eager to acknowledge that it
also means a major tax increase for millions of older Americans.
   Those who benefit from the legislation now awaiting President
Reagan's signature would pay the entire cost _ at least for the
near future.
   Congress itself estimates the average tax increase will be $285
per person in 1989 and $506 in 1993.
   Sponsors of the bill, however, are reluctant to use the term
``tax increase'' in public discussions of the bill. Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, repeatedly referred to it as ``a new income-related
premium.''
   For many Medicare recipients, the increase would more than wipe
out what they gained when the tax system was overhauled in 1986.
The tax increase would start at 15 percent next year, jump to 25
percent in 1990 and then rise by as much as one percentage point a
year thereafter, conceivably reaching 35 percent by the end of the
century.
   This tax increase would pay for about two-thirds of the cost of
protecting Medicare recipients against catastrophic hospital,
physician and drug expenses; the program would cost an estimated
$33 billion over the next five years alone. The remainder of the
cost would be covered by raising the monthly Part B premium paid by
recipients for doctors' services.
   ``We have not asked our children to pay the medical bills that
we incur,'' said Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas. ``These benefits will
be paid for by the men and women who will use the coverage.''
   But even some members of Congress who voted for the bill worried
aloud that as the tax burden on the elderly grows, pressure will
mount to have other taxpayers share the cost.
   The compromise bill cleared by Congress last week is
considerably more generous than the version recommended by Reagan.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that the president will veto
it, even with the tax increase.
   Backers of the bill acknowledge that no more than 7 percent of
the elderly and disabled who are eligible for Medicare would
benefit from the bill, even though all will have to pay the Part B
increase and many will face the new tax.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee,
compared the bill to fire insurance.
   ``Not everybody is going to have a catastrophic illness and not
everybody wants to have a fire either,'' Bentsen said, ``but what
you are paying is an insurance premium that takes the law of
averages and applies it to the individual, with the fervent hope
that the vast majority never have the need to use this benefit.''
   Negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill decided that
paying for the expansion solely by raising the Part B premium would
have made it prohibitively expensive for lower-income people.
   The final compromise, said Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., ``takes into
consideration an individual's ability to pay for this protection
and in doing so allows this coverage to be more affordable for
low-income beneficiaries.''
   The bill includes several restrictions on how the tax would be
applied:
   _It would hit only those people eligible for Medicare (generally
age 65 or older or disabled) whose incomes are high enough that
they already pay at least $150 income tax. Typically, a couple over
65 with adjusted gross income of $11,000 or less would not be
subject to the increase.
   Congressional staffers estimate that in 1989, about 40 percent
of Americans over the age of 65 would have to pay the tax increase.
A private organization, the Institute for Research on the Economics
of Taxation, estimates 46 percent next year and 56 percent by 1993.
   _The maximum tax would be $800 per person in 1989 ($1,600 for a
couple if both spouses are eligible for Medicare), rising to $1,050
($2,100 per couple) in 1993.
   _The tax will be at a rate of $22.50 for each $150 of regular
income-tax liability in 1989; by 1993, $42 per $150 of liability.
   According to the Institute for Research, a couple with $21,000
adjusted gross income and taking the standard deduction would face
a tax increase of $236 in 1989 and $441 in 1993. At $31,500 income,
the increase would be $473 next year and $882 in 1993.
   On the average, taxpayers with incomes between $20,000 and
$30,000 were given a $220 tax cut in the 1986 tax overhaul; those
between $30,000 and $40,000 averaged $273.
   The increase in the monthly Part B premium required by the bill
would be the same regardless of income. In 1989, the $27.10 premium
would rise to $31.10, and by 1993 would be $42.60 a month.

<HEAD>Splits Over Taxes, Defense, But Jackson Prevails On South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The forces of Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson are still miles apart on taxes, defense and many
foreign policy issues. But a preliminary platform-drafting session
ended with Jackson getting one wish: that the Democrats brand South
Africa a terrorist state.
   The platform writers boarded this island's horse-drawn taxis and
headed home Sunday after three days of deliberations that produced
working papers on health, education, civil rights and other issues.
The papers were generated by committee staff working with
surrogates of Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   The papers on defense and foreign policy have yet to be written,
and on taxes ``we agreed to disagree,'' said Michael Barnes, a
former Maryland congressman leading Dukakis's platform team.
   The 16-member drafting committee left without casting any votes,
but will meet again sometime before the full 186-member Platform
Committee convenes in Denver June 25-26.
   The Jackson forces encountered little opposition on the South
Africa issue, although earlier in the campaign, Dukakis balked when
Jackson tried to extract such a pledge from him.
   ``We have no problem declaring South Africa a terrorist state,
but let's go beyond that,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, a Dukakis
backer from California.
   The Massachusetts governor, the certain nominee, favors passage
of the tough sanctions in a bill that could put the apartheid
regime in Johannesburg on the same U.S. list of terrorist states as
Libya and Iran.
   But the delegates parted company Sunday on another bedrock issue
for the Jackson campaign: whether to freeze Pentagon spending. Two
labor leaders rose to the defense of the defense budget and nuclear
deterrence.
   Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the American Federation
of Teachers, said the Democrats must root out Pentagon waste, but
also ``honor our treaty obligations and defend democratic
institutions and our freedoms.''
   ``I hope this platform will call for a stable defense budget,''
she said.
   ``The defense budget is not a sacred cow,'' retorted Leslie
McLemore, a Jackson backer from Jackson State University in
Mississippi.
   Later, when McLemore urged the party to forswear first use of
nuclear weapons, James B. Booe, secretary-treasurer of the
Communications Workers of America, said 40 years of bargaining has
taught him never to tell ``any adversary for sure I'm not going to
do anything. ... I want to keep them off balance.''
   The Democrats' working papers call for appointment of a federal
drug czar, an Equal Rights Amendment, ending homelessness,
expanding AIDS research, and providing advance notice of plant
closings. Without using the word abortion, the civil rights paper
calls for ``freedom of reproductive choice ... regardless of
ability to pay.''
   ``I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep.
William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting panel chair.
   Those who hoped for divisive bloodletting ``will find the floor
is clean,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief.
She predicted it will be easier to reach an accord on defense than
on taxes.
   ``If by `stable' they mean something close to what we mean by
`freeze,' then perhaps there's room for compromise,'' Norton said.
   Madeleine Albright, Dukakis foreign policy adviser, said: ``I
think you will not see... `freeze' in the platform.
   Janice Thurmond, an Athens, Ga., lawyer, urged that the platform
embrace Jackson's views on self-determination for the Palestinians.
Albright told reporters flatly the platform will not contain such
language.
   Robert Borosage, a senior Jackson adviser, said the Jackson camp
will be insistent on its demand to further tax the rich and freeze
defense spending.
   ``We've got agreements with Dukakis on commitments for a whole
range of domestic programs, but where's the money going to come
from?'' he said.
   Barnes, the Dukakis platform team leader, was asked if the
Dukakis campaign would relish an opportunity in Atlanta to reject a
minority plank favoring a tax hike.
   ``We're not seeking floor fights,'' he said, adding that Jackson
has enough delegates ``to take anything he wishes to the
convention.''

   A strong earthquake startled residents
over a 350-mile expanse of Northern and Central California on
Sunday night, but authorities said there were no immediate reports
of serious damage or injuries.
   The quake hit at 6:45 p.m. and had a magnitude of 5.1 on the
Richter scale, said a spokesman for the University of California
Seismographic Stations in Berkeley. Its epicenter was on the
Calaveras Fault about 10 miles northeast of San Jose near Alum
Rock, said spokesman Anthony Lomax.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park estimated the temblor
at 5.3. Geophysicist Bill Ellsworth said the earthquake's
5-mile-long center was just north of the epicenter of a 6.2 quake
in Morgan Hill in 1984, the region's largest temblor in years.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered capable of
causing substantial damage, but authorities said they had no damage
reports worse than a few cracked ceilings and a broken water heater
and water pipe in nearby Milpitas.
   ``The whole mountain shook,'' said Al Wong, a maintenance
supervisor for the Federal Aviation Administration atop 2,571-foot
Mount Tamalpais 10 miles north of San Francisco in Marin County.
   Residents as far south as Bakersfield and as far north as Santa
Rosa flooded authorities and media with calls about the quake.
Police and sheriff's spokesmen throughout the San Francisco Bay
area, the Central Valley and Napa and Sonoma counties to the north
all said they had felt it but were unaware of any damage.
   ``It lasted longer than they usually do,'' said Santa Clara
County sheriff's Deputy Ray Dominguez. ``It came all of a sudden
and then leveled and rolled off.''
   ``It was the strongest quake I've felt here in years,'' said
meteorologist Mike Pechner of radio station KNBR in San Francisco
and a life-long resident of the area.
   A resident of Foster City on the San Francisco Peninsula said
people ran out into the street after the quake hit. A South San
Francisco resident said bottles fell off the shelf in his house and
plants were tipped over.
   Dan Trevan, a motorist who was driving over the Golden Gate
Bridge, said his car ``jumped a little bit'' during the quake.
   Bay Area Rapid Transit and Southern Pacific Railroad crews
slowed trains to check for damage to the tracks, but found none,
officials said.
   Pacific Gas & Electric said it had no reports of power outages
in the San Jose area adjacent to the epicenter.
   The quake was the third reported Sunday in California. Mild
earthquakes jolted Napa and Solano counties in Northern California
and the inland area of Southern California around Ontario, but
there were no reports of damage or injury.
   The Ontario quake also was felt in the cities of San Bernardino,
Fontana and Riverside, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   It struck about 2:20 p.m. PDT, was centered about five miles
east-southeast of Ontario, and measured 3.4 on the Richter scale,
said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit Southern
California since Friday, when a shaker measuring 5.2 on the Richter
scale hit 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles and was felt in much of
central and southern California.
   Daily said initial data indicated it was unlikely the Sunday
quake was related to the one which struck Friday.
   The Napa-Solano quake which measured 3.3 on the Richter scale,
occurred at 2:44 p.m., the Seismographic Stations at Berkeley
reported. The epicenter was near Lake Berryessa, about 40 miles
north of Berkeley.
   Vacaville police received dozens of calls from residents who
weren't sure what the jolt was, said dispatcher Jamie Weishaar.
   ``Many of the people were confused because it didn't feel like
an earthquake. Some people thought it might have been a sonic
boom,'' she said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strenth of the shaking. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Most Americans say a vice presidential nominee's
race and sex are irrelevant, but some independents and Republicans
would hestiate to support a black for the job, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Some Republicans also expressed reluctance about supporting a
woman for vice president, the national survey said. Independents
did not shy from a woman candidate, and Democrats did not lean away
from a black or a woman.
   The survey also indicated a substantial majority of Americans
would oppose President Reagan for a third term if he could run
again. Most Republicans favored another Reagan term; independents
and Democrats did not.
   The poll also found that 89 percent of Americans would not want
to be president and a plurality would not want their child to be.
Fifty-nine percent thought it possible their child could be
president.
   On the question of vice presidential candidates, 75 percent of
the 1,204 respondents said it would not matter to them if a
ticket's second slot were filled by a black or a woman.
   Still, 17 percent of independents said they would be less likely
to vote for a ticket with a black for vice president, compared with
4 percent who would be more likely to back it. The division was
wider among Republicans, while there was no measurable split among
Democrats.
   The survey did not specify any candidate. Black civil rights
activist Jesse Jackson, second-place finisher for the Democratic
presidential nomination, has said he should be offered the vice
presidential slot.
   With a woman for vice president, 20 percent of Republicans said
they would be less likely to support the ticket, while 6 percent
said they would be more likely. There was no such reluctance among
Democrats or independents.
   No potential woman candidate was specified. There have been
suggestions that Vice President George Bush, who has locked up the
Republican nomination for president, may select a woman to shore up
his support among women.
   Overall, 10 percent of respondents said they would be more
likely to support a woman for vice president, 14 percent less
likely. That split was within the poll's margin of sampling error
of 3 points.
   Given a black vice presidential candidate, 6 percent overall
said they would be more likely to lend their support, 18 percent
less likely.
   The split was wider for the presidency: Five percent said they
would be more likely to support a black, 27 percent less likely.
Ten percent said they would be more likely to back a woman for
president, 25 percent less likely.
   However, more than six in 10 said it would not matter if a
candidate for president were black or female.
   The poll's finding on Reagan indicates a sharp drop with
Democrats and independents, whose support was critical to his 1980
and 1984 victories.
   Reagan in 1984 won 25 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of
independent voters. But in the survey, just 13 percent of Democrats
and 27 percent of independents said they would vote for him for a
third term.
   Presidents are limited by Constitutional amendment to two
four-year terms, and about 65 percent each of Republicans,
Democrats and independents favored maintaining that limit.
   But if Reagan could run again, 60 percent of Republicans said
they would vote for him, while 85 percent of Democrats and 67
percent of independents said they would not. The total was 32
percent for Reagan, 64 percent against.
   Majorities of conservatives, moderates and liberals alike said
they would not want a third Reagan term. Women and poorer Americans
were more likely to oppose the idea.
   Respondents overwhelmingly attached importance to the office:
Eighty-nine percent said it matters who is elected president. The
same percentage said they would not want the job, and 46 percent
would not want their child to become president. Forty-one percent
would.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone
interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204
adults across the nation. Media General Inc., a communications
company based in Richmond, Va., publishes the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla). Tribune

   The legal complexities in the Iran-Contra
prosecution of former White House aide Oliver L. North and three
co-defendants are sometimes as perplexing to the lawyers and the
judge as they are to the general public.
   A continuing legal battle is being fought on several fronts
between independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and lawyers for
North, former national security adviser John W. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   Here are some answers to a number of questions about the case:
   Q. Who is charged with what?
   A. All four defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud
the government, theft of government property and wire fraud in the
diversion of profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Poindexter and North are both charged with lying to Congress.
North also faces charges of obstructing a presidential inquiry,
with pocketing $4,300 in travelers' checks a Contra leader gave him
to cover expenses, with accepting an illegal gratuity in the form
of a $15,000 high-security fence around his home, with obstructing
an FBI inquiry into the fence, and with conspiring to illegally use
a tax-exempt foundation to raise money to help arm the Contras.
   Secord and Hakim are charged with conspiring to py illegal
gratuities to North by setting up a $200,000 fund for North's
family and by arranging installation of the fence.
   Q: When is the case going to trial?
   A: That is still up in the air. But U.S. District Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell said last week that the defendants should be tried
individually so that he could ensure they each get a fair trial.
Gesell said he would decide major pre-trial issues by July 1. The
first trial likely will begin during the fall presidential campaign.
   Q. Who goes first?
   A. Walsh designated North as the leadoff defendant, to be
followed by Poindexter.
   Q. Why did Gesell order four separate trials?
   A. The judge was presented with a unique problem because three
of the four defendants _ North, Poindexter and Hakim _ testified
last year before congressional hearings under grants of limited
immunity from prosecution. As a rule, Walsh is prevented from using
the testimony of the defendants against them as evidence.
   Q. What does that have to do with holding four separate trials?
   A. Gesell ruled that each defendant has a right to present a
co-defendant's immunized testimony as evidence of his innocence. If
a joint trial were held, Gesell would have to choose between
protecting, say, Poindexter's Fifth Amendment right not to have his
congressional testimony used against him and the Sixth Amendment
right of Hakim and Secord to use Poindexter's statements to
Congress as evidence of their innocence.
   Secord and Hakim, both say that testimony by North and
Poindexter would help clear them of any wrongdoing by showing that
they acted with the understanding their activities were approved by
the U.S. government.
   Q. Is Gesell's order a blow to the prosecution?
   A. Prosecutors don't generally like trying conspiracy cases
against individual defendants. It's easier to show a jury how the
actions of each member furthered an alleged conspiracy if all the
defendants are being tried together. It means Walsh's resources
will be seriously stretched and the cases will take a long time to
try.
   Q: What are the remaining issues before Gesell can set a trial
date?
   A: The judge must decide whether the immunized congressional
testimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim tainted the investigation
of prosecutors. But his decision to hold four trials appears to
foreshadow a decision that congressional immunity won't be a
barrier to trying the case.
   Gesell also has to rule on whether procedures for handling
200,000 pages of classified documents collected during Walsh's
investigation will protect the defendants' rights to a fair trial.
   Q. What are those?
   A. The Classified Information Procedures Act requires the
defense to notify the prosecution before trial of any government
secrets it expects to use as evidence in the case. Defense lawyers
contend this will tip off the prosecution.
   Q. Can the court force the government to declassify secret
documents needed for the trials?
   A. No. If there is a large enough volume of material that the
government agencies won't release, Walsh would be forced to drop
the case.
   If the government determines that a particular document is so
sensitive it can't be made public, the law provides several ways
for the information to be presented. The court can order a
statement of what the document would prove, can substitute a
statement of facts that a document would prove for the actual
material, or the judge can also delete sensitive portions of the
material.
   Q: What sorts of secrets are involved?
   A: The keepers of government secrets are especially sensitive
about any document that reveals the source of foreign intelligence.
The government also is anxious to protect information revealing
that a foreign country provided information or was involved in a
secret initiative with the United States.
   Gesell speculated at a hearing that the defendants may want to
introduce evidence about other covert operations they engaged in to
show that the procedures were no different than those followed in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The judge said evidence about other secret operations might help
the defendants show they acted with authority or at least the
belief they had the permission of higher officials.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning the
results theoretically would be within three points of the same 19
times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the same
questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five points
for Republicans, for example.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. Presidents now are limited to two four-year terms in office.
Do you think it should be one-six year term, stay at two four-year
terms, be three four-year terms, or four or more four-year terms?
   One six-year: 16 percent. Two four-year: 65 percent. Three
four-year: 8 percent. Four or more four-year: 5 percent. None of
these: 4 percent. Don't know or no answer: 2 percent.
   2. If Ronald Reagan could run again, would you vote for him for
a third term as president?
   Yes: 32 percent. No: 64 percent. Don't know or no answer: 4
percent.
   3. I'm going to read a few attributes that might be found in a
candidate for president. Tell me if each would make you more likely
to vote for that candidate for president, or less likely to vote
for that candidate, or if it wouldn't matter.
   a. A woman. More likely: 10 percent. Less: 25 percent. Not
matter: 64. DK-NA: 2 percent.
   b. A black. More likely: 5 percent. Less: 27 percent. Not
matter: 66 percent. DK-NA: 3 percent.
   4. Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for a ticket
that has a woman candidate for vice president, or wouldn't it
matter?
   More likely: 10 percent. Less: 14 percent. Not matter: 75
percent. DK-NA: 1 percent.
   5. Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for a ticket
that has a black candidate for vice president, or wouldn't it
matter?
   More likely: 6 percent. Less: 18 percent. Not matter: 75
percent. DK-NA: 1 percent.
   6. Do you think it matters who's elected president?
   Yes: 89 percent. No: 9 percent. DK-NA: 2 percent.
   7. Would you want the job of president?
   Yes: 11 percent. No: 89 percent. DK-NA: 1 percent.
   8. Would you want your child to grow up to be president?
   Yes: 41 percent. No: 46 percent. DK-NA: 13 percent.
   9. Do you think it's possible your child could grow up to be
president?
   Yes: 59 percent. No: 34 percent. DK-NA: 8 percent.

   Tennis balls zoomed like missiles over the
White House lawn, causing even President and Nancy Reagan to duck,
but it was all for a good cause as some $500,000 was raised to
combat drug abuse.
   Celebrities, tennis pros and administration officials gathered
Sunday at the White House tennis court for the fourth annual
fund-raising event.
   The president and first lady joined a crowd of several hundred
guests and corporate sponsors, watching tennis stars Tracy Austin,
Vince Van Patten Jimmy Arias and Dennis Ralston compete in a match
that had no winners _ local sportscaster and master of ceremonies
Glenn Brenner got the score mixed up.
   The first couple also saw Secretary of State George Shultz and
GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf go down to defeat at the hands of
Treasury Secretary James Baker III and Wilhelm Wachtmeister, the
ambassador of Sweden.
   Shultz, just back from his round of travels to the Soviet Union,
Middle East and Spain, appeared to fall victim to jet lag with his
double faults.
   Old and new CIA hands faced off when current CIA director
William Webster and newsman Morton Kondracke opposed former CIA
director Richard Helms and actor Dick Van Patten.
   Helms, resplendent in traditional men's long slacks, was
declared by Brenner to be the winner of the day's ``sartorial
award,'' but he also managed to scoop up a win with a number of
tough lobs and strong net play.
   Other participants included actresses Dina Merrill, Catherine
Oxenberg and Tracy Scoggins, actor Chuck Norris, singers Lee
Greenwood and Larry Gatlin, boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and football
player Herschel Walker.
   At the end of the tournament, Mrs. Reagan presented $50,000
checks to two anti-drug abuse groups, the Target Interactive
Project of Kansas City, Mo., and Wally's Club and Frontline Foster
Grandparents Program of Nashville, Tenn.
   ``Because of their work, the lives of many parents and children
will be much brighter,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

<HEAD>Group Says More `Soft Money' Flowing Into Election Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ``Untold millions'' of dollars from
corporations and labor unions are flowing into the nation's
election process through a legal loophole, says a report released
today by a bipartisan research group.
   Union and corporate contributions to state and local political
parties for activities that are not directly used on federal
elections are generally known as ``soft money.'' The national party
organizations _ the Republican National Committee and Democratic
National Committee _ also collect and disburse soft money in a
variety of ways permitted by federal law.
   These funds are not required by law to be reported at the
federal level. And only some states have strict reporting
requirements.
   The Center for Responsive Politics said it identified $3.3
million in corporate contributions to political parties in five
states in the 1985-86 election cycle _ California, Colorado,
Florida, Missouri and Washington.
   ``This amount, if multiplied nationwide, would blossom into an
enormous sum, despite the fact that there was no presidential race
to boost contributions even higher,'' said Ellen S. Miller,
executive director of the center.
   Noting that nearly a billion dollars is tallied in reports to
the Federal Election Commission on spending for congressional
campaigns and presidential races, she added, ``Lying just below the
surface are untold millions of additional dollars unaccounted for
by the FEC.''
   The money can be used for such activities as state conventions,
voter registration drives, research, office expenses and
get-out-the-vote drives.
   Soft money plays an important role in presidential election
years, since the major parties' presidential campaigns are paid for
by the U.S. Treasury and the amounts the national parties can spend
in addition are limited.
   Republicans have traditionally raised far more in soft money
than Democrats, but the finance chairman for Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis has talked of raising $42 million in soft money for
the fall campaign.
   Based on reports filed with the five states involved, the center
identified the following amounts in corporate contributions to
state parties in 1985-86:
   California: Republicans, $808,290; Democrats, $295,389.
   Colorado: Republicans, $645,888; Democrats, $71,050.
   Florida: Republicans, $466,445; Democrats, $458,258.
   Missouri: Republicans, $369,482; Democrats, $22,400.
   Washington: Republicans, $129,776; Democrats, $31,250.
   The center identified about 1,700 soft money contributions in
these states, almost all of them from corporations.
   In its report, the center said American Continental Corp. of
Phoenix gave $85,000 to the California Democratic Party in 1986,
while Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles gave a total of $89,000
to the two state parties.
   The largest individual contribution identified by the center was
by Charles Keating, chairman of the board of American Continental,
who gave $100,000 to the Florida GOP.
   The report referred to the publicly disclosed contribution of $1
million by McDonald's heir Joan Kroc to the DNC. At most, $20,000
of that could be used on federal elections under the law, meaning
at least $980,000 would have to go into the DNC's soft-money
accounts.
   The report also noted published reports of gifts to the RNC
totaling $150,000 from Texas developer Trammell Crow, $127,600 from
Phillip Morris Corp. and $124,000 from Atlantic Richfield.
   Corporate and union money can also be used to pay for buildings
for the national parties. The report mentioned contributions to the
Democratic building funds of $50,000 from the painters' union,
$10,000 from the United Auto Workers and $5,000 from the
machinists' union.
   It cited contributions to the RNC fund of $40,000 from Bethlehem
Steel and $24,120 from Drexel, Burnham, Lambert.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, who once described himself as a
``man of few wants,'' lives in a duplex he bought 17 years ago for
$25,000, drives a 5-year-old Dodge, buys his clothes at a bargain
basement and generally vacations at the homes of friends or family.
   Despite his frugal lifestyle _ or perhaps because of it _ the
apparent Democratic presidential nominee has a net worth of at
least $500,000 in property, investments and salary and is the
potential beneficiary of about $1 million controlled by trusts,
according to his financial disclosure forms and statements made by
his presidential campaign aides.
   James Dorsey, the governor's Statehouse press secretary, said
the Dukakises ``live comfortably,'' but added: ``Nowadays there
isn't much time to spend money on anything.''
   The last time the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be took a
financial risk was 25 years ago when, following the lead of two
uncles in Haverhill a half century before, he took out two
mortgages to buy the six-apartment building he was living in for
$55,000.
   The investment proved successful. In 1971, eight years after
buying the apartment building in the Boston suburb of Brookline,
Dukakis sold off the apartments as condominiums _ one of the first
condo conversions in the state _ for a reported $26,000 profit.
   Earlier that year, he and his wife, Kitty, moved out of the
apartment building and bought half of a side-by-side brick duplex
down the street for $25,000.
   The Dukakises still live in that modest, three-story duplex _
since Massachusetts is one of only three states that doesn't
provide a governor's residence. But as a result of New England's
inflated real estate climate, the Dukakis home now carries an
estimated value of $367,400.
   Like many Americans, the Dukakis' home is the governor's single
largest investment. Unlike many Americans, Dukakis has paid off the
mortgage. Indeed, the governor, who refuses to use credit cards,
has no reported debts.
   His only independent stock investment totals less than $1,000 in
a small Massachusetts-based robotics manufacturer, Automatix Inc.,
which brought him less than $100 in income last year, according to
his financial disclosure forms.
   The governor has no vacation homes _ his vacations are usually
mixed with family visits to a cousin's home in Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla., to Mrs. Dukakis' sister's home on Cape Cod or to her father's
summer home in the Berkshires.
   He has no airplanes, boats or a garage full of cars. The only
car owned by the man who likes to ride the subway to work is a 1983
Dodge valued last year at $2,750.
   Dukakis, 54, has put his money into long-term investments aimed
at retirement or benefiting his three children. After 25 years in
state politics, first as a legislator and now as a three-term
governor, Dukakis has built his state retirement account up to
$49,494.
   If the governor has taken out life insurance, his federal and
state financial disclosure forms don't reveal it and his
presidential campaign staff won't discuss it.
   He and Mrs. Dukakis have $44,610 in various savings, Individual
Retirement Accounts and checking accounts, some of which are
considered trusts for his children, the campaign staff said.
   The governor and his wife reported total income last year of
$108,957. Virtually all of it was from his $85,000-a-year
governor's salary and Mrs. Dukakis' $20,000 as a part-time director
of the Public Space Partnership Project at Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government and the $2,000 she earned as director
of a college textbook publisher. The Dukakis' interest income
amounted to $1,445.
   Dukakis also is the potential beneficiary of money from two $1
million trusts set up by his late father, Panos. However, half the
money in those trusts is slated to go to Bates College in Maine,
where Dukakis' father went to school.
   Dukakis has reported two additional trusts, valued at a total of
$110,000, which were set up by Mrs. Dukakis' late grandmother,
Mabel Williams, and her father, Harry Ellis Dickson. But only the
governor's wife and children are potential beneficiaries.
   Dukakis has no direct control over or involvement in any of
these trusts.
   It was one of the trusts set up by Dukakis' father that drew
attention last year when the governor filed a report with the
Federal Election Commission revealing that until 1986 _ when he was
running for re-election _ the trust included stocks in companies
doing business in South Africa. In 1983, Dukakis vocally supported
and signed legislation to divest Massachusetts pension fund stocks
with South African ties to protest that country's system of racial
segregation.
   Dukakis, before withdrawing as a trustee of the trust last year,
told the State Street Bank & Trust Co. of Boston, which manages the
trust, to divest any South African-tied stocks. Stocks in 10
companies were immediately sold.
   Today the trust, in which Dukakis' mother, Euterpe, and his
campaign chairman, Paul Brountas, are trustees, has holdings in 21
companies, including IBM, several of the so-called ``Baby Bells''
spawned by the breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph Co. and
The Washington Post Co.
   So, could Dukakis be called a millionaire? ``It's not accurate
to say that, no,'' campaign spokesman Steve Akey said. ``Potential,
yes.''
   It was during discussion last year over raising the governor's
salary from $75,000 to an advisory board's recommendation of
$125,000 that Dukakis described himself as a ``man of few wants.''
   Dukakis, who eventually agreed to a $10,000 raise in governor's
pay, balked at the board's further recommendation for a
$25,000-a-year housing allowance, saying he could live on almost
any salary, ``within reason.''

<HEAD>Heat Still On Taxpayer-Financed Advertising for Farm Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress remains skeptical about government
subsidies for overseas advertising of U.S. farm products, with an
appropriations panel turning down a proposed $215 million increase
for next year.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., calls Friday's vote by the House
Appropriations Committee a ``victory for both the taxpayer and the
small farmer.''
   Schumer said he hopes ``this is the beginning of the end for
huge handouts'' to agribusiness concerns for overseas advertising.
   ``If giant companies ... want to advertise their brands in Japan
they shouldn't ask the American taxpayer to pay for it,'' he said.
   The Appropriations Committee's action held the program to its
usual level of $110 million from a proposed level of $325 million
for fiscal 1989.
   The Agriculture Department says the program is part of an
overall effort to make U.S. farm products more competitive
overseas. It notes that American exports fell from $38 billion in
1984 to $26.3 billion two years later. The level crawled back up to
$27.9 billion last year and is projected to hit $32 billion in 1988.
   A persistent critic of ``excesses'' in the agriculture budget,
Schumer prompted the General Accounting Office to conduct an
investigation of the Targeted Export Assistance program. The
congressional investigative agency said it found ``insufficient
accountability and management controls'' in the program as well as
an array of other problems.
   The TEA program was established by a voluminous 1985 law that
put into place all of the nation's current major agricultural
programs. Since 1986, it has supplied $110 million a year in
Commodity Credit Corp. generic certificates to reimburse 66
organizations for promotion of a wide range of farm exports.
   The generic certificates are issued by the Commodity Credit
Corp., which is owned by USDA's Agricultural Conservation and
Stabilization Service.
   The certificates may be redeemed for their face value's worth of
surplus crops held by CCC. The corporation acquires these goods
primarily through federal programs under which farmers pledge their
crops as collateral for price-support loans, with the option of
forfeiting the commodities rather than taking them to market
themselves.
   When the crops are transferred to another owner under an
Agriculture Department payment-in-kind program, such as Targeted
Export Assistance, the amount of the original loan goes on USDA
books as a ``realized loss.''
   Pears, wheat, peaches, fruit cocktail, peas, lentils, grapes,
apples, wood, poultry, eggs, soybean meal, dairy cattle, citrus,
prunes, nuts, raisins, rice, potatoes, chocolate, red meat, pasta
and cotton have all been the subject of overseas advertising
supported by the Targeted Export Assistance program.
   The program is intended to give first crack at the money to
products that have faced unfair foreign trade practices.
   TEA operates two kinds of programs. One subsidizes associations
for generic advertising of specific U.S. products, such as
``American pears.'' The other pays private companies to promote not
just ``American pears'' or ``American apples'' but farm products
marketed under their brand names.
   Individual amounts can be substantial. Sunkist Growers Inc., for
example, received $7.93 million in fiscal 1986 and $9.55 million in
fiscal 1987 for overseas promotion of California citrus.
   At least $900,000 was allocated under TEA to promote U.S.
tobacco exports, the GAO reported. USDA says an exporting group,
Tobacco Associates, used money from the program to participate in a
1987 tobacco show in China and that this ``is paying off in greater
contacts with the Chinese tobacco monopoly.''
   ``Several new TEA activities are now planned with China,
including sponsorship of a leaf grading school in China and
reciprocal trade team visits between China and the United States,''
according to a USDA report.

   The public image of U.S. farm goods' quality
will come in for a hard look later this month when the Agriculture
Department sponsors a conference on quality and competitiveness in
St. Louis.
   The public-image workshop is the most recent to be added to the
conference's agenda.
   ``This workshop will address general agricultural concerns and
will be open to any paid participant attending the conference and
to the press,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said in a
statement.
   The session will be led by Amy Barr, executive editor-at-large
of McCalls Magazine, Lyng said.
   Fourteen commodity workshops scheduled for the conference,
however, are going to be closed to the news media, USDA says.
   Major agribusiness executives are scheduled to address the
conference and the commodity workshops are designed to take a frank
look at complaints surrounding the quality of American products and
their impact on trade.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter is set to address
the conference's kickoff dinner.

   The FBI should include stringent safeguards
against abuse in the guidelines it used to launch a lengthy
investigation of Reagan administration political opponents, says a
former Justice Department aide.
   Eric Richard said the bureau's investigation of the Committee in
Solidarity with the People in El Salvador from 1983 to 1985 was
carried out under ``relatively lenient'' guidelines on foreign
counterintelligence and international terrorism. The group opposes
Reagan administration policies in Central America.
   In prepared congressional testimony, Richard said the probe
could justifiably have been conducted under another set of
guidelines, the ``relatively rigorous set of investigative rules''
governing domestic security and terrorism investigations.
   Details of the FBI investigation of CISPES surfaced in February.
Internal FBI documents showed that agents investigated nuns, union
members and college professors who opposed Reagan administration
Central America policy, photographing protesters at peace rallies
and recording license plate numbers. The investigation involved
nearly all of the FBI's field offices.
   The more lenient foreign counterintelligence guidelines allowed
the FBI to conduct a much broader investigation than would have
been possible under the domestic investigation guidelines.
   Richard suggested that the FBI rework the international
terrorism guidelines and apply some of the safeguards against abuse
that are contained in the domestic security guidelines.
   The international guidelines permit investigations of entire
organizations. Under the domestic standards, investigations must
focus on participants who knowingly act to further criminal
objectives.
   The domestic guidelines also specify that before investigations
are opened, the danger to privacy and free expression posed by an
investigation must be considered.
   ``If these standards had been conscientiously applied to the
CISPES investigation, it seems certain that an ongoing intrusion
into legitimate political activity would have ended much sooner,''
said Richard.
   Richard, the attorney general's special assistant for
intelligence during the Carter administration, made his remarks in
testimony to be delivered to the House subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights.
   The investigation of CISPES began March 30, 1983, prompted by an
informant's claim that members were covertly furnishing money and
supplies to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a
leftist group seeking to seize power in El Salvador.
   The probe was closed in June 1985 when the Justice Department
concluded that the group was involved in political activities
protected by the First Amendment and was not participating in
international terrorism.

<HEAD>`Greenhouse Effect' Could Trigger Flooding, Crop Losses,
Scientists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of scientists is offering a sobering
weather forecast for the year 2020: the planet's average
temperature hitting a 10,000-year high, and the world's oceans
surging an average of 83 feet inland.
   ``Things are going to change too fast,'' scientist Michael
Oppenheimer said as the World Meteorological Organization, a United
Nations Agency, released a report last week on the climate change
that could be triggered by the ``greenhouse effect.''
   The report painted a picture of a global civilization heating
its atmosphere in a myriad of ways, from burning fossil fuel to
destroying tropical forests.
   Those actions could force the average temperature up by 2
degrees Fahrenheit in the next three decades, the report says. That
might not sound like much, but the scientists say it would be
enough to wreak havoc.
   Such a temperature increase, for example, would cause the sea
level to rise by 10 inches, bringing seawater an average of 83 feet
inland, according to Oppenheimer.
   ``The potential for economic, political and social destruction
is extraordinary,'' said biologist George Woodwell.
   To illustrate the warming trend, he noted that four of the
hottest years in the last century have been recorded in the 1980s.
   The organization held four news conferences around the world,
including one in Washington, to talk about the report.
   Oppenheimer said even if mankind abruptly stopped adding
excessive gases to the atmosphere, the delayed impact of already
released gases would eventually raise the average temperature 1 to
2 degrees.
   The scientists' estimates are tied to an assumption that the
Earth's population, industrialization and emissions will continue
to grow along the upward curve that has been followed for the last
130 years.
   The report also gives a scenario tied to an assumption that
worldwide growth and development could load the atmosphere with
vastly increasing amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide,
methane and chlorofluorocarbons.
   In this case, the figures get two to three times worse: instead
of a 10-inch increase in the sea level, the report estimates a
2-foot increase. Instead of a 2-degree increase in the average
temperature, a 6-degree surge is called for. Oppenheimer says that
temperature level last occurred 2 million years ago.
   Whatever the increases, the report paints a dismal picture for
coastal areas: erosion of beaches, loss of wetlands, more frequent
and more severe flooding, damage to port facilities.
   In its only cost estimate, the report said global expenditures
of tens of billions of dollars will be needed over the next 50
years for dikes, walls and drainage systems to counter rising seas
caused by already released gases.
   It forecasts destruction of forests and agricultural lands for
the mid-latitudes, the heavily populated band that encompasses the
United States, China, Europe and the southern half of the Soviet
Union.
   Forest loss is a critical element, because this releases still
more carbon into the atmosphere. The report says the mid-latitude
nations probably will be able to maintain food production but in
different growing areas.
   Semi-arid tropical regions like northern Africa, Central America
and India would lose already marginal agricultural areas and face
scarcities of fresh water and wood for fuel. Humid tropics would be
wetter and warmer.
   In the high-latitudes like the northern Soviet Union,
Scandinavia, Canada, the Arctic and the Antarctic, the scientists
see melting ice packs and glaciers, more clouds and precipitation,
the slow disappearance of permafrost and the possibility of large
carbon releases from the soil.
   The report says that limiting the amount of global warming
``could be accomplished only with significant reductions'' in the
use of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum.
   ``If reasonable economic growth rates are to be maintained,
these reductions can be achieved only with two major changes: large
(energy) efficiency increases of the order of one-half in
industrial nations and rapid deployment of alternative energy
sources,'' it said.
   The report also calls for reduced deforestation and increased
forestation and implementation of last year's agreement among
industrialized nations to decrease the production and use of
chlorofluorocarbons.
   It cited the need for an international agreement ``on a law of
the atmosphere'' to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, possibly
setting long-term environmental targets to control the rate of
temperature and sea level increases.
   The report warned against world leaders attempting to divide
countries or regions into winners and losers in setting such
targets.
   ``This is not a `zero-sum' game,'' it said. ``Unless action is
taken, it could be a negative-sum game of highly uncertain
proportions.''

<TEXT>
   Southern Baptists mixed preaching and
politicking as fundamentalists and moderates today approached a
convention fight over control of the denomination's
multimillion-dollar organizational empire.
   A fundamentalist wing gradually has gained predominance among
trustees of Southern Baptist Convention institutions through nine
years of winning the influential presidency of the country's
largest Protestant body.
   But moderates think they can regain the office at the
convention, which opens Tuesday. They cite numerous victories on
the state level and various fundamentalist moves that have
antagonized the grass-roots.
   Expected to be nominated for the presidency were the
fundamentalist-backed Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., and
the moderate-backed Rev. Richard Jackson of Phoenix, Ariz.
   The president has appointive authority over trustees who run the
14.7-million-member denomination.
   Harsh words have been traded in the spiraling campaign recently,
with fundamentalists demanding literalistic beliefs about the Bible
among denominational teachers and agency staffers.
   Moderates defend a long-time Baptist concept of the ``soul
competency'' of individuals to interpret the Bible as they
understand it.
   A respected patriarch of the denomination, the Rev. Herschel H.
Hobbs, 80, of Oklahoma City, says the bitter struggle is hurting
the Christian cause.
   ``In this controversy, we are our own worst enemies,'' Hobbs,
the former convention president, said in a statement.
   ``What all outside forces of evil could not do, we are doing to
ourselves. As Paul said in Galatians 5:15, we are like wild animals
devouring one another. We deny the very oneness and peace for which
Jesus prayed.''
   As a prelude to the convention, the thousands of ``messengers''
were offered a day of preaching, some of it from leading exponents
of the two factions.
   So divided was sentiment that there were separate preaching
arenas _ a Pastor's Conference of mainly fundamentalist speakers
and the Forum for moderates.
   The Forum announced its 1988 Denominational Statesman Award to
the Rev. Randall Lolley, driven by demands of newly ruling
fundamenalist trustees to resign as president of Southeastern
Baptist Theological Seminary.
   ``Trustees are no longer free to debate and decide issues,'' he
said. ``They have people breathing down their necks to accomplish
the pre-arranged agendas.''
   He, along with four academic colleagues at the Wake Forest,
N.C., seminary quit after trustees enacted measures requiring that
faculty members profess that the Bible is free of error.
   ``The price which he has paid for his convictions is a witness
to his faith, an act of judgment upon all those who surrender to
the temptation to compromise their convictions,'' said the award
citation.
   Among preachers scheduled at the Pastors Conference were
fundamentalist former presidents, the Revs. Charles Stanley and
Bailey Smith, both of Atlanta, and Paige Patterson of Dallas, a key
strategist for that wing.
   Patterson denounces recent tactics of moderates accusing him of
right-wing political ties, calling it ``hurtful misrepresentation,
apparently born out of a willingness to do almost anything to
reverse the conservative resurgence.''
   Of moderate charges that he was involved in a rightist political
group, the Council for National Policy, he says conservative
Christians now simply are doing politically what liberals have done
for a long time.
   ``It is no longer the left involved in isolation, but now the
conservatives are involved,'' he said. ``What is sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander.''
   The Rev. W. Winfred Moore of Amarillo, who sent out the brochure
criticizing Patterson and others in the fundamentalist wing, said:
   ``There are some of our brethren who want to make all of us
believe the same way they do. ... Our diversity has always been our
greatest strength. Now they are telling us we cannot be different
any more.''

   Radicals attacked a U.S. government
office with firebombs and tear-gas bombs Monday in the southern
city of Taegu, but caused only minor damage.
   Three men yelling anti-American slogans hurled three firebombs
and two tear-gas bombs at the U.S. Information Service office, U.S.
officials and police said. The three, who appeared to be students,
were seized by police guards who stopped them with tear-gas guns.
   No casualties were reported in the attack in which six windows
were broken and the center's sign set on fire, officials said. The
facility 150 miles southeast of Seoul, which distributes
information about the United States and organizes cultural events,
was briefly evacuated.
   The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government and
anti-U.S. protests during the past two weeks by radical students.
They have been demanding the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's
government and an end to Seoul's alliance with Washington.
   Anti-Americanism dominated the protests, with radical students
claiming the United States enforces the partition of the divided
Korean peninsula so it can rule the south. The radicals want
immediate reunification with the communist north and removal of the
42,000 U.S. troops based in the south under a mutual defense pact.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter enemies. The
north invaded the south in 1950 to launch the Korean War.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
failed to attract public support.

   Drought can mean strict water conservation measures for
townspeople, financial hardship for farmers and rising prices for
scarcer farm products, but it also has other effects on the world
around us:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Wildlife</HEAD>

   ``It'll be very tough times for wildlife of all kinds,'' says
University of California, Davis, wildlife specialist Lee Fitzhugh.
``Virtually anything that depends upon herbaceous plants and seeds
will suffer _ songbirds, amphibians, reptiles and some small
mammals.''
   Territorial disputes may increase as animals concentrate around
dwindling water supplies in late summer and fall, says Fitzhugh.
   Jim Vashro of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks
said fish in streams and rivers are forced to move to deeper holes
for protection.
   ``The fish are concentrated more, so the predation and food
competition goes up,'' he said. ``There's a larger mortality rate
and less oxygen. As the water temperatures go up, the oxygen needs
of the fish go up, and they become stressed, their growth rate is
slowed, or they die.''
   The dry weather could mean fewer ducks for the fall hunting
season.
   Gay Simpson of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and
Parks said many nesting areas have dried up, although the extent of
the problem won't be fully known until after a breeding pair survey
and brood count are conducted.
   Around Atlanta coyotes, descendants of animals smuggled in by
hunters, have taken to raiding watermelon patches in search of
water, state wildlife officials say. Rats are reported invading
yards in the San Francisco Bay area in search of water.
   Even handouts for birds could be affected.
   ``Feed prices are way up already with the dry weather,'' said
Tom Westman, owner of several Minnesota Greenery Wild Bird Stores.
`In just the last month we've seen a 25 percent increase in our
costs on sunflower seeds. If some of these areas don't start
getting rain, then in the fall prices will continue to climb.''

   California Department of Forestry Director Jerry Partain says he
brought crews on early and added extra seasonal firefighters
because he fears the drought could fuel a firestorm exceeding the
ravages of the lightning-spawned blazes of 1987 that blackened
nearly a million acres. Large sections of forest may be closed to
the public because of fire danger.
   Drought-weakened trees are beginning to die under insect attack
in some areas.

   ``I've got eight boat slips out of 60 I can't use because
they're out of the water,'' said Mike Williams, president of the
International Falls (Minn.) Chamber of Commerce and co-owner of
Thunderbird Lodge on Rainy Lake on the Canadian border.
   Lake Tahoe, on the Nevada-California state line, is fed by
snowmelt in the Sierras, but there was little snow last winter. Now
at least two public boat ramps can't be used because of the falling
water level.
   Gary Midkiff, assistant director of the Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency, also said the low water is harming the lake's delicate
water quality. He says the falling water level lets sunlight warm
the lake deeper than usual, encouraging the growth of algae.

   There's no work waiting for hundreds of migrant workers who
journey north to Minnesota's Red River Valley every year to thin
and weed sugar beets.
   Growers replanted 150,000 acres of sugar beet plants after a
killing frost, but the new seedlings can't take root in the dry
soil and are blown about like tumbleweeds.
   Between 200 and 300 migrant farm workers have added their names
to a waiting list for temporary work at the Minnesota Jobs and
Training office in Polk County, said Armando Cuellar, a migrant
labor counselor at the office.

<HEAD>Drought Shriveling Crops, Driving Up Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought across broad patches of the nation is shriveling crops
and pastures, driving up grain prices and leaving some farm workers
jobless. Community water use restrictions are in place in
California, the Midwest and the Southeast.
   ``It's not total destruction for all these crops yet, but
another week or two of dry weather is going to put us near the
point of no return,'' said Richard Grove, agricultural extension
agent for Seneca County, Ohio.
   In addition, low water threatens to disrupt shipping on rivers
in the South and hydroelectricity there and in the Northwest.
   These are the problem areas:
   _Southeast: Parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and
Alabama have had below-normal rainfall for up to four years.
Atlanta and six surrounding counties have water conservation
programs.
   The hardest-hit reservoir is North Carolina's Fontana Lake,
which is 45 feet below normal. Some private wells have gone dry in
North Carolina.
   _Midwest and northern Plains: A hot, dry spring and less than
normal winter snow has left the soil so dry in some places that
seeds didn't germinate. Some farmers in northwestern Ohio have
plowed crops under rather than spend more money on fertilizer.
North Dakota Gov. George Sinner says the drought is the worst since
the 1930s.
   Thunderstorms on Sunday produced much-needed rain over parts of
the Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota. Mobridge, S.D., got 1.47
inches of rain in six hours and Jamestown, N.D., got 0.8 inch, but
the region will need more rain to replace subsoil moisture.
   Areas of Illinois are restricting water use and residents in the
Chicago suburb of Long Grove complain about dry wells, saying they
suspect their neighbors of using all the water. Long Grove
administrator D.M. Doughty said one woman's well ran dry while her
neighbor across the street had three or four sprinklers going.
``It's kind of hard to love your neighbor,'' he said.
   The northern Plains' problem is shared by farmers in Canada,
where Old Wives Lake, a 12-mile-wide expanse south of Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan, is bone dry for the first time since 1937.
   _West Coast: San Francisco and Los Angeles have imposed
mandatory water rationing in the wake of light winter snow in the
mountains, where the snowpack is a natural reservoir. Growers have
been told that irrigation allotments may be cut.
   That lack of snow also has left hydroelectric reservoirs falling
on the Columbia River in Washington, at the same time water must be
released from those reservoirs to help migrating salmon.
   During the past month, the grain futures market in Chicago has
surged upward as traders bet on smaller and smaller harvests.
Soybean futures rose 25 percent during the past month and last week
broke the $9-a-bushel barrier, highest since late 1983. Oats traded
up by the daily limit _ 10 cents, raised to 15 cents at midweek _
on four of the five trading days last week.
   The market opened sharply lower Wednesday after reports that
parts of west-central Iowa got rain, with 5.2 inches at Coon Rapids
and 1.79 at Des Moines. But other parts of the state stayed dry.
   The price of soybeans for July delivery closed slightly lower
Friday on the strength of forecasts for rain early this week, but
that was a decline of just 2 cents.
   Iowa's statistical bureau said the state's pastures were at
their June 1 driest since 1956.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department cited dry weather on the Plains
in May when it reported that farmers were harvesting an estimated
1.57 billion bushels of winter wheat. That's slightly more than
last year but 3 percent _ 50 million bushels _ less than a
prediction issued a month earlier.
   ``Corn is just lying there. Not enough moisture to germinate it.
Some early corn is barely surviving,'' said Bobby Peek,
agricultural extension agent in Buncombe County, N.C. ``Transplants
of tobacco are dying. They stood there for a few days, and now
they're starting to die. I never have known a spring like this and
nobody you talk to has, either.''
   The situation is acute for dairy farmers because grass to feed
livestock is wilting or not growing as fast as usual, and they also
depend on hay grown at this time of year to feed their animals in
the winter.
   The Agriculture Department is already allowing farmers to cut
hay or let animals graze on land that was set aside for crop
reduction or conservation in struggling counties in Montana, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana
and Ohio.
   Some farmers are selling cattle earlier than usual to avoid
rising feed prices.
   ``Normally, we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year. The
yield from the first cutting was way down and there won't be much
of a second cutting,'' said Don Keyes of the Minnesota Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Much of the state has had
less than half normal rain this year.
   Hundreds of migrant workers who journey north to the Red River
Valley along the upper Minnesota-North Dakota border every year to
thin and weed sugar beets are finding there's no work waiting for
them.
   Growers replanted 150,000 acres of sugar beet plants after a
killing frost, but the new seedlings can't take root in the dry
soil and are blown about like tumbleweeds.

   The anti-immigration National Front has all but
vanished from the legislature in nationwide elections, despite
winning a stunning 14 percent of the vote in April's presidential
balloting.
   In National Assembly elections two years ago, 35 members of the
far-right party won seats. On Sunday, only one survived.
   But the Front was ambushed less by voters than by a new
winner-take-all polling system.
   Not only did party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen lose his seat, he
also dropped $17,300 in a bet with a pollster whose organization
predicted Le Pen would be defeated.
   Le Pen called the election ``unfair and undemocratic,'' adding
that it was unreasonable for a party that won 4{ million votes in
April to be nearly shut out of the legislature in June.
   The Socialists, who won the presidency and took control of the
National Assembly in 1981, made it possible for the National Front
to get into the Assembly when they changed the election law from a
winner-take-all majority system to a proportional one.
   The majority system favors large parties. The proportional
system, where seats are allotted on the basis of the percentage of
votes won, is better for smaller parties.
   When the conservatives ousted the Socialists from power in the
Assembly in 1986, they immediately voted back the majority system.
   ``We, unfortunately, predicted victory of the
Socialist-Communist left, even though they are in a minority,
because of the majority system of election which we fought,'' said
Jean-Pierre Stirbois, secretary-general of the National Front.
   ``The election system ... was conceived to eliminate the
National Front,'' said Le Pen. ``And, on the whole, it achieved its
objective, at least in Parliament.''
   The National Front, vilified by the other political parties and
accused of being racist and xenophobic for its anti-immigration
platform, burst onto the political scene in 1984 by winning 11
percent of the vote in elections for a European Parliament.
   The party won 9.8 percent in 1986 legislative elections, not
only entering the assembly for the first time, but surpassing 30
seats, the number needed to form a separate parliamentary political
group.
   Le Pen's 14.4 percent performance in the 1988 presidential
election was 2{ points above the most optimistic prediction.
   Though suffering a serious setback in this election, the
National Front recorded at least one success. It brought
traditional rightist parties into a deal for mutual support in
several constituencies in recognition of its political strength.
   Le Pen claimed this arrangement allowed the right to blunt what
otherwise would have been a Socialist landslide.
   Carrying the National Front standard will be only Yann Piat, who
won re-election from a Mediterranean district. Mrs. Piat, the wife
of a naval officer, celebrated both her victory and her 39th
birthday on Sunday.
   ``I am an ardent defender of a strong Europe but a fierce
adversary of uncontrolled immigration,'' she said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hopes To Bring People Together Like RFK</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis said in an interview with British
broadcasters that he's not ``a razzle-dazzle performer'' but still
hopes to unite Americans the way the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
did.
   The Massachusetts governor said in the interview broadcast
Sunday that Kennedy had an unusual ability to bring blacks,
Hispanics, the elderly and white ethnic communities together.
   ``People saw him as being somebody who cared about people
everywhere _ and I'd like to think I'm that kind of person and
that's the kind of leadership I want to bring to the presidency,''
he said in an interview on the Channel 4 television program ``The
World This Week.''
   Dukakis, who was interviewed last week in California, appeared
unconcerned about criticism that he lacks charisma.
   ``I must be doing something right if I've been able to come
through this 15 months successfully,'' he said.
   ``I'm not a razzle-dazzle performer on the stage. I think I give
a reasonably decent speech, but my strength is in working with
people, in bringing people together, in my love of public service,
in the importance that I place on building coalitions,'' he said.
   ``I think people are ready for somebody who comes to the White
House, sure with warmth and feeling _ obviously I have that _ but
with the ability to get the job done. And I think that's what the
American people are looking for. It's certainly my great strength
and it's the reason that we've done as well as we've done,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Schroeder Criticizes Bush, Dukakis for Avoiding Domestic Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Rep. Pat Schroeder says both national
party front-runners have failed to take a stand on domestic issues
including child care.
   ``We need to find out what their (Republican George Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis) vision for the 21st century is,''
Schroeder, of Colorado, told the 38th national convention of the
League of Women Voters here Saturday.
   She urged the members to bring greater attention to family,
child care, economic and nuclear issues, citing a recent poll that
listed those as the top concerns of Americans.
   ``A very sensible list. But these are not the `power issues' in
Washington,'' she said, taking a slap at a presidential campaign
she considered joining last year.
   ``We have so stylized the campaigns anymore (that) we're going
to have to outlaw decaffeinated coffee (until after the election)
or we'll all fall asleep,'' she said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Takes Humorous Jabs At Bush And Himself At Press Roast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis responded with a bit of
mimicry when he received a mock congratulatory telegram from
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, at a press roast.
   ``Thank you, Dan,'' said the straight-faced recipient.
   Dan? Yes, Dan, as in CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who had an
infamous interview with Dukakis' Republican opponent, George Bush.
And ``Dan'' as in the name Bush repeatedly used to refer to his
interviewer, Ted Koppel, on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program last
week.
   It was a night of lampoons Saturday as Dukakis was honored by
the Boston Press Photographers Association. The Massachusetts
governor, who has rarely strayed from his straightforward delivery
on the campaign trail, poked fun at his chief rival, selection of a
running mate and even himself.
   Dukakis told the gathering he took a break that afternoon to go
``to a Harvard boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow,'' a jibe
at Bush's characterization of Dukakis as an elitist.
   Master of ceremonies Bob Warren presented him with a cardboard
presidential seal with a likeness of a cod in place of the bald
eagle.
   He laughed again when another seal was attached to the podium;
the sign said the official seal of ``The Next President of the
United States.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis says as
president, he would wage a ``real war on drugs'' _ something he
says the Reagan administration has failed to do.
   Dukakis was focusing on drug issues today. He had meetings set
with leaders of his state anti-drug program and with members of
Congress to discuss national efforts to fight drugs.
   A day earlier, Dukakis was in Utah to address the nation's
mayors, and was harshly critical of the administration's dealings
with Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment on
drug charges.
   If elected, Dukakis told the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Salt
Lake City on Sunday, he would tell the CIA and other agencies:
``Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drug peddler
who's poisoning our society and killing our children.''
   Dukakis also chided Reagan for ignoring efforts by Latin
American leaders to get Noriega to step down.
   ``They tried to go it alone and they fell flat on their face,''
Dukakis said of administration efforts to oust Noriega.
   Dukakis said he would direct more foreign aid to anti-drug
efforts, including support for drug-crop eradication and step up
protection of officials in drug-producing nations who have ``the
guts to join us in this war.''
   He said the military should be prepared to assist those efforts.
   Dukakis outlined a domestic anti-drug effort he said would
include tougher drug laws and stiffer fines, property seizures and
sentences, along with increased cooperation between federal, state
and local law enforcement agencies. He called for expanded drug
education for students and teachers, and guaranteed access to drug
treatment.
   ``For us, the stakes are clear,'' Dukakis said in a speech well
received by the mayors, a largely Democratic group. ``The war is
on.''
   Dukakis did not mention his certain Republican challenger, Vice
President George Bush, by name. But he attacked administration
anti-drug efforts, in which Bush played a part when he headed an
anti-drug task force.
   ``What we have today is chaos,'' Dukakis said of the
administration's anti-drug effort.
   Dukakis picked up endorsements from more than 500 Democratic
mayors and vice mayors.
   Dukakis held a private gathering with several black mayors who
support Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign. Several described
the meeting as a positive step toward building black support for
Dukakis, but added that how he resolves differences with Jackson
will be a crucial factor.
   Before leaving for Boston, Dukakis met with leaders of the
Church of Latter Day Saints and separately with actor Robert
Redford.

   A newly discovered herpes virus may
cause much of the damage to the immune system in people suffering
from the deadly disease AIDS, a researcher says.
   Dr. Robert Gallo, one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus, said
Sunday that the herpes virus works in concert with AIDS to attack
the white blood cells that orchestrate the body's defenses against
disease.
   He said the herpes virus can knock out the body's immune system
more effectively than Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome once the
AIDS virus has weakened the body's defense.
   The herpes virus appears to be harmless or to produce only very
mild disease in otherwise normal healthy people, Gallo said at the
opening session of the Fourth International Conference on AIDS in
Stockholm.
   ``Most of us in this room have been exposed to and probably
infected with this virus'' while showing little or no sign of it,
he said.
   The new herpes virus was discovered by researchers in Gallo's
laboratory in 1986. It was initially called HBLV (for human B-cell
lymphotropic virus) and is now referred to as HHV-6 (human herpes
virus, type six).
   This sixth human herpes virus, though related, is different from
the herpes viruses that cause cold sores and genital infections.
   One of the principal targets of the AIDS virus is the T4
lymphocyte, a white blood cell that serves as the master
orchestrator of the body's immune response to invading organisms.
   It appears, however, that the AIDS virus only infects a small
percentage of T4 cells, yet it kills a very large percentage of
them.
   There are a number of theories to explain how this might happen,
but Gallo proposed that the new herpes virus might be the answer.
   In studies in the test tube, the herpes virus is a more
effective killer of T4 cells than is the AIDS virus, Gallo said.
   It can activate the dormant AIDS virus, and it is more common in
AIDS patients _ and in such high-risk groups as homosexuals and
drug abusers _ than it is in the population at large, Gallo said.
   The AIDS virus weakens the immune system allowing HHV-6 to
enter, HHV-6 activates the virus and kills cells, producing further
loss of immune defenses, and the deadly cycle continues.
   To prove that, Gallo will have to do studies with animals, if he
can find animals that are infected both by the AIDS virus and
HHV-6, he said.

   The Tokyo stock market's key indicator on Monday
closed at its second highest level ever, while the U.S. dollar
gained ground against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 151.66-point
loser on Friday, bounced back 117.14 points, or 0.41 percent, to
close at 28,037.50 points. It had closed at a record 28,072.02
points on Thursday.
   The dollar finished at 125.19 yen, up 0.34 yen from Friday's
close. It had opened at 125.07 yen and ranged between 125.00-125.20
yen during the day.
   ``Led mainly by large-capital issues, the index rose following
last Friday's rise on Wall Street,'' said an official of a major
securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He added that stock prices were mixed in part because some
investors took to the sidelines prior to the release of April U.S.
trade figures, due out Tuesday.
   The dollar moved little in sluggish trading, dealers said.
   ``The market is holding steady as participants are waiting for
the U.S. trade figures,'' said an official of a major Tokyo
commercial bank, who requested anonymity.
   An exchange dealer at another commercial bank said the dollar
``was strengthened'' after a weekend remark by U.S. Federal Reserve
Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson that there was room for the U.S.
currency to rise.
   Johnson, speaking to reporters Saturday in West Germany, said he
thought ``there would be a certain tolerance for (the dollar to
rise).''

<HEAD>Woman Who Was One of Last Shakers Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gertrude Soule, a Shaker leader whose
storytelling helped outsiders understand her rapidly disappearing
religious community, has died at age 93, leaving no more than 10
sect members in the United States.
   Soule died in her sleep Saturday, Richard Kathmann, director of
the Centerbury Shaker Village, said Sunday.
   Her death leaves only two Shaker women in their 90s in New
Hampshire, and up to eight in Maine.
   Soule was born in Topsham, Maine. At age 11, she and her sister
were placed with the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Maine,
after the death of their mother.
   She chose to remain with the community when she turned 21 and
signed the Shaker vow of celibacy.
   In an interview this year, she said the vow was a challenge at
times.
   ``Of course, when you're young you have high thoughts,'' she
said. ``But you're living in a community where a lot of sisters and
brothers are living a celibate life and you don't think anything
about it.''
   Shakers believe God has a mission for everyone, she said.
   ``Whoever's mission it is to marry and bring new life into the
world, that's their mission,'' she said. ``Our mission is to live
as near as we can to Christ's teachings.''
   In the early 1950s, Soule became an eldress, or spiritual
leader, of the Sabbathday Lake Society. In 1957, she was appointed
to the Lead Ministry of the United Society of Believers.
   She moved to the village here in 1972 to assume further
responsibilities as a member of the Lead Ministry, and served as
vice president of the non-profit educational corporation and museum
that administers the historic site founded in the 1780s.
   Her storytelling helped children visiting the museum understand
the ways of the sect that's famous for its simple, efficient
creations, including the flat broom, clothespin and ladderback
chairs.
   Shakers once numbered 6,000 at 24 communities throughout the
country.
   Now, the villages in Canterbury and Sabbathday Lake are the only
ones with Shakers. The Sabbathday Lake Shakers still admit new
members, but the Canterbury village has admitted none since 1965.
   The Maine village has five members recognized by the New
Hampshire village and three whose membership is in dispute because
of the 1965 decision not to admit newcomers.
   The New Hampshire village once was a community of 400 men, women
and children. Soule's death leaves Sister Ethel Hudson, 92, and
Eldress Bertha Lindsay, 90, as the last Shakers at the village.
   Shakers, members of the United Society of Believers in Christ's
Second Appearing, received their name from the trembling produced
by religious emotions. They lived communally and believed in a
diety with male and female natures. The group began in England in
1747.
   Funeral services are planned Tuesday at the village Dwelling
House Chapel.

   An Alaska Airlines plane went off a runway after
landing late Sunday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and
minor injuries were reported among the 82 people aboard, officials
said.
   Neither the number hurt nor the nature of their injuries was
immediately known, said Port of Seattle spokeswoman Margo Spellman.
   The Boeing 727 was carrying 75 passengers and seven crew members
from Tucson, Ariz., said Spellman.
   The extent of damage to the airplane was not immediately known.
Ms. Spellman said the passengers were evacuated from the plane via
emergency chutes.
   The accident occurred after Flight 187 landed at about 10:20
p.m., she said.
   The jetliner veered off a runway while landing and came to a
rest on a grassy strip dividing Sea-Tac's two parallel runways,
said Port Police spokesman John Eliadis.
   He said investigators were checking to see whether the plane
might have blown a tire upon landing or had struck debris on the
runway.
   Eliadis said the airport was closed to aircraft for about 15
minutes after the accident, but subsequently was re-opened to
departing traffic.
   Alaska Airlines officials were not immediately available for
comment.

<TEXT>
   The city that boasts the highest
average income in the country and attracts more tourists than
Disneyland is preparing to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its
sprouting from a lima bean field.
   And as one would expect from this capital of conspicuous
consumption, the 14-month-long extravaganza will be on a grand
scale, starting with a July 3 musical extravaganza, followed by an
ABC-TV special and a float in the Rose Parade.
   Former talk show host Merv Griffin, who owns the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, and singer Dinah Shore are the hosts of the musical, which
will include performers Jimmy Stewart, Betty White, Robert Stack
and Dick Van Patten.
   Merchants also are getting into the act, as only Beverly Hills
merchants can. Harry Winston, one of its more exclusive jewelry
stores, is crafting a slice of birthday cake iced with real
diamonds, said to be worth millions of dollars.
   The Labor Day weekend 1989 grand finale will bring together the
world's top fashion designers in what's touted as the world's
largest fashion show. More than 1,000 models will promenade along a
2{-block runway down Rodeo Drive.
   ``We want to attract as many people as possible,'' said event
chairman George Fenimore, who estimated the 14-month celebration's
cost at $1.6 million.
   Throughout much of its history, Beverly Hills, with its lavish
mansions and fashionable boutiques, has attracted worldwide
interest.
   ``It's just the fame of it,'' said tourist Sue Brown of
Doncaster, England. ``It's all very exciting. Most people know
Rodeo Drive, even in our little town.''
   The Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau estimated that
between 16 million and 18 million tourists last year ambled through
the Golden Triangle, Beverly Hills' downtown district, compared
with 13 million at Disneyland.
   No wonder Beverly Hills is celebrating. The average annual
income in the 5.6-square-mile city is $125,000. There are more
licensed gardeners per capita than in any other U.S. city and more
Rolls Royces per capita than in London.
   There are more than $8 billion in deposits at its 100 financial
institutions, making it the nation's richest banking community
after New York. There's also a doctor for every 52 residents.
   Beverly Hills High School students watch from their football
field as an oil derrick pumps black gold from the school's 17 oil
wells.
   But what really separates Beverly Hills from other wealthy
communties is it's association with the entertainment industry.
   In 1920, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks built their
legendary home, Pickfair, in the northern reaches of the city. The
home has since been owned by Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss
and most recently by Meshulam Riklis and his singer-wife, Pia
Zadora.
   It all began in 1912 when developer Burton Green built a pink
and green palace, the Beverly Hills Hotel, above a bridal path
called Sunset Boulevard, on 12 acres of a lima bean field.
   The hotel was built at a then-staggering $500,000, today just a
fraction of home prices in the city.
   It was, and still is, the focal point of the city's social life.
In 1923, Will Rogers was inaugurated as the city's first honorary
mayor there, and its famous polo lounge is the site of the ultimate
power breakfast.
   In 1942, Billionaire Howard Hughes lived in four of the hotel's
famous bungalows, two used as decoys from reporters.
   Stewart, who filmed part of the 1946 classic ``It's A Wonderful
Life'' at Beverly Hills High, moved here with his family in 1948.
He often walks his two golden retrievers through his neighborhood.
   ``I wave to the tourist buses and sign people's maps to the
star's homes,'' said Stewart, who was honored by the five-member
City Council earlier this month as Man of the Year.
   ``A lot of people come up to me and say, `That guy looks like
Dean Martin,''' said Joe Patti, whose La Famiglia restaurant is a
popular celebrity hangout. ``And I say, `That IS Dean Martin.'''
   All the hoopla aside, Beverly Hills is a thriving city of
33,000, known for its community-oriented government.
   New commercial developments are limited to three stories and
fast food chains are banned. Its schools are among the nation's
best, with 93 percent of its students going on to college.
   ``I have great affection for Beverly Hills,'' Stewart said.
``It's a city built for the benefit of the community itself, not
just for a small group of celebrities.''
   ``Some people say, `Oh, you're just a snob from Beverly Hills,'
'' restaurateur Patti added. ``Well, they're just jealous.''

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Cancels Terrorist Warning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy has begun notifying American
residents that they no longer need limit their movements to avoid a
possible terrorist attack. On Thursday, the embassy warned the more
than 1,500 Americans living in Beijing to take precautions. The
Chinese government had told it unidentified terrorists from a third
country might attack U.S. citizens in the capital.
   On Sunday, the embassy canceled its warning after the Chinese
assured U.S. officials the danger was over.
   ``The Chinese government informed us today that it has taken
effective action to ensure that persons who intended to harm
American citizens will not be able to do so,'' Embassy spokesman
McKinney Russell said Sunday.
   Late Saturday, the official Xinhua News Agency issued a
statement by the vice minister of public security, Gu Linfang,
saying ``necessary measures'' had been taken and ``the problem has
been solved.'' Gu did not elaborate.
   Xinhua quoted Gu as saying that ``some persons recently
attempted to harm Americans in China,'' but Russell said he was not
aware of any attempted attack.
   Russell said the Chinese government did not tell the embassy the
nationality of the alleged plotters. A U.S. official in Washington
who spoke on condition of anonymity said last week that there was
Middle Eastern involvement.
   Several Western hotels increased their security staff in
response to the warning. The International School run by the United
States and four other foreign governments blocked off its road and
tightened security.
   The embassy also recommended that Americans avoid restaurants or
bars known to be gathering points for Americans and avoid wearing
clothing that clearly identified them as American.
   U.S. officials refused to say what steps were taken to increase
security on the four compounds that house embassy offices and
Ambassador Winston Lord's residence.

<HEAD>Soviet President Says Roman Catholic Church Free to Expand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As weeklong activities marking the millennium of
Christianity in Russia neared culmination, President Andrei A.
Gromyko pledged to allow religious freedom for Roman Catholics in
this officially atheist country.
   Gromyko's statement, published Sunday in the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda, came in response to a question from Cardinal
Johannes Willebrands, a member of the largest Vatican delegation
ever to visit the Soviet Union.
   At the St. Danilov Monastery, meanwhile, thousands of people
celebrated a divine liturgy on one of the holiest dates on the
Russian Orthodox calendar, known as ``Sunday of All the Saints who
Shone Forth in the Land of Russia.''
   The ceremony culminated a week of conferences, services and
receptions commemorating 1,000 years of Christianity in Russia.
   Willebrands, who heads the Vatican's secretariat for Christian
Unity, was among several foreign dignitaries in Moscow for the
millennium who attended a Saturday meeting with Gromyko.
   ``Of course we aren't making any attempts to encroach on the
rights of the Catholic church,'' Pravda quoted Gromyko as telling
the cardinal. ``And likewise we are not trying to encroach on the
rights of Catholics living in the Soviet Union.''
   The Vatican representative had asked whether it would be
possible to organize Catholic churches not only in the Soviet
Union's Baltic republics, where a recognized church exists in
Lithuania, but also in other parts of the Soviet Union where there
are large Catholic communities.
   He listed those areas as the Ukraine, Byelorussia and
Kazakhstan, according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   Those republics have no fully recognized Catholic churches, and
the Vatican wants the right to appoint bishops there, Navarro said.
   Pravda's report of the question, taken from a Tass dispatch,
omitted the specific references to the Ukraine, Byelorussia and
Kazakhstan, reflecting the Kremlin's sensitivity on the issue.
   Gromyko said Catholic churches could be opened outside the
Baltic states if local authorities agree.
   ``In the future, we will give the necessary attention to the
wishes of Soviet Catholics, regardless of where they live,'' the
78-year-old president told the prelates.
   Though officially atheist, the government supports the Russian
Orthodox Church and has exhibited greater religious tolerance in
the three years Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been in power.
   Willebrands met Friday with clergy of the underground Ukrainian
Catholic Church, which Josef Stalin ordered absorbed into the
Russian Orthodox church in 1946 during a massive campaign of
religious repression.
   Ukrainian clerics say there are between 3 million and 4 million
Ukrainian Catholics in the Soviet Union. Pope John Paul II said in
a letter in April to Ukrainian Catholics that their church should
be fully recognized.
   The Russian Orthodox Church bitterly opposes recognition of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church, claiming it was formed only as a result
of a forced split in the Orthodox Church at the end of the 16th
Century.

<HEAD>Vietnam Retiring 70 Army Generals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam is retiring more than 70 army
generals and about 3,000 colonels this month as part of its policy
of reducing one of the world's largest armies, a Vietnamese
newspaper editor said today.
   Bui Tin, a deputy editor in chief of the official Communist
Party newspaper Nhan Dan (The People), said younger officers will
fill some vacated posts but other posts will be eliminated. Many of
the officers have stayed on despite having passed retirement age,
he said.
   Some of the retiring officers, including the commander in chief
of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, will return home when Vietnam
begins withdrawing troops from that country later this month, Tin
told reporters in Bangkok. He declined to name the commander.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw 50,000 troops from Cambodia
this year as part of its plan for a total withdrawal by 1990. It
says the entire military command will be transferred to the
pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978. By U.S. estimate, it
maintains 120,000 troops there to combat guerrillas.
   Vietnamese officials have said their army must be reduced so
resources can be concentrated on economic development, which the
party has set as the country's top priority.
   Tin compared the campaign to a simultaneous effort to streamline
the government to promote greater efficiency.
   According to London's International Institute of Strategic
Studies, Vietnam's army of 1.1 million men is tied with India as
the world's third largest, behind China and the Soviet Union.
   Tin noted that as a proportion of the total population,
Vietnam's army is much larger than that of China and India.
   He said Vietnam's serious unemployment problem will worsen as
soldiers return to civilian life.

   Three minutes and 2} pounds of pink tomatoes
later, 10-year-old Danny Orton was the newly crowned champion of
the annual tomato eating contest at the Bradley County Pink Tomato
Festival.
   ``I'm hungry. I didn't eat since dinner last night,'' Orton said
before chomping and chewing his way past two-time defending
champion Chuck Allen and two other adults Saturday for the title
and the $50 prize.
   Orton, of Hermitage, was the first contestant to take his seat
before a heap of tomatoes, and he listened attentively as the
referee explained the rules, including the three-minute time limit.
   Allen, who won last year by tossing down more than 5 pounds of
tomatoes, had been the odds-on favorite to repeat this year. He
said before the contest that he did not feel well. He came out slow
and finished in a three-way tie for second place with Jay Wisener
and Dallas Davis.
   ``I think it messed me up on tomatoes,'' Davis, who works in a
tomato shed, said of the experience.
   The youngest contestant, 7-year-old Daniel Tucker of Star City,
said he entered because, ``I wanted to get some money and I like
eating good tomatoes.''
   He paused at intervals during the contest and used his T-shirt
to wipe tomato juice from his chin.
   More than 20,000 people attended this year's festival, which
also featured the popular all-tomato luncheon, where every item on
the menu except coffee and tea had tomatoes as an ingredient.

followed by Sam Teply of Lexington, Neb., in the contest sponsored
by the Livestock Marketing Association.
   The contestants Saturday each sported their own particular
calling style, ranging from low-key and straightforward to flashy
and loquacious.
   And they did run on.
   ``Here they come. They're good ones,'' called Keith Dinwoodie of
Armstrong, British Columbia, as a group of cattle was driven into
the ring. ``Look at the legs on 'em. The quality's here. Just the
way you want to buy 'em, fellas.''
   Dinwoodie, a former winner in the world all-around competition,
said his natural propensity to babble led him into livestock
selling.
   ``I grew up in Alberta on a ranch. I was kind of a mouthy kid,
and one day my dad and uncle said, `Why don't you be an
auctioneer?'''
   The tricky part of selling livestock, auctioneers say, is
keeping a close eye on buyers, whose bidding motions sometimes
merely resemble nervous tics.
   ``The bidders out here today have been super,'' said John Tarter
of Smiths Grove, Ky., one of 15 finalists. ``When they bid you can
really see it. Sometimes you get the eye winkers and finger
wigglers.''
   Along with sharp eyes, auctioneers have to talk fast and still
be understood, and that takes practice.
   Many participants attended auction school, but they said
practice makes perfect.
   ``I practice while I'm driving,'' said Duane Baxley from Paso
Robles, Calif., another finalist. ``Some people sing or talk to
themselves while driving _ I practice selling.''

<HEAD>Test More Accurate in Detecting AIDS Virus in Infants, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new test can distinguish infants infected by
the AIDS virus from those who only appear infected because they
carry blood proteins from their mothers, a study suggests.
   The test works by detecting genetic material from the virus,
rather than the standard method of detecting the proteins as
evidence of possible infection, scientists said.
   The proteins, called antibodies, form in reaction to exposure to
the AIDS virus. A mother's antibodies can pass to the fetus and
make the infant appear to have been exposed to the virus when
standard testing is used.
   The study, led by Steven Wolinsky at Northwestern University
Medical School in Chicago, is to be reported this week in Sweden at
the Fourth International Conference on AIDS.
   It used a ``polymerase chain reaction'' technique, called PCR,
to detect genetic material from the virus causing acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Part of the test focused on nine children, ages 6 months to 3
years, who had tested positive by standard tests. Three tested
negative by PCR and later were shown to be free of the virus. The
six others, scored positive by PCR, later showed other signs of
infection.
   In a different group of five children who had tested positive by
standard tests, three scored positive by the PCR test and later
showed other evidence of infection. The two others, who tested
negative with PCR, were found to be free of the virus.
   Five children who tested negative by standard tests also scored
negative with PCR.
   A second study by Wolinsky and colleagues confirmed other
demonstrations that PCR can detect infection in adults before they
test positive on antibody-based tests.
   Tests of stored blood samples suggested that 16 of 18 men who
tested positive on a standard antibody test would have tested
positive at least six months earlier with a PCR test. For one man,
the difference was 42 months, researchers said.

   Attackers yelled anti-American slogans
and hurled firebombs and tear-gas bombs at a U.S. government office
in a southern city today, officials said.
   The attack on the U.S. Information Service office in Taegu, 150
miles southeast of Seoul, caused no casualties and only minor
damage.
   The attackers tossed three firebombs and two tear-gas bombs at
the office, U.S. officials and police said. Three attackers,
believed to be students, were seized by police guards who stopped
them with tear-gas guns.
   Up to 10 radicals were involved in the attack, according to news
reports.
   Six windows were broken and the center's sign set on fire in the
attack, officials said. The center, which promotes information
about the United States and organizes cultural events, was briefly
evacuated.
   The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government and
anti-U.S. protests during the past two weeks by radical students
who have been demanding the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's
government and an end to Seoul's alliance with Washington.
   Anti-Americanism dominated the protests, with radical students
claiming the United States enforces the partition of the divided
Korean peninsula so it can rule the south. The radicals want
immediate reunification with the communist north and removal of the
42,000 U.S. troops based in the south under a mutual defense pact.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter enemies. The
north invaded the south in 1950 to launch the Korean War.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
failed to attract public support.

<HEAD>Jetliner Crashes In Fog In Northeastern Argentina; 22 Presumed
Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POSADAS, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators will study flight data
to find out why a DC-9 jetliner on a domestic flight crashed in
heavy fog near a northeastern airport, apparently killing all 22
people aboard.
   Austral Air Lines said 15 passengers and a crew of seven were
aboard the private carrier's plane, which on Sunday crashed into a
grove of eucalyptus trees about a half-mile short of the Posadas
airport.
   The plane had left Buenos Aires Sunday morning, stopping first
in the river port city of Resistencia before heading north for
Posadas, the capital of Misiones province, which is about 650 miles
north of Buenos Aires.
   The airline statement said Flight 046 crashed ``for unknown
reasons.'' It added, ``Given the magnitude of the accident, it is
presumed there are no survivors.''
   Intense heat at the crash site initially prevented recovery of
all the bodies.
   A Misiones radio station said the plane's black box was found in
the wreckage and investigators hoped the device that records flight
data will help them determine the cause of the crash.
   Local news reports indicated the jetliner made an abrupt turn
while approaching the airport runway three miles outside Posadas,
stalled in the air and then crashed.
   ``We flew over the crashed plane a little after the accident and
fire consumed everything in 10 minutes,'' said Federico Lujan,
civil aviation director of Misiones province.
   Witnesses and firefighters at the scene said the air was filled
with the smell of burning eucalyptus and that wreckage from the
charred DC-9 was strewn across a large area.
   Austral released a list of the people on board that indicated
most were Argentine, but one passenger identified only as Peterson
was also listed in the flight manifest.
   Austral is a private carrier purchased last year from the state.
It competes with the government carrier Aerolineas Argentinas on
domestic routes. Austral had been taken over by the state earlier
this decade because of financial troubles.

   The Vatican's No. 2 official talked with Mikhail
S. Gorbachev today and delivered a letter from John Paul II, but
the Soviet leader indicated the pope would not be visiting the
Soviet Union anytime soon.
   Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of state, met
the Soviet leader and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at
the Kremlin Council of Ministers building.
   The cardinal was in Moscow leading a Vatican delegation to
celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of Russian Christendom.
   Polish-born John Paul was not invited to take part. He has
insisted he must be free to meet with Roman Catholics in Lithuania
and elsewhere in the Soviet Union if he visits the country.
   Waiting to greet Casaroli, Gorbachev was asked by reporters when
the pope might visit the Soviet Union.
   ``For that, a lot still has to happen,'' Gorbachev said.
   Shevardnadze, who also talked to reporters briefly, said ``the
time will come'' when the pope can travel to the Soviet Union.
``We'll talk to Casaroli about it,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Vatican officials said that Casaroli carried a letter to
Gorbachev from John Paul, but they said nothing about its contents.
   On Friday, Casaroli met with five bishops and priests of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church, which is not officially recognized in
the Soviet Union and therefore operates illegally.
   The officially atheist state supports, but has traditionally
tightly controlled, the Russian Orthodox Church.

<HEAD>Strong Earthquake Breaks Windows, Knocks Kids Off Their Feet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake that broke windows,
emptied supermarket shelves and knocked children off their feet was
one of the strongest temblors to hit the quake-prone region in
years, authorities said.
   The earthquake, felt over a 350-mile area from Santa Rosa to
Bakersfield, was the sharpest of at least three measurable temblors
in California on Sunday. There were no reports of serious injuries
or damage.
   ``We got rocked and rolled pretty good,'' said police dispatcher
Chris Mraz in Milpitas, 10 miles west of the quake's center.
   The quake registered 5.3 on the Richter scale, according to the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. The University of California
Seismographic Station in Berkeley recorded it at 5.1 on the Richter
scale of ground motion.
   Ceilings cracked, a water pipe burst and burglar alarms sounded
in the area closest to the epicenter, and nervous residents rushed
into the street in at least one neighborhood and jammed phone lines
throughout the San Francisco Bay area. One man said he saw parked
cars moving in the U.S. Army's Presidio base in San Francisco.
   The quake hit at 6:45 p.m. and was centered on the Calaveras
Fault about 10 miles northeast of San Jose, near unincorporated
Alum Rock.
   Both seismographic centers recorded several small aftershocks
Sunday night, and Berkeley center spokesman Anthony Lomax warned
that another temblor of up to magnitude 4 was likely.
   Experts expressed concern because the 5-mile-long epicenter was
just north of the center of a destructive quake that hit Morgan
Hill in 1984, registering 6.2 on the Richter scale, the region's
strongest temblor in years.
   Sunday's quake's shallow epicenter increased its impact on the
area, experts said.
   Two children in Fremont, 10 miles north of the epicenter, said
they were knocked to the floor and suffered mild bruises when the
ground began to ripple.
   ``It still hurts when I walk,'' said 5-year-old Tommy Harang,
whose 12-year-old sister Chrissy also took a fall.
   In Milpitas, the quake knocked dozens of boxes, cans and bottles
off the shelves of at least one supermarket and further cracked a
window damaged in an earlier quake.
   ``We got off pretty easy,'' said Bill Smith, the night manager.
``I've lived in California all my life, so I'm blase about
earthquakes. I thought, `Here we go again.'''
   Earlier Sunday, an earthquake registering 3.3 on the Richter
scale jolted Napa and Solano counties in northern California, and a
quake measuring 3.4 hit the inland area of Southern California
around Ontario.
   The Ontario temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit
Southern California since Friday, when a shaker measuring 5.2 on
the Richter scale hit 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles and was
felt in much of central and southern California.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strenth of the shaking.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

<TEXT>
   A Japanese teen-ager was arrested after he
tried to sneak explosives, a dismantled rifle, a pellet gun and
dummy hand grenades aboard an airplane, authorities said.
   Sunday morning's discovery of the weapons in the youth's luggage
led authorities to close and evacuate one of five terminals at
Philadelphia International Airport for several hours.
   Yoshino Kosugi, 18, of Yokohama, Japan, was charged with
attempting to board an aircraft with firearms, explosives or
incendiary devices, said FBI agent John Kundts.
   Kosugi, a student at Drexel University, was scheduled to appear
before a federal magistrate today, Kundts said. Upon conviction,
the maximum sentence for the charge is five years in prison and a
$25,000 fine.
   Kosugi collects military paraphernalia, said Kundts.
   ``Contact with foreign authorities had determined at this time
no known association with a terrorist organization,'' Kundts said.
   Police detained Kosugi shortly after he tried to check in at the
last minute for an early morning Northwest Airlines flight to
Tokyo, said Detective Warren Rosen.
   When Kosugi's baggage was examined, the rifle and grenades were
found along with the pellet gun, carbon dioxide cartridges,
fireworks and flares, police Capt. Stanley Puchalski said.
   Also found was explosive black powder and some unspecified
ammunition that police were checking to determine whether it was
live, he said.
   Police bomb squad officers were called in and ordered the
evacuation of the terminal, Puchalski said. Departures were
delayed, but after nearly 3{ hours, the terminal began operating
normally, he said.
   Kundts said Kosugi was in the United States on a student visa,
but he did not know if Kosugi was leaving the country permanently.
   In April, Yu Kikumara, a Japanese national with links to the
terrorist Japanese Red Army, was arrested at a New Jersey Turnpike
rest stop after explosives were found in his car.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS President Laurence Tisch admits making
mistakes that led to the network's slump to third place in the
ratings, but vows to make changes to return it to the top spot.
   ``I have heard your concerns and disappointments loud and
clear,'' Tisch said at Sunday's opening session of the three-day
CBS affiliates conference.
   CBS fell to third place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings last
season for the first time in its history.
   ``We share your disappointment with our prime-time ratings last
season,'' he said. ``We will not settle for third or even second
place. Our highest priority is to restore CBS to No. 1. We will use
every resource and we are committed to that goal.''
   Tisch said the network would improve programming and the
promotion of that programming.
   ``We must be more aggressive in bringing our programming to the
attention of the public through promotion,'' he said, adding that
the network was putting new people in charge of on-the-air
promotion.
   Asked to identify an area where he had specifically made a
mistake, Tisch said he felt he should not have encouraged the
entertainment division to drop the Tuesday night movie and put in a
block of four comedies.
   ``I think if we had not done that and I had not encouraged them
to do that, we would not have ended up in third place,'' he said.
   In addition to its ratings woes, CBS has been beset by
programming delays resulting from the 14-week writers' strike, news
budget cuts and buyout rumors.
   ``There is one thing I want to make clear,'' said Tisch, who is
also chairman of Loews Corp. ``Despite rumors, CBS and Loews stock
is not for sale. The network is not for sale.''
   The estimated 800 people attending the luncheon burst into
applause.
   Tisch said he believed the price tag of $243 million for the
1992 Winter Olympics was a smart investment. He said he had been
criticized for the bid but said it was the first time anyone had
accused him of overspending.
   ``We have seen how two weeks of Olympic coverage can raise an
entire network and boost the ratings of its schedule,'' he said.
   Tisch said he didn't plan to put CBS into the cable business, as
ABC and NBC are, saying he felt ``the American public would be
better served by strengthening over-the-air broadcasting.''

   Six miles of shimmering Mylar tape, described
as a sculpture, has been removed from Aspen Mountain and wrapped
around the entrance to the Aspen Art Museum, sponsor of the exhibit.
   The tape exhibit, named ``Beacon Interrogator,'' was completed
last week for an art show entitled ``Sculpture-Aspen 1988.''
   When construction began on Thursday, protests started coming in
and one resident suggested in a letter to the editor of an Aspen
newspaper that the town should ``can the glitter or move it to
Vail.''
   Aspen and Vail are rival ski spas in the Colorado Rockies.
   ``There's always been security in the mountain, white in the
winter, brown in the spring, green in the summer,'' said Bill
Drueding, a town zoning official. ``Now I look up there and see
something I've known for 15 years and it's changed.''
   ``It's surprising to me that people feel as strong as they do
about me decorating their mountain,'' said New York artist Donald
Lipski, designer of the tape display. ``My guess is that there is
some complex sociology underneath that has nothing to do with my
piece.''
   The tape was removed from the mountain secretly early Saturday
and carried to the art museum. It had been scheduled to remain on
the mountain through Sept. 25.

   An anti-gang task force of 1,000 police
officers arrested 1,524 people, more than half of them gang
members, and seized guns, drugs and cars in a weekend crime
crackdown throughout the city, police said.
   The anti-gang task force, code-named ``The Hammer,'' was
concentrated in south-central Los Angeles, though officers made
several arrests in the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles.
   ``We will do it as often as we can, as often as we think it will
be productive and effective,'' police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth
said Sunday.
   Police confiscated at least 217 grams of cocaine, 551 grams of
marijuana, nearly $5,000 in cash and impounded 220 vehicles during
the two-night raid Friday and Saturday night, Officer Larry Judd
said.
   Along with rock cocaine and the drug PCP, several weapons also
were confiscated, including an AK-47 assault rifle.
   Smaller sweeps, using as many as 250 officers, have become
regular weekend fixtures since January, when police began an
aggressive crackdown on the city's 70,000 street gang members.
   The actions are major skirmishes in what Police Chief Daryl
Gates calls a war on ``the rotten little cowards,'' and followed
the release of a department report showing gang slayings had risen
20 percent this year.
   The report cited 96 gang-related killings in the city through
the end of May, compared to 80 a year ago. In all of Los Angeles
County there have been 138 gang-related killings this year. In
1987, there were 387 gang slayings.
   The report, however, showed a 3.5 percent decrease in
gang-related murders in south-central Los Angeles following the
added police presence. Gang killings in the region patrolled by the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Ddepartment rose 6 percent over the
same period, a sheriff's spokesman said.
   During the sweep, officers also gathered intelligence, filling
out hundreds of field identification forms of suspected and known
gang members to help them in future police work.

   New AIDS cases are being reported in
the United States at the rate of one every 14 minutes and an
estimated 365,000 cases will have been reported by 1992, the latest
U.S. government figures show.
   Dr. James Curran, director of the AIDS program at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said today that it is
difficult to tell whether the AIDS epidemic is leveling off.
   But he also said that, in his view, that is not a very important
question.
   ``We had a thousand cases reported in the United States last
week,'' he said in an interview during the Fourth International
Conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. ``Does it matter
whether it's going up or not?
   ``It might level off like lung cancer or heart disease _ and
that's not good,'' Curran added.
   He said an increasing number of people are contracting AIDS
through heterosexual contact in the United States, but that no
explosive increases in heterosexual spread of AIDS are likely.
   ``The data is too incomplete for firm conclusions,'' Curran said.
   In Europe, 12,221 cases of AIDS have been reported as of March
31, more than double the number reported a year earlier,
Jean-Baptiste Brunet of Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris, said
today.
   AIDS among drug abusers is increasing rapidly in Spain, France
and Italy, he said. An estimated 300,000 to 800,000 people in 30
European countries are now believed to be infected with the AIDS
virus, Brunet said.
   On Sunday, the director of the World Health Organization's AIDS
program told the conference's opening session that as many as
several hundred million people around the world may be at risk of
getting AIDS, which is now present in virtually every country in
the world.
   ``No country is immune,'' Dr. Jonathan Mann said.
   ``We do not _ we cannot _ have precise numbers, but it is likely
that several hundred million people around the world may have
behaviors which make them potentially vulnerable to infection with
HIV,'' said Mann, one of 7,000 scientists and doctors attending the
largest AIDS conference ever held.
   He estimated that 150,000 people will develop AIDS in 1988,
doubling in one year the estimated number of cases in the history
of the epidemic.
   In other developments, researchers at the National Cancer
Institute reported that a widely used AIDS drug appears to
dramatically reverse the devastating effects of the disease on the
brains of children.
   Dr. Philip Pizzo said children who have lost their speech as the
result of AIDS infection in the brain subsequently recovered their
ability to talk and other functions of the brain.
   Pizzo's study of 21 AIDS-infected children aged 14 months to 21
years showed that their IQ scores rose about 15 points after they
took AZT, the only drug that has been shown to help delay the onset
and severity of AIDS symptoms.
   Mann painted a grim picture of the AIDS epidemic but noted that
the world has never seen a mobilization of the kind that has been
mounted to fight the deadly disease.
   As an example of the ferocity with which AIDS can spread among
drug abusers, Mann described the situation in Bangkok, Thailand.
   Two years ago, virtually no one in the city had antibodies to
the AIDS virus. The presence of AIDS antibodies indicates an
individual has been infected with the virus.
   In 1987, 1 percent of the population had antibodies to AIDS. In
the first three months of this year, the infection had spread to 16
percent of Bangkok's population.
   ``This epidemic curve _ already documented in New York City,
Edinburgh and Milan _ threatens every community of IV (intravenous)
drug users in the world,'' Mann said.
   ``AIDS is changing the world,'' he said. ``It has become a key
part of the history of our time.''
   The number of AIDS cases officially reported to the World Health
Organization stood at 96,433 as of June 1. The number of actual
cases is now estimated to be 200,000, Mann said.
   Although AIDS was not identified until 1981, the origins of the
epidemic have been traced back to the 1970s, the time of what Mann
calls ``the silent pandemic.''
   ``A virus spread across the world, and we didn't even know it
existed ... It is _ or should be _ shocking to our modern pride
that such a global expansion could occur without even being
detected,'' he said.
   Participants in the four-day conference were scheduled to make
about 3,600 presentations, but no breakthroughs were expected in
ways of curing or preventing the deadly virus.
   AIDS damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Rumble Through Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled across the Midwest today, bringing
much-needed rain but flooding parts of Nebraska and pelting some
areas with hail. A high pressure system kept much of the nation dry.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from northwest
Minnesota through western parts of Nebraska into eastern Colorado
late Sunday and early today. Besides the rainfall, the storms
brought hail and gusty winds. Showers and a few thunderstorms also
hit southern Montana and northern Wyoming.
   Thunderstorms were heaviest across Nebraska, where heavy rain
caused local flooding late Sunday. Hemingford was drenched by 2
inches of rain, while part of the Nebraska Highway 92, west of
Scottsbluff, was flooded by 6 to 18 inches. More than an inch of
rain was measured at Crawford, which also was blasted by hail
one-inch in diameter.
   Meanwhile, the rest of the nation was dry as a high-pressure
system remained anchored over the central Appalachians. Dry weather
also covered parts of the West from the Pacific coast into the
inter-mountain areas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the Rockies and the High Plains into the upper Mississippi
Valley; thunderstorms through Montana, Wyoming, eastern Colorado
and western South Dakota; showers and thunderstorms scattered
across the southern half of Florida; showers widely scattered
through New England; and sunny skies over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were forecast in the 80s and 90s across most of the
nation; in the upper 60s and 70s along the Pacific coast and the
northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains, northern Arizona
and Maine; and in the 90s to around 100 across the desert Southwest
and the Texas Rio Grande River.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 82 degress at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Singer Dionne Warwick brought together her
show business friends in a benefit concert that capped a weekend of
events organizers expect to raise $1 million for AIDS education.
   The four-hour, $100-a-seat concert at the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts Sunday night reunited Ms. Warwick, Elton
John, Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight for a live rendition of their
hit song, ``That's What Friends Are For'' _ a plea for help in the
fight against the deadly virus.
   Frank Sinatra was to have joined the stars on stage, but son
Frank Sinatra Jr. told the audience the singer had ``taken ill''
and would not perform.
   A spokesman for The Warwick Foundation, Roy Betts, declined to
specify the nature of Sinatra's illness, but said he would not be
hospitalized. Susan Reynolds, Sinatra's publicist, said from Los
Angeles only that Sinatra was returning to California.
   Ms. Warwick, who organized weekend events that included a
special dinner and AIDS education workshops, cried as she made an
plea for more funds to educate the public about AIDS.
   ``We've got a big fight on our hands,'' she told the audience.
``And we know that with the help of people like you, we're going to
win that fight.''
   Elton John and Stevie Wonder made the longest trip for the
benefit, arriving Sunday after performing Saturday at the
FreedomFest anti-apartheid concert in London.
   ``That is what friends are for,'' Wonder said of his
cross-Atlantic journey to stand with Ms. Warwick.
   Betts said ticket sales for the concert, a sale of rights to the
concert to cable television and other proceeds should bring the
weekend's receipts to close to $1 million.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.

   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
says he plans to start eviction proceedings against suspected drug
dealers or users whose apartments contain drugs found during legal
searches by police.
   Civil libertarians expressed dismay at the plan but said they
would review the statute on which Morgenthau was basing the policy.
   Morgenthau's program would cover tenants in both privately owned
and city-owned buildings.
   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the district attorney, said the
law under which Morgenthau plans to seek the evictions states that
rental apartments cannot be used for illegal purposes.
   The action was outlined Sunday by Morgenthau on the WCBS-TV
program ``Newsmakers.''

<TEXT>
   Iran said its forces broke through Iraqi
defenses east of the southern port city of Basra today, killing or
wounding 4,000 Iraqis nearly three weeks after the Iraqis drove
them out of the region.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said fierce fighting was raging in the Salamcheh region,
with the Iranians ``holding the upper hand'' in a two-pronged
offensive.
   Iraq said the Iranians had crossed the border in what it called
a ``reckless assault'' at the deserted police posts at Bubiyan and
Kut Suwadi 15 miles east of Basra.
   An Iraqi military spokesman, who cannot be identified under
military regulations, told reporters in Baghdad that the Iraqis'
3rd Army Corps ``absorbed the momentum'' of the offensive and
contained it.
   He acknowledged fighting was still going on east of Fish Lake,
an area flooded by the Iraqis several years ago to block Iranian
thrusts.
   The spokesman said the Iraqis were preparing a counter-offensive
``that will teach the enemy a good lesson.'' He did not elaborate.
   There was no independent confirmation of either sides' claims.
The two nations rarely allow correspondents or other observers into
the combat zones.
   IRNA said Iranian troops punched through Iraqi defenses,
destroying 30 Soviet-made tanks, decimating three infantry brigades
and then overrunning three artillery battalions, setting ammunition
dumps on fire.
   IRNA correspondents with the Iranian assault force reported that
thick black smoke from the burning Iraqi depots billowed over the
battlefield.
   The agency reported that several hours after the offensive was
launched, a half-dozen other Iraqi infantry brigades had suffered
25 to 40 percent casualties. It made no mention of Iranian losses.
   The agency said the battlefield was littered with knocked-out
tanks and armored vehicles and that more than 700 Iraqis were
captured, including several senior officers.
   IRNA said Iranian artillery was pounding Iraqi positions behind
the lines to block reinforcements reaching the hard-pressed
frontline units.
   The offensive was the first major Iranian operation announced in
the strategically important southern sector since May 25.
   At that time, Iraqi soldiers pushed the Iranians out of a
hard-won bridgehead east of the southern port city of Basra in a
lightning offensive that apparently caught the Iranians by surprise.
   The Iranians had seized marshlands east of Basra with severe
losses in early 1987 and battled to within six miles of the city
before they were blocked by Iraqi defenses.
   The loss of the Basra bridgehead was Iran's second battlefield
defeat in five weeks.
   The Iraqis had recaptured the Faw Peninsula south of Basra on
April 18, ending two years of Iranian occupation.
   The Iranians, jolted by loss of their two main footholds on
Iraqi soil, had been expected to launch a retaliatory offensive in
an attempt to regain military initiative in the nearly 8-year-old
Persian Gulf war.
   Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, seeking to restore
Iran's military fortunes, appointed Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani as acting commander-in-chief of the armed force on June
2.
   Tehran Radio said at the time that Rafsanjani's appointment as
military leader was expected to herald ``new victories on the
battlefield.''
   Rafsanjani's appointment climaxed a shuffle of military
commanders that followed the loss of Faw on April 18, the same day
that the U.S. Navy sank or crippled six Iranian naval craft in a
series of clashes in the gulf.

<TEXT>
   A judge today rejected a bid to
reopen the trial of the Sharpeville Six, and the blacks convicted
for a mob murder once again faced hanging unless President P.W.
Botha intervenes.
   The judge gave the defendants 35 days to appeal to Botha or the
chief justice.
   The president already has turned down an appeal for clemency. In
doing so, he spurned an international campaign to spare the six,
who were found guilty in the mob killing of a black town councilor.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice Willem Human, who presided over
the original trial in 1985, rejected an application by defense
lawyers to reopen the case to consider allegations that police
coerced two state witnesses.
   The defendants _ five men and a woman _ were convicted of
complicity in the 1984 death of black town councilor who was stoned
to death and burned during riots provoked by a rent increase.
   Human, who had granted a stay of execution hours before the six
were to hang in March, said today the request to review the case
was ``frivolous and absurd.''
   But he extended the stay of execution, which would have expired
today, until July 19, giving defense attorneys 35 days to appeal
once again to Botha and ask Acting Chief Justice P.J. Rabie to
overrule the court's decision.
   However, Human indicated he felt the chief justice would not
overturn his decision by telling the lawyers that their only
remaining hope lay in petitioning Botha again.
   Several dozen friends, relatives and diplomats crowded into the
courtroom did not react immediately to the reading of the decision,
but some broke down and wept in the corridor when attorney Prakesh
Diar explained the ruling to them. They then went to Pretoria
prison to visit the six convicts.
   Diar said, ``It's a bit surprising that he would give a time
limit'' on when the chief justice would have to make a decision.
``Our experience when you petition the chief justice (is that) it
takes many months. He's giving us a deadline for the chief justice
to make up his mind. I think I'm losing a little extra hope with
the judge's attitude.''
   Human said apart from allegations that two witnesses were
coerced, there was ample uncontested evidence to implicate all six
defendants and he would not extend the stay of execution beyond
July 19.
   Diar said he would try to appeal to the chief justice. But he
said the fate of the six was really in Botha's hands.
   ``I hope and I pray that the state president will reconsider his
previous decision. This is a politically related case. (Botha's
decision) may be based on political considerations.''
   Diar said he spoke to his clients last week and described them
as ``hopeful, but not confident.''
   Prosecutors argued during a hearing last week that Human had no
jurisdiction to reopen the case because an appeal has been rejected
by the country's highest court, the Appeals Court.
   Defense lawyers had said Human could reopen the case if he
determined the trial court was defrauded by false evidence obtained
through coercion.
   But Human said today that further questioning of a state witness
who recanted part of his incriminating testimony would be ``an
exercise in futility.''
   The six were granted a stay of execution March 17, one day
before they were to hang.
   Their case has generated controversy in part because they were
not convicted of contributing physically to the councilor's death.
They were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose, which
held them responsible because they actively participated in the mob
which killed the councilor.
   The government has contended that the six have been unfairly
portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law. Authorities
say evidence at the trial showed that each played an active part in
the killing, through such actions as making firebombs to burn the
victim's house and slapping a woman who pleaded for the councilor's
life.
   The defendants are Mojalefa Sefatsa, Reid Mokoena, Oupa Diniso,
Duma Khumalo, Francis Mokhesi and Theresa Ramashamola, the only
woman on Death Row for what activists say is a politically related
crime.
   Through the policy of apartheid, the white minority government
has established a racially segregated society and denies the
country's 26 million blacks a vote in national affairs.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services. Black officials in the
government's employ are thus often resented by other blacks.

<HEAD>Budget Director Says Deficit Will Likely Exceed Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget Director James Miller said today that
this year's federal deficit will likely be greater than the
administration had forecast, forcing automatic spending cuts unless
new ways are found to slash spending.
   Miller said greater spending on such things as savings and loan
bailouts and lower tax revenues will push the budget gap higher
than the $146 billion threshold that would force cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   ``I'm afraid its about to fall,'' Miller, speaking on NBC-TV's
``Today'' program, said of Gramm-Rudman's automatic budget-cutting
ax.
   ``We're going over in spending and some of the receipts are a
little bit short so it looks like unless we do something it'll
fall,'' said Miller, director of the presidential Office of
Management and Budget.
   The budget blueprint worked out earlier this year by
congressional leaders and the administration projects a $135.3
billion deficit next year, barely below the $136 billion target of
the Gramm-Rudman law for fiscal 1989.
   The Congressional Budget Office had offered more pessimistic
forecasts for the budget, but Congress used figures provided by the
White House in projecting the deficit.
   ``When we sent the budget up, the bipartisan budget agreement
didn't leave very much margin for error at all,'' Miller said
today. ``The problem is that if we just tip over at all, that'll
trigger the cuts.''
   He said the administration's figuring had assumed revenues that
have actually been depressed because of lower inflation than the
White House had foreseen and ``we have some spending that's up. For
example, bailing out thrift institutions _ that's going to cost
more money.''
   The government last week paid out a record $1.35 billion to
investors in two failed California savings and loans.
   Miller said the Gramm-Rudman law would force cuts of 3{ percent
in domestic programs and 8 percent in defense spending unless
Congress comes up with other cuts by Oct. 1.
   ``By law we have to make these determinations,'' Miller said.
``We don't want those cuts; I don't think anybody wants those
cuts.''
   ``A concern is there are a number of threats up there, Congress
has got a number of bills it's trying to pull out of the hopper.
... And when you're right there at the margin, it looks like we're
going to have to do these across-the-board cuts, we cannot afford
to have that increased spending.''
   He said the budget gap was not enough to warrant more taxes,
however.
   ``I just don't think at this point we really need to have a tax
increase,'' said Miller.

Greece</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian suspected of placing bombs
aboard two U.S. jetliners that killed five people will be tried in
Athens on charges of entering Greece on a forged passport, a
security official said today.
   The Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, 34, has been held at Greek
security police headquarters since a tip from the U.S. Embassy led
to his arrest June 1 at Athens Airport.
   The United States is seeking Rashid's extradition for his
alleged involvement in the bombings of the U.S. jets over Hawaii in
1982 and over Greece in 1986.
   ``We understand that Rashid is to be tried for coming into
Greece with false travel documents. The question of his extradition
therefore doesn't arise at this stage,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to police, Rashid entered Greece on a fake Syrian
passport. If convicted, he could receive an 18-24 month sentence
for traveling on forged documents, the security official said.
   ``Under normal practice, it would be possible for extradition
proceedings to be started after he has finished serving the prison
term,'' the security official said.
   The official said he was not aware that any date had been set
for Rashid's trial. In the crowded Athens judicial system, suspects
may be held for up to 10 months before their case is heard.
   Greece has followed similar procedures in the past when faced
with extradition requests for alleged terrorists.
   A Jordanian arrested in Greece in 1982 is still awaiting
extradition to Italy, where he is wanted for allegedly plotting an
attack against the Rome synagogue that killed a small boy.
   Rashid, believed to be an explosives expert, is suspected of
placing a sophisticated device that went off aboard a TWA jet on a
Rome-Athens flight in April 1986 as it flew over southern Greece.
Four people, including a baby, died when they were blasted out of
the aircraft.
   Rashid also allegedly placed a bomb aboard a Pan Am jumbo jet
that exploded as the plane was coming in to land at Honolulu on a
flight from Tokyo in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15
passengers were injured.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush are likely to face a tight race for the White House this fall,
but Dukakis is off to a fast start in some traditionally Republican
states, according to a 50-state Associated Press survey.
   Democrats around the country expressed optimism about Dukakis'
chance to end eight years of Republican rule in the White House.
   Republicans in the survey said the contests shapes up as a close
one, but several officials added that Bush could win easily if he
succeeds in his attempt to depict Dukakis as an heir to the
Democratic party's recent liberal past.
   The AP survey included recent public opinion polls and
interviews with independent political analysts and party officials
in all 50 states.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, leads in the polls in
California and New Jersey, both of which last voted Democratic in
1964. He is running even with Bush in the polls in Utah, which gave
President Reagan his largest majorities in 1980 and 1984. One
survey shows him even in reliably Republican Nebraska, and within
striking distance in Texas and Florida, key Southern states.
   Said Democratic Chairwoman Karen Marchioro of Washington state,
``This is the best shot we've had in a long, long time.'' The last
time a Democrat carried her state in a presidential election was
1968.
   ``I think it will be the closest presidential contest we've had
since 1976,'' said Tom Cole, the GOP state chairman in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma hasn't voted for a Democrat in a presidential campaign
since 1964.
   Republicans have won four of the last five presidential
elections, with Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976 the only exception.
   While Dukakis leads in nationwide public opinion polls, there is
agreement that political fortunes in the five months until the
election will be influenced by factors such as selection of a vice
presidential running mate, campaign debates and the health of the
economy.
   Republicans say Dukakis' lead is a temporary result of favorable
publicity in recent weeks from his string of primary victories
against Jesse Jackson.
   ``Nobody has laid a glove on Dukakis,'' says South Carolina GOP
party director Tom Denny. ``That's going to change once the
conventions are over. We haven't been able to start hitting on
him.''
   For now, Dukakis' lead nationally is reflected in poll results
around the country and optimism among Democratic officials in
states from Washington and Oregon to New Hampshire.
   _ He leads Bush by double digits in polls in California, the
largest state with 47 electoral votes, which last voted for a
Democrat in 1964. He is also viewed as the leader in both
Washington, which last went Democratic in 1968, and Oregon, which
last voted that way in 1964.
   _ Polls in Utah and Nebraska indicate the two men are running
even. Neither state has backed a Democrat in a presidential race
since 1964, and GOP officials in both states express confidence
that won't change this time.
   _ Bush holds leads in polls in Texas and Florida, but Dukakis is
well within striking distance and officials in both parties say the
race could be influenced by vice presidential running mates. Bush
is perceived as running generally well across the South.
   ``I sense a strong base of support for Vice President Bush'' in
the South, says Steve French, political director of the Alabama
Republican Party. ``But Republicans in Alabama realize how close
this election can be.''
   Officials of both parties agree that the vice president also has
to contend with weaknesses in the Midwest that were exposed during
the primary season.
   ``If the election were held today, I think Michael Dukakis would
stand a good chance of winning Iowa,'' where a Democrat last won in
1964, said the state's GOP chairman, Michael Mahaffey.
   As is often the case, the large industrial states _ Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio among them _ are viewed as key battlegrounds,
although Dukakis seems to hold the early advantage in each of them.
   Most officials believe Dukakis holds an advantage in New York,
the second-largest state with 36 electoral votes. In Pennsylvania,
GOP Chairman Earl Baker said Dukakis is ``the strongest Democratic
candidate'' to run in the state. Dukakis's base also gives him a
good shot at Connecticut as well as Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
and Democratic officials say the three Northern New England states
shape up as closer than usual.
   ``No matter what the polls look like this is going to be a close
election because the vice president has an advantage in the
Electoral College,'' says Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager. He
says in states in the South and West there are ``210 or 220
(electoral college votes) easily available for the vice president.
... The problem is the other 50 are going to be difficult.''
   Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director, says the Democrat
intends to stage raids in normally secure Republican territory.
``We can win electoral votes in every region of the country,'' he
says.
   It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency.
   The race could be heavily influenced by the vice presidential
selections.
   The survey turned up little enthusiasm for Jesse Jackson on the
Democratic ticket, in keeping with polls that indicate that such a
pick would lose support.
   Dukakis has been advised by some to look to a Southerner such as
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Westerner or perhaps Ohio Sen. John
Glenn to fill out his ticket.
   ``If Dukakis doesn't pick a Southerner, it just makes it that
more difficult for us,'' said Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle.
   On the Republican side, the name of California Gov. George
Deukmejian came up frequently as talk turned to holding his state
in the GOP column. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander also was
mentioned by several as a good Southern choice.
   Whatever the preferences, the polls indicate the importance of a
vice presidential selection.
   A Texas survey gives Bush a margin of 48 percent to 41 percent
over Dukakis. But if Texas Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen were to
join the ticket, the survey shows the race would narrow to
essentially even.
   Similarly, a recent poll in California gives Dukakis a lead of
53 percent to 40 percent over Bush. But the vice president would
fare far better if Deukmejian joins the ticket.

<TEXT>
   After graduating from college in three
years, 11-year-old Adragon Eastwood De Mello faces a mind-boggling
choice: Should he pursue the answer to cosmic riddles? Or should he
go to junior high?
   Like most boys his age, the freckle-faced lad with a Prince
Valiant haircut would rather not go back to junior high. ``I
already know that stuff,'' he lamented Saturday as he received his
bachelor's degree in mathematics from Cowell College at the
University of California, Santa Cruz.
   But, unless Adragon is admitted to a graduate program, he will
be required by state law to go to junior high this fall. His
father, Augustin De Mello, is prepared to send his son abroad to
escape that fate.
   ``Our system is not equipped to deal with children like him,''
said the proud father, a single parent who started Adragon on a
special learning program at an early age by hanging space mobiles
over his crib.
   On CBS' ``This Morning'' program today, Adragon said, ``I'm not
sure what graduate school I'll go to.'' However, he said, going
back to junior high school ``won't do me any good.''
   The father said he introduced Adragon to sophisticated books
before he was a year old and that Adragon uttered his first
``Hello'' at 6{ weeks. ``When he was a little older than 1, he
strapped on a guitar and started singing,'' the father said.
   Adragon knew the alphabet at age 2, could read and write by 3,
and received an associate degree with highest honors from a
two-year junior college by 10, the father said. Adragon spent just
one year at the university.
   Adragon would like to continue his studies at the Santa Cruz
campus, but has not yet heard whether he's been accepted in the
graduate division for the fall.
   ``I want to start learning scientific programming next year,''
he said. ``I want to go into astrophysics or particle physics,
which hopefully will lead to the discovery of the creation of the
universe, which is what I'm interested in.''
   He says he wouldn't mind picking up a Nobel Prize along the way.
   Cowell College Provost John Lynch said he had mixed feelings
about Adragon's rapid progress. ``It's quite an achievement, and he
earned his degree. But I hope he will go on and be educated in life
as broadly as he was in math,'' said Lynch.
   Adragon's father is concerned his son made no friends at Santa
Cruz.
   ``I kept questioning myself: Was this the right way to go? It
gets harder and harder for him,'' said De Mello. ``He isolated
himself. ... His computers were his friends. It was very lonely for
him.''
   Although he's confident about his abilities to grow
intellectually, Adragon himself worries about his social life.
   ``It is strange having everyone so much higher than you,'' he
says. ``And in elementary school they have a recess. I once asked a
student at Santa Cruz where the playground was and he laughed.
   ``I finally found the playground in my computer.''

   It's not that Dikea Edwards
necessarily dislikes nudists. She just doesn't like getting all
those bothersome telephone calls.
   The calls began after Metro Times, a weekly newspaper in the
Detroit area, published a summer activities guide last month that
listed Edwards' number as that of the Detroit Sun Club.
   Since then, she's received about 300 telephone calls asking
about the group.
   ``This has really annoyed me, I'll tell you,'' the 27-year-old
woman said.
   Metro Times Managing Editor Toni Swanger said the number was
correct in last year's guide, but no one checked it out for this
year's edition. The newspaper ran a correction, but that didn't
stop the calls.
   A directory assistance operator said today there is no listing
under the Detroit area code for the Detroit Sun Club.

   Roy Moses had gone by the name John
Jackson since he walked into a pizza parlor six weeks ago and said,
``Help me, I don't know who I am.''
   The amnesia victim, who spent recent weeks in a city mission,
celebrated his 33rd birthday Sunday after two friends identified
his picture in a local paper.
   He had picked the name Jackson because he believed he may have
spent some time in Jacksonville, Fla. It turns out that's where
he's from.
   ``I saw the picture in the paper and said, `That's Mo,''' said
Duffie Swartz of Columbus, Ohio. Swartz was in Huntington with her
sister, Connie Hughes of New York, when they saw the newspaper.
   Moses said he was told, after the women identified him, that
Sunday was his 33rd birthday.
   Moses knew little about himself other than he remembered being
in Jacksonville, that he was a Cleveland Indians fan and traveled
frequently.
   Moses said the women look familiar and that he probably was in
nearby Kenova, where Swartz used to live, on May 3 looking for them
when he lost his memory.
   ``I was going to see my grandmother in Cleveland,'' Moses said.
``And I stopped in Kenova and something must have happened.''
   Moses said he awoke in a field in Kenova without his wallet. He
said he believed he was either robbed or the wallet fell out
somewhere.

   Scientists plan to turn a green cornfield
into a laboratory this month to test a genetically altered
microorganism in hopes of killing a caterpillar that costs American
farmers about $400 million a year.
   Proponents call testing of the microorganism Cxc-Bt a step
toward a new era of chemical-free pest control. Critics worry that
genetically engineered materials will spread uncontrollably once
released into the environment.
   The microorganism will be injected into corn stalks to combat
the European corn borer, one of agriculture's most destructive
pests.
   Although researchers have conducted other experiments of
genetically altered materials in the environment, the tests will be
the first approved for a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,''
said the microbe's creator, Peter Carlson, chief scientist of Crop
Genetics International Inc.
   ``If Crop Genetics is successful, this time or in future tests _
and there are similiar developments going on all over the place _
this will be a significant step forward in the production of
food,'' said Richard D. Godown, a Washington-based lobbyist for the
industry.
   Biotechnology industry officials say Cxc-Bt is just the edge of
a ``gene revolution'' that could dramatically boost crop production
and help feed a world population expected to double in the next 40
years, while cleaning up the environment.
   But the industry's main critic says the field tests, which will
begin June 20, are part of a dangerous trend to unleash hundreds of
similiar products without evolutionary defenses against them.
   And, said Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based
Foundation on Economic Trends, the pesticide doesn't work.
   ``If they develop a niche, you're stuck with them,'' Rifkin
said. ``They mutate, they migrate, they have mobility _ you can't
recall them.''
   Environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society and
the Environmental Defense Fund, did not oppose the limited field
tests approved in May, and officials say if their questions about
spread are answered with more tests, they may support the final
product.
   The crucial question for environmental groups is whether there
will be adequate testing and regulation because Cxc-Bt is just the
beginning of a rush of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of similiar
products, said Maureen Hinkle, the Audubon Society's director of
agricultural policy.
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' she said. ``If it works, it will be a
tremendous boon.''
   Whether Cxc-Bt will work is another question.
   Rifkin said the microbe approved for limited field tests by the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture
doesn't kill corn borers outside the petri dish and is being used
by the biotechnical industry to set precedent.
   Field tests of Cxc without Bt produced yields that were 17
percent below normal, Rifkin said. The Environmental Defense Fund
also said Cxc can lower corn yields. But Carlson said the average
corn yield at 33 test sites was on par with farmers', and only
seven showed reduced yield, including one patch with a 17 percent
drop.
   The organism being tested did not kill the corn borer outright
but sickened it, Carlson said. ``It's easier to get approval for
testing a recombinant microbe if it's not a sledgehammer,'' he said.
   He hopes his product will weaken the caterpillars and then
natural forces, such as disease, that were not present in
greenhouse tests, will kill the moth larvae. Crop Genetics also is
working on an improved form of Cxc-Bt that could kill the corn
borer outright, as well as products to combat cotton, rice and
soybean pests, he said.
   Concerned about insect transmission, the EPA is requiring the
test patches in Queen Anne's County and Beltsville be sprayed
against insects.
   Rebecca Goldburg, an Environmental Defense Fund biologist, said
the New York-based environmental group is not convinced Carlson's
bug will work or is safe enough, but the possibility of an
alternative to chemical pesticides is heartening and worth pursuing.
   ``I believe there is a potential for some genetically engineered
organisms to cause some ecological problems,'' Ms. Goldburg said.
``Lots of genetically engineered organisms won't cause any
problems. What we have to believe is that we have the ability to
say yes to some and no to others.''
   Only one other genetic crop-protector, a microbe altered to
fight frost, has been approved for field testing by the
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA spokesman Albert Heier said.
   A Montana State University researcher injected a genetically
altered bacteria into 14 elm trees in an effort to block Dutch elm
disease, but he cut them down in 1987 after officials learned he
conducted the experiment without federal or university approval.

   Israel today deported Arab-American activist
Mubarak Awad, an expulsion Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said was
necessary to deter violence.
   Awad, wearing a white shirt and carrying a jacket, was
accompanied up the stairway to the TWA aircraft by two police
officers before other passengers boarded. He waved briefly and
appeared to make a V-for-victory sign before entering the jetliner.
   Police barred reporters from the tarmac at Ben Gurion
International Airport and took identification documents from
several journalists who ventured near the plane. Armed border
patrol guards forced news photographers off the roof of the
terminal building.
   TWA flight 885, carrying Awad to New York, took off at 4:15 p.m.
   Also today, Israeli soldiers fatally shot a 43-year-old
Palestinian man in the head while searching a village near the West
Bank city of Ramallah, a hospital official said. The army said it
was checking the report.
   Shamir last month ordered Awad, a 44-year-old advocate of
non-violent resistance to the Israeli occupation, deported despite
U.S. objections. The prime minister told Israel radio today that
Awad's expulsion ``will have a deterrent influence'' on other Arabs.
   Shamir maintained Awad played a leading role in the
six-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied lands. The rebellion
has adopted some of the methods advocated by Awad, including use of
commercial strikes and boycotts of Israeli products.
   Awad was brought to the airport near Tel Aviv more than an hour
before his flight to New York. The convoy that accompanied the van
included dozens of policemen. The van carrying Awad sped behind a
hangar and was parked. Awad could not be seen by reporters.
   About a dozen Israeli supporters held placards at an airport
entrance. One, written in Hebrew and English, read: ``Mubarak: Next
Year in Jerusalem.''
   Awad issued a written statement today in which he urged Israelis
and Arabs to ``learn to take a risk for peace.''
   ``It would be unfair and cowardly on our part to postpone our
conflict for the next generation,'' the statement said.
   Awad, who has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, also vowed to return
to his native Jerusalem.
   Early today, in the West Bank town of Abwein, Israeli troops
shot and killed Dib Mahmoud Hussein after he failed to obey an
order to halt, according to Dr. Yasser Obeid, director of Ramallah
Hospital.
   Hussein's family said he did not stop because he was deaf and
could not hear the order.
   The death brought to 207 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising that began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war. Two Israelis have
also died.
   On Sunday, Israeli officials discussed punishment for
Palestinian arsonists blamed for fires that have destroyed at least
35,000 acres of woodland and farm pastures in the past week,
officials said.
   Shamir told Israel radio as he toured a factory near Tel Aviv
that Israel would respond to an upsurge in Arab attacks ``swiftly
and aggressively.''
   Referring to an unprecedented firebomb attack Sunday at Tel
Aviv's main shopping mall, he said:
   ``This is more proof that they (the Arabs) are not just talking
about the (occupied) territories but that the conflict is one for
our survival. These are blows against our existence.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Industry Minister Ariel
Sharon spoke out about a need to use guns to punish
firebomb-throwers and arsonists who have destroyed Israeli forests
in recent weeks.
   Rabin told the weekly Cabinet session Sunday that he had
authorized Israeli civilians in the occupied territories to shoot
at Arabs holding firebombs, the Jerusalem Post daily reported.
   Sharon, a former defense minister, said on army radio that Arab
firebombers should be shot dead ``not only after they (the
firebombs) are thrown. They must be shot with the intention to kill
to allow normal life for both Arabs and Jews.''
   Israeli police, meanwhile, arrested three 20-year-old
Palestinian men suspected of trying to set fire in a field in a
Jerusalem suburb over the weekend, the radio said.
   Shamir has also said he would introduce legislation to jail
arsonists for up to 15 years.

   The stock market and the franc dropped today after
voters denied Socialist President Francois Mitterrand a legislative
majority and created the prospect of an unstable governing
coalition.
   The Socialists emerged from Sunday's second round of voting with
the biggest bloc of votes, but must now look to the Communists or
the centrists for a coalition partner to form a National Assembly
majority. Just a few weeks ago, the Socialists were widely expected
to gain an absolute majority.
   Also, the extreme-right National Front all but vanished from the
legislature, winning just one seat against 35 two years ago. Among
the casualties was party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.
   Some commentators said the political landscape could remain
unsettled for weeks or even months. Such uncertainty would be
unusual in France, which has known only stable government
majorities since Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic in
1958.
   Share prices declined on the Paris Stock Exchange today in
reaction to the prospect of instability, retreating an average of
more than 2 percent. The franc fell to 3.38 against the Deutsche
mark, compared to 3.39 at Friday's closing. ``The market hates a
vaccum,'' said one trader at the Paris exchange.
   Mitterrand's premier, Michel Rocard, tried to put the best face
on the party's disappointment. ``You have chosen prudently,'' he
told voters Sunday night in a television address. ``It will take
several days to draw the appropriate conclusions of all these
choices.''
   However, others were more pessimistic.
   ``It will be the most subtle and complex situation you could
imagine,'' said political commentator Alain Duhamel.
   The Socialists could put together a majority in the 577-seat
National Assembly either by joining with the Communist Party or by
enticing some centrist members of the conservative coalition to
change sides.
   Neither path looked easy.
   It also was possible that the Socialists would set up a minority
government with Rocard or someone new as premier. They would then
try to win by seeking votes to the left or the right, depending on
the issue.
   The Communists said they would not consider forming a coalition
with the Socialists unless Mitterrand reverses his movement toward
the center and launches radical new economic policies to fight
unemployment and poverty.
   Centrist leaders said they would not abandon their conservative
allies. But they also indicated the time has come for right and
left to find a way to work together.
   Sunday's election filled 575 seats in the National Assembly; the
final two seats will be determined in French Polynesia on June 26.
   It takes 289 votes to form an absolute majority in the assembly.
   The Socialists had 276 seats.
   Just barely behind, the conservative alliance had 271. The
conservative Rally for the Republic won 126, the center-right Union
for French Democracy took 129, and smaller rightist parties
collected a total of 16.
   The Communists had 27.
   The National Front salvaged one seat. Its leaders said it fell
victim to the replacement of a proportional electoral system by a
system of majority vote in two rounds, which favors larger parties.
The first round was June 5.
   Sunday's runoffs were in the 453 districts where no candidate
won a majority the first time, and voter turnout was estimated at
71 percent.
   In 1986, the conservatives won control of the legislature and
Mitterrand was forced into an uncomfortable ``cohabitation'' with
the right.
   But following Mitterrand's solid re-election victory May 8 with
54 percent of the vote over then-Premier Jacques Chirac, it was
widely expected that the Socialists would win a handy absolute
majority in the assembly.
   But the pre-election polls proved wrong.
   Mitterrand met late Sunday night with Rocard but made no
immediate public statement. The new National Assembly is to meet
for the first time June 23.
   After Mitterrand was first elected in May 1981, he called
legislative elections and won a clear majority for his Socialists.
He named four Communists Cabinet ministers, but they later quit
when the government switched to an economic policy of austerity.
   Recently, Mitterrand said the Socialists should pursue an
``opening'' toward the center, although exactly what he means has
been the most-debated question in recent French politics.
   Georges Marchais, head of the Communist Party, said his forces
would vote for any Socialist proposals ``favorable to popular and
national interests,'' but not commit them in advance to backing the
government unless Mitterrand changes course.
   Marchais called for ``a policy of effective struggle against
unemployment, poverty and social inequality, an increase in
purchasing power, salaries, pensions and welfare payments, a policy
of new growth in the economy, a policy of freedom preserving the
rights of wage-earners and the independence of France, a policy of
peace and disarmament.''
   Mitterrand's policies by now may be closer to those of the
centrists. However, the centrists have longstanding ties to their
conservative partners that will not be broken easily.

   Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa says the
group will not stop its effort to rid a section near Times Square
of drug dealers, even though one anti-crime patroller was
critically injured in a confrontation.
   ``We will continue to bang away, inch by inch, apartment
building by apartment building,'' Sliwa said Sunday. ``We will take
back the neighborhood.''
   Six Guardian Angels were injured and four people were arrested
in connection with the incident Saturday night.
   The Guardian Angels, a volunteer group, have been patrolling the
section at the request of restaurant owners in the theater district
who have complained that crack dealers are driving away their
customers.
   ``They're everywhere, like cockroaches,'' Sliwa said of the
dealers.
   Illya Lichtenberg, 16, of Verona, N.J., was in critical
condition today after he was hit in the head with a bottle and
stabbed in the chest during the confrontation between about 15
Guardian Angels and 15 other people on the street, according to
police and hospital spokesmen.

   Authorities using death certificates
and toe tags have identified dozens of decaying bodies found
stacked in a funeral home, some for years, but a coroner said some
of the identities may never be known.
   ``There will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will not
be able to identify them,'' Chief Medical Examiner Peter Lipkovic
said Sunday. ``One doesn't have a head or legs, so even if we had a
dental chart, what could we do?''
   Officials on a routine inspection discovered eight of the bodies
early last week and another 36 were found Friday at Howell Morning
Glory Chapel, which had the city contract for handling the bodies
of indigents.
   Twenty-six boxes containing cremated ashes also were found at
the funeral home. The state Department of Professional Regulation
suspended owner Lewis Howell's license after the initial finds.
   Meantime, the painstaking process of identifying the remains
continues.
   A clerk from the Vital Statistics office at the state Department
of Health and Rehabilitative Services put in overtime this weekend
pulling death certificates for investigators.
   ``We entered names into the computer, playing a matching game,''
Lipkovic said.
   Means of identification also have included hospital bracelets,
Medical Examiner's toe tags and medical appliances such as hip
pins. Labels on cremation boxes were used to identify 26 sets of
remains.
   By Sunday, officials had identified 49 of the 70 remains at the
home. There were leads on identifying many of the remaining bodies,
Lipkovic said.
   The oldest body was identified through a 1978 death certificate,
Lipkovic said.
   Officials have not released the names of those identified and
have not contacted family members.
   Lipkovic said he believes no more bodies will be found, but
officials plan to bring in heavy equipment to dig up the yard
behind the funeral home.
   Three crime scene experts from the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement and two homicide detectives from the Sheriff's Office
are working on the investigation.

   Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski today
opened a two-day meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee
with a plea for national reconciliation and a promise that more
independent groups will be legalized.
   But he appeared to rule out talking to the outlawed Solidarity
trade union, which Polish authorities have maintained accepts money
from the U.S. government.
   ``We can talk to anyone, as long as he is not a client,
especially a paid one, of a foreign court,'' Jaruzelski said.
   The plenum was the first meeting of the 230-member Central
Committee since Poland was shaken by strikes in April and May, and
it was expected to give important signals of the authorities'
future moves to prevent more unrest.
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party,
said upcoming nationwide elections for municipal and provincial
councils offer Poles an opportunity to chose active candidates who
could represent their needs.
   The elections Sunday are structured in a way that assures in
advance that the Communist Party and its allies will dominate the
councils.
   But Jaruzelski said more seats have been set aside for non-party
members. He said those independent people who refused to join the
councils were ``another case of missing the train of history.''
   The party leader, who also is president of the Council of State,
said a government-social commission should be established to
monitor price increases in Poland and said across-the-board price
increases such as were introduced earlier this year should be
avoided in the future.
   Jaruzelski confirmed that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will
visit Poland next month and said the trip will be important for
Poland's future.
   And the Polish leader spoke at length about the disenchantment
of youth with the Communist Party and called for redoubled efforts
to win the allegiance of the younger generation.
   Referring to the strikes between April 25 and May 10, Jaruzelski
said they increased the chance for national understanding because
they showed the majority of Poles displayed ``a front of realism.''
   Strikes took place in five factories, with brief stoppages or
strike threats in 25 others. But the labor unrest did not spread
out of control to factories around Poland as it did in 1980, when
Solidarity was born.
   A new law on associations is awaiting enactment, said
Jaruzelski, but that should not stop new groups from being
legalized in the meantime.
   He mentioned no specifics, but there have been official hints
that at least three independent groups _ a Warsaw-based pro-private
enterprise Economic Society, the dormant Polish chapter of the PEN
writers' club and the Dziekania political discussion club in Warsaw
_ may soon be legally registered.
   Jaruzelski also suggested a ``round table'' meeting of
representatives of existing and proposed associations to discuss
solutions to Poland's problems. He gave no details on who would
convene the meeting, who could be invited or when it might take
place.
   ``National reconciliation and one of the goals of the socialist
renewal,'' Jaruzelski said. ``It is broader today than in past
years.''

<HEAD>Court Will Rule in New York Medicare Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the government may use a 19th Century anti-fraud law to
impose stiff civil fines on top of criminal penalties assessed for
the same offense.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Reagan administration
officials seeking to fine the manager of a New York medical
laboratory $131,170 for defrauding the government of $585 on
Medicare bills.
   The government imposed the penalty against Irwin Halper, who
runs New City Medical Laboratories.
   Halper was convicted criminally of submitting inflated claims
for Medicare reimbursement. He was sentenced to two years in prison
and fined $5,000.
   Government officials then also fined him $131,170 under the
False Claims Act, a civil statute enacted in 1863 to combat fraud
against the Union army by Civil War defense contractors.
   The civil fine was based on $2,000 for each of 65 separate
charges of overbilling plus $1,170 for double the actual loss
suffered by the government.
   The government said Halper billed Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Greater New York at $12 per patient for a service that Medicare
reimburses at $3.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet in New York City originally
reduced the civil fine to $17,170 and subsequently cut it to $1,170
when the government protested the first reduction.
   Sweet said the stiff fine the government wants ``amounts to a
criminal penalty for violations for which Halper has already been
punished.'' He said the original fine ``bears no rational relation
to the government's loss.''
   The judge said the civil fine violated Halper's double jeopardy
protection against being punished twice for the same offense.
   In the appeal filed today, government lawyers pointed out that
Congress in 1986 increased the fines so that offenders now may be
penalized from $5,000 to $10,000 per offense, plus triple the
actual government loss.
   ``Congress strengthened the government's civil remedies because
it determined that more severe sanctions were needed in order to
stem the tide of rampant fraud inflicted on the government,''
Justice Department lawyers said.
   Such a stiff penalty ``is reasonable and well within Congress's
legislative power,'' they said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Halper, 87-1383.

<HEAD>No. 2 Leader Of Shining Path Guerrillas Captured In Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have captured the No. 2 leader of the
Shining Path, a fanatical Maoist group that has waged a guerrilla
war against the government for eight years, a government minister
said today.
   Osman Morote, 42, was arrested by counterinsurgency police
Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along with two women, Deputy
Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said. He declined to name the
women.
   Morote had fake identification papers but was identified by his
fingerprints, Mantilla said.
   The capture is considered the most important since the Shining
Path launched its guerrilla war in May 1980. Since then the
violence has claimed more than 10,000 lives and cost this
impoverished nation $5 billion in damage to its economy, according
to government figures.
   Morote, known within the rebel band as ``Comrade Remigio,'' is
second in importance only to Abimael Guzman, a former professor of
philosophy who founded the Shining Path in 1970 as a splinter group
of the Communist Party.
   The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected
government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after
the ideas of China's Mao Tse-tung.
   Guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but Morote is
considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the
advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands
that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military.
   Intelligence sources said the capture is the most important
achievement so far in the government's efforts to halt the advance
of the rebel movement, which has spread from its base in the
highland state of Ayacucho through much of the country.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Morote's
capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of
the Shining Path and cause tension until a replacement is decided
upon.
   There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry
between Morote and Guzman, 53, and Mantilla said he did not
discount the possibility that Guzman had betrayed Morote to get him
out of the way.

<HEAD>Court Declines to Study Racial-Desegregation Case from New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, declining to study an
unprecedented racial-desegregation case, today refused to free
Yonkers, N.Y., officials from having to integrate city schools and
build subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that Yonkers
must build subsidized housing in predomimantly white sections of
the city and create ``magnet'' schools to reduce segregation.
   The case, stemming from a Justice Department lawsuit begun by
the Carter administration eight years ago, marked the first time
the government linked discrimination in education and housing.
   Yonkers, with some 200,000 residents, is located just north of
New York City.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand, in a 600-page decision in
1985, ruled that Yonkers officials intentionally and unlawfully
promoted racial segregation through their housing and school
policies.
   He said the city had confined subsidized housing to
predominantly black and Hispanic southwest Yonkers, and that
officials had bowed to the racial bias of some whites in resisting
school integration.
   The judge then ordered the city to pay the multi-million-dollar
bill for desegregating the school system and building 200 units of
subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city.
   City officials agreed last January to build the 200 units but
then sought to cancel the court-approved agreement. Sand refused on
June 8 to cancel the agreement.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Sand's 1985 ruling
in a 163-page decision last December.
   The appeals court rejected arguments by school board and city
officials that discrimination in schools and housing should not be
linked.
   ``When two actors have cooperated in a given venture, each
contributing to the outcome that each desires, it requires no
stretch of legal doctrine to conclude that each actor is liable if
the result deliberately attained is unlawful,'' the appeals court
said.
   The Reagan administration supported the appeals court ruling,
urging the Supreme Court to reject the appeals acted on today.
   ``As they have throughout this litigation, the (school) board
and the city blame each other for the segregated Yonkers public
school system,'' Justice Department lawyers said. ``This
fingerpointing, however, should not divert this court's attention
from the ... substantial evidence of cooperative, intentionally
segregative actions by both the board and the city.''
   The cases are Yonkers Board of Education vs. U.S., 87-1632, and
Yonkers vs. U.S., 87-1686.

<HEAD>Israeli and Palestinian Artists Sign Peace Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli and Palestinian intellectuals did today
what their political leaders have been unable to do for 40 years _
they signed a peace accord.
   The ``treaty,'' written in Hebrew, Arabic and English on
parchment-like paper, was signed by about 25 Israeli and
Palestinian writers and painters during a news conference at which
foreign reporters far outnumbered local journalists.
   The document calls for the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state _ called ``Falastin'' _ in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured during the 1967 Mideast war.
   The treaty recognizes the right of Israel and Falastin to live
in peace and security within their own borders. It designates
Jerusalem a demilitarized city with open borders, which would serve
as the capital of both states.
   Israeli author Yoram Kaniuk described the signing as an
``historic moment.''
   ``We hope this will have some kind of influence (on politicians)
who say there is no one to talk to and nothing to talk about,'' he
said, claiming the document represented the first treaty ever
successfully negotiated by Israelis and Palestinians.
   Kaniuk is one of the leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian
Writers, Artists and Academics Committee Against Occupation, the
only professional group that represents both Israelis and
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The group includes left-wing Israeli artists, among them poet
Nathan Zach.
   He recently canceled an international poetry festival to protest
allegedly harsh measures by the army to quell the 6-month-old
Palestinian uprising in which 207 Palestinians have been killed and
about 5,000 injured. Two Israelis also have been killed.
   Asad El Asad, head of the Palestinian Writers' Association in
the occupied territories, said the Palestine Liberation
Organization favors the terms of the artists' treaty.
   ``We feel we are transmitting clearly and honestly the message
of our represenatives, the PLO,'' said El Asad.
   Israel, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary, refuses to
recognize the PLO, saying it is a terrorist organization. The PLO,
which has called for the destruction of Israel, has also refused to
accept U.N. resolutions recognizing Israel's right to secure its
borders.
   Kaniuk said that Israeli and Palestinian ``negotiators'' often
disagreed about the terms of the treaty and each side eventually
had to ``give up dreams and accept reality.''
   Zach said he would now extend his appeal beyond the circle of
the committee and ask all like-minded artists, writers and
academics in Israel and the occupied territories to sign the treaty.
   ``If clods like us, who are not always very good at taking
action, can do it, so can politicians,'' said Zach. ``If they
don't, it's because they don't want to or are afraid to.''

<HEAD>Incompetancy Ruling Left Intact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a DuPont family fortune heir declared mentally incompetent after he
lent $212,000 to a group linked to political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that control of
Lewis duPont Smith's $8 million estate properly was taken from him
in 1985 under Pennsylvania's guardianship law.
   Smith's appeal contended that his freedom of political
expression and association had been violated.
   Smith, 31, lives in Chester County, Pa. He is the son of E.
Newbold and Margaret duPont Smith, and is heir to a significant
portion of the family fortune.
   In 1985, Smith had access to about $1.5 million in assets and
marketable securities. He also received substantial income from
trusts.
   Smith lent $212,000 in early 1985 to Caucus Distributions Inc.,
an affiliate of LaRouche's organization.
   Learning of his intention to lend an additional $75,000 to
Caucus Distributions, Smith's family on April 11, 1985, asked a
judge to appoint a financial guardian for him.
   After several hearings, the judge ruled that Lewis was
incompetent within the meaning of Pennsylvania's guardianship law
because he was ``liable to dissipate his assets and become the
victim of designing persons.''
   The judge appointed the Wilmington Trust Co., a financial
institution, as guardian of Smith's estate.
   Smith's free-speech challenge to finding him incompetent because
he contributed to LaRouche's political efforts was rejected by the
judge. ``It is not that kind of case ... Lewis' First Amendment
freedoms remain intact, and he may exercise them as foolishly as he
wishes,'' the judge said.
   His ruling was upheld by a state appeals court. ``We agree ...
that (Smith's) mental illness has resulted in producing a condition
that has made him a victim of the LaRouche organization,'' the
appeals court said.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear Smith's appeal
last Jan. 21.
   The case is Smith vs. Smith, 87-1753.

who was shot and rumors of Armenian deaths. Pickup 3rd graf pvs,
``The policeman...''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said today a
policeman in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku was killed by a
shotgun blast fired by an Armenian during an ethnic protest.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, also told
a news briefing that rumors saying two Armenians had been killed in
Baku led to a protest march in Moscow on Sunday. He said a general
strike had been called in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to demand
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region be turned over to Armenia.
   ``We have received the information from Baku that the
information about the murder of two Armenians is false,'' Gerasimov
said. ``In fact, there was a shooting in Baku from a shotgun ...
and the bullet killed a militia sergeant.''
   The policeman, identified as a Sgt. Izmailov, was killed by a
shot fired by an Armenian with the last name of Aganbegyan,
Gerasimov said. Izmailov was born in 1951 and Aganbegyan in 1932,
the spokesman said. He provided no other information about the men.
   ``The bullet was deflected from some kind of surface,''
Gerasimov said. Police had not yet determined whether the killing
was premediated, he said.
   The shooting occurred ``during a demonstration for retaining the
Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan,'' he said. He did not say
when the policeman was killed.
   Armenians gathered in a Moscow cemetery on Sunday and marched to
the offices of the official Tass news agency because of rumors that
two Armenians had been killed in Azerbaijan. He said the rumor was
false.
   Gerasimov also said that Armenians gathered in the central
square of Yerevan on Sunday and called a general strike until
Wednesday, when the Presidium of the Armenian Supreme Soviet is to
meet. Armenians are demanding that the republic's nominal
legislature go on record in support of annexing the
Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   He said a sit-in, meetings and demonstrations were continuing in
Yerevan.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, a Soviet republic
located south of the Caucasus Mountains and next to the Caspian
Sea, that is dominated by ethnic Armenians.
   They began demonstrating in mid-February to press their demand
to be annexed to neighboring Armenia.
   In February, violence erupted in Sumgait, a city in Azerbaijan.
The government says 32 people, 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis,
were killed.
   The government several weeks later turned down the demand to
allow Armenia to annex Nagorno-Karabakh and ethnic unrest has
continued since then.
   In May the Communist Party leaders of both Armenia and
Azerbaijan were replaced on the same day, an indication of Moscow's
displeasure with their inability to cope with the unrest.

<HEAD>Court Kills Suit By Paul Newman Against Universal Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal antitrust lawsuit by actor Paul
Newman and director George Roy Hill over profits from video
cassette sales and rentals was killed by the Supreme Court today.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out the
1985 suit against Universal Pictures and its parent MCA Inc.
   Newman and Hill contended that Universal and other major movie
studios illegally conspired in the early 1980s to hold down
artificially the profits paid to actors and directors from video
sales and rentals.
   The lawsuit said that as a result Newman and Hill did not
receive their fair share of the profits from two movies made years
earlier, ``The Sting'' and ``Slapshot.''
   Both men had signed ``profit participation agreements'' giving
them a percentage of all income received for showing the movies.
   U.S. District Judge James Ideman dismissed the suit, ruling that
Newman and Hill had suffered no antitrust injury.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last
year.
   ``The fundamental problem is that Newman and Hill entered into
contracts ... between 1972 and 1976, before the alleged conspiracy
arose,'' the appeals court said. ``The subsequent conspiracy could
not have affected the competition for Newman and Hill's services at
the time the contracts were made.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Newman and Hill called
the appeals court ruling ``bizarre.''
   ``How is it possible that a direct victim of a horizontal
price-fixing conspiracy does not suffer antitrust injury?'' the
appeal asked.
   The case is Newman vs. Universal Pictures, 87-1617.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper's thwarted attempt to obtain the
names and addresses of jurors who served in a much-publicized New
York murder trial failed to win Supreme Court review today.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments by Newsday
that the public has a constitutional right of access to such
information unless there exist specific reasons justifying secrecy.
   The controversy stems from the 1984 trial in Suffolk County,
N.Y., of William Patterson on charges of murdering his estranged
wife, Frances.
   Mrs. Patterson was shot through a window of her home while
watching television with her two children on June 29, 1982.
   During jury deliberations in Patterson's trial, a reporter for
the Long Island-based newspaper asked court officials for the
jurors' names and addresses. The request was denied.
   After Patterson's trial ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked
jury, Newsday continued to seek the juror information.
   The Suffolk County Commissioner of Jurors refused to give the
newspaper the information it sought. He said the jurors' names and
addresses fell within the confidentiality exemptions of a state law
aimed at curtailing secrecy within the state court system.
   Newsday sued over the blocked access, claiming a constitutional
right to criminal trial records.
   Three state courts rejected Newsday's appeal.
   The New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
last Dec. 23 that the names and addresses of jurors who serve in
criminal trials may be kept confidential.
   ``Inasmuch as (Newsday) has not contended that it has been
denied access to any judicial proceedings, or to any transcripts of
any proceedings, (Newsday's) constitutional right of access has not
been violated,'' the state court ruled.
   In the appeal acted on today, Newsday relied on past Supreme
Court decisions upholding the public's right to attend criminal
trials, including jury selection and pretrial hearings.
   The appeal said ``the interest which led this court to
recognize'' such rights ``are also promoted by access to the names
and addresses of jurors.''
   The newspaper urged the court to recognize ``a First Amendment
right of access to jurors' names and addresses which must be
properly considered before such access may be denied.''
   The case is Newsday vs. Sise, 87-1748.

   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
rock star David Crosby's cocaine conviction and five-year prison
sentence, overturned by a Texas court only after Crosby spent five
months in prison.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Dallas
police unlawfully searched Crosby's nightclub dressing room.
   A state appeals court ruled that evidence gathered by police in
the unlawful 1982 search _ including cocaine and a pistol
confiscated from Crosby _ should not have been used as evidence at
Crosby's trial.
   Crosby, who gained fame as part of the group called Crosby,
Stills and Nash, was convicted of unlawfully possessing cocaine and
carrying a handgun in a tavern.
   A state appeals court overturned the conviction and prison
sentence last Nov. 12. Crosby was freed after having served five
months of the sentence.
   In the appeal acted on today, Dallas County prosecutors argued
that the state court wrongly found that Crosby enjoyed a
``reasonable expectation of privacy'' in the dressing room of a
``closely regulated, state-licensed, liquor-selling establishment.''
   The case is Texas vs. Crosby, 87-1640.

<TEXT>
   The world's most powerful atom smasher is
set to start exploring some of nature's deepest mysteries this week
and physicists are thrilled at the prospects for scientific
breakthroughs.
   After nearly 10 years of construction and fine-tuning, the giant
collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in suburban
Batavia, west of Chicago, is ready to come on line to smash protons
and antiprotons together.
   ``We have the potential for making more discoveries in
high-energy physics than at any other time in history,'' says Fermi
Director Leon Lederman.
   Fermilab spokesman Richard Dease said today that the start-up
date is not certain but it is expected to be this week.
   More than 200 physicists from around the world will be
participating in the search for tiny subatomic particles that have
so far eluded scientists trying to unravel the basic details of how
the universe works.
   Fermilab's collider has three times the power of its closest
competitor, the CERN collider in Geneva, Switzerland, and could
open the door to new, unexpected scientific discoveries, officials
say.
   ``Now we really get to go into the unknown,'' says Harvard
physicist Roy Schwitters. ``That's why we're in the business.''
   Schwitters, co-director of the $40 million Collider Detector
Facility, compared the collider to using ``wrecking bars and
sledgehammers to try to find the treasure.''
   The Fermilab collider whirls protons and antiprotons around in
opposite directions on a 4-mile circular track called the Tevatron.
The protons and antiprotons travel at a speed close to that of
light _ 186,000 miles a second.
   When they collide, they annihilate in a burst of energy reaching
2 trillion electron volts, equivalent to a temperature of 10,000
trillion degrees.
   The detector facility traps the traces of particles produced by
the collisions.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury began a fifth day of
deliberations today in a cigarette liability lawsuit brought by the
widower of a lung-cancer victim who smoked for 40 years.
   The six-person panel is considering whether to award damages to
Antonio Cipollone for the 1984 death of his wife, Rose, at 58.
   During the four-month trial, he charged that Lorillard Inc.,
Liggett Group Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. misled the public about
the dangers of cigarette smoking and contributed to Mrs.
Cipollone's death.
   The cigarette manufacturers contended that she made an
intelligent, strong-willed choice to smoke knowing the risks. They
argued that smoking is not a proven cause of cancer, and that her
type of cancer isn't linked to cigarettes anyway.

<HEAD>Court Rejects New York Professor's Bid to Address Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned down the appeal
of a philosophy professor denied an opportunity to address Congress
about secular humanism during the lawmakers' daily moments of
opening prayer.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to hear arguments
that the professor's rights were violated.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to review the case more fully.
   Paul Kurtz, who teaches philosophy at the State University of
New York in Buffalo, said he unlawfully was denied an invitation to
make remarks to Congress about his humanist beliefs. He had asked
the chaplains of the Senate and House to let him speak during the
time designated for opening prayers.
   Kurtz said he was barred from speaking because he told the
chaplains he would not lead the lawmakers in prayer.
   ``The opening ceremonies of our nation's legislature, if they
claim to represent anybody, must represent everybody, the religious
and non-religious alike,'' Kurtz's lawyer argued.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here threw out Kurtz's suit
last September.
   The chaplains of the House and Senate occasionally invite guests
to deliver the opening prayers. Kurtz wrote to the chaplains in
1984, seeking to address either or both houses.
   He said, ``As a secular humanist, I would not, of course, invoke
any deity during my remarks. I do believe that it is important,
however, (for members of Congress) occasionally to have the
opportunity to hear non-theists speak of moral responsibilities.''
   Both chaplains declined to invite him. The Senate chaplain said
Kurtz must have a senator sponsor him to receive an invitation. The
House chaplain told him that each House session must begin with a
prayer.
   Kurtz then sued the chaplains and Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker. His suit named Baker on grounds that the treasury provided
taxpayer money to fund the chaplain programs in Congress.
   The appeals court threw out his suit on grounds that the
chaplains lacked the authority to permit Kurtz to speak. That
deprives Kurtz of legal standing to sue, the appeals court said.
   The rare privilege for outsiders of addressing either house
requires approvals of the members of each house, the appeals court
said.
   ``Even if the chaplains had agreed to invite Kurtz, it would be
unreasonable to imagine that they could have provided him with the
actual opportunity to deliver non-religious remarks to either house
of Congress during the time expressly set aside for prayer,'' the
appeals court said.
   The Reagan administration urged the justices to reject Kurtz's
appeal, but on different grounds.
   Justice Department lawyers said Kurtz must lose his case because
a 1983 Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of prayers that
open each day of the Nebraska Legislature. The court said such
prayers do not violate Constitution's establishment clause
requiring separation of church and state.
   ``So too is it untenable to contend, as (Kurtz) does, that the
framers (of the Constitution) intended the establishment or
free-speech component of the First Amendment as equal-time
provisions, mandating non-theistic speech-making whenever Congress
permits religious invocations,'' the government lawyers said.
   The case is Kurtz vs. Baker, 87-1581.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Michigan Police-Rights Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that police
officers sometimes may chase a person who starts running at the
sight of them even though they have no reason to suspect criminal
conduct.
   The court unanimously ruled that Michigan prosecutors may use as
evidence the drugs dropped by a man who began running when he
spotted a police cruiser on a Detroit street.
   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the
Detroit officers' pursuit of Michael Mose Chesternut did not amount
to a ``seizure'' under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
   The amendment generally requires police to have a warrant or
``probable cause'' to suspect a crime before conducting any search
or seizure.
   The court held in 1980 that a person is seized _ as opposed to
arrested _ when, ``in view of all of the circumstances surrounding
the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was
not free to leave.''
   Adhering to that principle, Blackmun said Chesternut ``was not
unlawfully seized during the initial police pursuit.''
   Blackmun noted that the police did not sound their cruiser's
siren or order Chesternut to halt. They merely pursued him as he
ran, Blackmun said.
   ``While the very presence of a police car driving parallel to a
running pedestrian could be somewhat intimidating, this kind of
police presence does not, standing alone, constitute a seizure,''
he said.
   According to court records, Chesternut was standing on a Detroit
street corner talking to another man a little after midnight on
Dec. 19, 1984 when he saw a police cruiser.
   Police said Chesternut immediately started running away, and was
followed by the officers. After turning a corner, and as the
cruiser drew alongside of him, Chesternut threw a number of packets
to the ground and then stopped.
   The officers said they picked up the packets, which appeared to
contain narcotics, and then arrested Chesternut. He was charged
with possessing heroin, codeine and diazapan.
   A state judge threw out the case, ruling that police lacked a
reasonable suspicion to pursue Chesternut and therefore had seized
the evidence unlawfully. A state appeals court upheld the dismissal.
   But today's ruling reinstated the charges against Chesternut.
   The case is Michigan vs. Chesternut, 86-1824.

<TEXT>
   Six detainees, including an ex-soldier
facing a possible death sentence for killing two people while he
dressed as a ``Ninja'' warrior, escaped from jail, and five
remained at large today, authorities said.
   Two of the escapees faced first-degree murder charges, but one
of the two was quickly recaptured, authorities said.
   The detainees used a hacksaw blade late Sunday to cut through
cell bars, knocked out a fourth-floor window at the Cumberland
County Jail and lowered themselves on a rope made of bedsheets,
authorities said.
   The breakout occurred minutes before the 11 p.m. lockdown, when
the inmates are returned to their cells and locked in for the
night, officials said.
   The escape apparently was spotted by a Fayetteville police
officer, who noticed someone drop from the center, Sheriff's
Department spokesman Harold Little said.
   Frederick Glenn Evans, 20, who was being held on charges of
killing a woman, injured himself while falling from the fourth
floor and was recaptured and taken to Cape Fear Valley Medical
Center, authorities said.
   The five others included Jeffrey Karl Meyer, who confessed to
the stabbing deaths of Paul Kutz Sr., 68, and his wife, Janie Kutz,
62.
   Meyer, a 21-year-old former soldier at Fort Bragg, pleaded
guilty to the December 1986 murders, and was to appear in Superior
Court today for a continuation of the sentencing phase of his
trial. He faces the death penalty or life in prison.
   The slayings came to be known as the ``Ninja'' murders because
Meyer and accused accomplice Mark E. Thompson, another former
soldier at Fort Bragg, allegedly were dressed in black clothes
resembling outfits worn by Japanese Ninja warriors.
   The other escapees were: Jerry Ronald Pond Jr., 24, of
Fayetteville, held in the Jan. 21 slaying of a pawn shop employee;
Gregory Morris Lee, 30, of Fayetteville, held on a charge of
first-degree burglary; Jeffrey Charles Minnick, 22, of Hope Mills,
held on charges of second-degree burglary, first-degree sex offense
and common law robbery; and Rick A. Wilson, 30, of Hope Mills, held
on charges of felony breaking and entering.
   Little said he had no information on why Wilson was held, and
did not have complete descriptions on the other escapees.
   Little said escape by sawing through the bars is supposed to be
impossible because the cells are designed with a bar within a bar.
When someone trying to saw through the outer bar reaches the inner
bar, it just spins, said Little. He later said that type of
construction was not used in the bar the inmates cut.
   He said the six were assigned to Cell Block F in the jail's top
floor, where they are allowed into a common area during the day,
but are locked in individual cells at night.

<TEXT>
   A Harris poll released today indicated a closer
presidential race than public opinion surveys last month, with
Democrat Michael Dukakis holding a slim five-point lead over
Republican George Bush.
   Dukakis' lead was within the poll's margin of sampling error and
was slightly down from his seven-point advantage in a Harris poll
released last month. Dukakis had a double-digit lead in some other
surveys in May.
   The new Harris poll, conducted by telephone June 1-6, found 49
percent support for Dukakis, who has clinched the Democratic
nomination, and 44 percent for Bush, the Republican nomination
campaign winner. Seven percent were unsure.
   Lou Harris & Associates contacted 1,258 likely voters, and the
margin of sampling error in its survey was plus or minus three
percentage points.
   A USA Today-CNN poll conducted June 7-9 and released last week
also showed a single-digit lead for Dukakis, 6 points.
   Pollsters have said that Dukakis' recent strength in the polls
was based in part on positive publicity from his string of
Democratic primary victories that continued for months after the
Republican race was settled.

<HEAD>Soviets Claim Property In Jerusalem, Expected To Demand Rent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union claims it owns a government
building and a downtown parking lot in Jerusalem and is expected to
demand several million dollars in back rent, Israeli officials and
media said today.
   The Soviets also are expected to claim other property in
Jerusalem, most of it believed acquired decades ago through the
Russian Orthodox Church.
   Israeli government officials declined to comment on specific
Soviet claims, but Jerusalem city spokeswoman Sivana Meryn said the
city acknowledged a paved parking lot on King George Street in
downtown Jerusalem was built on Soviet property. She said Israel
would be willing to negotiate rental payments.
   The Soviet Union says the building which currently houses the
Agriculture Ministry also belongs to the Soviets.
   Israeli officials said they were ready to discuss the claims but
hoped the talks would be friendly and would not disrupt a movement
toward improved ties between the Soviet Union and Israel.
   The Soviet Union severed ties with Israel to protest the Israeli
capture of lands from Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the 1967 war.
   Last July, for the first time since then, Moscow sent a consular
delegation to Israel to examine property holdings and speak to the
estimated 2,500 Soviet passport holders in Israel.
   Israel in return has asked that it be allowed to send a
delegation to Moscow, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said last
week that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told him
the Israeli delegation would receive Soviet visas next month.
   On Sunday, the head of the Soviet delegation, Georgi Martirosow,
informed the Israeli Foreign Ministry that the delegates had
completed a survey of property owned by the Soviet Union and
currently being used by Israel.
   Martirosow recently returned from Moscow where he spent several
weeks combing Soviet archives for deeds and other documents showing
Soviet property holdings in Israel, a Foreign Ministry official
said.
   The Soviet delegates are expected to present a detailed list of
their holdings along with demands for rental payments in the next
several weeks, the official said, requesting anonymity.
   A spokesman who answered the telephone at the Soviet
delegation's office declined comment.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said two weeks ago that the
Soviet Union would be willing to renew ties with Israel once all
parties in the Middle East conflict agreed to participate in an
international peace conference.
   Shamir, however, has rejected Israeli participation in such a
conference.

<HEAD>Court Tells Wisconsin Court to Restudy Child Support Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today told Wisconsin's
highest court to restudy the case of a teen-ager born out of
wedlock who says she should be allowed to seek support payments
from her father's estate.
   The justices said the Wisconsin Supreme Court should review its
ruling that a $4,600 settlement between Heather Jo Krueger's
parents after she was born bars her from seeking any additional
money.
   Today's order sending the case back to Wisconsin said the state
court should consider it in light of the justices' decision last
week striking down as unconstitutional a six-year deadline
Pennsylvania imposed for filing paternity lawsuits.
   Miss Krueger, 18, of Baraboo, Wis., was born Sept. 7, 1969.
   Her mother, Betty Lou Krueger, reached an agreement in 1970 with
Arlen Lee Moore, who admitted he was Heather's father and agreed to
pay $3,600 in child support over the next four years plus $1,000 in
hospital costs.
   A lawsuit was filed in behalf of the child in 1984 seeking
additional support payments from Moore, who died in 1986 when the
private plane he was piloting crashed.
   Moore owned his own biochemical research business. His widow,
who lives in Sun Prairie, Wis., is the heir to his estate.
   The suit in behalf of Heather Jo sought 17 percent of Moore's
gross income since 1974, plus additional money for his daughter's
medical bills and medical insurance. The suit also sought to have
her named his primary beneficiary in a life insurance policy.
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court last June threw out the suit. The
appeals court said the lump sum settlement between Heather Jo's
parents in 1970 bars any further lawsuit based on long-standing
doctrine.
   The state court said the doctrine is based on the principle that
``fairness to the defendant requires that at some point litigation
over the particular controversy must come to an end.''
   The state court said the interests of Heather Jo were
``virtually represented by her mother'' when the agreement with
Moore was reached. ``Although the settlement agreement ... appears,
in hindsight, to be low, we are satisfied that it is not
unconscionable.''
   The appeals court also rejected arguments that Heather Jo's
rights were violated because such lump-sum settlements were only
permitted for illegitimate children.
   Wisconsin law was amended in 1981 to ban such settlements for
children born out of wedlock and to require continuing support for
them.
   Miss Krueger is attending college at the University of
Wisconsin-Baraboo Center and is living with her mother, who does
part-time work as a cleaning lady and clerk.
   Wisconsin state officials urged the high court to hear the case
and rule in favor of Miss Krueger.
   Attorney General Donald J. Hanaway said permitting the lump-sum
payments for those born out of wedlock creates a class of children
``totally deprived of an ability to receive child support from
fathers who have the ability to pay.''
   The case is Gerhardt vs. Moore, 87-1103.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet forces reportedly have
returned to some cities in eastern Afghanistan to fight Moslem
guerrillas who have raided posts defended by Afghan troops, sources
said today.
   Dr. Ijaz Gilani, an analyst at the Pakistani-based Institute of
Strategic Studies, said he has received reports that the Soviet
forces are back at the garrison of Jalalabad and Khost, near the
Pakistani border.
   There was no independent confirmation of Gilani's report.
   Gilani said Afghan forces have remained on the defensive since
the Soviets began withdrawing their troops on May 15.
   ``The low morale of the Kabul regime soldiers touched a new low
with the withdrawal of Russian troops from certain garrison towns
and strong points,'' Gilani said.
   Soviet troops first entered Afghanistan in 1979 to support its
Marxist government.
   Jalalabad, on the main road from Peshawar, Pakistan, to the
capital of Kabul, was the first Soviet garrison vacated. Although
Soviet officials claimed the garrison was left completely to the
Afghan troops, guerrillas say they have spotted Soviet soldiers
there long after the reported pullout.
   Khost, scene of a major battle early this year after it was
seized by guerrillas, was recently reported again on the verge of
collapse as rebels poured in from the Pakistan border, just 15
miles away.
   Gilani said he had no precise figures on the Soviet
redeployment, but officials in Moscow and Kabul have warned they
might revise their nine-month withdrawal time frame if Pakistan and
the United States continue to arm the Moslem guerrillas.
   ``The war is still continuing at a medium pace, with more
initiative in the hands of the (guerrillas),'' Gilani said.
   Statistics compiled by Gilani and his analysts indicated there
were 266 battles in Afghanistan in May, down from 431 in the
corresponding month in 1987. He said 231 of the attacks last month
were launched by guerrillas and 35 by Soviet-Kabul forces.
   According to estimates by the Institute of Strategic Studies,
some 2,450 Afghan troops defected to the guerrillas last month.
However, Gilani said it was difficult to determine the difference
between outright defections and cases in which Afghan troops have
surrendered to the insurgents.
   The report also said 868 soldiers were killed in May, including
54 Soviets, 192 guerrillas, 542 Afghan troops and 80 unidentified
people.
   In April, a total of 1,149 soldiers died, compared to a
September 1987 high of 2,351, according to the report.

<HEAD>Court Turns Aside German Woman's Effort To Recover Stolen Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German woman's effort to recover the
Claude Monet painting stolen from her sister's home during World
War II ended unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Gerda
Deweerth waited too long before trying to recover the painting from
Edith Marks Baldinger, who bought it in New York City in 1957.
   The painting, Monet's ``Champs de Ble a Vetheuil,'' is one of a
series of impressionist landscapes painted near the town of
Vetheuil in Northern France.
   The oil painting shows a wheat field, a village and trees. It is
signed and dated ``Claude Monet '79.''
   Monet is one of the best known members of the school of
impressionistic artists active in France in the late 19th and early
20th centuries. It was from his early work, ``Impression: Sunrise,
La Havre,'' that the term impressionism was coined.
   The painting at issue is valued at more than $500,000, according
to the appeals court that ruled against Ms. Deweerth.
   She inherited the painting in 1922, and kept it in her home at
Wuppertal-Elberfeld, West Germany. In 1943, Ms. DeWeerth sent the
painting to her sister's home in southern Germany for safekeeping
during the war.
   When American troops quartered in the house departed in 1945,
the painting disappeared. Lower courts assumed it was stolen.
   Ms. Baldinger was a good-faith purchaser of the Monet 12 years
later.
   U.S. District Judge Vincent Broderick in New York ruled that the
painting must be returned to Ms. DeWeerth, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reversed his ruling.
   The appeals court said Ms. DeWeerth ``failed to exercise
reasonable diligence in locating the painting after its
disappearance'' and therefore had waited too long, under New York
law, before suing its current owner.
   The case is DeWeerth vs. Baldinger, 87-1752.

<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old student who praised Mikhail
Gorbachev's reform movement won Moscow's first beauty pageant and
walked away with a wealth of prizes that drew a gasp of amazement
from the audience.
   ``I felt exactly like Alice in Wonderland,'' Maria Kalinina said
Sunday after her warm smile and svelte figure won over the 12
judges, who chose her from six finalists in a contest that
emphasized bathing suit competition.
   Photographers were waiting for her as she arrived at school
today and hurried to a second-floor classroom to take the
equivalent of her high school final examinations.
   Izvestia, an afternoon paper, reported with almost unbelieveable
speed for the normally slow Soviet press that Ms. Kalinina received
the highest mark in her Spanish test and top grades in literature
and math exams as well.
   Like the other finalists, Ms. Kalinina is very thin, in contrast
to the common perception in the West that Soviet women are stout.
   The ``Moscow Beauty '88'' contest, made possible by Gorbachev's
more tolerant policies, was the first of its kind in the Soviet
capital. Millions of Soviets watched a live television broadcast of
the pageant.
   Although similar pageants have been staged in several other
Soviet cities, such contests are still a new phenomenon in a
socialist society which long disdained them as bourgeois. It was
not clear yet whether the new beauty queen would compete in
nationwide or international pageants.
   Ms. Kalinina was the youngest contestant in a field of 36 that
included an accountant, two librarians and two actresses. The
oldest was Yelena Baranova, 26, a doctor who did not reach the
final round Sunday night.
   During the question-and-answer competition, practically the only
event in which the finalists wore more than a tiny scrap of
clothing, Ms. Kalinina was asked what made the Moscow contest
different from beauty pageants in the West.
   ``Ours is different because we have `perestroika,''' she
replied, using the Russian word for Gorbachev's policy of economic
and social reforms.
   The third and final night of what was gala event by normally
austere Soviet went smoothly until the glittering crown was placed
on Ms. Kalinina's head.
   At that moment, long-stemmed red roses began to rain from the
ceiling, knocking off the crown and causing the beauty queen to
duck and dodge, although she never lost her smile. The next shower
of roses was aimed a little in front of the beauty queen, and did
not disrupt the ceremonies.
   As the master of ceremonies read out the list of prizes for Ms.
Kalinina, the crowd of 11,000 in the Palace of Sport sighed in
amazement. The prizes included: a cruise on the Adriatic Sea, a
trip to Austria, a television and mounds of cosmetics from the
Western and Soviet sponsors of the event.
   The other finalists, and some of the other contestants, received
cosmetics and trips inside the Soviet Union for categories such as
the ``most photogenic'' and ``most athletic.''
   Trips abroad are rare for Soviet citizens, and Western cosmetics
of the types distributed to the finalists are highly prized in this
country.
   Some of the loudest applause of the evening went to writer
Mikhail Zadurnov, who performed comedy routines satirizing consumer
shortages and the bureaucrats that are blocking Soviet reforms.
   At the end of an evening dominated by rock music by Soviet
bands, Zadurnov said: ``And we Muscovites would like to thank
Ronald Reagan,'' alluding to the facelift Moscow received for the
recent superpower summit.
   The parting line brought gasps of surprise from the crowd, then
thunderous laughter and applause.

   George Bush said today he has ``no long list,
no short list'' for the vice presidential spot on the Republican
ticket, adding that he has only now started to consider a process
to choose a running mate.
   Bush, who clinched the presidential nomination two months ago,
told reporters that he and his aides are ``getting a little
procedure worked out'' for winnowing the field of prospects for the
No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   ``I've enjoyed all the fabulous speculation,'' about whom he
might select, the vice president told reporters called to his
office in the Old Executive Office Building.
   Bush announced the hiring of two new top-level campaign aides to
deal with the press. Sheila Tate, who was spokeswoman to first lady
Nancy Reagan from 1981-85, was named press secretary, and Jim Lake,
who held previous press roles in the 1980 and 1984 Reagan-Bush
campaigns, was named as a senior communications adviser.
   Pressed to say how close he was to picking a vice presidential
running mate, Bush said, ``No list. ... We're getting a little
procedure worked out. So there literally is no long list, no short
list.''
   Bush reiterated that he will not seriously consider the question
until after the Democrats put together their ticket in Atlanta next
month. Meanwhile, he continues to get advice from party activists.
   ``I think we need an exciting vice presidential candidate,''
said Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico. ``We need someone,
certainly, who is a good communicator, like Ronald Reagan.''
   ``I recommended to Bush that he choose Elizabeth Dole,''
Carruthers said in an interview.
   He wasn't alone in offering advice to Bush and the vice
president's aides. It's apparent the suggestion box at the Bush
campaign is packed.
   Bush and his aides have been reluctant to talk about what
selection process they'll use, how long a Bush short-list of
candidates might be, or when the choice will be made known.
   But the jockeying to have an impact on this decision was evident
at the ``Unity '88'' weekend conference put on by the Republican
National Committee.
   Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., who joined Sen.
Bob Dole, R-Kan., Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and former Delaware Gov.
Pete du Pont in saluting Bush, joked about the speculation the
also-rans in the GOP competition came to Denver to protect their
prospects for the spot on the ticket.
   Haig said that since he had run for president, and been defeated
by Bush, he had no interest in seeking the second spot. ``I'm
content,'' he said.
   The list of names has lengthened in recent weeks, including
speculation about potential women candidates such as Mrs. Dole,
former U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum
of Kansas, along with Senator Dole, Kemp, du Pont. Plus Govs. Jim
Thompson of Illinois, George Deukmejian of California and John
Sununu of New Hampshire.
   ``I would like to see somebody that would be just a little bit
more conservative (than Bush), just to satisfy the right wing of
the party,'' said Bill Hughes, a Bush campaign chairman from
Vancouver, Wash.
   Joy Wood of Denver, who is trying to unseat Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., said ``I'm pushing for a very experienced
person. I think the Republican Party has very qualified women at
the top. But I, as a woman, want the strongest vice presidential
candidate.''
   ``I suspect it will be a man, but I just hope it will be a very
qualified person,'' she said.
   Barbara Campbell, state Republican Party chairwoman in Montana,
said ``I think it's a possibility'' that Bush will select a woman.
   But she also said that ``I have stated that it's important to
look to someone who understands the West.''
   Punch Green, Bush's campaign chairman in Oregon, said, ``I want
him to pick a guy or a gal who will be a vice president just like
George Bush has been for Ronald Reagan _ a person who will disagree
with him at times in the Oval Office, but then stand by the
president when he makes the decision.''
   Carruthers, however, said he hoped Bush wouldn't make the choice
based mostly on the basis of perceived loyalty.
   ``Loyalty is one condition, but I would hope that it would not
be the first-order condition,'' he said.
   ``What I would concern myself with most is the selection of a
winner,'' Carruthers said.

<HEAD>Bush Calls South Africa ``Racist;'' Poll Shows Him Gaining</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush comment, new poll in top 7 grafs, picking
up in 2nd graf pvs, Jesse Jackson</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>

   George Bush criticized South Africa today as a ``racist state''
but said he would not support breaking off diplomatic relations.
The apparent Republican presidential nominee commented as a new
poll suggested he was gaining slightly on Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Bush was asked at the White House whether he agreed with a move
by the Democrats to have their party platform brand South Africa
``a terrorist state.''
   ``I think it's a racist state, regrettably,'' he said.
   That language was stronger than President Reagan uses, but
Bush's policy recommendation was the same as the Reagan
administration has followed. He said the government must see
whether ``the United States can use its moral influence to change
things'' in South Africa.
   The new Harris poll showed Dukakis with a 5-point lead, just
within the survey's margin of potential sampling error. That was
down from a 7-point advantage in a similar poll last month.
   Dukakis was supported by 49 percent, Bush by 44 percent and 7
percent were unsure in the poll in which Lou Harris & Associates
contacted 1,258 likely voters the first week of June. The margin of
sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   One day earlier, Bush, seeking black support, edged away from
the Reagan administration on aid to minority businesses, while
Democrat Dukakis suggested he would use the U.S. military to help
fight the war on drugs.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, struck a conciliatory stance on the
touchy issue of whether he wants to be the Democratic vice
presidential candidate. After declaring last week that he was
entitled to consideration and that ``consideration means an
offer,'' Jackson backed off a bit.
   ``I do not want to push Mike Dukakis to that point,'' Jackson
said Sunday, interviewed from Chicago on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.'' Asked whether he should be offered the No. 2 spot, he said
only that he deserved ``serious consideration.''
   Jackson spent the weekend in his hometown of Chicago, mulling
his next move. He has said he will campaign all the way up to the
Democratic convention. Dukakis wrapped up the Democratic nomination
in the final four primaries last week.
   The Massachusetts governor was meeting today with congressional
leaders and law enforcement officials from several states to
discuss drug issues. He also sounded an anti-drug theme on Sunday,
when he told the U.S. Conference of Mayors the administration's
anti-drug effort is in a state of ``chaos.''
   That was an apparent dig at Bush, who headed an administration
task force on anti-drug efforts. Without providing specifics,
Dukakis told the mayors, meeting in Salt Lake City, that the
military should be prepared to assist in drug-interdiction efforts.
   ``It will take tough, sustained and unrelenting enforcement ...
at home and abroad, enforcement which uses the military where
appropriate and necessary,'' he said.
   As Dukakis spoke, Democratic party platform drafters were
calling for the appointment of a federal drug czar. A
platform-drafting panel wrapped up a long weekend of work Sunday at
the resort of Mackinac Island, Mich.
   In addition to backing a drug czar, the Democrats released
working papers that urged expanded AIDS research, adoption of the
Equal Rights Amendment, greater efforts to end homelessness, and a
law requiring employers to give workers advance notice of plant
closings.
   The Jackson forces had mixed success at the platform-drafting
sessions. The committee agreed the Democratic platform will label
South Africa a terrorist state, as Jackson has demanded. But the
panel was split on whether to call for a Jackson-backed freeze in
Pentagon spending, and expressed reluctance to call for the tax
hikes Jackson wants.
   Despite some bickering, the Democrats put up a united front.
   ``I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep.
William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the drafting
panel and a Jackson supporter.
   The Republicans, too, were making like a happy family. Over the
weekend in Denver, at the first of three ``unity conferences'' by
the Republican National Committee, GOP activists from 16 states _
and three former rivals for the nomination _ rallied around Bush.
   The vice president, who pleased many Republican observers when
he went on the offensive last week against Dukakis, promised the
party faithful on Saturday they'd be seeing more of the same.
   ``We're just beginning,'' he said.
   Another Bush tactic has been distancing himself from the White
House on selected issues. One of them is likely to be civil rights,
and the vice president stepped slightly away from the
administration on the use of federal aid to assist minority
businesses.
   ``I support strongly increased minority development efforts by
the federal government,'' he said in a commencement speech Sunday
at predominantly black Central State University in Wilberforce,
Ohio. ``We must bring black Americans and other minorities into the
free enterprise system.''
   The Reagan administration has opposed government programs that
set aside a portion of contracts for minority-run businesses. Such
set-asides have been used by federal, state and local governments
as a way to remedy past discrimination.
   Bush, who celebrated his 64th birthday Sunday, was awarded an
honorary degree by the university.
   Later Sunday, the vice president flew to Danville, Va., where he
campaigned for GOP congressional candidate Linda Arey and repeated
his call for Dukakis to join him in requesting an independent
counsel's investigation of alleged ethics breaches by Democratic
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   Wright, who is under preliminary investigation by the House
Ethics Committee, has denied the allegations.
   Bush was back in Washington today, where he planned to spend the
first part of the week. Dukakis scheduled a three-day Southern
campaign swing later in the week.

   Companies may violate antitrust law when they
lobby private organizations that play a prominent role in
influencing business legislation, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The 7-2 decision upheld a $11.4 million jury award against a
company accused of ``packing'' a meeting of the National Fire
Protection Association when the organization adopted a safety code
for electrical wiring.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in his opinion for the court, said
such activity to influence a private organization does not warrant
the same antitrust immunity granted to businesses and trade groups
that lobby governmental bodies.
   ``The activity at issue here did not take place in the open
political arena, where partisanship is the hallmark of
decision-making, but within the confines of a private
standard-setting process,'' Brennan said.
   Also, he said, the activity involved more than ``an exercise of
the power of persuasion.'' The adoption of an industry code ``in
part involves the exercise of market power'' because members of the
National Fire Protection Association, including consumers,
distributors and manufacturers, implicitly agreed to abide by the
association's rules, Brennan said.
   ``Given the context and nature of the conduct, it can more aptly
be characterized as commercial activity with a political impact,''
he said.
   The case stemmed from a May 1980 meeting of the association that
adopted a model legislative code for electrical conduit, a hollow
tubing used in building construction to carry insulated electrical
wires.
   Allied Tube & Conduit Corp., the largest producer in the United
States of steel conduit, was accused of organizing 230 voters at
the meeting to block approval in the code of a competing plastic
conduit.
   The charge was made by Indian Head Inc. and its Carlon division,
which makes electrical conduit from polyvinyl chloride, a plastic.
   The National Fire Protection Association is a private
organization that adopts the National Electrical Code of safety
regulations on which must state legislation is based.
   Indian Head said Allied illegally restrained trade in violation
of federal antitrust laws. A federal jury awarded $3.8 million and
the amount, as provided by law, was tripled.
   A federal judge threw out the judgment. But it was reinstated
last year by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in New
York City.
   The Supreme Court, in upholding the appeals court ruling,
refused to extend protection from antitrust suits it established in
1961.
   The justices ruled then that railway companies did not violate
antitrust law when they conducted a public relations campaign for
legislation aimed at placing the trucking industry at a
disadvantage.
   Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented today.
   The case is Allied Tube vs. Indian Head, 87-157.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Sentenced In Mingo County Job-Buying Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former southern West Virginia
sheriff who admitted buying the job for $100,000 was sentenced
today to a maximum of 7 years in federal prison.
   Former Mingo County Sheriff Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert also was
fined $10,000 by U.S. District Judge Charles Haden.
   Hilbert, 45, pleaded guilty in April to one count of mail fraud,
one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to buy the
sheriff's job from then-Sheriff Johnie Owens.
   Owens, who says he gave some of the $100,000 to county
commissioners to approve the arrangement, is serving a 14-year
federal prison sentence.
   Haden sentenced Hilbert to 2 years in prison on the mail fraud
count, in which Hilbert admitted backdating a check for an
insurance policy to cover an accident involving his son.
   Hilbert was sentenced to 5 years on the conspiracy charge, which
stemmed from the sale of the sheriff's office, and 3 years on the
tax evasion charge, in which he admitted failing to report income
from the sheriff's job.
   The 2- and the 5-year terms are consecutive, while the 3-year
term will be served at the same time.
   Hilbert had faced a maximum of 13 years in prison and $351,000
in fines. As part of his plea agreement he resigned as sheriff,
forfeited all pension and fringe benefits, and gave up all property
obtained with the proceeds of his criminal activity, prosecutors
said.
   Also today, former Mingo County Democratic Chairman Donald
Evans, 63, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to buy votes,
which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   He agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors and is free on
$10,000 bond pending his sentencing Aug. 8.
   One former Mingo County commissioner is scheduled to report to
federal prison later this month for his role in the scheme in which
the sheriff's job was sold. Two other county commissioners at the
time are under indictment.

<HEAD>Court Rules Postal Service Must Pay Interest to Missouri Letter
Carrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, ruling that the Postal
Service is similar to a private business, said today the service
must pay interest on back pay owed to a worker who won a lawsuit
charging it with illegal discrimination.
   By a 5-3 vote, the court ordered interest on back pay for a
letter carrier in Chesterfield, Mo., who was fired and later
ordered rehired.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said when the
Post Office Department was reorganized by Congress in 1970 into the
Postal Service it became in key respects more like a private
enterprise than a government agency.
   The reorganization launched the Postal Service into the
commercial world, specifically allowing it to sue and be sued,
Blackmun said.
   ``It follows that Congress is presumed to have waived any
otherwise existing immunity of the Postal Service from interest
awards,'' he said.
   The court ordered interest paid to Theodore J. Loeffler, who was
fired from his job as a letter carrier after 10 years.
   His superiors said Loeffler violated a rule dealing with the
organizing of so-called box-holder mail that is sent to ``current
occupant'' at an address and does not carry the resident's name.
   For a period in 1979 and 1980, letter carriers were not allowed
to sort the box-holder mail in separate compartments of their
carrying bags before beginning their routes. They were required to
leave the third class mail in bundles and sort it out at each point
of delivery.
   Loeffler, who worked in a rural area, openly refused to obey the
rule as did two female letter carriers.
   One of the women was suspended and threatened with dismissal.
The other woman was warned but was not otherwise disciplined.
   Loeffler was fired when he was caught breaking the rule the
fourth time.
   He sued the Postal Service under a 1964 civil rights law banning
sex discrimination in employment and a federal judge ruled in his
favor. Loeffler was awarded $91,871 in back pay and was ordered
reinstated.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Loeffler
was not entitled to interest the back pay would have earned from
the time he was fired until he won the suit.
   Such interest generally is authorized for those who win
anti-discrimination suits under the 1964 act.
   The appeals court said the Postal Service was immune from the
interest payments because Congress had not passed a law
specifically eliminating the service's protection against such
civil rights suits.
   The Reagan administration said today's case could affect
hundreds of employment discrimination cases pending against the
Postal Service.
   Dissenting from the ruling were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the ruling.
   The case is Loeffler vs. Frank, 86-1431.

<HEAD>US Will Aid Afghan Refugees: Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan assured a top U.N. official
today that the United States intends to ``contribute
significantly'' to the international relief effort aiding Afghan
refugees, the White House reported.
   Reagan discussed the matter with Sadruddin Aga Khan, who is the
U.N. coordinator for humanitarian and economic assistance,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The official, who is from Pakistan, asked the president for
assistance in helping the 5 million refugees to return to their
homeland, Fitzwater said. The refugees fled to neighboring Pakistan
following the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan in 1979.
   ``The president urged other countries to also contribute,
including the Soviet Union,'' Fitzwater said.
   Reagan assured the official ``that the U.S. will continue to
contribute significantly in assisting the Afghans adversely
affected by the war and would support strongly his efforts to
mobilize the international community to respond to the
repatriation, resettlement and subsequent reconstruction needs of
the Afghan people,'' the spokesman added.
   Fitzwater, who said the United States has budgeted $119 million
to aid the refugees, called America ``the leading country in terms
of assistance at this point.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African National Congress
leader Govan Mbeki, freed from a life prison term last year, has
been banned from being in the company of more than 10 people at a
time, his attorney said Monday.
   The government order against Mbeki, 77, will keep him from
attending any large rallies or meetings supported by the ANC, the
main guerrilla group fighting the South African government.
   Mbeki had already been prohibited from addressing meetings,
giving interviews or leaving the area near the city of Port
Elizabeth, where he lives. The new order limiting the number of
people he can be with is a common measure used by the government to
censure anti-apartheid activists.
   Mbeki's attorney, Priscilla Jana, said another of her clients,
United Democratic Front co-president Albertina Sisulu, was served
with similar new orders.
   Mrs. Sisulu, wife of imprisoned ANC official Walter Sisulu, was
one of 18 black activists whose movements and speech had already
been restricted in February.
   Also in February, the UDF, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups,
was banned from all activity, along with 17 other anti-apartheid
organizations.
   Mrs. Jana said Mbeki filed a court challenge to the first
restrictions placed on him but will have to refile the appeal under
the new regulations.
   Mbeki was freed last August after serving 23 years for a 1964
conviction on charges of sabotage.
   Under South African apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate schools, districts and health
services.

<TEXT>
   Chinese factories and offices have at least 20
million excess workers, and the situation is costing the government
billions of dollars each year, the official Xinhua News Agency said
Monday.
   The news agency quoted an official in charge of personnel
affairs as saying that overstaffing costs the state about $16.2
billion a year, equal to half the total revenue the state receives
from enterprises each year.
   He said many employees spend working hours playing cards or
watching television. At one 800-person factory in Shijiazhuang,
northeast China, employees were found to work only four hours
during an eight-hour shift, he said.
   China, with an urban work force of 120 million, has cited low
productivity and surplus workers as major obstacles to its drive to
modernize industries and make them more profitable.
   But the government is also committed to keeping unemployment at
the present stated level of 2 percent and has said it must create
30 million new jobs by 1990 just to keep pace with the expanding
work force.
   Factory managers have been given authority to dismiss
unproductive workers, but it is very rare for workers to be fired
for loafing on the job.

   A Hungarian woman who was decorated for
helping Jews and anti-fascists in wartime Hungary has been expelled
from the Communist Party for investigating the disappearance of a
war criminal, a source said Monday.
   A member of the Jewish community in Vienna said the information
was provided by Gyoerffy College, a university student club, and by
Andras Hegedues, a former prime minister.
   According to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Gizella Kutrucz was ousted from the party in March. The source said
Kutrucz had been a party member for 44 years, is in her 60s, and is
a retired government secretary.
   Last month, she had her pension reduced and was stripped of
other benefits and a medal she had been awarded for helping Jews,
anti-fascists and Communists during the war, the source said.
   Her friends in Budapest said Kutrucz drew official wrath for
persistent research into the mystery surrounding Zoltan Bonsyak, a
Hungarian who in 1944 led an institute doing research on Jews and
issued a fascist publication, Harc. Bonsyak, who was said to have
been on an international list of war criminals, mysteriously
disappeared. Officially, he was executed. But the Jewish source
said no documents apparently exist to corroborate that version.
   Kutrucz collected documents to shed light on what had happened
to Bonsyak, but officials apparently objected to her research
efforts, the source said.

   A subcommittee of the nation's largest

   The revised paper on ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age''
was scheduled to be considered later today by a full committee of
the 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
   The subcommittee of the Committee on Peacemaking and
International Relations ended almost four days of at-times
contentious debate with a 15-1 vote to recommend adoption of the
statement.
   The subcommittee revised the original proposal to make it clear
Presbyterians considered obedience to government the normal course,
and to soften language that now declares nuclear deterrence
immoral. The subcommittee adopted a writing team's fine-tuning of
the policy to agree with earlier changes in recommendations.
   Meanwhile, the full assembly today took up some internal issues,
including commissioning of missionaries.
   Other issues remaining for discussion by the denomination's
highest body include pornography, abortion and Israel's treatment
of Palestinians in its occupied territories.
   On Sunday, the statement on nuclear war was revised to say a
Christian ``normally'' should support the government, and nuclear
deterrence is immoral ``as an end in itself.'' The 630 delegates
are scheduled to take up the report Tuesday evening, the day before
the assembly ends.
   ``We Presbyterians will study this issue to death, while the
rest of the world moves on,'' said subcommittee member J. Leslie
Reindl, an elder from Minnesota.
   Sue Anderson, an elder from Tennessee, however, said the paper,
and the five-year process that preceded its writing, had led to
much debate in the 3 million-member denomination.
   If the intent is to make peace, especially within the
denomination, Ms. Anderson said, ``then let the people sitting
beside me in the pew have a chance to look at this.''
   Reservations in the subcommittee centered around fears the paper
elevated tax resistance and civil obedience above obedience in the
church's eyes and promised financial support to those who engage in
resistance.
   However, the revised paper retains declarations that nuclear war
is immoral, and says, ``The policy of nuclear deterrence has been
in danger of becoming an end in itself rather than an interim
measure of self-defense. Such a policy as an end in itself is not
morally defensible. The work for peaceful alternatives needs to be
vigorously pursued.''
   Supporters of the original paper expected the full committee to
restore some of the recommendations, including discussions of
corporate support, financial and otherwise, for tax resisters.
   Other issues awaiting assembly action included a recommendation
that the church call for Israel to end its ``repressive''
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and that the church ask
the U.S. government to stop aid to Israel that subsidizes
settlements in the occupied territories.
   Also Tuesday, commissioners face what is expected to be a hotly
contested election for stated clerk, the officer responsible for
the operation of the assembly.
   The Rev. James E. Andrews, 60, has been stated clerk or interim
co-stated clerk of the denomination since it was formed in 1983 by
the reunion of the Northern and Southern branches of the
Presbyterian church. Previously, he held the office in the
Presbyterian Church (U.S), the Southern church, for 10 years.

   When Sam Nunn overcame his reluctance to talk
about the possibility of being Michael Dukakis' running mate, the
Georgia senator gave the interview to a newspaper he is sure the
Massaschusetts governor reads every day _ The Boston Globe.
   Frequently mentioned in speculation about the Democratic vice
presidential nomination, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee has been cautious in indicating his interest _ but he is
interested.
   His response to the question of whether he would even accept the
offer is delicately phrased: ``I probably would not accept,'' he
told the Globe.
   Nunn earns a spot among possible nominees because some judge him
the perfect balance on a ticket with Dukakis:
   _ A conservative Southerner with the liberal Northeasterner.
   _ An expert on defense with an expert on domestic policy.
   _ A senator with a governor.
   ``The best in Louisiana would be Nunn,'' said state party
chairman Jim Brady. ``He's strong on national defense ... and he's
perceived to be very intelligent.''
   Because of Nunn's expertise in defense and foreign policy,
former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb and others have even talked of
Nunn being vice president and secretary of defense, an
unprecedented double role in U.S. government.
   ``That would be the only reason that he would want to give up
the chairmanship, a major substantive role ... to basically sit
around an inquire into the health of both his own president and
leaders of other countries,'' Robb said.
   Nunn carefully encourages that by contrasting his clout in the
Senate with the vice president's role: ``You have tremendous
potential power, but you don't have power ... Unless you had some
unusual understanding as to what you're going to be _ which I don't
think would be easy to work out for me or anyone else _ I think
there's just a very definite problem there.''
   But there is a long list of reasons cited by critics that Nunn
should not be on the ticket. In general, positions he has taken
have caused consternation among various Democratic groups.
   Civil rights is at the top of the list, and has become a
particularly thorny matter with Democratic runner-up Jesse Jackson
pressuring Dukakis on the issue every day.
   ``Sam Nunn represents the Old South,'' said Patricia Ireland, a
vice president of the National Organization for Women from Florida.
   Nunn voted in 1975 against bringing up the legislation to renew
the Voting Rights Act. When the law was up again for a vote in
1982, Nunn voted for amendments that critics said would weaken the
legal protections. In 1980, he voted to continue a filibuster that
killed new federal powers to fight housing discrimination.
   He voted against an extension of time to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment. He supported a constitutional amendment that would
overturn the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and leave
the matter up to each state.
   Such criticism irritates Nunn.
   ``I don't enjoy it. I don't like it. I don't want my children to
read 10, 15, 20 years from now that Sam Nunn was against civil
rights. That's just absolutely false,'' he told the newspaper.
   Nunn's aides say that each of his votes was on the specific
matter at hand, and often dealt with procedural considerations.
   For example, aides said Nunn voted against the ERA extension
because it would not allow states to withdraw a previous
ratification vote. On the fair housing bill, Nunn argued he didn't
want the federal government being both judge and jury on alleged
violators.
   Whether or not Jackson would object to Nunn on the ticket is not
known, but his aides quickly started boosting Ohio Sen. John Glenn
as an alternative choice when Nunn's name was first mentioned.
   Nunn also has a long record of support for many of President
Reagan's policies. Congressional Quarterly, an independent
magazine, ranked Nunn as the most frequent supporter of the
president among Senate Democrats in 1983 and 1985, never dipping
below a 58 percent level in votes on Reagan issues.
   ``He's too conservative for me,'' said Colorado Democratic Party
Executive Director Sigrid Freese of Nunn. ``He's more Republican
than Democrat.''
   And there are a series of specific issues on which Nunn and
Dukakis disagree.
   Nunn voted for aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, while
Dukakis says that policy is illegal. Nunn voted for the MX missile,
which Dukakis opposes. He voted for a balanced budget amendment and
the Gramm-Rudman law requiring automatic spending cuts in 1985.
   In 1986, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave Nunn a
30 percent rating, while their counterpart, the American
Conservative union gave him a 55 percent mark.
   A thoughtful and careful politician, Nunn has sometimes been
called dull, a word applied to Dukakis as well. Nunn has little use
for such criticism.
   ``It would bother me if I felt audiences I spoke to felt that
... I never had that impression,'' Nunn told the newspaper. ``I
could become very controversial by just saying a lot of stupid
things and the media would say, `Where did you get all that
charisma?' But then, in two years I wouldn't be back up here.''
   There is also the question of just what Nunn could bring the
Democrats in the South. One poll in Florida suggested adding Nunn
to the ticket was worth only one precentage point of the vote in
the fall.
   A Charlotte Observer poll in North and South Carolina found a
Dukakis-Jackson ticket trailing a George Bush-Bob Dole GOP team by
five percentage points. But a Dukakis-Nunn ticket trailed by 13
points.

Treatment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Radicals hurled tear gas grenades and
firebombs at a U.S. diplomatic office Monday, and thousands of
students battled riot police to protest the blocking of a march to
the North Korean border.
   Riot police kicked and punched street vendors in Seoul and threw
tear gas to disperse a march by about 1,000 of the merchants, news
reports said. The vendors accused authorities of hurting their
businesses in efforts to clean up the city for the Olympics.
   Police and U.S. officials said students tossed three firebombs
and two tear gas grenades at the U.S. Information Service building
in Taegu before they were seized by police guards firing tear gas.
   Police said only three students were involved in the attack in
Taegu, 150 miles south of Seoul, but local press reports said there
were up to 10 attackers and that they also hurled two homemade
bombs.
   The reports said six windows were broken and the office's sign
was set on fire.
   The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government and
anti-U.S. protests in the past two weeks by radical students
demanding an end to U.S. influence and the removal of about 42,000
American troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact.
   Few South Koreans support the radicals, who also are demanding
reunification of South Korea and communist North Korea.
   In the western port city of Inchon, about 3,000 university
students yelling ``Yankee go home!'' and anti-government slogans
hurled firebombs and rocks when police fired barrages of tear gas
to stop them from marching off their campus.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap said about 1,200 students from
eight schools attacked riot police with firebombs and rocks at a
university campus in the southern city of Pusan.
   No injuries were reported in the campus clashes.
   The protesters demanded that the government release students
arrested Friday in major street clashes across the capital.
   Those battles broke out when riot police blocked thousands of
students trying to march to the North Korean border for talks with
northern students on reunifying North and South.
   There was more violence Sunday when riot police clashed with
thousands of students during a funeral march for a radical who
committed suicide in an anti-government protest.
   The students burned Olympic flags during the funeral march.
Seoul is the host of the 1988 Summer Olympics, which begin Sept.
17. The radicals back North Korea's demand to be a co-host of the
Games.
   Police said Monday that 600 of the 908 students arrested Friday
had been freed and that 229 others were facing minor charges.
   Police charged 47 students with assault or with violating
national security laws.
   ``Ensure our life!'' street vendors shouted as they marched in
Seoul after a rally at Sungkyunkwan University.
   News reports said at least five vendors were injured when police
moved in to disperse them. The reports said one vendor was
seriously hurt by a punch in the face.
   The vendors shouted anti-government slogans and accused
authorities of cracking down on their street stalls to keep the
streets clean as part of beautification and urban renewal projects
for the Olympics.

<HEAD>Aide Says Working On Book Was `Part Of My Job'</HEAD>

Wright comment today</NOTE>

   A former aide to House Speaker Jim Wright was
quoted today as saying he thought working on a book written by his
boss was ``part of my job'' rather than the volunteer project
described by Wright.
   Matthew Cossolotto said, ``I did think it was part of my
congressional job. That was my understanding at the time, and I
still think that.''
   The statement by Cossolotto, published in the Forth Worth
(Texas) Star-Telegram, contrasts with statements by Wright,
D-Texas, who said today that Cossolotto had volunteered and that
the important thing was the aide gave full value for taxpayers'
dollars.
   ``It is common practice for people on the staff to help in
preparation of articles, books and speeches,'' Wright told
reporters, adding that such action is proper if the writing
involves matters of public policy.
   ``Was that (Cossolotto's work on the book) public work? I think
it can be argued that it was.''
   Wright earlier defended his actions in back-to-back appearances
Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' and ABC-TV's ``This Week
with David Brinkley.''
   Last Friday, the House ethics committee announced it was
starting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of conflicts of
interest in Wright's financial dealings.
   Some of the allegations center on the book written by Wright,
``Reflections of a Public Man.'' According to reports Sunday in the
Fort Worth newspaper and in The New York Times, one Texas
businessman said he bought 1,000 copies of the book as a legal way
to give money to Wright and bypass limits on campaign contributions.
   Cossolotto was on Wright's staff at the time and Wright has said
Cossolotto worked on the book on his own time, rather than while he
was supposed to be at his job.
   But Cossolotto disputed that. ``I never understood it (the book)
to be personal time. Nobody ever said this was a project to be done
around personal time. It was pretty clear.''
   Cossolotto, now in private business in Washington, said of the
fact that his statements differ from Wright, ``I don't want to
characterize it as a conflict.''
   ``I do have a recollection of it and the speaker has a
recollection of it,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Wright said Sunday the congressional investigation of his
financial dealings won't hamper him in his role as chairman of next
month's Democratic National Convention.
   ``There is no cloud over my head, no sir,'' the Texas Democrat
said. ``I've done nothing unethical, nothing illegal, nothing
violative of the rules of the House.''
   Other allegations concern Wright's political efforts on behalf
of several Texas businesses.
   Wright said the allegations are ``a partisan political ploy'' by
Republicans seeking to deflect attention from ethical violations by
current and former members of the Reagan administration.
   ``It's a partisan ploy and it will be revealed to be a partisan
ploy,'' Wright said on the CBS program.
   Wright, when asked if he would step down from the chairmanship
of the party's convention if asked, said, ``I don't expect to.''
   ``I haven't done anything dishonest or illegal,'' he said. ``I'm
convinced I haven't violated any rules of the House.
   ``I may have done some things, at one time or another in my
career, that were bad judgment,'' he said. ``But whatever mistakes
I've made have not been dishonest mistakes.''
   Wright refused to say if he thinks the ethics investigation
should be conducted by an independent counsel, rather than the
committee. ``I don't have a preference,'' he said.
   ``I'm not trying to tell the committee how to do its business,''
Wright said on ABC. ``I asked them to look into it thoroughly. I
asked them to do it promptly. Now, anything that can be done is
fine with me so long as it gets the facts out and gets them out
soon.
   ``I want this resolved and I'm convinced that the resolution is
going to be that I haven't violated any rules.''
   The committee's inquiry was originally suggested by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., one of Wright's harshest critics in the House. But
the panel said its investigation will be wider in scope than that
suggested by Gingrich.
   Wright received a 55 percent royalty totaling about $55,000 on
his book. Questions have been raised about Wright's use of a
congressional staffer to work on the book, purchases of the book by
friends and lobbyists, and about the royalty percentage, which is
higher than those usually paid to authors.
   Wright said ``there was nothing wrong with the contract'' and
joked that `the royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity _
Mrs. Wright and me.''
   The book was published by William Carlos Moore, a friend of
Wright who also received large printing contracts from Wright's
re-election campaign.
   ``I think it's a good book,'' Wright said, while acknowledging
that it contained little that was new.
   ``It's not fresh stuff,'' he said. ``Most of it is reprinted
from speeches, articles, newsletters, memoirs. Little vignette
style, so they're self-contained.''
   The Times and Star-Telegram articles Sunday concerned purchases
of the book by Fort Worth developer S. Gene Payte.
   Payte said he bought 1,000 copies at a cost of $6,000 because
federal election laws limit individual campaign contributions to
$1,000 for each election.
   ``If I wanted to help Jim and wanted to give him some money, I
couldn't do it,'' Payte told the Star-Telegram. ``But I could buy
his books.''
   Payte, who has known Wright since he entered Congress in 1955,
said he bought the books ``to show my appreciation'' to Wright and
that he encouraged other Texas business executives to do the same.
   Asked about such reports, Wright answered, ``I didn't sell these
books.''

   As the long primary season ended, Michael
Dukakis had few scars from his battle for the Democratic
presidential nomination. But now comes the hard part.
   Dukakis clinched the nomination without becoming the target of a
lot of criticism from within his own party.
   When criticism did come, it was from a rival on the left in
fellow Democrat Jesse Jackson and from the right in Republican
George Bush. That left Dukakis in the best position of all: the
middle.
   Also, Dukakis made it this far without the intensely negative
campaign coverage that hit some of his presidential rivals,
according to experts who are studying television coverage of the
race.
   Now, though, ``It's finally one-on-one,'' said Sen. Bob Dole,
who lost his bid for the Republican nomination, ``and that's bad
news for Michael Dukakis.''
   It may or may not be bad, but it will be different.
   Bush signaled that last week when he took the gloves off in
trying to reverse Dukakis' lead in the polls. He lashed at Dukakis
as an ``old-style 60s'' liberal with views ``born in Harvard yard's
boutique.''
   Dukakis, like Bush, hasn't officially locked up his party's
nomination. But he has entered a new phase of his presidential race
in which he is one of the final two players and inevitably will
draw the intense scrutiny such a position brings.
   ``I think he'll get a round of very tough press before the
convention,'' said Bob Beckel, who helped Walter Mondale through
these same waters in 1984 as campaign manager. ``Any mistake he
makes will be magnified.''
   That's a certainty, says Michael J. Robinson, a government
professor at Georgetown University and a student of presidential
campaign press coverage.
   ``Whenever someone emerges from a pack into a two-person race,
that person's coverage always becomes more negative,'' he said.
``It's never not happened.''
   Dukakis' character and background have already come under
extensive examination in television and newspaper stories. Two
biographies have been published.
   But there'll be more attention to such accounts now, and to
stories questioning the validity of anything he claims or contends.
   He takes at least partial credit for the economic boom in
Massachusetts. Look for stories examining the loss of manufacturing
jobs in that state and pointing out current budget problems.
   Look for examinations, too, of the personal side of Michael
Dukakis: the cool way he deals with some people, suggesting to some
an insensitivity.
   And look for criticism of his bland speaking style.
   What Dukakis sees as positive will be a negative to some: his
seemingly vague talk of ``partnerships,'' his calling, without
specifics, for ``good jobs at good wages _ and I mean good wages.''
   ``People are going to be talking about how incredibly bromidic
he is. He's cliche-ridden,'' Robinson said. ``It's going to be a
story now: `Does Michael Dukakis say anything?'''
   Robert Lichter, who is conducting a television-coverage study at
the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a non-profit reasearch
group, says Dukakis has fared ``better than you'd expect for a
front-runner.''
   ``Dukakis missed being treated as a front-runner,'' Lichter
said. ``He went right from being treated as a co-front-runner with
Jesse Jackson to being the winner. ... I would be astounded if his
coverage doesn't become more critical in the next couple of
months.''
   Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe says polls show even
partisan Republicans have not yet reacted negatively to Dukakis _
an indication, he says, that they haven't begun paying attention to
the race yet.
   He says Dukakis' press coverage shows that Republicans and other
critics have held their fire.
   Robinson adds that in part that's because Dukakis ``has been in
hiding,'' avoiding a lot of exposure to the press and risking his
lead.
   ``Now there's going to be an active effort on the part of the
Republican Party, George Bush, and Republican surrogates to say,
`Hey, this is what the guy says but look at his record,''' Mahe
said.
   Still, Mahe and others suggest Dukakis is in a strong position
to weather increasingly tough examinations _ unless some skeletons
are unearthed, or he commits some gaffe that supports the doubts
critics are trying to raise.
   ``It's like in basketball _ he's been able to get a couple big
feet planted in the center,'' said Mahe. ``You can't get him out of
there now by bumping him. Somebody's going to have to plow into him
and take an intentional foul.''

<HEAD>Belgian Extradicted to California Also Held Liable to Lawsuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People extradited from foreign countries to
face criminal charges here cannot avoid defending themselves
against related civil lawsuits filed in U.S. courts, the Supreme
Court ruled today.
   The justices ruled unanimously against Wilfried van
Cauwenberghe, a Belgian citizen who is trying to avoid having to
defend himself against a $19 million lawsuit in California.
   The court said Van Cauwenberghe has no right to appeal, before
any trial is held, the authority of a Los Angeles-based federal
court to preside over the lawsuit.
   Van Cauwenberghe was sued by another Belgian, Roger Biard, who
lent $1 million to a California real estate partnership engaged in
renovating a Kansas City townhouse complex.
   According to court papers, Biard was repaid $800,000 of the loan
and accused Van Cauwenberghe of fraud.
   Van Cauwenberge also was convicted in federal court in
California of wire fraud and related charges. He was sentenced to
time already served in pretrial confinement and was ordered to pay
Biard $34,501 in restitution.
   Van Cauwenberghe had been arrested while on a trip to
Switzerland and was extradited to Los Angeles.
   In seeking to have Biard's civil lawsuit dismissed, Van
Cauwenberghe argued that the Belgian courts are a more convenient
forum for the civil case, and also that extradited individuals are
immune from such suits.
   A federal judge refused to dismiss the suit and the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said it was premature for it to hear Van
Cauwenberghe's appeal.
   The Supreme Court today agreed that any such appeal by Van
Cauwenberghe can wait until after the trial is completed.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said Van
Cauwenberghe's freedom is not at stake in the case.
   Van Cauwenberghe cannot be imprisoned or required to post bail
in a civil suit and, in fact, is not even required to be present at
the civil trial.
   Van Cauwenberghe's right to challenge the outcome of the lawsuit
can be vindicated after there is a judgment in the suit, Marshall
said.
   The case is Van Cauwenberghe vs. Biard, 87-336.

<HEAD>Seafarers Union President Frank Drozak Dead of Brain Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Drozak, president of the 80,000-member
Seafarers International Union since 1980 and a vice president of
the AFL-CIO, died at his home from brain cancer, labor officials
said Monday.
   Drozak, 60, who had been hospitalized several times in the past
18 months for cancer treatments, died Saturday.
   Despite his illness, he had remained active in the union. Just
last fall, he had lobbied extensively for legislation that would
have required 11 Kuwati tankers operating under the U.S. flag in
the Persian Gulf to be manned by American crewmen.
   Congress passed the measure. But the Reagan administration,
citing national security interests, used an exemption in it to
allow the reflagged tankers to be staffed mostly with Filipino
crews who are paid about one-fourth the $30,000 to $35,000 annual
wage of U.S. seamen.
   Drozak assumed the leadership of the Seafarers Union at a time
when its membership was suffering large layoffs due to an
overcapacity of ship bottoms in the world, new technologies that
reduced the size of crews needed on each vessel and a large decline
in the size of the U.S. merchant marine fleet.
   Of the union's 14,000 active deep sea seamen, only about 7,000
hold active jobs now, according to union officials.
   Beginning as a shipyard worker at the age of 16 in Mobile, Ala.,
Drozak worked his way up the union's heirarchy in the 1950s and
1960s, first as an organizer in Mobile and then as a port agent in
Philadelphia and San Francisco.
   He was elected a vice president of the union in 1965 and was put
in charge of its contracts covering the Atlantic and Gulf coasts,
Great Lakes and inland waterways in 1972.
   In 1980, Drozak was elected to succeed Paul Hall as the
Seafarers' president and also as head of the 44-union AFL-CIO
Maritime Trades Department.
   A year later, he was named an AFL-CIO vice president and to one
of the 35 seats on the labor federation's policymaking executive
council.
   Drozak is survived by his wife, Marianne; a daughter; a sister;
a brother; and three grandchildren.
   Funeral services will be held Thursday at the Seafarers' School
of Seamanship at Piney Point, Md.

<TEXT>
   Louis L'Amour, one of America's
most prolific storytellers whose frontier tales of gunfighters,
lawmen and drifters enthralled millions of readers from waitresses
to presidents, has died. He was 80.
   The funeral for L'Amour, who died of lung cancer Friday at his
Beverly Hills home, will be private, his daughter, Angelique, said
Sunday night.
   A few hours before his death, L'Amour was proofreading the
manuscript of his autobiography ``Education of a Wandering Man,''
according to Bantam Books, his publisher of 33 years.
   ``For millions of readers around the world, Louis was the
embodiment of the North American frontier,'' said Stuart Applebaum,
his editor at Bantam.
   ``They were able to relive our American history and heritage,''
the editor added. ``His books gave pleasure to truck drivers and
truck stop waitresses, financiers and presidents of the United
States. ... His work far transcends the Western novel genre.''
   L'Amour wrote 101 books, nearly all of them Westerns, including
``Hondo,'' ``The Iron Marshal,'' ``The Quick and the Dead,''
``Sackett's Land,'' ``Down the Long Hills'' and ``Ride the Dark
Trail.''
   Nearly 200 million copies of the books are in print; his works
were translated into 20 languages.
   More than 45 of his novels and short stories were made into
movies, including ``Hondo,'' ``Burning Hills,'' ``Heller in Pink
Tights'' and ``Stranger on Horseback.'' Stars cast in L'Amour
Westerns included John Wayne, Natalie Wood and Alan Ladd.
   Applebaum noted that perhaps his best-known novel, ``How The
West Was Won,'' was based on the movie screenplay.
   L'Amour was a writer who paid scrupulous attention to accuracy.
   ``If he said that the cowboys went over a hill and to the right
was Jones Hill, then there was Jones Hill. He researched it from
heck to breakfast,'' retired newspaperman Jack Evans said Sunday.
   ``He would travel widely to check out the geography, the way
people talked,'' Evans said from his farm in L'Amour's hometown of
Jamestown, N.D. ``If you start reading his books, you won't quit.
It gets ahold of you and grabs you 'til the end. He was that good a
writer.''
   ``He always said he was just a storyteller, in the ancient folk
tradition of people sitting around the fire, just telling
stories,'' said Joseph Wershba, a New York-based television news
producer who knew L'Amour for more than a decade.
   L'Amour dispelled myths about life in the Old West, such as
townfolk fleeing the bad guys. Many of the actual settlers, he
noted, were Civil War veterans not deterred by gunplay.
   ``I go to an area I'm interested in and I try to find a guy who
knows it better than anyone else. Usually it's some broken-down
cowboy,'' L'Amour once explained in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   ``I'm actually writing history. It isn't what you'd call big
history. I don't write about presidents and generals,'' L'Amour
said. ``I write about the man who was ranching, the man who was
mining, the man who was opening up the country.''
   Although he was the first novelist to win the congressional Gold
Medal, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he never won
a top literary award. But that didn't bother him.
   ``He never really paid critics and literati that much mind,''
Applebaum said. ``He received thousands of fan mail (letters) every
year. They were the critics that counted.''
   L'Amour left Jamestown when he was 15 for what he later called
his ``yondering'' years, picking up such odd jobs as prize fighter,
tugboat deckhand, longshoreman, lumberjack, prospector, miner,
circus roustabout, fruit picker, elephant handler and amateur
archaeologist.
   As a result, he was largely self-educated. In later years, he
lectured on such campuses as the University of Southern California,
the University of Oklahoma and Baylor University.
   He said that he ``wanted to write almost from the time I could
walk.'' He became a prolific contributor in the 1940s and 1950s to
pulp magazines.
   After World War II, he used the pen name Tex Burns because, he
recalled, ``no editor believed that the name L'Amour could ever
appear on a Western story.''
   He used his real name after his first novel, the 1953 ``Hondo,''
was made into a successful motion picture starring Wayne. ``Hondo''
was followed by 85 novels, 14 short story collections and one
non-fiction book.
   His readers included Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan, who read ``Jubal Sackett'' while
recovering from surgery in 1985.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent a telegram to L'Amour's widow
expressing their ``heartfelt sympathy'' on the author's death.
   ``He brought not only millions of hours of enjoyment to readers
but the best descriptions of American history,'' former President
Jimmy Carter said in a telephone interview today. ``One of the last
requests he made of me was a signed copy of my last book, `An
Outdoor Journal.' We used to swap books all the time, but I always
got the best end of the deal.''
   L'Amour received the congressional gold medal in 1983 and the
Medal of Freedom from Reagan the following year.
   Two L'Amour books are scheduled for release this fall:
``Lonigan,'' a short story collection, and ``The Sackett
Companion,'' a non-fiction account of his research for his 17
novels devoted to the fictional Sackett clan.
   In addition to his daughter, L'Amour is survived by his wife of
32 years, Kathy, and son, Beau.

   The glorious summer sound of ice cream
truck bells may no longer be heard in one Chicago suburb.
   Schaumburg's village board is considering a ban on Good Humor
and other ice cream trucks in residential neighborhoods in the
northwestern suburb.
   Village Trustee Ray LeBeau said some board members were worried
that children attracted to the trucks were endangering their lives
by running onto streets without looking.
   ``They say that on too many occasions, kids hear the bells, and
they don't stop and realize _ they just dart,'' LeBeau said.
   But Jeanie Caban, co-owner of Roxanne's Good Humor in
Schaumburg, said her four trucks have never been involved in an
injury.
   ``There's nothing dangerous about it,'' said Barbara Pawlowski,
Caban's main driver. She said most of her sales are made in
cul-de-sacs, out of the flow of traffic.
   Mark Hotchkiss of Wood Dale Frozen Foods, who sells Penguin Ice
Cream in Schaumburg, said, ``They don't ban skateboards or
all-terrain vehicles, and kids die on 'em every day.''
   ``I think it's stupid,'' 14-year-old ice cream lover Vicki Glade
said of the proposal.

   How much would you pay for scotch and champagne
that had been aging undisturbed for 75 years in dark, cold storage
_ in a shipwreck at the bottom of Lake Huron?
   At a rare wine auction this past weekend, people bid up to $90 a
bottle for scotch and champagne recovered from the wreck of the SS
Regina, one of 19 ships that sank in the Great Lakes in the great
storm of November 1913.
   ``It's a novelty, my father is a scotch drinker,'' said Susie
Shaw of Chicago, who paid $180 for three bottles of Whyte & Mackay
Scotch Whisky intended as a Father's Day present.
   ``I don't drink, but some of my divers tried some samples which
were in very good condition despite being underwater for 75
years,'' said commercial diver Wayne Brusate, who discovered the
wreck in July 1986 while searching for a tugboat that sank in the
late 1960s.
   About 300 bottles of French champagne and Scotch whisky have
been salvaged from the Regina, a 249-foot Canadian freighter that
served the coastal towns of Lake Huron with packaged goods until it
went down in 80 feet of water with all 27 crewmembers on Nov. 9,
1913.
   Several thousand more bottles still rest in the wreck roughly 3{
miles offshore from Port Sanilac, about 80 miles northeast of
Detroit, Brusate said.
   ``Most freighters on the Great Lakes carried coal, iron ore and
tons of wheat, but this was like a general store,'' said Brusate,
of Marysville, Mich.
   The 60 bottles sold Saturday by Christie's auctioneers brought a
total of $3,460, said Michael Davis, vice-president of Christie's
wine division. Among wines that did not come from the ship, the
highest price at the auction was $1,600 for a 1875 Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild. About 100 people attended.
   Deanna Chan, president of Freedom Marine Ltd. of Vancouver,
British Columbia, the Regina's salvagers, said she was a bit
disappointed the bids weren't higher.
   ``It's a piece of our history, a collector's item,'' she said.
   A wine collector, Dr. Steven Pritikin of Bridgeview, Ill.,
bought six bottles each of the Regina's champagne and Scotch.
   ``We'll store some and drink some,'' said Pritikin. ``We sampled
some of the champagne and it was quite good. ... The constant, cool
temperatures helped preserve it.''
   Brent Albrecht, a representative of Clicquot Inc. U.S.A., bid
$85 for a bottle of 1906-1908 vintage Veuve Clicquot for the
champagne company's museum in Reims, France.
   Other items salvaged from the Regina have been auction to help
finance further salvage operations, which are to resume next month,
Brusate said.
   He estimated that only about 10 percent of the ship's cargo has
been recovered so far.
   The search will concentrate on finding the ship's safe, which
reportedly contained $86,000 in gold coins, worth at least $2
million at current bullion prices, Ms. Chan said. The gold was
believed to have been the payroll for workers building the Sault
Ste. Marie locks between lakes Superior and Huron.

   An Alaska Airlines jetliner skid off a runway
after landing at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and four of
the 82 people aboard sustained minor injuries, officials said.
   The accident occurred late Sunday as Flight 187 from Tucson,
Ariz., landed, and resulted in a 15-minute closure of the airport,
authorities said.
   The extent of damage to the Boeing 727 was not determined,
although there was no fire and no damage to the fuselage was
visible.
   The passengers used emergency chutes to evacuate, said airport
spokeswoman Margo Spellman.
   Afterward, two people complained of back pain and were taken
away by ambulance, Ms. Spellman said. One person received a bruised
knee and one a sprained ankle, she said.
   The airplane veered off a runway and came to a rest on a grassy
strip dividing Sea-Tac's two parallel runways, said police
spokesman John Eliadis.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were checking
to determine if the plane blew a tire upon landing or had struck
debris on the runway, officials said.
   ``It was a fairly normal flight until we landed,'' said Marlene
Davies, 52, of Kent, one of 75 passengers.
   ``I saw the white line and we kept going over it. And then I saw
smoke or dust or something,'' she said. ``I couldn't tell if it was
smoke or dust, but I wasn't waiting around to see.
   ``It was very scary.''
   She said the plane had been on the runway 5 to 10 seconds before
it veered off. She praised the flight's seven crew members for
quick action in getting the passengers off the plane.
   ``It seemed to me like about 30 seconds from the time we stopped
to the time the stewardess threw the door open and yelled to
evacuate,'' she said.
   The airport was closed to aircraft for about 15 minutes, but
re-opened with one runway, Eliadis said.
   Alaska Airlines officials were not immediately available for
comment.

   Prosecutors have reopened their investigation
into the murder of a 70-year-old woman who left most of her estate
to the ministry of Louisiana television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   McLennan County District Attorney Vic Feazell said Sunday that
his office renewed the investigation because of a reporter's new
information that could help him resolve what he called ``unanswered
questions'' about the December 1983 slaying.
   The inquiry into the murder of Ida Lee Baugh was not targeted at
Swaggart but could involve ``one or more individuals connected with
the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at that time,'' said Feazell.
   Ms. Baugh was found stabbed and beaten with a wheelchair
footstool and died later at a Waco hospital. Her husband, Maurice
Patrick Baugh, died of heart failure five days after her death.
   The couple, in their will, left all but 25 percent of their cash
only, not to exceed $25,000, to the Baton Rouge, La., television
minister.
   A Swaggart spokesman estimated the estate's size at between
$500,000 and $800,000.
   In April 1984, Jacqueline Euna Warren was convicted of murder in
the case and sentenced to 99 years in prison.
   Baugh's son contested the will, charging that associates of
Jimmy Swaggart ministries exercised ``undue influence'' on his
parents to change their will. Larry Neale Baugh said two men
working on behalf of Swaggart Ministries had recommended Ms. Warren
to take care of Mrs. Baugh.
   Larry Baugh later dropped his charges. A source familiar with
the case told the Waco Tribune-Herald a settlement was reached
between Baugh and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.
   A reporter for the National Enquirer approached Feazell with new
information he had developed independently, said the prosecutor,
adding that parts of it ``have been substantiated.''

   The Soviet Supreme Court today cleared the names
of three prominent old Bolsheviks, Lev Kamenev, Gregory Zinoviev
and Karl Radek, who died in the 1930s during the purges of Kremlin
dictator Josef V. Stalin.
   The court, said the government newspaper Izvestia, ``is
returning to these tragic figures their honor and their names'' as
part of the campaign to stimulate more open discussion of key
issues in Soviet political life and to dismantle the system created
by Stalin.
   The three men were as important in their time as Nikolai I.
Bukharin, an old Bolshevik rehabilitated in February. But
exonerating Bukharin was considered more crucial politically
because his economic theories were similar in key respects to
reforms being attempted by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The rehabilitation of Zinoviev, Kamenev and Radek, Izvestia made
clear, was meant to reassure Soviets they would not be punished for
expressing political views. Tumultuous discussion is forecast at a
nationwide Communist Party conference, starting June 28, which is
to debate proposals to expand the reforms.
   The persecution of the old Bolsheviks, said Izvestia, ``is an
urgent item for today.''
   ``We are learning democracy, mastering the rules of political
discussions, ``We are learning democracy, mastering the rules of
political discussions, also in a time of hard struggle,'' the
newspaper said in a long article on page three under the headline,
``A Return to Truth.''
   Zinoviev and Kamenev spent years in exile with Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin before he led the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
They were elected to the ruling bodies of the Bolshevik Party after
the revolution, and sided with Stalin against his arch-rival, Leon
Trotsky, after Lenin died in 1924.
   After Trotsky was forced into exile, Stalin turned on his former
allies, and Zinoviev and Kamenev were convicted of treason and
executed following a show trial in 1936.
   Radek was born in Poland, took part in the 1917 revolution, was
accused of siding with Trotsky and expelled from the party in 1927.
He was later rehabilitated, and edited Izvestia in the 1930s.
   He was tried again in 1937 and sent to a labor camp where he is
thought to have died.
   Trotsky was murdered in exile in 1940 in Mexico and has not been
rehabilitated.
   Izvestia, printing a detailed account of the purges and their
prelude, said that ``our predecessors, the people of the 20s, could
not control the situation ... and were burned up in the flames of
repression.''
   ``They preached intolerance toward the opinions of their
opponents and gave birth to physical and moral terror. And the
oppression of those who were left in the minority led to a
situation in which one man crushed the majority.''
   ``A lack of the very notion of personal opinion created that
wild `crowd syndrome', which sanctified any tyranny in the name of
the people.''
   ``In a word, discussion has been cut off for a long time about
the paths toward the building of socialism. It has been restored
now, more than a half century later, and from the same place; about
the paths of developing revolution, about the role of the party and
about the place, of `the ruler,'' or Vozhd in Russian. Stalin was
known as the ``Vozhd,'' or supreme leader.
   In reversing the decisions against Zinoviev, Kamenev and Radek,
Izvestia said, ``the Supreme Court, naturally, did not discuss the
`party face' of rehabilitated citizens, and did not evaluate
whether they were right or wrong in the old debates. But it said
clearly: they are innocent before the law, state, and people.''

<HEAD>Husband Of Tampa's Anti-Drug Mayor Defends Work For Convicted
Smuggler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The husband of this city's anti-drug
crusading mayor says there is nothing wrong with his handling
real-estate affairs for a convicted drug smuggler.
   Attorney Michael J. Freedman, husband of Mayor Sandy Freedman,
set up a corporation for convicted smuggler Kenneth M. Kiken in
1985 and served as the corporation's registered agent.
   Kiken, who was twice convicted on federal marijuana imporation
charges in 1974, is awaiting trial in U.S. District Court on new
drug charges in the attempted importation of 165,000 pounds of
marijuana in 1985.
   Freedman's former law partner, Arnold D. Levine, represented
Kiken after his 1974 convictions. Since then, Levine has been a
trustee for property Kiken owned in nearby Odessa, has arranged a
loan for Kiken and later handled the sale of the property, the St.
Petersburg Times reported Sunday.
   Freedman, a corporate and real estate lawyer, prepared financial
and legal documents that named Levine the trustee for the Odessa
property, and prepared the papers for the sale of the property.
   Both Levine and Freedman say they knew of Kiken's 1974
convictions, but said they were unaware of any activities alleged
in the latest indictment. Both defended their roles in helping
Kiken manage his business affairs.
   ``I don't see anything wrong with it,'' Freedman said in a
telephone interview Friday from Bermuda, where he and the mayor are
vacationing. ``Just as I have no hesitation in saying to you that
someone accused of criminal conduct is entitled to representation,
if an individual wants to buy a piece of property or set up a
corporation, I've never felt it appropriate to inquire whether it
was going to be for a legitimate purpose or if that person had some
ulterior motive.''
   Said Levine, ``It looked like the guy had turned legitimate and
was successful in that regard and there was no reason to question
it.''
   Mrs. Freedman, who has been mayor since July 1986, has made a
war against drugs one of the hallmarks of her administration. Last
month she announced ``Operation Crackdown,'' the bulldozing and
burning of 50 rundown buildings that attracted crack dealers.
   Mrs. Freedman said her husband would never knowingly represent a
drug smuggler in business transactions.
   ``My husband's integrity, his ability to tell right from wrong,
certainly makes me very confident that he's going to do the right
thing in every circumstance,'' she said from Bermuda on Friday.
   Kiken was arrested March 30. A federal indictment accuses him of
conspiracy and aiding and abetting the attempted importation of
165,000 pounds of marijuana aboard a barge in October 1985. The
load was worth an estimated $50 million.

   Scientists are observing the fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10's departure from the solar system today
as the spacecraft continues collecting data about the sun and
searching for a tenth planet.
   Signals from the 570-pound Pioneer _ slightly more than 4
billion miles away from Earth _ are scheduled to be transmitted
over telephone lines from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to the California Museum of Science and Industry in
Los Angeles.
   Officials from the museum and TRW Inc., the Redondo Beach
company that built the spacecraft, were to unveil a refurbished
engineering model of the probe to go on public display on Tuesday.
   Scientists assembled here at a NASA facility to outline
Pioneer's most recent accomplishments and celebrate the craft's
role as one of the United States' most successful space missions.
   Pioneer is the first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter and return
pictures, chart Jupiter's intense radiation belts, measure the mass
of Jupiter's four planet-sized moons, locate the giant planet's
magnetic field and discover Jupiter is primarily a liquid planet.
   It's expected to transmit information until its power source
diminishes toward the end of the 1990s.
   The spacecraft was launched March 2, 1972 from Florida and made
its closest approach to Jupiter _ 82,000 miles _ on Dec. 3, 1973
after traveling an arc-shaped 620-million-mile path from Earth.

   A convicted rapist whom outraged Californians
fought to keep out of their communities during his yearlong parole
there has come back to his hometown and registered with Florida
authorities today in Tampa.
   Lawrence Singleton gave his address to the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement to comply with a law requiring convicted felons
entering the state to register their address.
   ``He's met all the requirements of the statutes. As far as we're
concerned, we have no further involvement in this matter
whatsoever,'' said Jack Espinosa, spokesman for the Hillsborough
Sheriff's office.
   Sheriff's Col. Cal Henderson said Singleton received his Florida
driver's license last week.
   Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker,
chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead along a
roadside near San Francisco in 1978. The 60-year-old former
merchant seaman spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in a
California prison.
   His parole ended in April, and Singleton soon surfaced in the
Tampa area, where he grew up and still has family.
   Singleton's relocation to the Forest Hills section in northwest
Tampa has some area residents worried.
   ``We don't want that type of individual living here. We're
concerned about the young children and we're concerned about the
young girls living in the neighborhood,'' said Audrey Grimes, a

   The owner of the home listed as Singleton's address told The
Tampa Tribune, ``I don't know anything about it.''
   In California, residents mounted campaigns when their communites
were mentioned as possible homes during Singleton's parole. One
town even filed a lawsuit.
   Last year, Florida corrections officials refused a request from
California officials to supervise Singleton's parole while he
stayed with relatives in the Tampa area.

<HEAD>Exiled Lawyer Says South African Government Attempted His Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South African lawyer whose arm was blown off in
an April car-bomb explosion alleged Monday that the South African
government planted the bomb as part of a death campaign against
African National Congress members.
   South African officials denied it.
   Albie Sachs, 53, is a white member of the ANC, the main
guerrilla group fighting the South African government.
   The exiled attorney said the government was responsible for the
April 7 attack in the Mozambique capital of Maputo.
   ``It was an arm, almost certainly the military arm, of
Pretoria,'' said Sachs, who spoke in a television interview from an
undisclosed location in Britain.
   ``They've been doing it in many parts of the world. They've
threatened to kill ANC people wherever they might be anywhere in
the world,'' said Sachs, who looked ill as he spoke, with the stump
of his arm still bandaged. Sachs was also burned and his eye
injured in the explosion.
   ``They are the only people who have the possible motivation and
capacity for this kind of thing,'' he said.
   Independent Television, which carried the interview, said Sachs
was secretly flown to London for medical treatment after the
explosion, which blew apart his car. At the time of the blast,
Sachs was employed by the Mozambican Justice Ministry.
   The television station said Sachs has been living in Britain
under an assumed name.
   The South African Embassy in London denied government
responsibility for the attack.
   ``The ANC is on record as having advocated a policy of violence
... it's very possible this policy has extended to members of the
organization itself,'' said Minister Justus de Goede, the No. 2
diplomat at the embassy.
   The ANC is fighting to topple the South African government and
its policy of apartheid, under which the nation's 26 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control
the economy and dominate government.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   VACCINE
   
   The court ruled the government may be forced to pay damages when
a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices rejected Reagan administration
arguments that the government always should be shielded from
lawsuit in such cases.
   The case is Berkowitz vs. U.S., 87-498.
   
   SENTENCING
   
   The court agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new
sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes.
   At issue in the sentencing case is whether the U.S. Sentencing
Commission's rules that took effect Nov. 1 may stand or must be
thrown out. The validity of the commission itself is at stake, also.
   By the time the court announces its decision, expected sometime
in 1989, thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced _
regardless of which way the court rules.
   The case is U.S. vs. Mistretta, 87-1904.
   
   POLICE AUTHORITY
   
   The court armed police with new authority, ruling that officers
sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the sight of them
even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct.
   It unanimously ruled that Michigan prosecutors may use as
evidence the drugs dropped by a man who started running when he
spotted a police cruiser on a Detroit street.
   The case is Michigan vs. Chesternut, 86-1824.
   
   RACIAL DESEGREGATION
   
   The court declined to study an unprecedented
racial-desegregation case, refusing to free Yonkers, N.Y.,
officials from having to integrate city schools and build
subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that Yonkers
must build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of
the city and create ``magnet'' schools to reduce segregation.
   The cases are Yonkers Board of Education vs. U.S., 87-1632, and
Yonkers vs. U.S., 87-1686.
   
   FRAUD
   
   The court agreed to decide whether the government may use a 19th
Century anti-fraud law to impose stiff civil fines on top of
criminal penalties for the same offense.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Reagan administration
officials seeking to fine the manager of a New York medical
laboratory $131,170 for defrauding the government of $585 on
Medicare bills.
   The case is U.S. vs. Halper, 87-1383.
   
   POSTAL SERVICE
   
   _ The court ruled that the Postal Service is similar to a
private business and said the service must pay interest on back pay
owed to a worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal
discrimination.
   By a 5-3 vote, the court ordered interest on back pay for a
letter carrier in Chesterfield, Mo., who was fired and later
ordered rehired.
   The case is Loeffler vs. Frank, 86-1431.
   
   DIRECT MAIL
   
   The court barred states from banning all direct mail
advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled in a Kentucky case that states
violate free-speech rights when prohibiting lawyers from soliciting
business by sending truthful and non-deceptive letters to people
they know face particular legal problems.
   The case is Shapero vs. Kentucky Bar Association, 87-16.
   
   DUPONT-LAROUCHE
   
   The court rejected the appeal of a DuPont family fortune heir
declared mentally incompetent after he loaned $212,000 to a group
linked to political extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that control of
Lewis duPont Smith's $8 million estate properly was taken from him
in 1985 under Pennsylvania's guardianship law.
   The case is Smith vs. Smith, 87-1753.
   
   HUMANIST
   
   The court turned down the appeal of a philosophy professor
denied an opportunity to address Congress about secular humanism
during the lawmakers' daily moments of opening prayer.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to hear arguments
that the professor's rights were violated.
   The case is Kurtz vs. Baker, 87-1581.
   
   CHILD SUPPORT
   
   The court told Wisconsin's highest court to restudy the case of
a teen-ager born out of wedlock who says she should be allowed to
seek support payments from her father's estate.
   The justices said the Wisconsin Supreme Court should review its
ruling that a $4,600 settlement between Heather Jo Krueger's
parents after she was born bars her from seeking any additional
money.
   The case is Gernardt vs. Moore, 87-1103.
   
   ANTITRUST LAW
   
   The court ruled that companies may violate antitrust law when
they lobby private organizations that play a prominent role in
influencing business legislation.
   The 7-2 decision upheld a $11.4 million jury award against a
company accused of ``packing'' a meeting of the National Fire
Protection Association when the organization adopted a safety code
for electrical wiring.
   The case is Allied Tube vs. Indian Head, 87-157.
   
   EXTRADITION
   
   People extradited from foreign countries to face criminal
charges here cannot avoid defending themselves against related
civil lawsuits filed in U.S. courts, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices ruled unanimously against Wilfried van
Cauwenberghe, a Belgian citizen who is trying to avoid having to
defend himself against a $19 million lawsuit in California.
   The case is Van Cauwenberghe vs. Biard, 87-336.

   Louisiana's Supreme Court and a federal
appeals court both refused today to stop Tuesday morning's
scheduled execution of convicted murderer Edward Byrne Jr.
   The decisions were released as Byrne, his attorneys and
prosecutors gathered at the state prison in Angola for a hearing
before Louisiana's newly appointed Pardon Board on Byrne's pleas
for a reduced sentence of life in prison. Gov. Buddy Roemer,
however, has the final say.
   Byrne is scheduled to die in the electric chair at the state
prison in Angola between 12:01 and 3 a.m. Tuesday. If he's executed
Tuesday, it would be the 100th execution nationwide since capital
punishment was reinstituted more than 10 years ago.
   The state Supreme Court gave no reason for its unanimous denial
of Byrne's appeal. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, in a
12-page opinion, denied Byrne's petition for a stay of execution.
The petition claimed the execution would be unconstitutional
because it failed to give Byrne 60 days to appeal an earlier
decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Officials at the 5th Circuit offices in New Orleans said another
Byrne appeal was pending there. Byrne's attorneys were expected to
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if that appeal failed.
   Byrne, 28, was condemned for killing Roberta Johnson, who he
said he began dating because he planned to rob the Bossier City gas
station where she was manager. She was fatally bludgeoned with a
ballpeen hammer on Aug. 14, 1984, as she prepared to take more than
$7,000 to the bank.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan called today for ``a joint
venture'' between the United States and other industrialized
democracies to strengthen economic policy coordination, open more
markets and ease the debt burden of poorer nations.
   Previewing the points he will push at the seven-nation economic
summit commencing Sunday in Toronto, Reagan also said that finding
``a common offensive'' against money laundering and drug
trafficking is of utmost importance.
   In a speech prepared to the Atlantic Council, a group that makes
policy recommendations on the development of democracies around the
world, the president also said there should be greater efforts to
restore the economies of the Philippines and Afghanistan.
   Reagan used much of his speech to extoll the virtues of his own
economic policy of lowering tax rates, easing government regulation
and otherwise encouraging U.S. business investment, and said he
believes that many of the other industrialized democracies have
begun to follow the U.S. pattern.
   ``This new consensus (on economic growth strategy) has not only
brought the economies of America, Britain, Canada and so many other
countries roaring back,'' he said, ``it also has opened the way for
coordination of economic policy among the summit countries that
would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.''
   Reagan will join the leaders of Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy and Japan at the economic summit in Toronto. In his
speech today, the president made it clear he thinks the summit
partners should move with greater speed on the question of
agricultural subsidies. The summit runs from Sunday through Tuesday
and will be Reagan's last.
   ``In no field do we have more weeding to do than agriculture,
where subsidies cost the consumers and the taxpayers of Europe,
North America and Japan $200 billion a year,'' he said. The
president noted that agriculture has been a principal item on the
agenda of the so-called ``Uruguay Round'' of trade talks, but said
not enough has been accomplished there.
   ``Those talks were scheduled to go for four years. They are now
nearing the half-way point,'' he said. ``It's time to narrow down
and lay out specific goals, a road map and a timetable to the
finish line.
   ``In Toronto, we, the heads of the major industrial states, can
push our ministers to have that job completed by year's end. No
excuses.''

   The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide
the fate of a new sentencing system for federal crimes that some
judges have refused to adopt.
   At issue are U.S. Sentencing Commission rules that took effect
Nov. 1. The validity of the commission itself likely is at stake
also, and a decision is expected sometime in 1989.
   More than 50 federal trial judges have refused to use the new
sentencing rules, declaring them or the commission
unconstitutional. But dozens of their colleagues have imposed
sentences under the new rules.
   The Reagan administration, citing the ``intolerable
uncertainty'' caused by the conflicing rulings, urged the justices
to resolve the issue even before any federal appeals court has
ruled on it.
   Today, the justices granted the administration's speeded-up
appeal.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the court's action pleased him.
   ``It is vitally important that these issues are resolved by the
court as quickly as possible,'' Thurmond said.
   By the time the court announces its decision in a test case from
Missouri, thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced _
regardless which way the court rules.
   If the justices uphold the system, those defendants sentenced by
judges who refused to apply the new rules will have to be
resentenced. If the justices invalidate the system, those
defendants sentenced under the new rules will have to be
resentenced.
   The commission estimates that by Jan. 1 more than 10,000 federal
court defendants will have been subjected to the new sentencing
system.
   The commission was created by Congress in the Sentencing Reform
Act of 1984, legislation aimed at eliminating disparities in
sentences.
   The law empowers the commission, with seven members appointed to
six-year terms by the the president, to tell federal judges what
sentences, within certain ranges, should be imposed for various
crimes. Three of the commission's members must be federal judges.
   The commission's rules _ called ``guidelines'' even though the
1984 law makes them binding on all federal judges _ eliminated
parole and curtailed credit for good behavior.
   Judges who have struck down the new sentencing system have ruled:
   _That Congress avoided political accountability by
unconstitutionally delegating its legislative power to the
commission.
   _That the commission, because it includes members of the
judiciary and holds legislative power, violates the Constitution's
separation of powers principles.
   _That the new rules violate defendants' due-process rights by
curbing too severely the sentencing discretion of judges.
   In urging the justices to uphold the sentencing commission's
authority, lawyers for the commission said the 1984 law ``reflects
a massive interbranch commitment to the creation of ... a major
improvement in the administration of justice.''
   The test case accepted for review stems from the prosecution of
John M. Mistretta, who pleaded guilty in federal court to
conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine after his arrest last
December in Kansas City, Mo.
   Before Mistretta's sentence was imposed, he challenged the new
sentencing rules. A trial judge dismissed the challenge, and
sentenced Mistretta to 18 months in prison, to be followed by a
three-year term of supervised release.
   Mistretta then appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, but Justice Department lawyers asked the Supreme Court to
decide the case while it is pending before the appeals court.

   The court refused to reinstate the conviction and five-year
prison sentence that a Texas court overturned after Crosby already

   The justices, without comment, let stand the ruling last
November by the state court that cocaine and a pistol confiscated

   Entertainer Frank Sinatra, stricken
with a mild bout of food poisoning that forced him to cancel an
AIDS benefit performance, was recuperating at his desert home, his
publicist said.
   ``He had a touch of food poisoning and he's returned home,''
spokeswoman Susan Reynolds said Monday. ``It was apparently
something he ate en route to Washington aboard a private jet.''
   The illness caused Sinatra to bow out of a performance Sunday
night. The $100-a-seat concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts featured Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Stevie
Wonder and Gladys Knight.
   Frank Sinatra Jr. told the audience his father had ``taken ill''

   It took Mel Fisher 16 years and $16
million to find his sunken Spanish treasure.
   Now some of the booty is going on the auction block at
Christie's in New York, as divers continue to comb the site and
preservationists painstakingly scrape centuries of marine crust off
the riches.
   ``This auction is particularly exciting because the pieces
recovered enhance knowledge of the New World,'' said Christie's
publicist Starr Collins.
   ``There's been a lot of public interest'' in the two-day sale
which begins Tuesday, she said.
   In July 1985, Fisher's crew found the vast mother lode of the
Nuestra Senora de Atocha, the richest of five Spanish galleons
dashed to the ocean floor about 40 miles west of the Florida Keys
by a hurricane in 1622.
   So far, the galleon has surrendered more than 4,000 emeralds,
150,000 gold and silver coins, fine jewelry and thousands of
ceramic pieces. Also dredged up were thousands of pieces of
salt-soaked wood, rusty navigational devices, muskets, tools, pots
and pans and other artifacts.
   More than 300,000 salvaged pieces of the ship or its cargo have
been logged in computer records. Each piece is tagged, drawn to
scale, cleaned of calcium and seashell deposits, catalogued, again
drawn to scale and photographed.
   The 389 lots to be auctioned this week belong to Fisher or
investors who received the treasures in return for their financial
backing. Among baubles up for bid are a 5{-foot gold chain valued
at $200,000, a $150,000-to-$200,000 silver-gilt wine cup and
jewelry salvaged from the Atocha or its sister ship, Santa
Margarita, also sunk in the 1622 hurricane.
   Fisher says he hopes to buy back some of the treasures for his
museum in this town at the tip of the Florida Keys.
   ``There's been a tremendous amount of paperwork'' since his crew
found the Atocha's treasure, said Fisher, 65, who oversees his
non-profit Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society Inc.
   Fisher began his search for the Atocha about 1970. The effort
was marked by financial troubles and court battles, and Fisher's
oldest son and daughter-in-law were killed when their tugboat
capsized during a 1975 search.
   In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the state of Florida's
bid to keep a quarter of the salvor's haul.
   Fisher estimates there are at least another $100 million worth
of artifacts from the Atocha remaining on the ocean floor.
   ``1985 was just the beginning. We're going to be working for
years and years. The stuff takes forever,'' says John McGarry,
executive director of the museum, which shares quarters with
Fisher's treasure restoration facility.
   The museum's $10 million displays, gleaned from the Atocha,
Margarita and from a British slaving ship found during the quest
for Spanish treasure, range from dishes to gold bars to a $1.13
million gold necklace studded with diamonds, rubies and pearls.
   But Fisher isn't content to count his Spanish treasure.
   The former California dive-shop operator now dreams of building
Treasure Island, a $140 million resort and research complex in the
Caribbean.
   The government of Antigua has agreed to a 99-year lease on its
isle of Barbuda, where Fisher plans to build a 400-unit hotel, a
treasure museum, preservation facilities and an underwater
restaurant.
   After a year of exploring the area, his crews have found an
unidentified shipwreck and the bones of a British vessel.
   ``It'll never end,'' said Fisher's son, Kim, a treasure hunter
since age 9 and one of the divers combing the Atocha site. ``I'm
going to go out tomorrow and find more stuff for them to clean up.''

<HEAD>Shultz Warns of Buildup in Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed
concern today about the introduction of advanced missiles into the
Persian Gulf war, saying that countries far removed from the
conflict may be put at risk.
   Shultz said use of these advanced missiles in the Iran-Iraq war
has led to the ``indiscriminate slaughter'' of civilians and made a
peace settlment more difficult.
   ``We are already seeing signs of a dangerous new arms race which
will put at risk countries far removed from the gulf region
itself,'' he said.
   Shultz's remarks were prepared for a special U.N. session on
disarmament at U.N. headquarters in New York.
   Shultz also said the United States considers nuclear
proliferation the most important item of the U.N. session.
   ``Does anyone doubt that the spread of nuclear weapons threatens
regional and global security?'' Shultz said. ``What state believes
that, if it now acquired nuclear weapons, its rivals would not do
the same?''
   He said that at the moment that the United States and the Soviet
Union have agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals, ``it would be
tragic for other countries to pursue the capability to cross the
nuclear threshhold.''
   Apparently alluding to India and Pakistan, Shultz said South
Asia is the area of greatest danger.
   ``We encourage the states of South Asia to take concrete steps
to meet this urgent challenge. The U.S. is prepared to work with
countries inside and outide the region to find a lasting solution
to the danger of proliferation that satisfies all parties,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Gerardus Wiarda, a Dutch jurist
who was president of the European Court for Human Rights, died at
his home here, a relative said Monday. He was 81.
   The cause of his death Saturday was not immediately available,
but Wiarda had been in ill health over the past few years, the
relative said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Born in Amsterdam in 1906, Wiarda finished his legal studies at
Amsterdam's Municipal University in 1929.
   After practicing law in Rotterdam and serving as a judge at
Amsterdam's district court, Wiarda was appointed a member of the
Dutch Supreme Court, the highest in the land, in 1950.
   During his 26-year tenure there, the last four of which he
served as the court's president, Wiarda earned a reputation of a
progressive in social and judicial issues.
   After his retirement from the bench in 1976, he was appointed as
a judge at the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg. In
1981, he was named president of the 18-member human rights panel
for the 21-nation Council of Europe.

<HEAD>Bush Denounces South Africa as ``Racist State''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush denounced the
government of South Africa on Monday as a ``racist state,'' using
the strongest language yet of any high Reagan administration
official toward the apartheid regime.
   His remark, which came a day after Democratic platform writers
agreed to castigate South Africa as a ``terrorist state'' in their
1988 party document, seemed calculated to put distance between Bush
and administration policies on the subject.
   However, Bush, like President Reagan, said he does not favor
breaking diplomatic ties with Pretoria.
   It was the second day in a row that Bush sought to highlight his
views on civil rights issues.
   In a speech Sunday at predominently black Central State
University in Wilberforce, Ohio, Bush said he would campaign for a
``positive civil rights agenda'' and suggested that his priorities
would be different from those of the administration _ including
more federal support for minority businesses and more assistance
for the disadvantaged.
   Bush, talking Monday to reporters in the Executive Office
Building adjacent to the White House, was asked if he agreed with
the Democrats' decision to brand South Africa a terrorist state, a
characterization sought by defeated Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson.
   ``I think it's a racist state, regrettably, and I think we ought
to do what we can by staying engaged and trying to figure if the
U.S. can use its moral influence to change that situation,'' Bush
replied.
   ``I don't favor breaking diplomatic relations,'' he said.
   The Democrats, who held a platform-drafting session over the
weekend in Mackinac Island, Mich., have not indicated whether they
would seek to break relations with South Africa.
   In the past, Reagan has said he personally considered the system
of apartheid, or white minority rule, in South Africa ``repugnant.''
   But the president initially resisted imposing economic sanctions
on that nation, going along with the sanctions only after they won
wide bipartisan support in Congress.
   On Monday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration disagreed with the description of South Africa as a
terrorist state.
   ``We believe the best way to influence policy in South Africa is
to stay engaged,'' Fitzwater said. He briefed reporters at the same
time that Bush was answering questions, and the subject of Bush's
comments did not come up.
   Bush, who is spending this week in Washington and has no
campaign appearances planned, met with reporters to announce the
naming of two senior aides, James Lake as communications consultant
and Sheila Tate as campaign press secretary.
   Lake, a Washington political consultant, was the campaign
spokesman for the Reagan-Bush ticket in 1984. Ms. Tate is a former
spokeswoman for Nancy Reagan.
   After announcing the appointments, Bush stayed on to answer a
wide range of questions and even joked that he had offered a spot
on his ticket to Jackson, whose Democratic vice presidential
thoughts have been a hot topic.
   ``I saw Jesse the other day. ... I said, `Jesse, I don't think
you're going to make it on the Democratic ticket. Are you
interested?'''
   ``And he turned to his mother, and he said, `George Bush has
done a good job as vice president. I might keep him on.' And that's
all I know about the Jesse Jackson situation.''
   On possible Democratic platform fights, Bush said: ``That's
their problem. That's the problem of the Democrats. The issues,
regardless of what happens, are going to be so clear in the fall _
the differences _ that I think what I've got to do is do my part
... and not intervene in that Democratic convention process at
all.''
   ``I don't think it would be right for me to get involved in the
Democratic convention and to say what ought to be done about Jesse
Jackson. He ran a good race. He stayed in there. He came up when
there was a lot of feeling that he wasn't going to do as well as he
did, and I'll give credit for that,'' Bush added.
   Bush also said there were no immediate plans for Treasury
Secretary James Baker to join his campaign team. ``I'm comfortable
with the situation at present,'' Bush said. ``He and I have been
friends for so long. I see him a lot, so I'm getting the benefit of
his advice as it is.''
   Republican sources have said they expect Baker to join Bush's
campaign this summer. However, Baker, a longtime Bush supporter,
told The Associated Press in an interview on Friday that no
decision would be made at least until after the economic summit in
Toronto later this month.

<HEAD>Bill Would Require Athletes Be Told of Their Chances To Graduate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two basketball stars-turned-congressmen
introduced legislation Monday requiring colleges to give
prospective students athletes an idea how they'll fare in the
classroom as well as on the playing field.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., former
teammates on the New York Knicks professional basketball team,
introduced the ``Student Athlete Right-to-Know Act.''
   The law would require all colleges accepting federal financial
help to compile and report scholastic statistics regarding student
athletes.
   The data would be collected by the secretary of education and
made available to students and their parents for use in choosing a
school.
   Bradley and McMillen said the act is aimed at encouraging
high-school students to weigh academic standards, not just athletic
prospects, as they chart their futures.
   All too often, the ex-basketball players said, students pick a
college on the unrealistic hope that they're on their way to a
career in professional sports.
   But since very few students make it to the pros, picking a
college by its academic credentials makes more sense, according to
Bradley and McMillen.
   ``Most people don't get that ticket to the pros,'' said Bradley,
who attended Princeton University on an academic scholarship.
   He and McMillen acknowledged the bill would do little to address
abuses by college athletic recruiters, or to stop colleges from
holding athletes to lower academic standards than other students.
   But, McMillen said, the measure would assist students trying to
make well-rounded judgments about their educations.
   ``The idea here is to provide a snapshot ... a balance sheet of
the university's academic picture,'' said McMillen, a graduate of
the University of Maryland.
   The act would require schools to report graduation rates for all
students with academic scholarships, broken down by sport, sex and
race. The education secretary would be required to publish the
information.
   The law also would require students to acknowledge reviewing a
school's academic data before signing a letter of intent to enroll.
   Rep. Ed Towns, D-N.Y., a co-sponsor of the legislation, said,
``If we can have reporting as to the on-time arrivals of airlines,
surely we a can let student athletes know whether they are likely
to receive a useful college degree.''

   General Nutrition Corp., the national health
food chain, has agreed to pay $600,000 to three health research
groups to settle allegations that it made false claims for diet
supplements, the Federal Trade Commission announced Monday.
   Under terms of a consent agreement, GNC agreed to the payment to
be divided equally among the American Diabetes Association,
American Cancer Society and American Heart Association, the FTC
reported.
   The agreement settles charges brought in 1984 that GNC falsely
claimed its Healthy Greens diet supplement was effective in
reducing the risk of cancer, and that other food supplements would
promote weight loss, help muscle growth and retard aging, according
to the trade commission.
   GNC, based in Pittsburgh, operates some 1,100 stores across the
nation selling health food products and various vitamin and mineral
supplements. It had sales of more than $300 million in 1986.
   The $600,000 payment for health research is in lieu of paying
redress to consumers in the case, the FTC reported. In signing the
consent order, GNC did not acknowledge wrongdoing.
   Healthy Greens, pills containing vitamins, minerals and
dehydrated vegetables, are no longer sold by the company, the FTC
noted.

   A faculty panel at Georgia Southwestern
College has recommended that a white professor accused of making a
racist remark to a black female student be reinstated but be barred
from teaching freshmen.
   The recommendation is not binding on the president.
   The five-member panel, which included four whites and one black,
unanimously cleared Allen Towery of three charges of violating
state Board of Regents policy, said Towery's attorney, Eugene Black
Jr.
   Towery, an English professor, also was cleared by a 4-1 vote on
a fourth policy-violation charge, involving the racial comment;
Jacqueline Willis, the only black on the panel, dissented on that
vote, Black said Sunday.
   The panel, however, recommended that Towery not be assigned to
teach freshman classes, Black said. The student involved in the
case was a freshman.
   ``I feel that we were vindicated,'' the attorney said.
   Towery, who has taught at the school for 18 years, declined to
comment.
   Clifton Baxter, the professor of business who was chairman of
the panel, said the group deliberated about 20 hours Thursday and
Friday before completing its report to Georgia Southwestern College
President William H. Capitan.
   Baxter declined to discuss its contents.
   College spokeswoman Patty Plotnick said Capitan postponed a
scheduled trip to Asia so he can review the report.
   Black, who received a copy of the report Sunday, said the panel
found Towery innocent of immoral and obscene conduct, default of
academic integrity and failure to carry out assigned
responsibilities to students.
   Ms. Willis dissented from the panel's fourth finding that Towery
was innocent of racial or sexual harassment, Black said.
   The case was initiated after freshman Ginevra Dennis, 18, of
Atlanta, said Towery called her ``a black bitch.''
   Testimony at the hearing showed the comment was made after she
demanded a ``withdrawn passing'' grade from Towery's freshman
English class. She was failing with only two weeks left in the
class.
   Capitan suspended Towery with pay March 11, four days after Miss
Dennis' complaint.

<TEXT>
   The House completed congressional action
Monday on legislation to set efficiency standards for fluorescent
lamp ballasts, a move proponents say can produce energy savings
equal to seven large power plants.
   The bill covering the ballasts that start and operate
fluorescent lights was given voice-vote approval and sent to the
White House, where it is being opposed as unnecessary.
   The measure is an amendment to the 1987 law that required
efficiency standards for a variety of large household appliances.
The administration also opposed that legislation, but President
Reagan signed it following its overwhelming approval by Congress.
   The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy estimates
that with at least 50 million fluorescent ballasts sold annually,
more efficient units could save 7,000 megawatts of electricity by
the year 2000 along with $11 billion in lower lighting costs to
consumers.
   The president's Office of Management and Budget said many
ballasts already meet the proposed standards and the bill would
impose unnecessary burdens on industry and force consumers to pay
more for ballasts.
   The bill and the 1987 law resulted from a coalition of energy
conservation advocates and electrical and appliance manufacturers,
who began backing national standards after a handful of states
began setting their own.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday opened lines of
communication with the Vatican in his first meeting with a top
Roman Catholic official, but both sides said a papal visit and
diplomatic relations are not imminent.
   Asked by reporters about a possible visit to the Soviet Union by
Pope John Paul II, the Soviet leader said, ``For that, a lot still
has to happen.''
   Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican's secretary of state,
told reporters his meeting with Gorbachev was ``warm'' and
``friendly.''
   But Casaroli added: ``We have not arrived at the point of
speaking about diplomatic relations of any sort. ... The question
of any invitation to the Holy Father was not raised.''
   He said that as a result of his meeting with the Soviet leader,
``we can raise questions about the life of Catholics, which was
difficult before because there were no direct contacts. This
possibility has opened up.''
   He did not say how the contacts would be maintained.
   Casaroli said statements by Soviet officials about allowing
greater religious liberty are important, especially if the Soviet
Union intends to allow believers to express their beliefs openly
instead of merely allowing them ``internal freedom of conscience.''
   Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, head of the Vatican's Secretariat
for Christian Unity, said Soviet officials appeared more willing to
recognize that there are religious groups in their country ``with a
point of reference outside the Soviet Union.''
   The Russian Orthodox Church and most other religious groups
recognized by Soviet authorities are based in the Soviet Union,
making it easier for the Kremlin to control them.
   Strict laws prohibit religious groups from doing charitable
work, require them to be registered with the government and sharply
restrict religious education. Officials say the laws are being
rewritten to reflect Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet society.
   Casaroli, leading a Vatican delegation at celebrations of the
Russian Orthodox Church's 1,000th anniversary, carried a letter
from John Paul to Gorbachev.
   Casaroli said the pontiff expressed the desire in his letter for
regular contacts with the Soviet government. The Vatican also
expressed in general terms its concern over the naming of bishops
and the establishment of a seminary for Ukrainian Catholics.
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church was forcibly integrated into the
Russian Orthodox Church in 1946 by Josef V. Stalin but has survived
underground since. It has not been recognized by authorities and
therefore is illegal.
   Casaroli and Willebrands met last Friday with five bishops and
priests of the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   Russian Orthodox Church officials, who are opposed to official
recognition of the Ukrainian church, have said they will discuss
this with Vatican representatives later this month.
   Gorbachev and Casaroli shook hands in the meeting room in the
Council of Ministers building in the Kremlin and then sat down at a
table with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and interpreters.
   They did not discuss the letter before reporters, who were
present for the first couple of minutes of their meeting.
   Instead, Gorbachev asked if Casaroli had been cold in Moscow.
The cardinal said he knew what kind of weather to expect since he
had been to the Soviet capital in 1971. Gorbachev said he had been
to Sicily.
   Vatican officials told reporters that Gorbachev read a Russian
translation of the papal letter during the meeting.
   Members of the Vatican delegation, the highest ever to visit the
Soviet Union, will travel to Kiev, Leningrad and Vladimir this week
for continued celebrations of Christianity's anniversary.

<HEAD>Reagan Calls For Effort To Rebuild Economies Of Afghnistan,
Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, sketching his agenda for the
seven-nation summit in Toronto, called Monday for a joint effort to
restore the battered economies of Afghanistan and the Philippines
and an international crackdown on money laundering from illegal
drugs.
   Reagan also said he would prod world leaders to complete
negotiations by the end of the year to cut back on agricultural
subsidies, which cost an estimated $200 billion a year in Europe,
North America and Japan.
   ``It's time that we in the summit nations forget about quitting
time and join in a great `venture to progress' _ a joint venture
that opens the international marketplace and that also strengthens
the weak links in the international economy,'' Reagan said in a
speech at the State Department to the Atlantic Council, a private
group dealing with foreign policy.
   On Sunday, Reagan will fly to Toronto for his eighth and final
summit with the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Canada,
Japan and Italy. Billed as an economic summit, the meetings
invariably focus heavily on political issues, as well.
   With a presidential election in the United States and Wall
Street still skittish after last October's collapse, the summiteers
are expected to steer clear of controversies and emphasize areas of
agreement.
   Reagan proposed that the summit nations ``join together to help
restore the economies of two countries: one, the Philippines, a
heroic democracy ravaged by communist-led insurrection; the other,
Afghanistan, a victim of brutal aggression.''
   He did not offer any specific proposals.
   The administration has been talking with congressional leaders _
as well as with officials in Asia and Europe _ about the
desirability of a multi-year assistance program for the
Philippines, as well as a program to stimulate trade and investment
there. The amount of funding and details of the program have not
been decided.
   For Afghanistan, the administration has earmarked $119 million
for resettlement of Afghan refugees.
   In his speech, Reagan also proposed a joint effort to help
countries of sub-Saharan Africa work out their debt problems. ```We
will take up their problems, as we have those of other debtor
nations, on a case-by-case basis, working to help develop economic
policies that promote growth and opportunity,'' he said.
   Reagan said the summit nations also should ``join together to
attack the lifeblood of one trade that should never be part of
international trade, the international narcotics trade.
   ``At this summit, we should join in a common offensive against
money laundering and the flow of drug profits through the world's
financial institutions,'' the president said. He did not spell out
how he would attack the problem.
   On the economic front, Reagan extolled the virtues of his own
policies, saying the United States had led the way in persuading
other countries to cut tax rates, sell off state-owned industries
and cut back on regulations.
   ``Starting with the United States,'' Reagan said, ``the summit
countries have had nearly six years of uninterrupted growth. I'd
like to make it 60 and more.''
   He said that, ``In no field do we have more weeding to do than
agriculture, where subsidies cost the consumers and the taxpayers
of Europe, North America and Japan $200 billion a year.'' The
president noted that agriculture has been a principal item on the
agenda of the so-called ``Uruguay Round'' of trade talks, but said
not enough has been accomplished there.
   ``Those talks were scheduled to go for four years. They are now
nearing the half-way point,'' he said. ``It's time to narrow down
and lay out specific goals, a road map, and a timetable to the
finish line.
   ``In Toronto, we, the heads of the major industrial states, can
push our ministers to have that job completed by year's end. No
excuses.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three out of five voters favor a massive $2.5
billion expansion of federal aid for child care, according to a
poll released Monday by two leading proponents of the legislation.
   Of the 901 voters sampled in the nationwide telephone survey, 60
percent said they favored the Act for Better Child Care proposal of
Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and
32 percent said they opposed it.
   The survey by Marttila & Kiley Inc. of Boston was conducted from
May 31 through June 5 and carried a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points.
   The poll was commissioned by the Children's Defense Fund and the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, two
of the leading lobbying forces behind the Dodd-Kildee bill.
   Three-fourths of the money in the legislation would provide new
child care subsidies to families making up to 115 percent of a
state's median income. Federal aid for child care through tax
credits and grants currently totals some $6.9 billion a year.
   Business groups and the Reagan administration oppose the
Dodd-Kildee bill and have united behind a smaller $375 million

   Duchess the lioness is lovesick and she's
not trying to keep it a secret.
   Duchess lives with her owner, Glenda York, and Ms. York's dog,
two cats and two cockatoos west of Rathdrum in northern Idaho.
   Betty Jergensen started complaining about her 2-year-old
``neighbor'' Duchess when the 300-pound African lioness went into
heat recently.
   ``It roared practically 24 hours a day for 10 days,'' Ms.
Jergensen said. ``It roared morning, noon and night. I plan on
selling my property pretty soon, and I don't want to have the damn
thing roaring in the background when I show the house.
   ``What am I supposed to do, say `Oh, it's just the neighbor's
African Lion?'''
   Ms. York, who plans to take the above-ground swimming pool out
of her back yard and build an even larger pen for the lioness, says
Duchess is safely and happily caged.
   The cat eats about seven pounds of raw chicken a day, although
sometimes Ms. York is able to get horses carcasses from
veterinarians to feed Duchess. One of Ms. York's other neighbors,
Mike Richards, said the noise of Ms. Jergensen's chickens bothered
him more than the lioness's roars.
   Ms. Jergensen says she has called everyone she can think of,
from fish and game officials to the Kootenai County sheriff to
Idaho politicians. However, unless the cat is a roadside
attraction, there are no laws that regulate it, she said.
   ``There's nothing in the law that prevents you from having an
exotic animal in your back yard,'' said Ms. Jergensen. ``I could
have an elephant in my back yard tomorrow, and there isn't a thing
anyone could do about it.''

boy set ablaze by a vengeful father.
   ``She was thrilled to get this role. The script was spectacular.
She just couldn't resist,'' Richard Grant, publicist for the
actress, said Monday.
   The ABC-TV movie ``David'' features Miss Peters as the
bewildered but courageous mother of the boy. The youngster survives
the motel room fire, but emerges horribly scarred.
   Miss Peters begins rehearsals later this month and filming

   The House on Monday passed legislation to
require the U.S. Geological Survey to study the impact of
geothermal development on Yellowstone National Park, home of the
nation's most famous geothermal sight, the Old Faithful geyser.
   The provision, in a bill sent to the Senate by voice vote, is a
response to complaints from conservationists that proposals to tap
underground steam deposits near the park could disrupt Old Faithful
and other geothermal features.
   The bill would amend a 1970 law that permits the government to
lease land to people trying to convert geothermal steam into
electricity. The bill would extend beyond 15 years the amount of
time a leaseholder has to develop a project.

   Millions of dollars in corporate ``soft
money'' is pouring into the political system through state entities
that can accept big donations that are banned on the federal level,
a private group said Monday.
   The Center for Responsive Politics complained there is no way of
knowing whether the money quietly finds its way into congressional
and presidential elections, where spending is strictly limited
under the Federal Election Commission.
   Federal law prohibits any corporate or union money in federal
campaigns, and limits individuals' contributions to $1,000 per
candidate. But many states have no limits on individual
contributions and permit labor and corporate contributions to state
parties.
   The state party then can spend the money on voter outreach
efforts, such as voter registration and state conventions, that can
end up helping candidates for president or Congress as well. Such
funds are known as soft money.
   The Center For Responsive Politics, a non-profit, bipartisan
group, said it could document $3.3 million in soft money
contributions from corporations during the 1985-86 election season
in five states.
   ``There is currently no way to precisely determine the extent to
which soft money is in fact being used to finance federal as
opposed to state activities,'' the report said.
   Most of nearly 1,700 soft money contributions disclosed were
from corporations. Fewer than 10 were from labor unons, and those
donations were in the $100 to $200 range, the study said.
   It listed top givers as American Continental Corp. of Phoenix,
which gave $85,000 to the California Democratic Party in 1986, and
Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles, which gave a total of
$89,000 to the state Democratic and Republican parties.
   The largest individual contribution identified by the center was
from Charles Keating, chairman of the board of American
Continental, who gave $100,000 to the Florida GOP.
   According to public records cited by the center: In Colorado,
the top-dollar donor was CCS Automation systems, Inc. which gave
$30,000 to the Republicans; in Florida, S.W. Florida Enterprises,
Inc., which gave $20,000 to the Democrats; in Missouri, Bruce
Investment Co., which gave $34,082 to the Republicans, and in
Washington, Boeing Co., which gave a total of $42,700 to both
parties.
   The group said it was not accusing any corporation or labor
union of illegality, since such contributions are legal in the
states studied, but it said there is a potential for abuse.
   Soft money is not required by law to be reported at the federal
level. And only some states have strict reporting requirements.
   ``We have no idea how the soft money is mixed with the hard
money,'' said Ellen Miller, the group's executive director. ``We do
not know for what purpose the moeny was given or how it was used.''
   ``It gives individuals and corporations and labor unions one
more avenue to flex their muscle with candiates and parties.''
   Noting that FEC reports document nearly a billion dollars in
spending in congressional campaigns and presidential races, Miller
said, ``Lying just below the surface are untold millions of
additional dollars unaccounted for by the FEC.''
   For this year's presidential election, each national political
party plans to raise soft money to augment the maximum $8 million
it is allowed to spend to elect its nominee. In addition to the
party expenditure, each candidate gets $46 million from the federal
Treasury to wage his campaign.
   The finance chairman for likely Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis says he wants to raise $42 million in soft money for the
fall campaign.
   Based on reports filed with the five states involved in the new
study _ California, Colorado, Florida, Missouri and Washington _
the center identified the following amounts in corporate
contributions to state parties in 1985-86:
   California: Republicans, $808,290; Democrats, $295,389.
   Colorado: Republicans, $645,888; Democrats, $71,050.
   Florida: Republicans, $466,445; Democrats, $458,258.
   Missouri: Republicans, $369,482; Democrats, $22,400.
   Washington: Republicans, $129,776; Democrats, $31,250.
   The center's report noted that McDonald's heir Joan Kroc gave $1
million to the Democratic National Committee a few months ago. At
most, $20,000 of that could be used on federal elections under the
law, meaning at least $980,000 would go into the DNC's soft-money
accounts.
   The report also noted published reports of gifts to the
Republican National Committee of $150,000 from Texas developer
Trammell Crow, $127,600 from Phillip Morris Corp. and $124,000 from
Atlantic Richfield.
   Soft money also can go into national party funds for
construction of party buildings. The report said the Democrats got
$50,000 from the painters' union, $10,000 from the United Auto
Workers and $5,000 from the machinists' union for its building fund.
   It cited contributions to the Republican National Committee fund
of $40,000 from Bethlehem Steel and $24,120 from Drexel, Burnham,
Lambert.

   Israeli and Palestinian intellectuals signed a
``peace treaty'' in a symbolic ceremony Monday after months of
arguments and said their example shows that gaps between the two
sides can be bridged.
   ``If clods like us, who are not always very good at taking
action, can do it, so can politicians,'' said one of the
signatories, Israeli poet Natan Zach.
   They said the agreement, written in Hebrew, Arabic and English,
was the first of its kind to be negotiated by Israelis and
Palestinians.
   It was signed by about 25 Israeli and Palestinian authors and
artists during a news conference. Foreign reporters far outnumbered
Israeli and Palestinian journalists.
   ``The agreement was reached after many arguments,'' said Nissim
Kalderon, an Israeli poet. ``After 40 years of war and brutality,
there is bitterness on both sides and demands on both sides that
the other finds hard to cope with.''
   The pact calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state, to
be called Falastin, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. ``Falastin'' is how the word ``Palestine'' sounds in Arabic.
   Jerusalem, a key point of dispute, would be demilitarized and
serve as the capital of both states. Israel and Falastin would
recognize each other's right to live in peace and security.
   The signatories are members of the Israeli and Palestinian
Writers, Artists and Academics Committee Against Occupation, the
only professional group that includes both Israelis and
Palestinians from the occupied territories.
   Most of the Jewish members are left-wing activists.
   Zach, for example, recently canceled the International Poetry
Festival, which was to be held in Israel this month, to protest the
army crackdown on the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands.
   Asad el Asad, head of the Palestinian Writers Association in the
occupied territories, said the Palestine Liberation Organization
favored the terms of the treaty. ``We feel we are transmitting
clearly and honestly the message of our representatives, the PLO,''
Asad said.
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, saying it is a
terrorist organization. The PLO covenant calls for the destruction
of the Jewish state, and the PLO has refused to accept
unconditionally U.N. resolutions guaranteeing Israel's right to
secure borders.
   Zach said the group would now seek the signatures of additional
intellectuals in Israel and the occupied territories.

   About three of every 1,000 patients at
six U.S. hospitals are infected with the AIDS virus, but it has not
spread extensively in the past year, according to a study released
Monday.
   It indicated the infection rate among hospital patients is about
five times higher than that among military recruits from the same
cities but has not changed over the first 15 months of the study.
   ``The importance is that there has been a slowing in the rate of
new infection,'' said Dr. Timothy J. Dondero. ``The stable rate
means it is not exploding.''
   Dondero, a researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, heads the study program called the U.S. Sentinal Hospital
Surveillance Network.
   He said the infection rate seen at the six hospitals, four of
them in the Midwest, probably is lower than the rate nationwide.
   If the rate at the hospitals were the same as the national
figure, that would mean about 700,000 Americans carry the AIDS
virus. The CDC officially estimates between 1 million and 1.5
million Americans are infected, and Dondero said he believes the
true figure ``is closer to 1 million.''
   Figures are based on anonymous blood testing of 18,809 hospital
patients.
   Excluded from the tests was anyone who might already have the
disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, including patients
hospitalized for infections or cancer. Many of those tested were in
the hospital for accidents, surgery or childbirth.
   The CDC plans to expand the program to 40 hospitals across the
country.
   Dr. George Grady, the Massachusetts state epidemiologist, said
the CDC study may have missed an increase in the infection rate
because it did not sample enough people and did not choose a truly
representative sample of the population.
   ``There is a feeling across the country that the infection rate
in gay men is stabilizing and that it is still going up in
intravenous drug users,'' he said.

   One or more people associated with Jimmy
Swaggart Ministries could be targets of a reopened investigation
into the slaying of a woman who left part of her estate to the
television evangelist's ministry.
   Vic Feazell, McLennan County district attorney, said Sunday his
office is re-examining Ida Lee Baugh's slaying in December 1983 and
that a National Enquirer reporter's new information could help him
resolve ``unanswered questions.''
   Feazell said the inquiry was not aimed at Swaggart but could
involve ``one or more individuals connected with the Jimmy Swaggart
Ministries at that time.''
   ``What we are looking into right now is the possibility of
violations of the Texas Penal Code that could include being a party
to murder,'' Feazell said.
   Jacqueline Euna Warren was convicted in April 1984 of murder in
the case and sentenced to 99 years in prison.
   Mrs. Baugh, 70, of McGregor, was found stabbed and beaten and
died later at a Waco hospital. Her husband, Maurice Patrick Baugh,
died of heart failure five days later.
   In their will, the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash,
not to exceed $25,000, to the ministry in Baton Rouge, La. A
Swaggart spokesman estimated the couple's total estate at between
$500,000 and $800,000.
   Baugh's son contested the will, charging that associates of
Jimmy Swaggart ministries exercised undue influence on his parents
to change their will.
   Larry Neale Baugh alleged that two men working on behalf of
Swaggart Ministries had recommended that Ms. Warren take care of
Mrs. Baugh.
   Later, Larry Baugh dropped his charges. The Waco Tribune-Herald
quoted a source familiar with the case as saying a settlement was
reached between Baugh and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.
   Feazell said a National Enquirer reporter approached him with
new information he had developed independently.
   ``The information was believeable and parts of it have been
substantiated,'' he said.
   Feazell said his office had investigated a possible connection
between the murder, the will and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries at the
time of Ms. Warren's trial.
   ``Lot of questions came to light in the spring of 1984 _
unanswered questions that weren't pursued,'' he said.
   ``I met with Jimmy Swaggart's attorneys at that time. After
meeting with him, I decided to take no further action,'' he said.
   Feazell said that ``as material becomes available, it could be
presented to the grand jury'' during the next few weeks. ``It might
be something we can wrap up rather quickly, or we could take a long
time with it.''

   Production of a vital oxidizer for the
fuel of the space shuttle booster rocket resumed Monday, five weeks
after the only other plant in the nation that made the chemical
blew up a mile away.
   Fire inspectors were on hand at the Kerr-McGee Corp. plant in
nearby Henderson when workers began filling vats with chemicals to
produce ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in the solid-fuel
shuttle boosters and some military rockets.
   Clark County Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the inspectors would be
at the plant until a dispute between the fire department and the
company over storage of the finished chemical product is resolved.
   ``It's like a fire watch,'' said Parrish. ``We're going to have
them out there 24 hours a day.''
   Parrish refused to rule out the possibility of legal action
against the company if it does not agree to fire department
recommendations that it store the chemical in smaller piles and
place the piles further apart than it currently does.
   County officials and a team of safety experts hired by
Kerr-McGee plan to meet Thursday to try and work out an agreement
on the storage issue.
   ``We will ask some very pointed questions,'' said Parrish.
``They're going to have to come up with some reasons why they
selected the way they did to store the product.''
   Plant spokeswoman Annita Bridges said workers will be on the job
in three shifts while the plant gears up to operate at its capacity
of 36 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate a year.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said last week that they had only enough fuel for eight shuttle
boosters, enough for four flights. Each set of boosters needs 1.7
million pounds of ammonium perchlorate mixed with its rubber-like
fuel.
   Kerr-McGee temporarily halted its production of ammonium
perchlorate after a series of thunderous explosions May 4 killed
two people, injured 326 and caused an estimated $73 million in
damage at the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. in Henderson.
   After a brief reopening the next week, production was halted
again under the threat of lawsuits by state and local officials
until an independent safety team could inspect the plant.
   Kerr-McGee agreed, among other things, to ship the chemical in
containers less susceptible to heat and shock, and reduce by 50
percent its supply of unfinished ammonium perchlorate.
   The cause of the Pacific Engineering blast is still under
investigation. Company officials have said the blast may have been
caused by a leaking natural gas line, but fire department sources
said the most likely cause was a spark that set off ammonium
perchlorate.
   Parrish said he would not speculate on when the department's
formal report fixing the cause of the explosions will be finished.

   An ex-sheriff who pleaded guilty to
buying the job from his predecessor for $100,000 was sentenced
Monday to seven years in a federal penitentiary.
   Former Mingo County Sheriff Charles E. ``Eddie'' Hilbert ``was
not motivated by personal greed or a lust for power,'' said
Hilbert's lawyer, John Cyrus. ``In a real sense (he was) a victim
of (a) corrupt system. ...
   ``The crimes he committed were those of a stupid man,'' Cyrus
told U.S. District Judge Charles Haden, adding that his client has
a ``low intelligence quotient (and is) only marginally literate.''
   Hilbert, 45, pleaded guilty in April to one count of mail fraud,
one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to buy the
sheriff's job from then-Sheriff Johnie Owens.
   In addition to sentencing Hilbert to five years on the
conspiracy count, Haden also ordered him to pay a $10,000 fine. In
addition, Hilbert was ordered to serve two years on the mail fraud
charge, which stemmed from a scheme to obtain backdated insurance
coverage for his son, who had been involved in a motorcycle acident.
   Hilbert also was sentenced to three years in prison on the tax
evasion charge, but Haden said that sentence would run concurrently
with his other terms.
   The former sheriff, who is scheduled to begin serving his
sentence on Aug. 11, had faced a maximum sentence of 13 years in
prison and a $350,000 fine. Under federal law he must serve a
minimum of one-third of the seven-year sentence before he will be
eligible for parole.
   Cyrus said Hilbert ``did not profit'' from his crimes, but
rather, ``Mr. Hilbert's crimes are ... more crimes of the heart.
   ``Eddie Hilbert is a weak man further weakened by alcoholism,''
Cyrus told Haden, who emphasized that Hilbert pleaded guilty to a
conspiracy count under the federal government's Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act.
   Hilbert told the judge that he was sorry for what he had done
and added that he had never taken a kickback or sold drugs to
anyone in Mingo County.
   Owens, who said he took the $100,000 from Hilbert and gave some
of the money to county commissioners to approve the arrangement, is
serving a 14-year federal prison sentence.
   Former County Commissioner Rastie Runyon Jr. is scheduled to
report to federal prison later this month for his role in the
scheme. The other two county commissioners at the time also are
under indictment.
   Haden on Monday also accepted a guilty plea from former Mingo
County Democratic Chairman Donald Evans, 63, to one count of
conspiracy to buy votes. Evans, who is to be sentenced Aug. 8, also
has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.

   In the film, which opened last weekend, Ms. Tomlin and Miss
Midler each play a pair of identical twins who are mixed up at
birth and raised as fraternal twins. One set winds up in a
hillbilly hollow; the second set lives luxuriously in New York.
   ``I'm very fond of Bette and I felt that we were cute
together,'' Ms. Tomlin said. ``I thought if we could be to the
ultimate what we both are, it could be super.''
   Ms. Tomlin, who has played a disgruntled secretary in ``9 to
5,'' a happy housewife who became ``The Incredible Shrinking
Woman'' and a body snatcher in ``All of Me,'' is working on an
animated special for CBS, based on the character Edith Ann, a
mischievous 5-year-old.
   Asked if she ever has the urge to play a more mainstream role,
she said: ``Not really. Shrinking women, body snatchers, these are
the things movies are made of.''

   A government brochure sent to more than 100
million households explaining in frank language how the AIDS virus
can be spread is getting a good response, Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop said Monday.
   The federal government mailing this spring was designed to reach
every household in the country as part of a campaign to teach
people how to avoid the risks of catching the fatal disease.
   ``I think that a number of people who planned to be shocked, who
planned to criticize ... have been surprised that it is a good
piece of education,'' Koop said at a news conference before he
delivered a commencement address to graduates of the University of
Health Sciences-Chicago Medical School in suburban North Chicago.
   Most pleasing are reports of family discussions of the brochure,
Koop said.
   ``People have heeded my request,'' he said. ``They have taken
the family together and presented this to them as a problem that
they all should understand.''
   He also said there have been a ``tremendous number'' of calls to
a hotline asking for the brochure in Spanish. Koop said no good way
could be found to determine which households in the country would
need the Spanish language version when the brochure was mailed.
   Koop also cautioned against overreacting to what may seem to be
new and frightening findings to be presented at the the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS which opened Sunday in Stockholm,
Sweden.
   ``Don't be misled that that something has just happened in the
last week and now we're in real trouble,'' he said.
   Dr. Lars Olof Kallings, a conference chairman, characterized
some of the information in the papers as ``frightening.''
   Koop said AIDS continues to present a unique problem for people
in the United States, a country used to seeing diseases conquered
by science.
   ``I don't see a vaccine that is both effective and readily
available, as well as safe, in this century,'' Koop said. But he
said that before the year 2000, scientists may develop a better
agent to hold the AIDS virus in check, postponing, possibly
indefinitely, deaths from the disease.
   Koop said teen-agers are among the toughest people to warn about
AIDS, because they are, by nature, ``risk takers.''
   He said that because AIDS symptoms often do not show up for
years after infection, teen-agers may feel no fear because they do
not see their friends dying from the disease.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's defenses
against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening
infections and certain cancers.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by infected drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   AIDS has struck more than 64,000 people in this country since
1979 and killed more than 36,000 of them, according to the national
Centers for Disease Control.

   Five escapees, including a confessed
double killer, were still at large Monday as more than 75 officers
scoured the area for the men who cut their way from what was
thought to be an escape-proof jail.
   Six detainees, including the confessed double killer in the
so-called ``ninja'' slayings, escaped Sunday night from the
Cumberland County Jail. They left in their wake two small hacksaw
blades, an 8-inch-by-15-inch hole in a cell and a rope made of
bedsheets hanging from a fourth-floor window, authorities said.
   Frederick Glenn Evans, 20, who was being held on murder charges,
was recaptured shortly after the escape and was treated for a
broken leg or hip he suffered in a fall, said Harold Little, a
spokesman for the sheriff's department. The others remained at
large as officers with the FBI, State Bureau of Investigation,
state Highway Patrol and nearby military installations fanned out
to search the county.
   Fayetteville architect Dan MacMillan, who designed the jail,
said he was baffled at how the men sawed through the heavy-gauge
horizontal bars.
   ``An ordinary hacksaw would not cut this material,'' he said
Monday. ``I've seen demonstrations of it where they (try to cut) it
with an electric hacksaw, but the thing just goes back and forth
and it does not make any impression in the material. ... I'm really
not aware that there was a hacksaw blade available that would saw
the material.''
   The escape apparently was spotted by a police records clerk who
noticed someone drop from the center, Little said. Desk Sgt. Mike
Reihe gave chase but lost the suspects in the dark, Little said.
   Still at large Monday afternoon was Jeffrey Karl Meyer of
Raleigh, a 21-year-old former soldier at Fort Bragg who confessed
to the stabbing deaths of Paul Kutz Sr., 68, and his wife, Janie
Kutz, 62. Meyer was scheduled to appear in Superior Court Monday
for a continuation of the sentencing phase of his trial, in which
he may face the death penalty.
   The slayings came to be known as the ``ninja'' murders because
Meyer and accused accomplice Mark E. Thompson, another former
soldier at Fort Bragg, allegedly wore black clothes resembling
outfits worn by Japanese assassins.
   The other escapees were: Jerry Ronald Pond Jr., 24, of
Fayetteville, held in the slaying of a pawn shop employee; Gregory
Morris Lee, 30, of Fayetteville, held on a charge of first-degree
burglary, assault on a female and larceny; Jeffrey Charles Minnick,
22, of Hope Mills, held on charges of second-degree burglary,
first-degree sex offense and common law robbery; and Rick A.
Wilson, 30, of Hope Mills, held on charges of felony breaking and
entering.

<TEXT>
   South Korea is once again being hit by
a wave of violent anti-government demonstrations and street battles
between riot police and radical students. Here are answers to some
questions on the latest unrest.
   Q. Why are there new riots in South Korea? Haven't elections and
democratic reforms in recent months produced substantial changes?
   A. Many of the authoritarian controls on politics and many other
aspects of South Korean life have been dismantled in recent months.
The small, but powerful radical movement contends there has been no
change and remains determined to overthrow a government it claims
is a dictatorship. Radicals are fighting for an ill-defined
``democracy of the masses.''
   The well-organized radical movement, which evolved during years
of resistance to authoritarian rule, has become increasingly
leftist and violent as it has split with moderate opposition forces
over political goals in recent months.
   Q. Most of the protesters are described as students. Who are
they and what do they want?
   A. Radical college students are the main strength of the protest
movement. They constitute up to 10 percent of college students,
with perhaps another 10 percent sympathizing with their ideas and
aims.
   Many radical students are idealists seeking a perfect society in
a nation dominated for most of its 40 years by military and
civilian dictators. They see themselves as champions of workers,
peasants and the poor.
   The radicals have little understanding of politics or ideology,
partly because of strict government controls in the past on
political education. They talk about true democracy and sharing
wealth, but are vague or inarticulate on how to achieve their goals.
   Q. How serious is the unrest?
   A. The radicals lack public support and are not a serious threat
to the government, but they are capable of causing trouble by
violent tactics. The main problem is that they are helping continue
the confrontational nature of Korean politics.
   Q. Why have the latest protests been mainly anti-American.
Didn't the United States help the South during the Korean War?
   A. Radical students contend successive authoritarian governments
have been able to rule the country because of U.S. backing.
Students say the United States as a democracy has failed to push
for democracy in South Korea and other nations.
   The radicals also claim the United States enforces partition of
the divided Korean Peninsula to control the South. The intensely
nationalistic students resent the presence of 42,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea and oppose the growing impact of American cultural
influence. But the resentment aimed at the U.S. government has so
far had little impact on individual Americans.
   Q. How do the majority of the Korean people feel about the
United States and about the radicals' anti-Americanism?
   A. Most South Koreans are not anti-American. A majority are
believed to support the presence of U.S. forces as a defense
against communist North Korea.
   But there is a growing belief among South Koreans that the
United States tends to patronize its weaker Korean ally. This
partly reflects the Koreans' growing prosperity and confidence and
their desire for a bigger voice in the world. U.S. trade pressure
to open up South Korea's markets to American imports has also
stirred resentment.
   Q. The students tried to march to the North Korean border for
reunification talks. Is reunification possible?
   A. Radical students, who insist they are not communists, say
reunification must be achieved at once. They claim the governments
in the north and the south will be swept away and the peninsula
reunited if the ordinary people of both nations simply join hands.
   But many South Koreans fear the North wants to impose communist
rule. The North invaded the South in 1950 and the two nations
technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed.
   There seems to be little hope of reunification while the North
remains one of the most repressive communist regimes in the world
and the South becomes one of the fastest growing pro-Western
capitalist nations. The peninsula was divided in 1945 when U.S. and
Soviet forces ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War
II.
   Q. Do the new protests pose a threat to the Summer Olympics in
Seoul in September?
   A. Some radicals are backing North Korea's demand to be a
co-host of the Games as a way of promoting reunification. The
International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the
North's demand.
   The South Korean government is determined to make the Games a
major success and any attempt to disrupt them would be suppressed
by a huge security shield. But radicals may try to stage protests
since world attention will be focused on South Korea.

   Vice President George Bush on Monday named
James Lake as his campaign communications adviser and Sheila Tate
as campaign press secretary.
   Lake, a Washington-based political consultant, served a similar
role in the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign and was press secretary to
President Reagan early in his 1980 campaign.
   Ms. Tate, a former press secretary to Nancy Reagan, had been
managing director of the Washington office of Hill and Knowlton, a
public relations and advertising company, since May 1987.
   Bush, who appeared with the new aides at a brief news conference
in the Old Executive Office Building, said ``having these two
professionals will strengthen my campaign organization.''
   The campaign has not had a press secretary since Peter Teeley, a
longtime Bush associate, resigned as communications director and
chief spokesman in mid-May after clashes with other senior Bush
aides.
   Bush said that, as press secretary, Ms. Tate would have ``full
unhampered access'' to him and other key campaign officials.
   Bush also named Stephen Hart, who has been acting press
secretary, to assistant to the vice president for press relations.
   Hart will deal mostly with matters affecting the office of the
vice presidency, while Ms. Tate and Lake will be involved in Bush's
campaign.

<TEXT>
   An Alaska delegation hoping to improve
U.S.-Soviet relations and reunite Eskimo families divided by the
Cold War took off today on a ``friendship flight'' to the Siberian
community of Provideniya.
   The flight, aimed at cracking open a border closed for 40 years,
left Nome at 11:09 a.m. (ADT) for Provideniya, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   Dubbed Friendship 1, the plane had left Anchorage at 7:55 a.m.
for the 1{-hour flight to the western Alaska town of Nome, the
jumping-off point for the second leg of the trip, a 45-minute
flight to the Soviet Union.
   The flight from Nome to the eastern Siberia port of Provideniya
is seen as a big step toward thawing relations between the
neighboring regions, once part of the same country before Russia
sold Alaska to the United States in 1867.
   Eskimos once freely crossed the icy Bering Strait in motorboats
and walrus-skin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives. The
border was closed in 1948 amid growing Cold War tensions.
   This month, the Soviets approved today's one-time charter flight
to Provideniya, after two years of work by Alaskans promoting the
idea.
   Eighty government officials, Eskimos and journalists were booked
aboard the Alaska Airlines plane for the 225-mile flight.
Provideniya officials planned to entertain the one-day visitors
with tours, a banquet and a trip to an outlying native village.
   The flight is long overdue, says Timothy Gologergen, 68, one of
several Siberian Yupik Eskimos who are making the trip.
   ``This is the first chance to create peace towards our people
and their people,'' he said. ``This way we'll have a chance to find
out if the relatives are still alive there someplace and open up a
little trade.''
   Gologergen said his great grandfather migrated from Siberia and
kept in touch with relatives there until ``the iron curtain came
down.''
   The ``friendship flight'' is part of a broader initiative that
Alaska business leaders, educators, and state officials have
launched to improve relations with the Soviet Union. Those efforts,
combined with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness,
have started to chip away at long-standing barriers.
   ``From a symbolic perspective, the trip represents the reopening
of an old gateway between Alaska and the Soviet Union,'' said Gov.
Steve Cowper, delegation leader. ``I'm confident it will lead to
better relations between our two countries for years.''
   The flight stems from the dream of James Stimpfle, a real estate
agent in Nome. When Alaska's oil recession began two years ago,
Stimpfle brainstormed ways to improve the economy of his remote
town of 3,700 people.
   He figured that if the Alaska-Siberia border were opened, Nome
could become an economic and cultural center for both sides of the
Bering Strait. In addition to freer travel by residents, Stimpfle
envisioned increased trade, joint business ventures, and tourist
excursions by airplane and cruise ship between Nome and Siberia.
   The barriers to such activity were _ and remain _ substantial.
Though Siberia and Alaska lie only 3 miles apart at their closest
point, the regions are a world apart politically and economically.
Even a telephone call from Nome must be routed the opposite
direction around the globe to reach Provideniya.
   Officials in Washington, four time zones to the east, and
Moscow, 12 time zones to the west, seemed content with the status
quo.
   So Stimpfle tried some attention-grabbing stunts. He floated
balloons from Nome across the Bering Strait and pointed a huge
Peace sign, in Russian, toward Siberia.
   He also wrote hundreds of letters to Soviet and U.S. officials,
urging the opening of the border. Slowly, people began to listen _
especially after Alaska Airlines, the largest air carrier serving
Alaska, hopped on the ``friendship flight'' bandwagon.
   ``It was only a short while ago that this flight was a dream,''
said Lou Cancelmi, Alaska Airlines spokesman. ``I personally
wondered if this day would ever come.
   ``I don't think Jim Stimpfle ever thought for a moment that it
wouldn't, and that's what it takes to make something like this come
true.''

<HEAD>Top Military Leader Of Shining Path Rebels Captured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police captured the top military leader of the
Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war
has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.
   Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered the
most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date
for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the
Andean highlands in May 1980.
   ``Osman Morote is considered the No. 2 of the party and its
military chief,'' the independent magazine Si said recently. ``For
some Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, the
true leader of the organization.''
   Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded the
Shining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader.
   The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected
government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after
the ideas of Mao Tse-tung.
   Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said Morote was
arrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along with
two women. Police sources said two other men also were arrested.
   Mantilla said Morote had fake identification papers but was
identified by his fingerprints.
   Counterinsurgency sources said police raided the house after
neighbors told them of suspicious behavior by the people living
there. The sources said police discovered revolutionary propaganda,
dynamite and a revolver.
   Col. Javier Palacios, a top official in the counterinsurgency
police, presented Morote to the press Monday but did let him speak.
   Palacios said police had suspected Morote was in the house. He
said Morote put up no resistance.
   The colonel said Morote arrived in Lima a week ago from the
northern highlands to coordinate terrorists attacks in the capital.
Palacios said the attacks were planned this week to mark the second
anniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed more
than 250 rebel inmates.
   There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry
between Morote and Guzman, and Mantilla said he did not discount
the possibility that Guzman betrayed Morote to get him out of the
way.
   Morote, known within the rebel band as ``Comrade Remigio,'' is
second in importance only to Guzman, who founded the Shining Path
as a splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party.
   The Shining Path devoted itself to 10 years of semi-clandestine
political work with peasants in the impoverished Andean highlands
before taking up arms.
   Guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but Morote is
considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the
advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands
that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military.
   Counterinsurgency sources said Morote's capture will create a
power vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path and
spark tension until a replacement is found.
   Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground
in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has
claimed more than 10,000 lives.
   Guzman has not been seen for years and rumors have circulated
that he may have died. But most counterinsurgency experts believe
that Guzman, described as brilliant by his former professors, is
still alive.
   Guzman has become a mythical figure for Peruvians. Various
rumors say that he is living abroad, that he moves about Peru
disguised as a priest, that he works as a day laborer in Lima's
crowded street markets.
   Since 1980, the movement has expanded from its base in the
highland state of Ayacucho and now launches attacks throughout much
of this impoverished nation.
   Damage to the economy from sabotage is estimated at $5 billion.

<HEAD>Presidential Guest Quarters Displayed After $13 Million Makeover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials on Monday showed off the $13 million
renovation of Blair House, the president's guest quarters where
visiting dignitaries can eat in one of three dining rooms,
entertain in a cozy library and have their hair styled at a private
Elizabeth Arden salon.
   ``It is not too grand, but it has elegance,'' said Chief of
Protocol Selwa Roosevelt, who oversaw the restoration. ``It is a
guest house worthy of this great nation.''
   Manager Benedicte Valentiner said she doesn't expect guests for
another six weeks because work is only 90 percent complete. The
chef, for instance, needs to a proper gas range for cooking. The
first official visitor has not been named.
   Blair House, a 115-room complex consisting of four connected
townhouses on Pennsylvania Avenue across from the White House, was
shut down in 1982 after a malfunctioning gas valve leaked explosive
natural gas during one dignitary's stay.
   In 1985, Congress allocated $8.6 million for a complete overhaul
that included new electrical heating, plumbing and air conditioning
systems, roof repairs, installation of fire and safety systems and
improved security.
   The rest of the money _ more than $5 million _ was raised
privately for refurbishing the interior of the four-story house.
Furniture is in the Anglo-American style of 18th and 19th centuries
with lots of overstuffed chairs and couches, Oriental rugs and
hand-painted wallpaper.
   ``We wanted it to be soft and light,'' said decorator Mark
Hampton, who shared the project with Mario Buatta. That was no
small feat because heavy curtains will be drawn to keep ``the local
Pennsylvania Avenue terrorist from looking in the windows,'' he
said.
   Rooms that formerly had dingy white walls were painted a variety
of bright colors: salmon, blue, shades of yellow, to name a few.
Light streams through the back windows that face an interior garden.
   Chiefs of state invited by the president to use Blair House will
sleep in a double canopy bed in a private room, part of a suite
that includes another bedroom for a spouse, a sitting room and
three bathrooms, one of which has a European bidet.
   If the leader feels cramped by an 18th century bed, the Blair
House staff can arrange for a king-size bed to be installed.
   ``We will do anything to make them happy,'' said the
multi-lingual Valentiner, who will stay on premises to supervise
the staff of 13 during a an official visit. The most number of
people Blair House can accomodate is 27 _ 19 guests and eight staff
members. All stay free of charge.
   If the leader wants see people, he or she can attend to business
in a book-lined libary, which Hampton tried to give a masculine
feel by using rich brown tones. For news conferences, heads of
state have the use of a high-ceilinged room with two fireplaces.
   Since dignitaries often bring family members, Blair House has a
private Elizabeth Arden studio with professional hair styling
equipment.
   The original house, built in 1824, is rich in history. After the
original owner's death it was sold to Francis Preston Blair, an
intimate of President Andrew Jackson.
   Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Col. Robert E. Lee was
offered the command of the Union Armies at a Blair House meeting,
but he declined in favor of his native Virginia.
   President Roosevelt approved the acquisition of the house in
1942, saying the government needed it ``for the entertainment of
distinguished visitors.''
   On Nov. 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican nationalists tried to force
their way into Blair House in an assassination attempt on President
Truman. One of the nationalists and a White House guard died in the
shootout.

   Iran said its forces drove into southern
Iraq behind helicopter gunships Monday, recapturing some of the
territory east of Basra that they lost three weeks ago. Iraq said
it repulsed the invaders.
   Iran claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on the
attackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poison
gas and kept casualties to a minimum.
   Revolutionary Guards stormed through mine fields and thickets of
barbed wire in a two-pronged offensive before dawn in the Salamcheh
region, killing or wounding more than 11,500 Iraqis and capturing
2,100, Iran said.
   Iraq acknowledged the Iranians broke through border defenses in
a ``reckless assault'' 15 miles east of Basra, the southern port
and provincial capital. The Iraqis said their 3rd Army Corps
``absorbed the momentum'' and ``completely destroyed'' the
offensive in a 19-hour battle which was supervised by President
Saddam Hussein and resulted in ``a new victory.''
   The Iraqi president returned to Baghdad on Monday evening after
the fighting settled in the favor of Iraqi troops, Baghdad radio
reported.
   Iran claimed the Revolutionary Guards, supported by artillery
barrages and air strikes, were ``holding the upper hand.''
   An Iraqi communique said Iraqi planes flew 170 combat missions
and helicopter gunships flew 240.
   That is the highest single-day tally of Iraqi missions in
months. The communique said the aircraft destroyed nearly 200
vehicles and inflicted ``enormous losses.''
   No independent confirmation of the conflicting claims was
available. Neither side allows Western journalists or other neutral
observers into combat zones except on rare guided tours.
   The Iranian attack was seen as a bid by Iran's new
commander-in-chief, Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, to
regain military initiative lost by defeats in the past two months
of the war, which began nearly eight years ago.
   It was not clear how many Iranian troops were involved in the
thrust. Tehran communiques indicated the assault forces initially
engaged at least 11 infantry and armored brigades, an estimated
40,000 men.
   Since it is standard military practice for an assault force to
outnumber defenders at least 2-1, that would indicate about 80,000
Iranians.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an
unidentified Revolutionary Guards commander at the front as calling
the Iranian offensive ``a crushing response to recent Iraqi
movements in Salamcheh.''
   It said air force planes flew 19 ground-attack sorties and that
28 missions by helicopter gunships destroyed ``tens of tanks and
armored personnel carriers ... creating a hell of fire for the
Iraqi forces.''
   The commander claimed anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi
warplane in the region, but did not disclose the type of the jet
reportedly downed.
   According to Iraq's communiques, one of its air strikes was on
an Iranian air base near the western city of Dezful, apparently to
knock out Iranian jets supporting the offensive.
   Reports in official Iranian media in the past two weeks have
said thousands of ``basij,'' or volunteers, were going to the front.
   In its reports of the battle, IRNA said Iranian troops broke
through Iraqi defenses and destroyed at least 30 Soviet-made tanks.
   It said the attackers caused heavy casualties in six infantry
brigades and wiped out three artillery battalions that were caught
in the open.
   Dispatches from the official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military
spokesman in Baghdad as reporting an Iranian offensive east of Fish
Lake, an area northeast of Basra flooded several years ago to
frustrate Iranian assaults.
   He said the Iraqis were preparing a counteroffensive ``that will
teach the enemy a good lesson.'' According to the Iranians, Iraqi
soldiers counterattacked at noon but were driven back with the loss
of 800 killed or wounded.
   IRNA dispatches said the battlefield was littered with
knocked-out tanks and armored vehicles of Iraq's 3rd Armored
Division and 5th Mechanized Infantry Division.
   Elements of both divisions were involved in the Iraqi assault
May 25 that drove the Iranians out of their hard-won bridgehead
east of Basra and back across the frontier. The offensive Monday
was the first major Iranian operation since that battle.
   Iran seized the marshlands east of Basra with huge losses in
January and February of 1987 and fought to within 6 miles of the
city.
   Two years ago, Iranian forces captured the Faw Peninsula south
of Basra. On April 18, Iraq's 7th Corps recaptured it in a 34-hour
battle that began with a surprise attack.

   The Supreme Court ruled today the government
may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the
disease it was intended to prevent.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices rejected Reagan administration
arguments that the government always should be shielded from
lawsuit in such cases.
   In another case, the court agreed to judge the constitutionality
of a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes.
   The court reinstated a suit by the parents of a Pennsylvania boy
who contracted polio after receiving a dose of federally approved
vaccine.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in his opinion for the court, said
governmental immunity from suit only extends to instances in which
an official exercises discretion or judgment.
   ``The discretionary function exception, however, does not apply
if the acts complained of do not involve the permissible exercise
of policy discretion,'' Marshall said.
   If a federal policy ``leaves no room for an official to
excercise policy judgment in performing a given act, or if the act
simply does not involve the exercise of such judgment,'' the
government may be sued for causing personal injury, Marshall said.
   The court revived a suit in behalf of polio victim Kevan
Berkovitz, who was less than three months old on May 10, 1979, when
his pediatrician in Charleroi, Pa., gave him a dose of Orimune.
   The drug, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories, is a form of
Sabin oral vaccine. Orimune was licensed by the government in 1963.
   Kevan was stricken with polio within a month and the U.S.
Communicable Disease Center determined he contracted the disease
from the vaccine. He is paralyzed and deformed and breathes with
the help of a respirator.
   The Berokovitz family contends that negligence by a goverment
worker caused the child's polio.
   The parents said the vaccine approved by the government violated
its own standards for safety and that policy-making discretion by
the government was not involved in approving the defective vaccine.
   The Reagan administration argued that even when an employee is
negligent, the government agency that employs the worker may be
using its discretion in approving the vaccine.
   Justice Department lawyers said if the government can be sued in
such cases, it will be forced into becoming an insurer of vaccines
and may withdraw from licensing them.
   Federal officials said Sabin oral vaccine, administered
routinely to all children in the United States, has all but
eliminated polio even though each year a few who take the vaccine
have adverse reactions.
   Today's ruling overturned a decision by the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals based in Philadelhia which threw out the Berkovitz
suit last year.
   The appeals court held that discretion was involved when the
government initially decided to verify test results by vaccine
manufacturers, thereby shielding the government from suit.
   Ronald Greene, a lawyer representing Lederle Laboratories, said
the impact of the ruling is unclear. He said the decision appears
to cover all government-licensed vaccines and possibly other drugs
as well. But he said the standards enunciated by the court may
affect a limited number of cases.
   ``The facts alleged here are unusual and I don't know whether
they (the Berkovitz family) can prove them,'' he said. ``These are
circumstances that are unlikely to arise'' very often.
   Faye Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug
Administration who said the FDA licenses more than 40 vaccines,
declined to comment on the impact of the ruling.
   Ellen Viakley, a lawyer for the Berkovitz family, said ``it's
not a case of an allergic reaction. It's a case where the
government knew that this particular polio vaccine violated its own
regulatory safety standards. By the government's own regulatory
safety standards, this vaccine was unsafe, but it licensed it
anyway.''
   She said, ``It's not going to affect any cases where there is
simply an allergic reaction,'' such as DPT vaccine against
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, which the American Academy of
Pediatrics says is the source of three-quarters of the serious
injuries to children resulting from vaccines.
   At issue in the sentencing case is whether the U.S. Sentencing
Commission's rules that took effect Nov. 1 may stand or must be
thrown out. The validity of the commission itself is at stake, also.
   By the time the court announces its decision, expected sometime
in 1989, thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced _
regardless of which way the court rules.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Armed police with new authority, ruling that officers
sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the sight of them
even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct.
   It unanimously ruled that Michigan prosecutors may use as
evidence the drugs dropped by a man who started running when he
spotted a police cruiser on a Detroit street.
   _ Declined to study an unprecedented racial-desegregation case
and refused to free Yonkers, N.Y., officials from having to
integrate city schools and build subsidized housing to overcome
decades of discrimination.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that Yonkers
must bujild subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of
the city and create ``magnet'' schools to reduce segregation.
   _ Agreed to decide whether the government may use a 19h Century
anti-fraud law to impose stiff civil fines on top of criminal
penalties for the same offense.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Reagan administration
officials seeking to fine the manager of a New York medical
laboratory $131,170 for defrauding the government of $585 on
Medicare bills.
   _ Ruling that the Postal Service is similar to a private
business, said the service must pay interest on back pay owed to a
worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal discrimination.
   By a 5-3 vote, the court ordered interest on back pay for a
letter carrier in Chesterfield, Mo., who was fired and later
ordered rehired.
   _ Barred states from banning all direct mail advertisements sent
by lawyers to potential clients.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled in a Kentucky case that states
violate free-speech rights when prohibiting lawyers from soliciting
business by sending truthful and non-deceptive letters to people
they know face particular legal problems.
   The vaccine case is Berkovitz vs. U.S., 87-498.

<TEXT>
   Smiling grade school students Monday helped
a descendant of legendary seamstress Betsy Ross place a wreath at
her tomb on the eve of Flag Day.
   Greg Scott of Norristown placed the wreath with the assistance
of Chris Amend and Chris Walsh, both 11 amd from Cranford, N.J.
About 100 people gathered around Mrs. Ross' gravesite in the
Atwater Kent Park for the ceremony. Amend and Walsh were among 62
fifth-graders who attended the ceremony.
   Mrs. Ross, according to some historical accounts, created the
first official American flag, sewing a flag with bars and 13
five-pointed stars. The story goes that a special committee headed
by George Washington visited Mrs. Ross in June 1776 and asked her
to sew a flag based on their rough design.
   Mrs. Ross was the official flagmaker for the Pennsylvania Navy.
But the story of the first stars and stripes has never been
authenticated.
   Scott, an administrator at Bryn Mawr College, plays saxophone in
a big band, and says he is not a practicing Quaker; nor does he
belong to any organizations such as the Sons of the American
Revolution.
   But he said he admires his great-great-great-grandmother, who
died in 1836, because she was a rebel.
   ``I do this because Betsy was a pretty cool old girl,'' Scott
said. ``She was no shrinking violet.''
   Mrs. Ross, born Elizabeth Griscom to Quaker parents on Jan. 1,
1752, broke with the Quaker tradition of pacifism to support the
Revolutionary War, he said.
   The ceremony Monday was preparatory to the city's Flag Day
ceremonies on Tuesday, which commemorates the day Congress
officially adopted the flag in 1777.

<HEAD>Aspirin Packages To Carry Stronger Warning on Reye Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Monday
it has published a final regulation requiring a permanent and
stronger warning label against giving aspirin to children and
teen-agers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of Reye
syndrome.
   The new warning, a modification of one already required on
aspirin and aspirin-containing drugs, says: ``WARNING: Children and
teen-agers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu
symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare
but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.''
   The new part of the warning is the last phrase: ``reported to be
associated with aspirin.''
   The stronger warning is based on a Public Health Service study
that found a significant association between Reye syndrome and
taking aspirin during chicken pox or flu, the FDA said.
   For one year, aspirin and aspirin products must display an
attention-getting device, such as a flag on the label, alerting
consumers to the new and stronger Reye syndrome warning.
   The new warning and attention-getting statement will be required
on aspirin products sold after Dec. 9, 1988. Until then, the
current warnings may be used.
   Although rare, Reye syndrome is fatal in 20 percent to 30
percent of cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage.
Its symptoms _ severe tiredness, belligerence and excessive
vomiting _ may occur just as a child or teen-ager appears to be
recovering from flu or chicken pox.

<HEAD>Pet Skunk Put To Sleep For Biting Neighbor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pet skunk who made headlines and
drew hundreds of callers lobbying to save his life was put to death
Monday because the man he bit refused to undergo precautionary
rabies treatment.
   After three stays of execution, Skunky was given a fatal
injection so that his brain could be tested to see whether he had
rabies.
   Skunky's owner, Jan Shelton of Buford, had tried until the end
to save the animal by trying to persuade the man whom Skunky bit
either to take rabies shots or drop his complaint.
   She had tears in her eyes as she spoke her last words to her
pet. ``Hey, you're sleeping. You're not conscious. It's fine,'' she
said.
   The bitten man, William Eugene Evans, 48, had said Thursday he
would not change his mind and either drop his complaint or undergo
a $600 series of rabies shots. Both moves would have spared
Skunky's life.
   Evans' physician said Evans should avoid rabies shots because he
suffered a heart attack two weeks ago.
   Ms. Shelton claims that Evans was mistreating her 1-year-old
skunk when he was bitten June 4, but Evans said he was bitten when
he reached down to pet the animal, thinking it was a cat.
   Officials say that the skunk is not classified as a domestic
animal, and by state law, had to be put to death and its brain
tested for rabies. The only alternatives were for Evans to
volunteer to undergo rabies treatment or to take a chance and agree
to spare Skunky from the fatal test.
   County Public Information Officer David Hirt noted that Skunky
had won three stays of execution last week, when the story began
making headlines.
   Skunky won his first postponement so that his case could be
heard by the county commission last week. The commission gave him
another break until Thursday, and then agreed to an extension until
Monday at noon.
   ``I've had hundreds of calls to the county office to save
Skunky,'' said Hirt.

<HEAD>Irish Judge Rejects British Bid To Extradite Suspect Bomber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's first attempt to extradite a
guerrilla suspect under a new agreement with the Irish Republic
collapsed on Monday when an Irish court freed a man accused of
bombings in London.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain was ``utterly
dismayed'' by the ruling, a senior aide said.
   A crowd of supporters cheered Patrick McVeigh, 37, outside
Portlaoise district court and drove him away so quickly they left
his wife, Celina, standing on the sidewalk.
   McVeigh was the first person targeted for extradition since the
British and Irish governments last month resolved legal differences
which had stopped all extraditions this year.
   An Irish state application was made for McVeigh to be sent to
Britain to face charges regarding explosions between 1981 and 1983
that killed two people outside Chelsea Barracks and a bomb disposal
expert in Oxford Street.
   Judge Jarlath Ruane said the Irish government had not properly
established McVeigh's identity.
   The judge said British police had not sent witnesses to identify
McVeigh as the man wanted, so there was nothing to indicate the man
in court was the same as the one mentioned on extradition warrants.
   McVeigh, from Belfast, was arrested May 18 as he left Portlaoise
prison after serving five years of a seven-year term for Irish
Republican Army weapons offenses.
   Alan Green, Britain's director of public prosecutions, said in
London that Irish authorities had assured his officers further
identification was not needed.
   An Irish government spokesman said: ``We do not comment on
decisions made in court.''
   Sean McManus, national chairman of the Sinn Fein, the legal
political wing of the outlawed IRA, accused the British government
of arrogance in assuming Irish courts automatically would hand over
prisoners.
   ``There should be no extradition of Irish citizens to face
British injustice,'' McManus said in Dublin.
   Under a new law that took effect last Dec. 1, Britain and
Ireland agreed to make positive identification the chief factor in
extradition.
   Previously, Irish courts freed wanted guerrillas on grounds the
IRA was engaged in a political struggle and not a criminal one in
trying to drive the British out of Northern Ireland.
   The extradition issue has been a major British-Irish dispute.
   In 1986, bombing suspect Evelyn Glenholmes was freed when a
Dublin court found a London police warrant for her defective. She
has been on the run from valid warrants ever since.
   London-Dublin relations are still troubled by the fatal
shootings on March 6 of three guerrilla suspects in Gibraltar
colony and refusal to grant a new trial for six Irish people
imprisoned in Britain for bombings of which they say they are
innocent.

<HEAD>Daimler-Benz Says Payment To ``Soothe'' Nazi Horrors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The industrial giant
Daimler-Benz, which forced people to work for the Nazi war effort,
said Monday that its $11.7 million payment to victims is designed
to help prevent similar injustices.
   ``We hope to make a contribution toward preventing the horrors
of the past from being repeated,'' Daimler-Benz board chairman
Edzard Reuter told reporters at the company's headquarters in
Stuttgart.
   ``With this gesture, we hope to soothe the still painful scars
(of the Nazi regime),'' said Reuter, whose family fled to Turkey
after the Nazi takeover. Reuter's father was a promiment Social
Democrat, one of the major foes of the Nazis.
   Like other German companies during Adolf Hitler's Third Reich,
Daimler-Benz used thousands of forced laborers to fuel its wartime
production of engines and vehicles for the military. Many laborers
died from ill-treatment or were later murdered in Nazi
concentration camps.
   The German Red Cross announced Daimler's payments Friday. The
announcement followed a study the company commissioned to determine
the extent to which forced laborers worked in its plants nearly a
half century ago.
   Daimler-Benz makes buses and cars, including Mercedes-Benz
luxury automobiles. Its many subsidiaries include a major aerospace
manufacturer.
   According to a study released in 1987 by an indepndent
historical research group, more than 46,000 forced laborers were
being used in Daimler-Benz factories in 1944.
   The study, compiled by the Hamburg Foundation for 20th Century
Social History, concluded that by the end of the war, half of the
workers at the company's factories were forced laborers.
   The study detailed brutal work conditions and executions of
workers _ many from France and the Soviet Union _ accused of
sabotage. It also concluded that Daimler management conspired with
Nazi leaders in the early 1930s to make the company Germany's chief
producer of military vehicles.
   The amount of the Daimler-Benz payment and its timing drew
immediate fire from survivors of the labor programs.
   ``The real tragedy is that 43 years after the end of the war,
only a quarter of those who worked at Daimler are still alive,''
said Alfred Hausser, a spokesman for a Stuttgart-based group
representing the interests of the former laborers.
   ``One can't even begin to call this compensaton,'' Hausser said.
   Daimler-Benz joins other major German companies that have paid
reparations to former forced laborers and their families.
   Government studies indicate that more than 8 million people
worked against their will in factories during World War II.
   Among them were people deported from occupied territories,
prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates.
   In 1986, the giant Flick conglomerate paid $2.9 million to its
victims. Other West German firms, such as the giant Krupp concern,
a major weapons producer during World War II, have also paid
reparations.
   In addition to the company payments, the West German government
has so far paid $46.8 billion to Nazi concentration camp survivors,
under the 1952 Luxembourg agreement signed between West Germany and
the World Jewish Congress.
   That figure is expected to reach $58.5 billion by the end of the
century.

<TEXT>
   Manufacturing corporations' after-tax profits
averaged 6.3 cents per dollar of sales in the first three months of
the year, up a sharp 43 percent from the fourth quarter, the
government reported Monday.
   The Commerce Department said U.S. manufacturers' after-tax
profits totaled a seasonally adjusted $39.4 billion in the first
quarter, compared with $27.4 billion in the fourth quarter, when
profits averaged 4.4 cents per dollar of sales.
   After-tax profits totaled $36.9 billion, a 41.3 percent rise
from the fourth-quarter total of $26.1 billion in profits. Sales
climbed a smaller 2.1 percent in the first quarter to $629.1
billion from $616.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
   The combination of rising profits and higher sales boosted the
level of profits to 6.3 cents per dollar of sales, an increase of
43 percent over the fourth- quarter performance of 4.4 cents.
   The government said the profit improvement occurred in part
because petroleum and chemical companies took large write-offs
against profits in the fourth quarter, depressing earnings during
that period.
   Manufacturers of primary metals, electrical machinery and
transportation equipment all enjoyed profit gains of more than 30
percent in the first quarter from the final quarter of 1987.
   Compared with a year earlier, companies reporting profit
increases of 50 percent or more were food, paper, printing,
petroleum, primary metals, fabricated metals, machinery and
instruments.

   The American Jewish Congress will present a
satellite television forum to enable four retired Israeli generals
to explain their support of a Middle East land-for-peace compromise
to Jews in 22 U.S. cities, the group's president said Monday.
   ``We wanted to present another point of view by people who know
the situation best,'' Robert F. Lifton told a news conference.
   He noted that conservative Israeli leaders have taken the stance
that any relinquishing of territory would be ``tantamount to
suicide.''
   However, Lifton said his organization had scheduled the
televised forum to inform American Jews about the viewpoint which
believes that a ``land-for-peace compromise with conditions is a
better choice'' than continuing the status quo.
   Lifton said conditions for such a compromise might include a
lengthy transition period; demilitarization of the area; removal of
foreign troops east of the Jordan River, and establishment of
warning stations.
   The forum, which will allow the audience to question the panel,
is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday.
   The panelists are retired Brig. Gen. Yoram Agmon, former air
attache at the Israeli Embassy in Washington; retired Maj. Gen. Ori
Orr, former chief of staff of the central command; retired Brig.
Gen. Ephraim Sneh, former head of civil administration for Judea
and Samaria, and retired Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv, former director of
military intelligence.

<HEAD>Policeman Shot in Ethnic Protest; General Strike in Armenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general strike was said to have virtually shut
down Armenia on Monday, and a shotgun blast killed a policeman
during weekend ethnic protests in the neighboring southern republic
of Azerbaijan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said an
Azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire during protests in
Baku, the Azerbaijani capital. Gerasimov identified the slain
officer only as Sgt. Izmailov.
   It was the first official confirmation of a police death in
ethnic unrest that began in February in the neighboring Caucasus
republics. Gerasimov identified the gunman only as an Armenian
named Aganbegyan.
   Azerbaijanis and Armenians are arguing over control of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region with a predominantly Armenian population
that was assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923. The conflict is aggravated
by the fact that most Azerbaijanis are Moslems and most Armenians
are Christians.
   On Sunday, rumors that two Armenians had been killed in
Azerbaijan led to protests by Armenians in Moscow. They gathered in
a cemetery and marched to the offices of the official Tass news
agency.
   Gerasimov told reporters Monday: ``We have received information
from Baku that the information about the murder of two Armenians is
false. In fact, there was a shooting in Baku from a shotgun _ a
shot from a shotgun and the bullet killed a militia sergeant
there.''
   ``The bullet was deflected from some kind of surface,'' he said,
and police have not determined whether the killing was intentional
or accidental. It occurred ``during a demonstration for retaining
Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan,'' Gerasimov said.
   He provided no details of the shooting and did not say precisely
when it occurred. There were unconfirmed reports Saturday of
large-scale protests in Baku.
   Gerasimov and Sergei Grigoryants, a Moscow dissident reached by
telephone, said Armenians met in their capital, Yerevan, on Sunday
and decided on a general strike.
   Its timing is an attempt to influence a June 15 meeting of the
Supreme Soviet of Armenia.
   Armenia's new Communist Party leader, Suren Arutyunyan,
addressed protesters and told them the Armenian Supreme Soviet
would ``not only review, but decide positively'' on their claim,
Grigoryants said. National government and party officials have
refused the Armenian demand for control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Grigoryants, a former political prisoner, said the activists had
not decided how long the strike would run but that it might
continue until June 28, when a special conference of the national
Communist Party begins in Moscow.
   He said estimates of the number of people who gathered in
Yerevan on Sunday ranged from 500,000 to 700,000, which would rival
the huge demonstrations at the end of February. His estimate could
not be confirmed independently.
   After the February protests, riots broke out in the Azerbaijan
city of Sumgait, north of Baku. Officials have said 32 people were
killed _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.
   Those who protested on Sunday agreed on a general strike to
include all industries except food processing, health care and
transportation, Grigoryants said, and it spread to public transport
on Monday.
   He said strikes were under way throughout Armenia, with the
possible exception of Kafan city, from which he had no information.
   According to official and dissident versions of events in
Yerevan, strikes, meetings and protests continued from Sunday night
into Monday morning.
   Grigoryants said the constant gatherings in the main square were
called off Monday afternoon because the temperature reached 104
degrees.
   People assembled again Monday night but there was no information
on their numbers or what happened, he said.
   Arutyunyan was made Armenian party leader May 21, replacing
Karen Demirchyan. Azerbaijan party leader Kyamran Bagirov was
replaced the same day in a clear indication of Moscow's displeasure
with the unrest.
   Gerasimov said the trouble did not stem from Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet society. ``This is not the
result of democracy and glasnost, but many years of stagnation when
we didn't delve deeply enough into national problems,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Guardian Angels on Monday accused police of
harassing them to halt their patrol of a restaurant district,
saying police arrested two Angels after they were menaced by a
knife-wielding crack dealer.
   ``I think it's ridiculous for the police to be fighting the
Guardian Angels. They should be fighting the crack dealers,'' said
Lisa Sliwa, spokeswoman for the group and wife of the group's
founder, Curtis Sliwa. ``It's almost as if they are on the side of
the drug dealers.''
   The confrontation that led to the arrest of two youths Sunday
night followed an incident the previous night that left one Angel
critically injured after he was stabbed.
   The Angels started their patrols of the Restaurant Row section
of West 46th Street in midtown Manhattan last Wednesday. Fifteen
proprietors asked the volunteer patrol group to help rid the block
of drug traffic.
   Asked if the Angels were being harassed by police, Detective
Joseph McConville, a department spokesman, said: ``I have no
knowledge of that.''
   He had no comment when asked if the Angels were being asked not
to patrol Restaurant Row.
   According to Ms. Sliwa, the latest incident occurred at about 1
a.m. Monday while the two Angels were on patrol in the area.
   ``They told a small group of crack dealers to leave the area, to
move on. One of the crack dealers pulled out a knife from his back
pocket and threatened the Angels,'' she said.
   The Angels immediately called police, who took everyone to the
Midtown North precinct station, she said.
   McConville, however, said the incident occurred about 9:20 p.m.
Sunday.
   John Johnson, 24, of New York, told police he was surrounded by
12 Angels and refused to leave the area when they ordered him out.
Johnson, according to McConville, was bumped by an Angel and then
``took out a pocket knife and held it at his side for protection.''
   When police arrived, they arrested Johnson and two Angels, Loren
Gonzalez, 21, of Milwaukee, and David Baldwin, 18, of Newark, N.J.
The three were charged with menacing and the Angels also were
charged with harassing.
   In Saturday's incident, Illya Lichtenberg, 16, of Verona, N.J.,
was hit in the head with a bottle and stabbed in the chest during a
confrontation between about 15 Angels and 15 other people, police
said.
   Lichtenberg was in critical condition Monday at St. Vincent's
Hospital after surgery. A 25-year-old man has been charged with
attempted murder in the incident.

   An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 jet crossed
the ice-clogged Bering Strait on Monday in a short but historic
flight aimed at bridging 40 years of wariness and distrust between
the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The one-time charter ``friendship flight'' to the eastern
Siberia port of Provideniya from the western Alaska town of Nome
was seen as a tentative first step in thawing relations and
reuniting Eskimo families split when the Iron Curtain slammed shut
during the Cold War in 1948.
   The border between Alaska and the Soviet Union was closed first
by the United States, and then by the Soviets.
   Monday's 40-minute flight was approved by the Soviets with
little notice earlier this month after two years of work by
Alaskans promoting the idea.
   Eighty government officials, Eskimos and journalists were booked
aboard the jet making the 225-mile flight. It left Nome shortly
after 3 p.m. EDT.
   Provideniya officials planned to entertain the visitors with
tours, a banquet and a trip to an outlying native village.
   The flight is part of a broader effort being mounted by Alaska
business leaders, educators, and state officials to improve the
state's relations with the Soviet Union.
   The flight was the dream of James Stimpfle, a Nome real estate
agent seeking ways to improve Nome's economy. He envisions Nome as
an economic and cultural center for both sides of the Bering Strait.
   Alaska Airlines is seeking permission to follow the one-time
charter with twice-weekly tourist excursions between Nome and
Provideniya.
   While peaceful interactions begin to flourish, military interest
in Alaska and Siberia also runs high. The U.S. Navy has increased
its emphasis on a strong defense in the North Pacific and Bering
Sea, and U.S. fighter jets last year intercepted a record number of
Soviet military aircraft off Alaska's coasts.

<TEXT>
   The White House on Monday shrugged off a new
book that says former presidential aide Oliver North proposed using
hostage negotiator Terry Waite in an attempt to set up Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi for assassination.
   ``We don't look into Ollie North stories,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``That's history, and world leaders
know it. It's a book about Oliver North. What do we care?''
   He called the book's narration about the alleged North episode a
``cockamamie story.''
   Fitzwater said events involving North, a former staff member of
the National Security Council, were ``a long time ago. I don't know
what he did.''
   North was fired in November, 1986, after the discovery of an
alleged diversion of profits from the secret Iran arms sales to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua. North and three other defendants face
trial felony conspiracy charges.
   A newly published book by CBS Pentagon correspondent David C.
Martin and Wall Street Journal national security correspondent John
Walcott said North proposed asking Waite to go to Tripoli to meet
with Gadhafi.
   Waite would ask Gadhafi's help in freeing the American hostages
in Lebanon and then depart, leaving the Libyan leader to spend the
night at his compound _ where he could be the target of an
assassination attempt, according to the book, entitled ``Best Laid
Plans.''
   The book said North's plan was quickly rejected.

<TEXT>
   Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft
that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years
after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the
launch pad, NASA scientists said Monday.
   Disturbances in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus suggest that a
mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond Pluto, John D. Anderson
of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said as NASA observed the fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past Pluto's orbit.
   Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is
searching for long gravity waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and
the boundary of the sun's influence.
   The radio signals the 570-pound space probe is sending back _
from 45 times the distance between the Earth and the sun _ aren't
very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light.
But they are important to researchers trying to solve some
classical puzzles about the universe.
   The energy of the craft's signals picked up by a 70-meter deep
space antenna would have to be accumulated for over 11 billion
years to build up enough energy to light a 7{-watt nightlight for
one millisecond, said Richard O. Fimmel, project manager at the
NASA Ames Research Center.
   But the signals from Pioneer 10 and its twin, Pioneer 11,
launched in 1973, are strong enough to send ``high quality data on
a daily basis,'' said physicist James Van Allen of the University
of Iowa, a principal investigator on the Pioneer project.
   Van Allen, who discovered the radiation belts surrounding Earth,
said Pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its
original missions to study Jupiter and the asteroid belt between
Mars and Jupiter.
   ``One of the principal current objectives is the observation of
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored
distances from the sun,'' Van Allen said.
   ``We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer
boundary of the heliosphere, which is the sphere of influence of
the sun, and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,''
he said.
   But sadly, he said, Pioneer 10 may stop working before it
reaches the edge of the heliosphere.
   The tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10
years, Fimmel said, and may run out of energy before it reaches
interstellar space.
   Before that, however, Pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to
the shape of the heliosphere.
   And it is relaying strong evidence suggesting Planet X or
possibly two smaller unknown planets exist.
   ``We have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that Uranus and Neptune
are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet
X,'' said Anderson. ``It's conceivable there could be other
gravitational effects on the two orbits.
   ``We haven't ruled out other matter which could be in orbit
around the sun,'' he said. ``It could be small particulate matter.
It could be more than one planet that are very small. The best
hypothesis is a single planet X at one to four Earth masses.''
   Such a planet, he said, would likely be a mixture of ice and
rock.
   Pioneer 10 made its closest approach to Jupiter _ 82,000 miles _
on Dec. 3, 1973, 21 months after it was launched, after traveling
an arc-shaped 620 million-mile path from Earth.
   It was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, fly past
Jupiter and return pictures, chart Jupiter's intense radiation
belts, measure the mass of its four planet-sized moons, and
discover that Jupiter is predominantly a liquid planet.
   Pioneer 11 encountered Jupiter a year later, then reached Saturn
on Sept. 1, 1979.
   Both craft, though partly damaged along the way, far exceeded
their operations guarantee of at least 21 months. A spokesman for
TRW Inc. of Redondo Beach joked Monday that the company would fix
anything wrong with the two Pioneers if NASA could bring them back.

   Vice President George Bush promised a group of
Cuban-Americans Monday that the U.S. government will make ``no
accommodations'' with Fidel Castro's communist government.
   Speaking at a ceremony at which the administration announced
agreement with a private foundation on a plan to resettle some
4,000 Latin American refugees, Bush said ``we have isolated him so
effectively, both diplomatically and politically,'' that it would
be foolhardy to make concessions in the interest of better
relations.
   ``There will be no diplomatic or political agreements that will
prolong the suffering'' of Cubans under Castro's Marxist
dictatorship, he said, adding that Castro's rule has proved
``calamitous for the Western Hemisphere.''
   ``There have been no accommodations made with Castro's corrupt
communist government by this administration and, if I may inject a
partisan point, I guarantee you there will be no accommodations,''
if he is elected president, Bush said.
   ``Freedom for Cuba is not a bargaining chip at all,'' he said.
   Bush also said he would work hard to make TV Marti successful in
bringing news of the outside world to Cubans on the mainland, as he
said Radio Marti has succeeded in doing.
   Bush, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams and immigration commissioner Alan C. Nelson
took part in ceremonies with representatives of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, a private organization that has agreed to take
on the project of helping to resettle some 4,000 Latin Americans in
this country.
   The administration had been pushing for such a program, but was
unwilling to have it paid for out of the U.S. Treasury. The
foundation has volunteered to carry on the work at its own expense,
with donations.

<TEXT>
   Tragedies like the death of a Navy recruit
during a training program could be avoided if the Pentagon did a
better job of screening recruits for potential mental health
problems, Rep. Michael Bilirakis said Monday.
   ``We need to find out what steps are being taken by the military
to deal with this very serious problem of phobias,'' the Florida
Democrat told a news conference.
   On Monday he wrote to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
seeking detailed information about how the Pentagon screens
recruits for potential mental health problems. Carlucci's office
said the secretary would not have any comment because the letter
hadn't yet been received.
   Bilirakis' letter referred to the March 2 death of Airman
Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., who drowned during an
elite rescue swimmer training program at the Pensacola, Fla., Naval
Air Station.
   A Navy investigator is now deliberating whether five swimming
instructors and a commanding officer should be court-martialed
because force was used to stop Mirecki from leaving the pool where
he drowned.
   Testimony at a Navy preliminary hearing indicated Mirecki had a
phobia about being pulled under water.
   Bilirakis held his news conference along with members of the
Phobic Society of America, who said Mirecki's case highlights the
dangers of phobias.
   Phobias are defined as persistent, irrational fears of a
specific object, activity or situation which results in a
compelling desire by an individual to avoid the fearful stimulus.
   Bilirikis, citing statistics from the National Institutes of
Mental Health, said ``phobias are the number one mental disorder in
this nation and one out of every eight people suffer from some sort
of phobia.''
   According to Bilirakis, Mirecki's death may have been avoided
had his phobia been recognized before he entered the training
program.
   Bilirakis said nothing on the military medical forms filled out
by recruits addresses phobias. ``Additionally, I am told there is
nothing in the military medical procedures requiring a doctor to
ask about specific mental health disorders at all.''

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department researchers are growing
coca plants in a $1 million-a-year search for ways to eradicate
South American crops destined for processing into cocaine,
officials said Monday.
   Between 400 and 600 plants are being grown at two USDA research
sites, one a greenhouse near Washington and the other an outdoor
location in an undisclosed, warm-weather area, said Dr. Edward B.
Knipling, associate deputy administrator for the Agricultural
Research Service's national program staff.
   Knipling said all of the plants used in the experiment are
incinerated afterward and that no cocaine is produced from them.
   Researchers earlier had grown opium poppies in Thailand and
marijuana in the United States as part of USDA's research into ways
to stem production of narcotics. The priority changed two years ago
because of growing use by Americans of cocaine and crack, a cocaine
derivative, Knipling said.
   The project was spotlighted in a report published in The New
York Times on Sunday.
   Knipling estimated the cost of the program at about $1 million a
year. He said part of the funds come from the research service's
regular budget and the rest by the State Department.
   ``There is absolutely none being developed into cocaine,''
Knipling said. `` ... It's not possible, not at our agricultural
facilities.''
   He confirmed that the seeds were brought to the United States
from South America and said a number of herbicides have been tested
for use against the plant.
   The chief herbicide recommended to the State Department for use
against coca is tebutherion, a product manufactured by Eli Lilly &
Co. of Indianapolis under the trade name Spike. Knipling said it is
used in considerable quantities in the United States to clear brush
in areas where food crops do not grow.
   Guards, alarms and wire fences are being used to keep out
intruders at the USDA installations, Knipling said. He refused to
disclose the precise whereabouts of either of the growing sites.
   The issue first surfaced when the former head of the project,
Walter Gentner, said in interviews that he had resigned in April to
protest what he described as the failure of the Agriculture and
State departments to examine adequately the potential dangers from
use of the herbicide.
   Knipling said there had been considerable pressure from various
places in the administration to get on with approval of Spike for
use against coca.
   ``We've been under an extensive sense of urgency coming from the
State Department and, of course, the White House, itself, that this
is a high-priority project,'' he said.
   Knipling said there had been ``frequent calls and visits'' to
the research service that intensified the pressure. He also said it
was intensified by demands from Congress and the public for action
to combat drugs.
   Knipling contended that illicit cocaine production in South
America is doing far more to endanger the environment than would
use of tebutherion. He said there was little doubt that the coca
leaves were being heavily sprayed with pesticides, which could
cause harm.
   Moreover, he said, sulfuric acid and other chemicals being used
to process the coca into cocaine are undoubtedly dumped into
streams when the manufacturing process is over.

   Friends and relatives gathered Monday to bury
veteran movie stunt man Charles H. Roberson, who for decades took
falls for John Wayne and even broke limbs on behalf of the Duke.
   Roberson, 69, died of cancer last Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in
Bakersfield.
   Roberson first doubled for Wayne in the 1949 film ``The Fighting
Kentuckian,'' and he retired in 1976 after working with Wayne on
the actor's final film, ``The Shootist.''
   ``He could do any stunt I could do. But the money people
couldn't afford to let him get hurt, so I was the one who ended up
in stitches,'' Roberson said in a 1984 interview.
   During nearly three decades of stunts for Wayne, Roberson
cracked his back, twisted an ankle and broke ribs and arms.
   He also did stunt work for Gregory Peck, Jeff Chandler, Clark
Gable and Ronald Reagan, who sent him a telegram after he became
ill last October.
   After retirement, Roberson raised thoroughbred horses on his
ranch south of Bakersfield.
   He also was the subject of a book titled ``The Fall Guy,'' by
Bodie Thoene, which later was the basis of the television series by
the same name starring Lee Majors.
   ``He was known as the finest stunt man in Hollywood and also the
best director of action scenes,'' said Ms. Thoene, of Glennville.
``He's one of the last of them. There aren't too many left like
him.''
   Roberson is survived by his wife, Dolly Mae Roberson, four
daughters, a sister and several grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Senators scurried Monday to overcome
last-minute objections by the Reagan administration to a
far-reaching welfare bill designed to help people break out of
poverty through jobs, training and education.
   Following a round of opening statements on the Family Security
Act, key senators retired to the office of Sen. Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., to try to work out differences with the
administration, which was threatening to veto the measure.
   The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
said the first session was ``very promising'' and that the meetings
would continue through the evening and on Tuesday.
   ``We have been attempting to find some solutions and we clearly
are making progress, at least in some very specific regards,''
Moynihan said.
   Dole said past congressional moves have only made the welfare
system worse. ``What we do here in the next few days in the Senate
will be a step in the right direction, for once,'' he said.
   The five-year, $2.6 billion bill is consensus measure that took
18 months to develop. It is a compromise version of a $7 billion
welfare plan passed by the House last Dec. 17.
   Besides putting more welfare recipients to work, the bill would
force more absentee parents to pay child support and require states
to provide at least six months of welfare benefits to poor
households with two parents.
   Government checks are the main feature of the current Aid to
Families with Dependent Children program, serving 3.7 million
families, including 7 million children, though there is a
small-scale work program.
   The Moynihan bill and the more expensive House bill attempt to
turn welfare into a jobs system, with goverment checks a last
resort if wages and child support payments are inadequate.
   ``Never has the Senate considered so fundamental a redirection
of the (welfare) system,'' Moynihan said.
   ``It's tempting to say this is an historical moment ... and yet
events will decide whether that was the case,'' he said, referring
to uncertainty over whether President Reagan would veto the bill.
   The administration was seeking, among other things, broader
authority for states to use federal money for experimental welfare
schemes; a mandatory percentage of people participating in work,
training or education programs; and a brand-new mandatory workfare
or public works program that one senator said would cost $900
million.
   The Office of Management and Budget said in a statement Monday
that Reagan would veto the bill in its present form.
   Many senators said the Moynihan measure is sorely needed to
update and improve a 53-year-old program conceived as a temporary
benefit for widows in an age when divorced, working and unmarried
mothers were a rarity.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, called welfare reform ``an urgent national priority.''
He said the nation is making do with ``a Rube Goldberg welfare
system developed during the Depression to meet the needs of a
society that no longer exists.''
   Bentsen and others hammered at Moynihan's themes that children
are the poorest population group in America today and that their
training for the job market is important given projections of an
impending labor shortage.
   ``Millions of children who are living in poverty and receiving
welfare today must become the trained, motivated workers of
tomorrow,'' Bentsen said.
   States would have to require parents to furnish Social Security
numbers at the birth of their children; meet minimum standards for
establishing paternity; set guidelines for child support awards;
and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks.
   All states would be required to have a jobs, education and
training program for welfare recipients with children age 3 or
over, or age 1 at state option. States would have to guarantee
child care for participants, and spend half their money on people
who are or are likely to be long-term welfare recipients.
   Nine months of transitional child care assistance and a year of
Medicaid coverage would be required for people moving off welfare
into the workforce.
   Another provision would require states to give welfare benefits
to families with two parents in the home. Twenty-six states already
provide such benefits; Moynihan's compromise would make six months
a year mandatory in the other 24 states.
   The Moynihan bill would be financed primarily by making
permanent the Internal Revenue Service's refund withholding program
for delinquent federal debtors and phasing out the dependent care
tax credit for higher-income taxpayers.
   The House bill offers states financial incentives to raise their
benefit levels, many of which are far below the federal poverty
line. Liberal lawmakers and interest groups have criticized the
Senate bill for leaving out the provision.

<TEXT>
   Lewis Earl ``Hoppy'' Swartz, the father of
organized surfing and developer of the judging system used on the
professional circuit, has died of a stroke while on his way to a
surf competition. He was 71.
   Swartz collapsed while standing in line at a ticket counter at
the Los Angeles airport Thursday, his longtime friend, Dave
McIntyre, said Monday.
   As Swartz wished, his body will be cremated and the ashes
scattered Sunday at Redondo Beach.
   Swartz, a 1930s surfing champ who was a familiar figure on
California beaches with his trademark straw hat, was headed for a
Western Surfing Association contest in Santa Cruz when he died.
   ``This 12-year-old kid walked up to me Saturday and said, `Dave,
I talked to Hoppy last Friday. Where's Hoppy?''' recalled McIntyre.
``I just said `Turn around and look out there.'
   ``The waves had been pretty flat and they suddenly came up to 6
feet. I said `He's out there.''
   ``Surfing was his whole life,'' said Leroy Granis, pioneer
surfing photographer who grew up with Swartz when surf boards were
110 pounds of pine and redwood.
   Swartz started the United States Surfing Association in the
early 1960s.
   ``There is now an immense hole in amateur surfing on the West
Coast because he was really the crankshaft of organized surfing on
the West Coast,'' said Surfer magazine publisher Steve Pezman.
``The sport will miss him.
   ``Surfing is really the antithesis of organized social behavior
so it was hard to organize. But it had to organize to survive.
Hoppy was always the guy willing to do the dirty work.
   ``He dedicated his life to making surf competitions a place
where young people could become exposed to sportsmanship and all
the virtues of wave riding.''
   In addition to surfing, Swartz had a master's degree in
electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley,
and worked on space radar systems at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, TRW and Hughes Research before retiring at age 55.
   Swartz, who recently moved to Long Beach, is survived by a
brother, two sisters, two daughters, a son and eight grandchildren.

   Robert T. Sullivan, an editorial
cartoonist for the Worcester Telegram for 17 years, has died
following a short illness. He was 64.
   Sullivan, whose lifelong ambition was cartooning, began his
career as a manufacturer's representative in power transmissions
but worked as a free-lance cartoonist until he joined the Telegram
in 1971.
   A World War II veteran who received the Air Medal for his
missions as a top turret gunner over France, Sullivan contributed
drawings to the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.
   He received numerous awards for his editorial cartoons, which
also have been displayed in several area galleries.
   Dick Locher, editorial cartoonist for the Chicago Tribune,
called Sullivan ``a tremendous artist and excellent cartoonist.''
   Sullivan leaves three brothers. Funeral services are scheduled
Wednesday.

   Louisiana's Pardon Board refused Monday to
recommend a halt to the scheduled Tuesday morning execution of
Edward Byrne Jr., convicted of romancing, robbing and murdering a
service station worker in August 1984.
   The decision left Byrne's fate up to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Other state and federal courts refused earlier Monday to stop the
execution, which would be the 100th in the nation since capital
punishment was reinstituted more than 10 years ago.
   At Monday's Pardon Board hearing, Byrne was described by defense
attorneys Amanda Potterfield and Nancy Baumgartner as a sensitive,
articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to
loved ones.
   Byrne, clad in blue jeans and T-shirt, claimed he never intended
to kill his victim.
   ``I was planning to rob this woman all along,'' said the curly
haired, 28-year-old prisoner. ``It was all set up. There were no
flaws that I could see.''
   Four of the five pardon board members who heard Byrne's case
voted against a lighter sentence. A fifth member was absent.
   Byrne was to die in the electric chair at the Louisiana State
Penitentiary in Angola for fatally bludgeoning Roberta Johnson of
Bossier City. The Pardon Board has no power to stop executions, but
can recommend sentence reductions for approval by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   Ever since his arrest, Byrne has admitted that he started dating
Johnson because he knew she handled large sums of money at the
service station where she worked. But he insisted he never meant to
kill her.
   Johnson died after being struck repeatedly with a ball peen
hammer.
   ``I just attempted to knock her unconscious,'' Byrne told the
Pardon Board in a hearing that began about 14 hours before his
scheduled execution. ``It didn't work.''
   As Byrne asked the Pardon Board to recommend reducing his
sentence to life imprisonment, efforts to save him continued at the
U.S. Supreme Court. Early Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and the state Supreme Court rejected appeals.
   At the Pardon Board hearing, which took place at the prison,
defense lawyers had Yousef Danesh, a Southern University professor
of political science, read poetry written by Byrne. Danesh said he
had become friends with Byrne after the killer was incarcerated at
the state prison.
   Baumgartner said Byrne was a young man deeply remorseful about
the death he had unintentionally caused.
   But Henry Brown, the district attorney who prosecuted the case,
painted Byrne as a manipulative rogue and cold, calculating killer.
   Brown said Byrne had been caught in a Leesville hotel room the
morning after the killing. Byrne was captured, naked, with a
barmaid he had picked up at a nearby tavern and had proposed
marriage to. Parked outside was a car Byrne had stolen from the
woman he lived with before getting involved with Johnson, the
prosecutor said.
   The district attorney said the victim has been hit 13 to 15
times with the hammer ``with most of the blows enough to kill her.''

   A Japanese student charged with trying to
sneak weapons aboard a jetliner remained jailed Monday without bail.
   ``He is a threat to the community and a risk of flight,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Marsha McClellan told federal Magistrate
Richard Powers.
   Powers denied bail and scheduled a hearing Thursday on a
government motion to hold Yoshino Kosugi, 18, a Drexel University
engineering student, for trial.
   Kosugi, en route to Japan to spend the summer with his family,
was arrested Sunday morning minutes before the scheduled takeoff of
a Northwest Airlines jetliner for Tokyo.
   He had a round-trip ticket and was scheduled to return in
September when classes resume.
   A routine check of his luggage uncovered four practice grenades
with live primers, blank rifle ammunition, a small bottle of flash
gunpowder, smokeless powder, a carbon dioxide pellet gun with
cartridges and pellets, 50 feet of detonation cord, homemade
firecrackers, road flares and three knives.
   The discovery led authorities to close one of five terminals at
Philadelphia International Airport for three hours while the bomb
squad examined the explosives.
   The government charged that Kosugi ``did willfully and without
regard for the safety of human life'' try to place the seized items
aboard an aircraft. If convicted, he faces a maximum of five years
in prison and a $25,000 fine.
   An affidavit filed with the court said Kosugi ``freely admitted
that the items located in his luggage belonged to him and were
packed in his luggage in a concealed manner by him for transport to
his destination, Yokohama, Japan.''
   FBI agent John Kundts, who participated in the questioning, said
Kosugi maintained that he collected military paraphernalia.
   His items were all obtainable from an Army surplus store.
   The prosecution at the hearing did not say whether the
government had any evidence, or even believed, that Kosugi was a
member of a terrorist group.
   But shortly after the arrest, Kundts said foreign authorities
had found no connection between Kosugi and terrorist organizations.
   In April, another Japanese, Yu Kikumara, accused of links to the
terrorist Japanese Red Army, was arrested at a New Jersey Turnpike
rest stop, where explosives were found in his car.
   Nothing indicated any connection between Kikumara and Kosugi.

   Investigators examined an Alaska Airlines
jetliner Monday and interviewed crew members to learn why it veered
from a runway and skidded to a stop in mud after landing at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   Four people were slightly injured Sunday night aboard the Boeing
727-200, which remained overnight in the grassy strip between the
airport's parallel runways.
   The 75 passengers and seven crew members aboard Flight 187 from
Tucson, Ariz., used emergency chutes to evacuate as a precaution,
airport officials said.
   ``It was a fairly normal flight until we landed,'' said
passenger Marlene Davies, 52, from nearby Kent. ``I saw the white
line and we kept going over it. And then I saw smoke or dust or
something. It was very scary.''
   ``It seemed to me like about 30 seconds from the time we stopped
to the time the stewardess threw the door open and yelled to
evacuate,'' she said.
   Once out of the plane, ``We ran as fast as we could to the
runway we had just been on,'' said passenger Katherine Tune of
Seattle. ``We all congregated and the emergency crews gathered.''
   The jet was towed Monday morning to an airport hangar where the
National Transportation Safety Board began its probe of the
accident. A representative of Seattle-based Boeing was assisting,
the jet manufacturer said.
   ``Upon examination of the airplane after it came to rest in the
grassy area, the left tire of the two-tire front nose assembly gear
was flat,'' said Dave Marriott, a spokesman for the Seattle-based
Alaska Airlines.
   ``Whether it was flat before they landed, flat on impact or flat
after that is still being looked into,'' he said.
   Port of Seattle spokesman John Eliadis said the nose of the
plane stopped about 400 feet from the runway, and investigators
were checking to see whether the plane might have blown a tire upon
landing or possibly struck some debris on the runway.
   Gwen Gause, an NTSB staff assistant in Seattle, said the plane's
nose wheel had to be dug out of mud before the plane could be
moved. There was no other visible damage to the plane, she said.
   Ms. Gause said it may take months to determine the cause of the
accident.
   Margo Spellman, airport spokeswoman, said two passenger
complained of back pain were treated at area hospitals. A third
person had a bruised knee and a fourth suffered a sprained ankle,
Ms. Spellman said.
   The flight originated in Tucson and made stops in Phoenix and
Portland, Marriott said. Marriott said the airline canceled four
flights Monday between Seattle and various California airports
because the plane was taken out of service, but expected to operate
those flights on Tuesday.

<HEAD>U.S. Cruiser Back to Work After Maintenance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A superpowerful American missile cruiser
returned to patrol duty in the Persian Gulf Monday after being
pulled off for what a U.S. Navy spokesman said was maintenance.
   The 9,400-ton USS Vincennes was taken off duty less than two
weeks after its arrival in the waterway May 28. It is the first of
the Navy's billion-dollar Aegis-type cruisers to be assigned to the
gulf.
   U.S. Navy officers say the warship's multiple-mission,
computer-linked radar and weapons system vastly expands the Navy's
air and sea surveillance capabilities.
   The Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, said the Vincennes
was withdrawn for ``maintenance upkeep,'' but refused for security
reasons to say what was the exact nature of the problem.
   The ship was out of action for about three days, other Navy
sources said.
   Those sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified,
said the ship's ``phased-array'' radar system was involved, but
could give no other details, and this could not be verified. Unlike
standard radar, the system is able to constantly monitor scores of
contacts simultaneously.
   In its first week in the gulf, the Vincennes had a near
encounter with an Iranian frigate that intercepted, boarded and
then escorted away the Cypriot-flag freighter Vevey, suspected of
carrying war-related cargo.
   The cruiser followed the detained ship to the edge of Iran's
declared ``war-exclusion zone'' in hopes of detecting some signal
from the Vevey that would justify its intervention, but neither saw
nor heard any, U.S. officers said.
   Meanwhile, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said an
American-owned supertanker, attacked by Iranian gunboats Saturday,
would continue to Singapore as planned after repairs at a United
Arab Emirates shipyard.
   The 258,979-ton Esso Demetia, owned by the Exxon Corp. and
sailing under the British flag, had eight holes in its hull from
rocket-propelled grenades, Lloyd's said.
   Fires broke out but were controlled, Lloyd's said. There were no
casualties.
   The London-based maritime agency, which monitors commercial
shipping worldwide, said the ship now is anchored off Bahrain and
will sail to Fujairah, on the Gulf of Oman, for repairs. Later it
will head for Singapore, its original destination, with its cargo
of Saudi Arabian crude.
   The raid took place about 45 miles off Saudi Arabia, in an area
where no such attacks are rare, according to U.S. Navy officials
and gulf-based shipping executives. All these sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Of interest to Navy intelligence was how the two or three armed
speedboats could appear in daylight and just as quickly vanish in
the western gulf, about 60 miles off Iran and the same distance
from Iranian-held Farsi Island. The island is known as an operating
base for the speedboat-borne Revolutionary Guards in the northern
gulf.
   U.S. forces maintain a careful watch on shipping activity in the
gulf, including small- and medium-sized craft that might be used
for minelaying or as ``mother ships'' for the speedboats.
   In land and air action in the nearly 8-year-old war between Iran
and Iraq, Iran said its forces drove into southern Iraq behind
helicopter gunships on Monday, recapturing some of the territory
east of Basra they lost three weeks ago. Iraq said it repulsed the
invaders.
   Iran claimed Iraqi planes dropped chemical bombs on the
attackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poison
gas and kept casualties to a minimum.

   The 1 million or more Americans
infected with the AIDS virus are becoming more infectious, and the
risk to uninfected people is growing, researchers said Monday.
   ``Non-monogamous sexual contact is becoming more dangerous,''
said James Goedert of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,
Md. He presented his findings at the Fourth International
Conference on AIDS in Stockholm.
   In a study of hemophiliacs, Goedert found that condoms don't
protect against AIDS unless they are always used during sexual
relations. ``Irregular condom use is no better than no condom at
all,'' he said.
   Dr. James Curran of the Centers for Diease Control in Atlanta
reported that new AIDS cases are reported in the United States at
the rate of one every 14 minutes.
   He estimated 365,000 cases will have been reported in the United
States by 1992 but said the figure could range between 205,000 and
440,000.
   The AIDS conference here is the largest meeting ever held on the
subject of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, with more than
7,000 participants.
   Also Monday:
   _Jean-Baptiste Brunet of Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris said
the number of AIDS cases reported in Europe has reached 12,221 and
is doubling every 11 months.
   The incidence of AIDS in drug abusers is exploding in Spain,
France and Italy, he said. In 1985, 7 percent of Europe's AIDS
cases were in drug abusers. Now the figure is 30 percent. An
estimated 300,000 to 800,000 people in 30 European countries are
infected with the AIDS virus, Brunet said.
   _Australian researchers described six cases in which mothers who
became infected after birth passed the virus to their infants
through breast milk.
   _An early report from an expanding U.S. government study of
American hospital patients said that three in every 1,000 patients
tested at six U.S. hospitals are infected with the AIDS virus _ but
the spread of the AIDS virus appears to be slowing.
   Curran said it is difficult to tell if the AIDS epidemic is
beginning to level off but said he didn't consider that an
important question.
   ``We had a thousand cases reported in the United States last
week,'' he said in an interview. ``Does it matter whether it's
going up or not? It might level off like lung cancer or heart
disease _ and that's not good.''
   A 1986 estimate that 1 million to 1{ million Americans were
infected with the AIDS virus was probably too high then, Curran
said. ``We believe an estimate of 1 million to 1{ million infected
is accurate now,'' he said.
   Goedert's conclusions about the growing infectiousness of people
carrying the AIDS virus came from a study of the rate at which
infected hemophiliacs transmitted the AIDS virus to their wives or
steady female partners.
   In the first year of the hemophiliacs' infection, only 1 percent
of the partners became infected.
   By the fourth year, the rate of transmission began to increase
and by the fifth year, 10 percent to 20 percent of the women were
becoming infected each year, Goedert said.
   ``There is a steeply increasing risk of becoming infected in
long-term relationships,'' Goedert said.
   ``The more partners, the more the risk,'' Goedert said.
   Curran said that the transmission of AIDS among heterosexuals
will continue to grow.
   ``More and more women are acquiring the disease through
heterosexual contact,'' he said.
   ``The data are too incomplete for firm conclusions,'' he said,
but ``heterosexual transmission will be increasingly important _
without explosive increases, as we're seeing in IV (intravenous)
drug abusers and gay men in the United States.''
   Goedert said that a person infected with the AIDS virus becomes
more able to transmit it when the disease progresses to the point
where laboratory tests reveal an immune system deficiency _ even
though there may be no visible symptoms.
   Dr. Robert Redfield of the Walter Reed Institute of Research in
Washington said that the gradual spread of AIDS to heterosexuals is
being accompanied by another unfortunate trend.
   ``We have mounting evidence that the virus is steadily creeping
into the young people,'' he said.
   Among 17-year-old applicants to the armed forces, women are
twice as likely to be infected as men, suggesting that the women
acquired the infection from heterosexual contact with older men, he
said.
   About 60 percent of the nation's approximately 18,000
hemophiliacs are now infected with the AIDS virus, Goedert said.
   Curran said the best available evidence now is that 40 percent
of people infected with the virus will develop AIDS within nine
years after becoming infected, and the rate at which they develop
AIDS is likely to climb as even more time goes by.
   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers.
   The World Health Organization reported in April, 1988, that
there were 88,031 AIDS cases reported worldwide since 1981,
including 57,575 in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Alessandro Natta, who led the Communist Party to its
recent election defeats, resigned Monday citing reasons of health.
   Natta, 70, had a heart attack in April. He had led the largest
Communist Party in the West since the death of party chief Enrico
Berlinguer in 1984.
   Achille Occhetto, 51, the deputy party secretary, is expected to
succeed Natta. Although the Communists are Italy's second-largest
party, they been excluded from the national government since 1947.
   Natta said in a letter of resignation to the Central Committee
and watchdog Central Control Commission that the party faces
difficult tasks and cannot be ``subordinate'' to his recuperation.
   The letter was made available to journalists.
   Upon taking power, Natta promised to follow the policies of
Berlinguer, who proclaimed the party's independence from Moscowk,
but lacked the appeal of Berlinguer, who led the party to 34.4
percent of the vote in 1976 _ just 4 percent less than the dominant
Christian Democrats.
   Under Natta's leadership in June 1987, the party suffered its
worse election defeat in 20 years, winning 26.6 percent of the vote
for the Chamber of Deputies. It now has 177 seats in the 630-seat
chamber.
   In recent local elections, the party got 21.9 percent, a large
decline from the 25.8 percent it received in the last local voting
in 1983.

<TEXT>
   The prime ministers of rivals Greece
and Turkey held discussions ``in a very friendly atmosphere''
Monday of problems that only last year brought the two NATO allies
close to war.
   As they talked outside the capital, about 2,000 Greek Cypriot,
Armenian and Kurdish demonstrators in the city burned Turkish flags
outside the Turkish Embassy and shouted ``Fire for the Turkish
dogs!''
   Hundreds of helmeted riot police guarded the embassy building
but there were no clashes, witnesses said.
   No signs emerged of a breakthrough on the major disputes over
Cyprus and the Aegean Sea during Monday's one hour of talks between
Premiers Andreas Papandreou of Greece and Turgut Ozal of Turkey.
   Mesut Yilmaz, the But Turkish foreign minister, told reporters
later: ``The meeting was held in a very friendly atmosphere and all
bilateral problems and international issues were handled,''
   Ozal began a three-day visit to Greece on Monday, the first by a
Turkish premier in 36 years.
   Pro-government and opposition Greek newspapers both gave him a
cool reception.
   ``Frozen Smiles'' was the headline in 24 Hours, an independent
Athens daily. ``The country receives Ozal with a cold heart,'' said
the pro-government Avriani.
   In separate statements before the talks started, both leaders
made clear they did not expect immediate major advances on the main
disputes.
   On Monday night, Ozal was guest of honor at a dinner beside the
the swimming pool of a seaside hotel in Vouliagmeni, outside
Athens, where he and Papandreou are staying.
   ``There is no room for petty designs, one-sided gains and
short-sighted tactics,'' Ozal said in his speech, in an apparent
reference to Greek demands that Turkish troops leave Cyprus.
   Papandreou said in his speech he had revived an earlier proposal
for demilitarization of the Mediterranean island and establishing a
joint Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot police force.
   ``It's clear that progress in Greek-Turkish relations is
directly affected by the solution of the Cyprus problem ... and
this is directly linked with the withdrawal of troops from the
island,'' he said.
   Ozal will drive into downtown Athens on Tuesday to lay a wreath
at the Monument of the Unknown Soldier outside Parliament, then
hold more private talks with Papandreou in the evening.
   Ozal began his visit with an appeal for patience on the ``the
long road (to peace) on which we have started journeying.''
   ``We must have realistic expectations, otherwise the
disappointments to be suffered will take us away from our main
goal,'' he told reporters. ``The problems go back a long time and
as solutions were delayed some of these problems petrified and
prejudices increased.''
   When Ozal arrived at the airport, only a few red-and-white
Turkish flags were displayed and a Greek commando squad in
camouflage battle-dress formed the honor guard.
   The neighbors came to the brink of war in March 1987 over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean seabed. The near-clash apparently
convinced Papandreou to alter his no-dialogue policy toward Turkey
and seek friendlier relations.
   Greece wants Turkey to pull its troops out of northern Cyprus
and agree on a joint appeal to the World Court to settle the Aegean
continental shelf dispute.
   Ozal says Turkey will not be pressured into withdrawing its
forces from Cyprus and prefers Greek-Turkish talks to solve the
Aegean problem. The soldiers were sent after a brief Greek-led coup
in July 1974.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Even If Veep Spot Not Offered, He Could Back Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson expressed confidence Monday that he
could rally his supporters behind certain Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis, even if Dukakis doesn't pick him as a running mate.
   But Jackson continued to stress that he is entitled to ``serious
consideration'' for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Even if Dukakis picks someone else, Jackson told reporters here,
the Massachusetts governor could expect backing from him ``so long
as our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.''
   Jackson sought to put the focus on harmony with the Dukakis
camp, citing the weekend agreement that South Africa shuld be
branded a ``terrorist state.''
   Jackson had strongly pushed that view, and, at a preliminary
platform-drafting meeting in Mackinac Island, Mich., the Dukakis
forces went along.
   The South Africa position ``is a step in the right direction for
America because we must regain our credibility and our moral
authority in the third world as leader of the free world,'' Jackson
said at an impromptu sidewalk news conference here.
   Dukakis has backed strong sanctions and a divestiture of U.S.
industries in South Africa to protest its apartheid policies of
racial segregation. But the Massachusetts governor had resisted
branding South Africa a ``terrorist state'' in the same category of
states as Libya and Iran.
   ``Our agreeing to declare South Africa a terrorist state and
thereby pointing to apply anti-terrorist legislation to South
Africa is a real hope to people throughout the world who seek
fairness and justice,'' said Jackson.
   He said there was ``a good tone'' to the negotiations with the
Dukakis camp.
   ``So far they (the talks) are having an impact on broadening and
strengthening the Democratic Party,'' he said.
   But Jackson noted that major differences remain, including
Dukakis' refusal to support the freeze on military spending that
Jackson has called for, and the Dukakis forces' resistance to the
tax hikes Jackson wants.
   Jackson was in Chicago for a weekend of meetings with members of
his national staff to discuss plans for the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta next month.
   Jackson said he planned to deliver several major policy speeches
before the convention outlining his programs for health care,
education, the war on drugs, and foreign and defense policy.
   He also met Monday with the editorial board of the Chicago
Tribune and with officials of Johnson Publishing Co., publishers of
Jet and Ebony magazines.

   George P. Shultz said ``proliferation is
winning the race against disarmament,'' and told the General
Assembly on Monday that all nations should sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   The U.S. secretary of state said the danger of proliferation is
``most acute'' in South Asia, meaning India and its rival Pakistan.
Both have refused to sign the treaty and accuse each other of
developing nuclear weapons.
   He said that 136 nations have signed the 20-year-old treaty and
``there is no good reason why every nation should not make such a
commitment. It is a contribution each and every state can make to a
safer world.''
   Shultz also said the United States is ``concerned about the
introduction of advanced missiles into the Persian Gulf war''
because they have killed civilians.
   Hundreds of people were killed on both sides earlier this year
when Iran and Iraq rained missiles on each other's cities. Most of
the weapons were believed to be Scud missiles of an old Soviet
design, some of them equipped with boosters for longer range.
   Shultz address to a special General Assembly session on
disarmament came a week after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze called on the United States to join a permament
nuclear test ban. Shultz did not respond to a series of Soviet
proposals that won praise from many in the 159-member assembly.
   In his speech, Shultz outlined American achievements in arms
control and said Washington's ``top priority'' in the field is
concluding a U.S.-Soviet treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals
by 50 percent.
   ``Does anyone doubt that the spread of nuclear weapons threatens
regional and global security?'' he said. ``What state believes
that, if it now acquired nuclear weapons, its rivals would not do
the same?''
   Now that the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to
reduce their nuclear arsenals, ``it would be tragic for other
countries to pursue the capability to cross the nuclear
threshhold,'' Shultz said.
   He said South Asia is the area of greatest danger, and urged
countries in the region ``to take concrete steps to meet this
urgent challenge. The U.S. is prepared to work with countries
inside and outside the region to find a lasting solution to the
danger of proliferation that satisfies all parties.''
   Shultz was among the final few of more than 100 speakers who
have addressed the General Assembly since the special session began
two weeks ago.
   In his remarks about the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September
1980, he said: ``We already are seeing signs of a dangerous new
arms race which will put at risk countries far removed from the
gulf region itself.''
   Use of the missiles and the killing of civilians makes a peace
settlement more difficult, he said.
   The U.N. session has been divided over key disarmament questions
and diplomatic observers said it will be difficult to draft a final
document which can satisfy most nations and be adopted by consensus.
   The United States and Western allies have called for limited,
pragmatic steps in arms control, continued respect for nuclear
deterrence, a limited role for the U.N. and recognition that
bilateral arms talks must supersede multilateral efforts.
   They say the treaty on intermediate-range nuclear weapons and
some progress in U.S.-Soviet talks on 50-percent cuts on strategic
weapons show that bilateral efforts should be allowed to continue
unencumbered by a multilateral apparatus.
   Western diplomats also have said that conventional disarmament
is as important as nuclear disarmament and urged poor developing
nations which clamor for nuclear disarmament to cut their own
mounting expenditure in conventional armies.
   After the speeches end Tuesday or Wednesday, groups will begin
drafting resolutions and a final document for this third special
session on disarmament in 10 years.
   But if the divisions are too great and the disarmament proposals
too sweeping and utopian, Western nations are expected to demand a
vote, making consensus unlikely.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Appeals For Reconciliation, But Not With Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
appealed Monday for national reconciliation and expressed
willingness to legalize new associations and cooperate with
``communities'' outside official life _ but not with Solidarity.
   ``We can talk to anyone, as long as he is not a client,
especially a paid one, of a foreign court,'' Jaruzelski said. He
referred to grants of $1 million the U.S. government gave to
Solidarity after it became the first free trade union federation in
the Soviet bloc.
   Jaruzelski gave the major policy address at the start of a
two-day meeting of the 230-member Central Committee of the Polish
United Workers' (Communist) Party. He is party first secretary and
president of the Council of State.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, national spokesman for the now outlawed
Solidarity labor federation, said in a telephone interview that any
claim that Solidarity is disloyal to Poland did not merit a
response. He noted that both Poland's Roman Catholic Church and the
communist government have accepted U.S. aid in the past and added,
``We are in very strange company.''
   It was the first Central Committee plenum since a series of
strikes between April 25 and May 10. Five factories were struck and
25 other plants endured brief stoppages or strike threats in the
strongest labor action since Solidarity was suspended in December
1981 and subsequently outlawed.
   Solidarity had been chartered by the government during
nationwide strikes in August 1980.
   Jaruzelski accused the leaders of the recent strikes of an
``almost pathological lack of responsibility'' and said they could
not be ``an objectively credible partner in dialogue.''
   But he said authorities are ready to talk with critics who want
to improve the state.
   ``National reconciliation is a basic condition and one of the
goals of socialist renewal,'' Jaruzelski said. ``It is broader
today than in past years.''
   Jaruzelski said a planned new law on associations would lift
administrative restrictions and grant the associations more
freedom. In the meantime, officials should legally register new,
``socially justified'' groups, he said.
   He mentioned no groups specifically. Indications have emerged
that at least three suppressed groups _ the pro-private enterprise
Economic Society; the Polish chapter of the PEN writer's club and
the Dziekania political discussion club _ may soon be registered.
   About 300 mostly non-controversial private associations were
legalized last year, but applications of many other groups were not
approved, including local chapters of Solidarity and the
Independent Students Association.
   Jaruzelski said ``ideas and practices are crystalizing slowly''
for cooperation with what he called independent communities that
have refused to join PRON, the official national unity organization.
   He proposed a permanent wage-price commission with
representatives of labor, management and consumers that would seek
a social consensus for price increases. He said this would avoid
periodic across-the-board price increases like one this year and
instead aim at a floating system with prices evolving gradually.
   Jaruzelski noted that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will visit
Poland next month and said the trip will add a ``new, significant
chapter'' to Polish-Soviet relations.

   A Soviet immigrant engineer has
been charged with spying for the KGB, authorities said Monday.
   The charges accuse 34-year-old Peter Friesen of providing the
Soviets with information about his job and trying to infiltrate a
West German political party, said chief federal prosecutor Kurt
Rebmann in a statement.
   He said Friesen was trained by the Soviet secret police and
intelligence agency in using coded messages before he emigrated to
West Germany in 1981.
   The statement said Friesen stopped his espionage activities in
November 1985 on KGB orders after West Germany's chief of
counter-espionage, Hans-Joachim Tiedge, defected to East Germany.
   Friesen was arrested in March along with six other suspected
Soviet KGB agents in what Rebmann said at the time was a major
crackdown on Soviet spying activity in West Germany.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, on Monday declined to provide further details on Friesen's
case, including where he worked.
   No trial date was set, he said in a telephone interview.
   Five of the seven arrested remain in investigative custody.
Investigations against the other two are continuing although they
are no longer in custody, Prechtel said.

   A cargo ship on Monday rescued an English
yachtsman whose vessel sank after a herd of whales apparently
attacked the craft during a trans-Atlantic yacht race, the coast
guard said.
   A distress message received by the coast guard in Falmouth said
the yacht had come under attack by whales 1,000 miles west of the
southwest tip of England, the Defense Ministry said.
   David Sellings, 41, who was competing in the Carlsberg
single-handed trans-Atlantic race, told rescuers the 25-foot yacht
sank in seconds but that he managed to recover his dinghy and set
off a distress beacon.
   Sellings escaped unhurt, the coast guard said.
   A Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaisance plane spotted the dinghy
and, after eight hours, Sellings was picked up by the West German
coaster Bridgwater. He was expected to return to Liverpool on the
ship Friday.
   A coast guard spokesman said about 20 whales apparently attacked
the yacht and may have been protecting their young.
   ``It is very unusual for whales to attack a boat, but not
unknown,'' said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.
   The trans-Atlantic race from Plymouth on the south coast of
England to Newport, R.I., began June 9. Eleven of the 94 vessels
have dropped out to date.

   Acrobats, films, art exhibits, folk
songs and spirited public readings on Monday celebrated the 100th
birthday of Portugal's most acclaimed poet of the century, Fernando
Pessoa.
   ``A simple man who became a symbol of universal man,'' Lisbon
Mayor Nuno Krus Abecassis said of Pessoa at the unveiling of a
statue of the poet outside one of Pessoa's favorite cafes in the
Portuguese capital. Pessoa died in 1935 at the age of 47.
   Hundreds of people gathered in the plaza in front of the
Brasileira cafe for the ceremony, including President Mario Soares
aning writers.
   The bronze figure of Pessoa is seated at a table identical to
those of the Brasileira a few feet away and the sculpture includes
an empty seat for a passerby to join the poet.
   In the afternoon there d dozens of leadagain were hundreds of people
outside the
house where Pessoa was born as dozens of doves were released at
3:20 p.m., marking the time of the poet's birth in 1888.
   In a touch that might have brought a smile from the taciturn
Pessoa, a tape recording of church bells was played at the same
moment. Officials said the bells in nearby churches that were to
ring in Pessoa's honor were found to be no longer functional.
   Performers read from Pessoa's works, acted out skitguages
including Chinese, Japanese, Bulgarian, and Estonian.

   Soviet troops are leaving Afghanistan
``faster than we all expected,'' the U.N. mediator who negotiated
the withdrawal said Monday.
   Diego Cordovez refused to say how many Red Army troops have
pulled out since the Geneva Accord took effect May 15.
   He also said he is disturbed by allegations the pact is being
violated.
   The Soviets said they had 100,300 troops in Afghanistan as of
May 15 and would withdraw one-fourth of them by early June. Western
intelligence agencies had estimated Soviet troop strength as up to
115,000.
   In Moscow, Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan
President Najib on Monday spoke of ``resolute retaliatory
measures'' if Pakistan continues to aid Moslem guerrillas battling
the Kabul regime.
   The warning was the first of its kind directly from Gorbachev.
It came as sources in Pakistan said Soviet forces had returned to
some cities in eastern Afghanistan to fight guerrillas who raided
posts defended by Afghan troops.
   Najib and Gorbachev distributed a joint statement over the
official Soviet news agency Tass saying: ``The Soviet Union and
Afghanistan believed that the U.N. Mission monitoring compliance
with the Geneva accords would adopt ... effective measures to curb
the practice (of Pakistan's aiding the guerrillas) which, if
continued would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute
retaliatory steps.''
   Last week, Najib accused Pakistan of violating the accords by
aiding the guerrillas and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said Moscow might have to review its troop withdrawal
schedule.
   Both were in New York last to attend a special U.N. conference
on disarmament.
   Pakistan, in turn, has accused Afghanistan of intruding on its
airspace and territory.
   Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, S. Shah Nawaz, said Monday that
``the world will not be surprised if a crumbing (Afghan) regime
makes a desperate bid to retain the protective umbrella of foreign
troops, the withdrawal of which is the central element of the
Geneva Accords.''
   He addressed the 159-nation General Assembly during a special
session on disarmament.
   Cordovez said later in a news conference: ``Let me say that
nothing that has happened was not foreseen in the Geneva accords.
It is unfortunate that we have encountered difficulties, and I am
... concerned about them.''
   He said the accord ``envisages violations'' and has procedures
to deal with them.
   ``It was also expected, of course, that some people would make a
lot of noise,'' said the U.N. official.
   ``The withdrawal has been going on very well ... faster than we
all expected, and when people now talk about (the withdrawal)
slowing down, I would say, in reference to what? The agreement
provides simply that 50 percent of the troops should be out by the
15th of August.
   Cordovez said he would visit Afghanistan and Pakistan at the end
of the month to review the implementation of the Geneva accords.
   Soviet troops first entered Afghanistan at the end of 1979 to
support its Marxist government.
   The United Nations mediated the accord between Afghanistan and
Pakistan aimed at restoring peace in Afghanistan, with the United
States and Soviet Union signing as guarantors of the pact. Pakistan
adjoins Afghanistan, is headquarters for all major Afghan guerrilla
organizations and shelters about 3.5 million Afghan refugees.

   Mubarak Awad, the Arab-American advocate of
non-violent protest who was deported by Israel on Monday, got his
first taste of passive resistance as a student in the American
South during the early 1960s.
   When he returned home to Jerusalem in 1983 after 13 years in the
United States, Awad applied these ideas to the Arab-Israeli
conflict, calling for civil disobedience to protest Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Awad remained largely unknown until Israeli authorities ordered
him deported last month, saying he played a role in inciting the
Arab uprising that began last Dec.8.
   ``He openly and intensely acts against Israeli control,'' read a
decision last week by the Israeli Supreme Court upholding the
deportation order.
   His case drew worldwide attention and U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz tried to intercede on his behalf.
   Awad's American-born wife, Nancy Nye, said her husband never
tried to be a leader, but she noted his ideas for boycotts of
Israeli products and non-payment of taxes are being used in the
uprising.
   ``If you read an article Mubarak wrote in 1983 and read today's
underground leaflets, it's almost as if he envisioned what was
going to happen,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Ms. Nye, however, has denied Israeli charges that her husband
wrote leaflets advocating violence. He has been criticized by
Israelis for not speaking out against violent attacks by
Palestinian militants.
   Awad, a soft-spoken man with graying, curly hair, said in a
statement addressing Israel's government last week: ``You have the
power, the law and the gun pointing in my face. I am armed with
hope, truth and non-violence.''
   Awad was born in Jerusalem on Aug. 22, 1943, the fifth of seven
children of a Greek Orthodox father and a Protestant mother.
   His father was killed by a stray bullet near his home during the
1948 Middle East war. Awad and his siblings were sent to orphanages
and boarding schools while his mother worked as a nurse.
   Awad graduated from an Anglican school in Jerusalem and in the
early 1960s went to Lee College, a Pentecostal school in Cleveland,
Tenn., intending to become a minister.
   But Ms. Nye said Awad returned to Jerusalem after a little more
than a year, repelled by the racial discrimination he saw.
   ``But there he first became interested in Martin Luther King Jr.
and the methods of resistance he advocated,'' Ms. Nye said.
   ``This was reinforced by his education at a Mennonite school,''
she said. ``He participated in anti-war demonstrations in America,
and from there it was just a natural progression.''
   Awad taught for several years, then in 1970 he returned to
United States to study at Bluffton College, a Mennonite school in
Bluffton, Ohio.
   Later, he earned a master's degree in counseling from St.
Francis College, a Catholic institution in Fort Wayne, Ind., and a
doctorate from the International Graduate School in St. Louis.
   In January 1978, he launched the Ohio Youth Advocate Program,
which offered community service programs for troubled youths.
   Awad returned to Jerusalem in 1983 and two years later founded
the Palestinian Center for Non-Violence. He lectured on civil
disobedience, counseled teachers against corporal punishment and
planted olive trees in West Bank villages to underscore the Arabs'
claim to the land.

<HEAD>Judgeship Nominee Accused of Keeping Liens `Hanging Over a Dying
Man'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's nominee for a California
judgeship was accused at a Senate hearing Monday of keeping
property liens ``hanging over a dying man'' in a lawsuit filed by
the U.S. Olympic Committee.
   Vaughn R. Walker, nominated for a U.S. district court judgeship
for northern California, sharply disagreed with the statement by
the attorney who opposed him in the trademark infringement case.
   Walker told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation
hearing there was ``nothing malicious'' in his representation of
the USOC against the late Tom Waddell, an AIDS victim who spent the
last years of his life trying to organize athletic games he wanted
to call the ``Gay Olympics.''
   The nominee was among 13 current or former judicial candidates
listed by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. as victims of a Democratic
plot to delay Reagan's judgeship nominees in the waning days of his
administration.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., who presided at the hearing, said
many of the delays were caused by the Justice Department's
tardiness in responding to committee information requests on
nominees.
   Other delays resulted because Democrats wanted to investigate
nominees thoroughly ``before they are given a lifetime charter to
sit in judgment on the rights and liberties of the American people,
not afterwards,'' Leahy said.
   There were two major issues in Walker's nomination: his
membership in San Francisco's Olympic Club, which has few black
members and does not allow its female members to vote; and his
conduct in representing the Olympic committee, a case in which the
Supreme Court eventually ruled the USOC had exclusive use of the
Olympic name and the gay organization could not use it.
   Walker said he has been working from within to get the Olympic
Club to change its policies, with some recent success.
   He promised to resign if current efforts to recruit minorities
and allow full voting rights to women become stalled. Supreme Court
Justice Anthony Kennedy resigned from the same club because he
disagreed with the policies toward minorities and women.
   In the Olympic case, Walker was retained by the USOC in 1984 to
prevent use of the ``Gay Olympics'' name. A U.S. district judge
ordered that Waddell _ a former U.S. Olympic decathlon athlete _
and a gay organization were liable for $96,000 in attorneys fees,
and Walker slapped liens against Waddell's home and other property
in an effort to collect the money.
   The liens were not removed until six days after Waddell's death
due to AIDS in July 1987.
   Walker defended his actions, saying a federal appellate court
ruling in the case automatically dissolved the liens. But the
attorney for Waddell, Mary Dunlap, told the committee that she and
Waddell's estate lawyer were unable to get the liens removed
without Walker's agreement, which he refused to give.
   She said Walker left the liens ``hanging over a dying man at the
time he needed to know his daughter would inherit his estate.''
   Ms. Dunlap contended that Walker ``misrepresented the facts'' to
the committee by telling senators that she had done nothing to
obtain an order removing the liens. Ms. Dunlap said that she and
Waddell's estate lawyer repeatedly tried without success to get
Walker to sign a release.
   Walker has drawn opposition from San Francisco's gay community
and the city's Board of Supervisors, which voted unanimously
against the nomination. His main supporter, Republican Sen. Pete
Wilson of California, told the committee:
   ``What principle of American jurisprudence is more fundamental
than that due process of the law requires that however unpopular a
client, that client and that client's cause of action are entitled
to be represented by competent counsel.''
   Walker used similar language in defending himself, telling
Leahy, ``I was perfectly aware of how unpopular the position was.''
But he added that the committee should be looking for judicial
candidates ``willing to take stands'' that are legally correct,
``even though they may be unpopular.''
   Walker said the Olympic committee held firm on the lien, adding
it did so in the hope that the gay organization working with
Waddell _ San Francisco Arts and Athletics _ would raise the money
for the attorney fees.
   ``The client made the decision it had the right to recover the
cost of the suit. That was a perfectly legitimate decision on their
part,'' Walker said, adding, ``I was not at liberty'' to go against
his client.
   He added that in his opinion, ``The liens were ineffective after
the court of appeals judgment'' which vacated them.
   If that were so, Leahy asked, ``Why didn't you sign the
release?''
   ``The client wanted to pursue it,'' Walker said.

   A Canadian man has been arrested and charged with
obtaining classified U.S. military documents that could have been
useful to the Soviet Union or East bloc countries, the government
announced Monday.
   Stephen Joseph Ratkai, 25, was arrested Saturday in St. John's,
Newfoundland, following an investigation by the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and U.S.
Navy intelligence, according to Solicitor General James Kelleher.
   The minister declined to say if Ratkai actually passed or tried
to pass the documents to anyone, but he said the offense involved a
``foreign agent.'' He said that information would come out in court.
   Kelleher gave no details of the contents of the documents. The
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in a television report said the papers
involved operations at the U.S. naval base at Argentia,
Newfoundland, where U.S. and Canadian military forces cooperate in
monitoring the movements of Soviet submarines.
   The solicitor general said no Soviet diplomats or citizens
residing in Canada were involved ``to our knowledge.''
   ``But we believe the information _ the documents _ would be
useful to the Soviet Union and-or other East bloc countries,''
Kelleher said.
   He said Ratkai was not a member of the Canadian armed forces or
government but was believed to be a native-born Canadian citizen.
He gave no other details on Ratkai's background.
   Ratkai was charged under a section of the Official Secrets Act
that prohibits the gathering or passing of classified documents or
information that could be of use to a foreign power and could harm
the interests of Canada and its allies. The offense carries a
maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
   Ratkai was arraigned in a St. John's court on Sunday and is
scheduled to appear in court again on Wednesday.

   Rose Cipollone was a teen-ager, fascinated
by movie stars and working in a 5-and-10, when she took up smoking
in the early 1940s.
   She smoked for 40 years. In 1981, she learned that she had lung
cancer, and she died in 1984 when she was 58 years old.
   But before her death, Mrs. Cipollone and her husband Antonio
sued the three companies that made the cigarettes she smoked,
charging that they were responsible for her disease.
   ``I was sure that if there was anything that dangerous, that the
tobacco people wouldn't allow it and the government wouldn't let
them'' sell cigarettes, she said.
   During the four-month trial which ended in federal court here
Monday, Rose's story was told by her husband and her children, and
by herself in pre-trial statements read to the jury.
   ``She was, how you say, friendly, outgoing,'' Cipollone
testified. ``She was a beautiful woman.''
   She was born Rose DeFrancesco on Dec. 17, 1925 at her parents'
home in New York City's borough of Queens.
   She described herself as a happy child who taught herself to
play piano. Another hobby was cutting out movie star pictures and
pasting them in a scrapbook.
   She met her husband Antonio at an open-air opera during a street
festival, and they married in 1947 after a chaperoned courtship.
They had three children.
   Nothing in her life was as miserable as the chemotherapy that
followed the diagnosis of lung cancer, Cipollone testified.
   ``She wanted to live so bad. She didn't want to think about
it,'' he said.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Afghan
President Najib on Monday warned of ``resolute retaliatory
measures'' if Pakistan continues to help Moslem rebels fighting the
Afghan government.
   The warning, the first of its kind directly from Gorbachev, came
as sources in Pakistan reported that Soviet forces returned to some
cities in eastern Afghanistan to fight guerrillas who raided posts
defended by Afghan troops.
   Since shortly before the Moscow summit that ended last week, the
Soviets have been warning Pakistan and the United States that
continuing to arm the guerrillas violated the accords signed in
Geneva on May 15.
   Under those accords, the Kremlin agreed to withdraw its 100,300
troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Western intelligence agencies
put the number of Soviet forces involved as up to 115,000.
   Gorbachev did not issue any warnings about Afghanistan during
the summit, said U.S. officials, who predicted then that the
Soviets would complete the withdrawal.
   Thousands of Soviet troops already have returned home.
   U.S. officials rejected Soviet complaints about aid still
flowing to the Moslem rebels, noting an exchange of letters between
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that each side would arm its Afghan
allies as long as the other did so.
   A joint Najib-Gorbachev statement distributed over the official
Tass news agency said: ``The Soviet Union and Afghanistan believed
that the U.N. Mission monitoring compliance with the Geneva accords
would adopt ... effective measures to curb the practice (of
Pakistan's aiding the guerrillas) which, if continued would make it
necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory steps.''
   Shevardnadze had made a similar warning after meeting with Najib.
   And Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov lashed out
against Pakistan for maintaining what he called an ``infrastructure
of interference _ military camps, training centers for the armed
groups of the opposition, all manner of subversive, terroristic
groups'' on Pakistani territory.
   He also attacked a White House statement that he said tried to
justify Pakistan's continued supply of arms to the rebels, saying
the Kremlin rejected a U.S. proposal for mutual termination of aid.
   ``The Soviet Union never agreed to its military aid to the
legitimate government in the Republic of Afghanistan being linked
in any form with arms supplies to the insurgent illegal groups
which bank on the forcible overthrow of the government,'' the
statement said.

Impact</HEAD>

   Anti-smoking forces hailed a federal jury's
decision Monday to hold a cigarette company partially responsible
for the death of a smoker but analysts discounted any long-term
impact for the industry.
   ``Mighty Casey has struck out,'' said Dr. Alan Blum, a teacher
at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who founded the
anti-smoking group Doctors Oughta Care.
   However, because the jury did not find the tobacco industry
conspired to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking,
analysts said the verdict could be considered a victory for the $35
billion tobacco industry.
   ``I think it's probably the second-best decision they could have
hoped for,'' said analyst Lawrence Pidgeon of Goldman Sachs & Co.
in New York.
   The decision in the case of Rose Cipollone, who died of lung
cancer after 40 years of smoking, exonerated the Liggett Group
Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. of conspiracy.
   The jury did find that Liggett failed to warn the public about
the dangers of smoking and violated its promise to consumers to
make a safe product, contributing to Mrs. Cipollone's illness.
   The jury awarded $400,000 in damages to widower Antonio
Cipollone from Liggett, which faced separate charges because it
made the brand of cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked before Congress
required health warnings on cigarette packs in 1966. Liggett has
promised an appeal.
   ``It's bittersweet for Cipollone's attorneys since they won but
it wasn't necessarily on the charges they wanted or for they amount
they wanted,'' said Pidgeon.
   The two companies that were exonerated have ``a bit of breathing
room,'' while ``obviously for Liggett it's quite serious,'' he
added.
   Financial markets were closed when the jury made its decision
but Allan Kaplan, a Merrill Lynch tobacco analyst, said he expects
only short-term damage to industry stocks.
   ``It's a loss but not a major loss,'' Kaplan said. ``The only
way this would be considered a negative is if the award made it
exciting for other (law) firms to sue. I don't think that
happened.''
   He said stocks might drop early Tuesday but would probably
rebound during the day.
   Jefferies Group Inc., which specializes in stock trading when
the exchanges are closed, did not handle any tobacco stock
transactions after the ruling although there were many calls for
information, trading assistant Maureen O'Connor said.
   ``We've had a lot of inquiries, but everybody's trying to assess
the news,'' Ms. O'Connor said. The only offer was a bid of $80 per
share with the buyer seeking to sell at $84 a share, she said.
   The tobacco companies waged an expensive defense _ the cost has
been been put at $50 million by one industry analyst _ because they
feared a loss in the case could open the way for many more
liability suits.
   The verdict marks the first time a jury has found any degree of
liability but anti-smoking forces and tobacco industry
representatives indicted it was not the clear victory for which
both sides were hoping.
   Philip Morris attorney Peter Bleakley said he thought the
verdict represented a compromise on the part of the jury. ``I think
they had a holdout,'' he speculated.
   The jurors _ one smoker, two who quit and three who never smoked
_ would not comment on the case.
   Liggett attorney James Kearney said he was very pleased by the
verdict and thought it would discourage further liability suits.
   ``The jury specifically rejected any claims of damages,'' he
said. ``The flood gates have been closed even firmer than they were
before.''
   Marc Z. Edell, the attorney for Cipollone, said he saw a partial
victory in the jury's conclusion that ``that the cigarette
companies should have warned people as early as the 1940s about the
health hazards of cigarette smoking.''
   Richard Daynard, whose Tobacco Products Liability Project in
Boston supports lawsuits against the industry, went further:
   ``It's the first time tobacco companies have been held
accountable for the death and diseases their products cause. It's a
tremendous victory. I've been waiting four years to say something
like that. I think it will be a tremendous encouragement to
plaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorneys to say, `You can do it.'''
   ``This could be the beginning of the end for tobacco
companies,'' added John F. Banzhaf, a George Washington Unversity
law professor who directs an anti-smoking group.
   John J. Madigan Jr., director of government relations for the
American Cancer Society in Washington, called the verdict the
``opening salvo in what will probably be a long battle.''
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., the chairman of a House
subcommittee that has scheduled hearings for July on possible
federal regulation of the sale and promotion of tobacco, said ``the
jury's decision represents a signifcant and long overdue
breakthrough.''
   ``This crack in the tobacco industry's liability armor will have
implications far beyond the specifics of this case,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit Parts of Rockies, Plains; Drought Continues in
Some Areas</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Scattered thunderstorms increased and intensified rapidly Monday
afternoon over the foothills of the central Rockies and into the
central high Plains. But a drought continued in northern Illinois
and caused fires in Michigan.
   Most of the thunderstorms were over Colorado and eastern Wyoming.
   Hail, two inches in diameter, occurred early Wednesday afternoon
about 20 miles southeast of Denver. Small hail was reported at
Laramie, Wyo.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect until Monday evening
for a large part of southeast Wyoming and eastern Colorado and a
small part of the Nebraska panhandle, while showers and
thunderstorms over Minnesota and northern Iowa diminished.
   Thunderstorms were widely scattered over coastal sections of
southeast Florida, Louisiana and Texas.
   The drought, which has withered lawns and crops and caused
watering bans across northern Illinois, entered its 20th day.
   Since May 24, no measureable rain has fallen over Chicago _ the
longest such period for this time of the year. The only year that
comes close to the current dry spell was in 1886, when a tenth of
an inch fell from May 24 to June 12.
   Compounding the problem is that rainfall across northern
Illinois was much below normal throughout April and May as well.
   Wind and dry conditions fueled a fire that burned through
thousands of acres of a rural Michigan area Monday as more than 100
firefighters fought to contain it. Officials were helping evacuate
an undetermined number of people whose houses lie in its path.
   Elsewhere in Michigan Monday, hot weather continued breaking or
tying high temperature marks. Afternoon readings were in the lower
90s at many locations. Marquette, Mich., broke its record high for
the day with an 88-degree reading and Alpena, Mich., tied its
record for the date with 92 degrees.
   In New England, it was hot, too. The temperature at Logan
airport in Boston reached 94 degrees before a sea breeze set in
during the early afternoon. The temperature at south Weymouth Naval
Air Station in Massachusetts reached 98 degrees at 2 p.m. Most
readings across New England were in the upper 80s to lower 90s.
   Much of the remainder of the eastern half of the nation had
temperatures about 90 degrees but with low relative humidities.
   The low humidity helps to keep the air feel reasonably
comfortable, but the downside is that it is maintaining the dry
weather plaguing portions of the Midwest and the Southeast.
   Cloudiness and spotty light rain kept temperatures across
Montana on the cool side. Afternoon readings were mostly in the 50s
to lower 60s.
   West of the Rockies, sunshine and mild temperatures prevailed.
Early afternoon readings were mostly in the 60s and 70s but ranged
up to the 90s in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Livingston, Mont., to 97 degrees at the Weymouth Naval
Air Station; Needles, Calif.; and China Lake Naval Station at
Inyokern, Calif.
   The low for the nation Monday morning was 28 degrees at South
Lake Tahoe, Calif.
   The National Weather Service forecast scattered showers and
thunderstorms extending from the upper Mississippi Valley across
the northern Great Plains and western portions of the southern
Plains to eastern Colorado. Thunderstorms were predicted to be most
numerous over North Dakota and northern Minnesota. Scattered
showers were expected over northern Maine and showers and
thunderstorms should continue over central and southern Florida.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 80s to mid-90s over much
of the nation. Highs will be in the upper 60s and 70s along the
Pacific Coast and from the northern and central Rockies across the
northern Plains to northern Minnesota. Readings were expected to
climb to between 95 and 105 degrees in the desert Southwest and the
big bend area of southwest Texas.

<HEAD>Threatens Execution of Those Dumping Toxic Wastes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The military government said Monday it
will execute anyone convicted of involvement in dumping foreign
toxic waste in Nigeria.
   Duro Onabule, spokesman for President Ibrahim Babangida, said
the death penalty also might apply to foreigners connected with the
dumping of more than 2,000 tons of chemical waste near the town of
Koko, including poisonous and radioactive material. Koko is 150
miles southeast of Lagos, capital of this West African nation.
   Prince Tony Momoh, the information minister, said at a separate
news conference that 15 people had been arrested in the Koko
dumping. He did not identify them but said an Italian who directed
the operation, Gianfranco Raffaelli, fled the country after
newspapers reported the dumping.
   ``There will be no mercy on this issue,'' Onabule told
reporters. ``We would rather do away with 20 Nigerians, stupid
Nigerians, than allow them to endanger the lives of millions of
Nigerians and fellow Africans.''
   He said the government seized the land on which the waste was
dumped.
   Last Friday the government said it had seized an Italian ship
that would be forced to remove the waste and recalled its
ambassador from Italy. An Italian firm was accused of dumping the
waste for European companies.
   Police guarding the site in Bendel state were withdrawn Sunday
for their own safety, the Nes Agency of Nigeria reported. It said
confirmation by chemists that the waste included poisonous
substances prompted removal of the policemen, who had been
stationed around the site to keep the public away.
   Scientists urged anyone who had been near the site to have a
medical examination.
   Attempts by European and American companies to dump toxic waste
in West Africa have provoked protests in recent weeks.
   Five Congolese, including three senior government officials,
were arrested after a dumping scheme was discovered there. Guinea
arrested a Norwegian businessman and charged him with complicity in
dumping American waste on an island near the capital, Conakry.
   Several other countries said they had refused lucrative offers
from Western companies seeking permission to dump chemical waste.

<TEXT>
   A district attorney has asked for more
information in his examination of a U.S. request for extradition of
a Palestinian accused in the bombings of two American jetliners,
judicial sources said Monday.
   They said the request for Mohammed Rashid's extradition ``wasn't
backed by hard enough evidence that would support opening
extradition proceedings.''
   District Attorney Elias Spyropoulos, who is handling the case,
told U.S. authorities Greek law sets a two-month time limit for
providing needed information in extradition requests, according to
the sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   ``What the Americans have so far provided won't do, and if the
additional evidence hasn't landed on the district attorney's two
months from now, the proceedings can't be pursued,'' one source
said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington on
Monday that the United States asked Greece for the immediate
extradition of Rashid, ``a Palestinian terrorist wanted in
connection'' with the August 1982 explosion aboard a Pan American
World Airways passenger jet in Hawaii. The blast killed one person
and wounded 15.
   Redman said the United States was heartened by the Greek
government's June 7 statement saying it was dedicated to the
international fight against terrorism.
   ``We strongly believe that the most effective way to fight
terrorism in this case is to expeditiously begin extradition
proceedings against Rashid,'' he added.
   It was the first time the Reagan administration publicly
acknowledged it was seeking Rashid, 34. American officials admitted
privately last week that they were seeking Rashid's extradition but
declined to make the case public, citing the delicacy of the
negotiations.
   Rashid was arrested at the Athens Airport June 1 by Greek police
acting on information from the United States, according to police.
   U.S. officials said last week Rashid also is wanted in
connection with a 1986 explosion aboard a Trans World Airlines
plane flying over Greece in which four people were killed. Redman
did not mention that case in his brief statement on Rashid.
   The U.S. decision to publicly comment on the case came after a
Greek security official in Athens said earlier Monday that Greece
would try Rashid on the charge of using a false Syrian passport to
enter the country.
   If convicted on that count, Rashid could be given a jail term of
1{ to two years to be served before an extradition hearing took
place, said the security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Government spokesman Yiannis Roubatis declined to comment on the
case.
   Greece has followed a similar procedure in delaying extradition
proceedings until a suspect served a misdemeanor sentence.
   A Jordanian arrested at the Greek-Turkish border in 1982 is
still awaiting extradition to Italy, where he is wanted for
allegedly plotting an attack at a Rome synagogue that killed a boy.
   The Jordanian, Abdel Osama Al-Zomor, served a 20-month sentence
for smuggling explosives before the extradition request was heard.
Although the request eventually was approved by the Supreme Court,
Al-Zomor was sentenced again for being found in possession of an
illegal weapon in his prison cell and remains in Greece.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's Socialist government, which has
good relations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, has been
accused of being lax in fighting terrorism.

   Eight people died when a private
plane with engine trouble crashed while trying to make an emergency
landing Monday night. It was the country's second fatal air
accident in as many days.
   Air authorities in La Plata, 30 miles south of the capital
Buenos Aires, said the pilot of the Havilland Dove twin-engine
craft told the control tower he was having problems with one engine.
   He requested emergency landing rights, which were immediately
granted, officials said.
   But the plane crashed in Arana, a community five miles from the
airport, police at the scene said.
   Eight bodies were recovered, including that of a police
inspector and two children, ages eight and nine, police said. The
ninth victim was taken to a local hospital in serious condition,
police said.
   On Sunday, an Austral Air Lines DC-9 jetliner smashed into a
hillside in heavy fog and burst into flames outside Posadas in
northeastern Argentina. All 22 aboard were killed.
   The cause of that fiery accident, which claimed the lives of 15
passengers and seven crew members, is under investigation. Two of
the victims were Japanese and a third was French.
   Austral is a private carrier bought last year from the state and
competes with the government carrier Aerolineas Argentinas on
domestic routes.

<HEAD>Draft Report Advises Against Converting WPPSS I For Production
Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A draft report for the Energy Department
released Monday appears to favor a South Carolina plant over the
Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state for development of
a new defense production reactor, two senators said.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., an opponent of converting the
mothballed Washington Public Power Supply System No. 1 nuclear
reactor to defense use, said the report recommends against such a
conversion.
   The report, released by an advisory panel to DOE's Energy
Research Advisory Board, seems to favor the Savannah River Plant in
Aiken, S.C. for the new production reactor, Adams said.
   The proposed reactor would replace three Savannah River plants
that now produce tritium for defense use. Tritium, a radioactive
isotope of hydrogen, is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. It
decays relatively rapidly and so needs to be constantly replenished.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the report favored Savannah
River because its current reactor technology _ heavy water _ was
chosen as the best type for producing nuclear weapons materials.
   However, an executive summary of the report said: ``Each of the
reactor types considered can meet the mission requirements of a new
production reactor with varying degrees of risk as to cost and
schedule.... Heavy water is the most mature technology. Others
would require some research and development.''
   The ``heavy water'' option is limited to defense use and could
win favor ``by clearly separating defense missions from civilian
use,'' the report said.
   The technology for recovering tritium from a converted WPPSS
reactor does not exist, according to the report.
   The DOE report, said Adams, ``says what I have said many times:
If we need to produce tritium we should build a special reactor
designed for that purpose....
   ``While these reports are preliminary, they only confirm my
belief that conversion of WPPSS No. 1 is the wrong option and
should not be pursued,'' Adams said.
   But Sen Daniel J. Evans, R-Wash., a supporter of WPPSS
conversion, said the report's conclusions were ``by no means
final.''
   Evans said four of the advisory board's subcommittees are
discussing possible technology for the reactor.
   ``Each subcommittee is inclined to sing the praises of its
particular nuclear reactor technology. It's premature to speculate
about the final decision,'' Evans said.

   Some Chinese officials already have been turned
away at the door while others will come laden with gifts and
promises of banquets to the biggest business conference ever held
between the United States and China.
   Nearly 1,000 Americans from 600 mostly smaller and medium-sized
businesses are to attend the June 20-23 U.S. Joint Session on
Industry, Trade and Economic Development at the Great Hall of the
People.
   They will discuss investment opportunities with about 800
Chinese officials from 22 provinces and municipalities.
   The U.S. Embassy's commercial officer, Dennis Barnes, said it
will be the first time so many smaller U.S. companies visit China,
a nation they previously avoided because of the risks involved.
   The Chinese will try to convince the Americans they are
eliminating investment risks, such as difficulty in repatriating
profits, inadequate energy supplies, red tape, corruption and
insufficient say over personnel matters.
   The event is sponsored by the China Association of Science and
Technology and People-to-People International, a Spokane, Wash.,
group founded in 1956 by President Dwight Eisenhower.
   Wu Ganmei, organizer of the seminar, said Chinese trying to
promote their respective regions for investment will set up about
100 booths in the Great Hall, the political center of China.
   She said about 30 cities have invited the American business
executives to come for first-hand looks in post-seminar tours.
   ``We heard that the Soviet Union and the United States had the
same kind of meeting and (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev talked
for 52 minutes. Well, ours is going to be bigger,'' Ms. Wu said.
   China is now eagerly courting foreign investors in its drive for
rapid economic development. The government has encouraged
more-developed coastal areas in particular to set up
export-oriented industries with the help of foreign money.
   According to Chinese statistics, U.S. businesses contracted for
407 joint ventures and pledged investment of $3.1 billion as of the
end of last year. That figure is second only to the amount invested
by Hong Kong.
   Ms. Wu said 95 percent of the Americans to attend the seminar
will be coming to China for the first time, and Chinese are
scrambling to be at the head of the line to greet them.
   Initially, she said, they planned to limit participation to
representatives from coastal provinces, but later, under strong
pressure, expanded to let in the industrial city of Wuhan and
Sichuan province, home of senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Other
provinces asking to participate have been rejected.
   She said the mayor of Harbin, an industrial city in the
northeast, insisted on coming with a 15-member delegation. ``We
told him no,'' she said, but added that in the end they may allow
the city to send four or five observers.
   Ms. Wu said their offices are already full of books, handouts
and gifts prepared by provinces to woo the Americans, and that
mayors and governors are vying to hold lunch and dinner banquets
for the potential investors.
   Sichuan province was spending $108,000 for gifts and investment
guides and one province had plans to charter an aircraft to
transport Americans to its cities.
   Among the U.S. representatives at the meeting will be James
Abdnors, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration; Richard A.
Lempert, vice president of American Airlines; Malcolm T. Stamper,
vice chairman of Boeing Co.; and Barton Brown, vice president of
General Motors Corp.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Nearly 5,000 people demonstrated in
Cap-Haitien after the funeral of a young man who was killed by a
soldier at a slum area courthouse a week ago, the radio station
Haiti-Inter reported Monday.
   The protest occurred Saturday afternoon around Sacre Coeur
Church in the poor La Fossette quarter of Cap-Haitien.
   Soldiers intervened when the crowd headed for the courthouse
shouting anti-government slogans, and dispersed the demonstrators
with tear gas and shots fired into the air, the radio said. One
protester was beaten with a club, it said, but no arrests or
further incidents were reported.
   Reynold Nivrose, 19, was shot dead June 6 by the
sergeant-at-arms of the La Fossette courthouse, who had been
ordered by a judge to arrest him. Nivrose had protested a ruling by
the judge and fled when the sergeant-at-arms tried to make the
arrest.
   Ernst Malebranche, outgoing president of the Port-au-Prince Bar
Association, said in an interview: ``Both the judge and the soldier
acted illegally _ the judge, who is not authorized to order the
arrest of a citizen, and the soldier, who used his firearm
unnecessarily.''
   A mob stormed and ransacked the courthouse June 6 after Nivrose
was killed.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has commuted the death
sentences of prisoners awaiting execution in his country, the
official Libyan news agency JANA said Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Rome, also said Gadhafi pledged ``to
continue the struggle for abolishing the death sentence.
   ``The leader intervened to cancel the death penalty on those
convicted ... and to change it to a prison sentence,'' the news
agency said.
   JANA did not say how many prisoners' death sentences were
commuted, nor did it say how long the new prison terms would be.
However, Gadhafi recently advocated life in prison without
possibility of parole as an alternative to the death penalty.
   Gadhafi's reported action came a day after he expressed regret
that Libya's highest policy-making body, the General People's
Congress, did not abolish capital punishment at its special human
rights session.

   Israel on Monday deported Arab-American
Mubarak Awad, an advocate of non-violent resistance to Israel's
occupation. He flashed a defiant victory sign before police hustled
him aboard a plane that flew him to New York.
   In the occupied West Bank, troops carrying out a pre-dawn search
in an isolated mountain village fatally shot a nearly deaf Arab man
after he ignored orders to halt, hospital officials and villagers
said.
   Israeli leaders called for tougher measures, including
shoot-to-kill orders, against Arabs throwing firebombs and setting
fires to Israel's pastures and scarce forests.
   More than 2,500 acres were scorched in weekend blazes, and
officials blamed most of the fires on Arab arsonists. American
donors have planted 20 million trees in Israeli national parks,
more than 10 percent of the country's trees.
   The Jerusalem-born Awad was driven to Ben Gurion International
Airport in a black windowless prison van under heavy guard. Wearing
a white shirt and carrying a jacket, he waved and gave a victory
sign before boarding the plane.
   Awad arrived Monday night at New York's Kennedy Airport, where
about 50 demonstrators _ supporters as well as opponents of Awad _
gathered in the TWA terminal.
   ``Awad wishes to express that he was happy to be out of jail
after 40 days of incarceration,'' said Charles Kimball, director of
the Middle East office of the National Council of Churches, who
spoke for Awad.
   Awad did not speak to reporters, but Kimball said Awad planned
to hold a news conference Tuesday.
   The deportation ended a seven-month legal battle to avoid
expulsion. Awad was the 21st Arab to be expelled since the Dec. 8
start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Awad was kept away from reporters in an airport holding cell,
but his letters to supporters from prison were distributed and
shown to journalists.
   ``Even after my departure, my efforts will continue,'' Awad
wrote. ``We have no choice but to continue with the uprising for
our liberation.''
   He vowed in the letters to return soon. Awad, a Christian, has
said he might convert to Judaism as a means to return to Israel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad deported, saying he
played a key role in organizing te uprising. Shamir on Monday
rejected U.S. condemnation of the order, saying if the United
States were confronted with a similar case, ``the person would be
expelled immediately with no second thoughts.''
   ``We think it is unjustifiable to deny Mr. Awad the right to
stay and live in Jerusalem where he was born,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday. ``If he acted illegally, he
should have been charged and tried in court with full due process
of law. He should not have been deported.''
   Awad denied inciting violence against Israel but has supported
the uprising in the territories that Israel captured in the 1967
Middle East war. Although he has little influence in the
Palestinian community, some tactics he advocates, such as tax
boycotts, were adopted by uprising leaders.
   About a dozen Israelis gathered at an airport gate to protest
Awad's deportation, unfurling banners and holding flowers. One
banner read ``Mubarak: Next Year in Jerusalem,'' a reference to a
traditional saying of Jews living outside Israel. Police
immediately confiscated the banners.
   A second protest was held in downtown Jerusalem where 25 Awad
supporters gathered. One held a poster that read: ``Mubarak Awad
was deported today, but his ideas remain.'' Dozens of angry
Israelis staged an impromptu counter demonstration, shouting that
Awad supporters were traitors.
   In the West Bank village of Abwein, Dib Mahmoud Hussein, 43, was
fatally shot in the head after he ignored soldiers' orders to halt,
said Dr. Yasser Obeid, director of Ramallah Hospital.
   One villager, who identified himself only as Samy, said in a
telephone interview that Hussein was hard of hearing and probably
never heard the order. Sami said Hussein was killed during a search
for troublemakers in which soldiers rounded up about 30 youths.
   The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the
circumstances.
   Hussein was the 207th Palestinian killed in the uprising. Two
Israelis also have died.
   Three Arabs working for the military government were injured in
an attack in the West Bank city of Hebron on Monday, the army and
hospital officials said. An Arab postman was stabbed and two other
employees were beaten.
   Palestinian underground leaders have demanded that all Arabs
working for the military government resign.
   After a weekend marred by an upsurge in Arab violence, including
a firebomb attack in Tel Aviv's main mall, Israeli leaders promised
retaliation.
   Shamir told the daily Haaretz he would introduce legislation to
jail arsonists for up to 15 years.
   ``We must put an end to this,'' Industry Minister Ariel Sharon
said on Israel radio. ``Those who throw firebombs must be shot with
the intention to kill ... they must be warned these are the steps
the army is going to take.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a closed-door Cabinet
session he had authorized Israeli civilians to shoot at Arabs
holding firebombs and in response to ``other imminent dangers,''
the Jerusalem Post reported Monday.

<HEAD>Three Armed Prison Escapees Captured at Mountain Cottage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three armed convicts who escaped last week from
a maximum-security penitentiary outside Montreal were captured
Monday at a cottage in the Laurentian hills, Quebec police reported.
   Andres Dugas, police spokesman, said officers seized the
escapees at the cottage 25 miles northeast of Montreal without a
shot being fired.
   ``We had a tip and drove up to the cottage with our armored
truck'' and the convicts surrendered without resistance, he said.
   Recaptured were Robert Henley, 25, serving a life sentence for
murder; Rene St. Arnaud, 29, sentenced to 12 years for armed
robbery, and his brother Pierre, 23, serving seven years for
robbery.
   Henley, who was wounded in a shootout during the escape Thursday
from the Laval Institute, was hospitalized for treatment.
   ``Henley was so badly hurt he couldn't raise his hands above his
head when we asked him to surrender,'' Dugas said.
   The three used a forklift vehicle and garden hose to scale the
wall of the prison, taking a woman guard and a passing woman as
hostages as they fled in a car. The hostages were released unharmed
near the U.S. border.
   Officials said the convicts were seen climbing the prison wall
and in an exchange of gunfire Henley and one guard were wounded.
   They said an investigation is under way to determine how the
three convicts were armed and how they received the weapons.

<HEAD>Eds.: New throughout to CORRECT acreage of Arizona fire and UPDATE
with winds diminishing, 710-acre fire contained in Calif., details
of New Mexico fires. No pick up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Diminishing winds helped firefighters battle a 9,800-acre brush
fire on steep, rocky terrain in southern Arizona Monday, and in
Montana most fire crews returned home after controlling a
17,000-acre grass fire that killed cattle and destroyed three homes.
   A small fire in southern California's Angeles National Forest
may have been started by a killer disposing of a woman's body.
Firefighters elsewhere in the same forest Monday evening contained
a 710-acre brush fire that may have been the work of an arsonist.
   And in southwest New Mexico, firefighters struggled with at
least five lightning-caused wildfires that charred more than 500
acres of grassland and trees. Authorities said the largest fire
burned at least 400 acres of grass, brush, juniper trees and
pockets of ponderosa pine trees on federal lands.
   Twenty-four fires were reported in New Mexico from the lightning
of a Friday afternoon storm, authorities said.
   ``Things are looking very good down along the border,'' said Jim
Payne, a spokesman with the U.S. Forest Service in Phoenix.
   Payne said winds died down Monday to 15 to 20 mph, allowing
firefighters to work towards consolidating fire lines that have
been cut along the flanks of the blaze.
   Payne said the fire, which started Friday in Mexico, has
consumed 2,500 acres in northwest Sonora and 7,300 acres in Arizona.
   He said firefighters hope to have the blaze contained by
Wednesday evening.
   The blaze was named the Peaks fire because it was on Coronado
National Forest slopes so steep that the fire-line elevation ranged
from 5,200 feet to 7,200 feet.
   In southern California, the charred body of a woman was found
early Monday in a small brush fire was an apparent homicide victim,
Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said. Investigators believe
the woman was killed elsewhere, dumped and set ablaze, said Deputy
Gabe Ramirez.
   That fire was fanned Sunday night by northeasterly winds gusting
to 35 mph, but during the day Monday the wind shifted to the
southwest, bringing in moist ocean air, said Forest Service
spokesman Mike Wickman.
   The only reported loss was an apiary, but firefighters managed
to save another set of beehives, Mike Wickman said. No injuries
were reported.
   A fire that raced across 17,000 acres of parched Montana
grassland, destroying three homes and killing cows, was declared
under control Monday.
   An Amtrak train apparently sparked the fire Friday in eastern
Montana, said Roosevelt County Fire Chief Lyle Knudsen. The flames
quickly spread into North Dakota's Williams County. No serious
injuries were reported.
   Most firefighters were withdrawn Monday.
   ``We've just got a few guys keeping an eye out, spot checks, but
all the (fire) departments have returned in,'' Knudsen said.
   Officials were unsure how many head of cattle were lost in the
fire. Cattle displaced by the fire were widely scattered, Knudsen
said, adding: ``We definitely need hay or pasture, because we've
got hundreds of head of cattle without anything to eat.''

<HEAD>Report: 350 Trade Unionists Killed in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 350 trade unionists were
killed and 7,500 arrested worldwide during 1987, the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions said in a report released
Tuesday.
   Despite improvements in some countries, ``the overall picture
remains grim,'' the ICFTU said in its annual survey of anti-union
violence.
   ``There is a tendency among governments to consider respect for
trade union rights as less important than certain other human
rights,'' it said.
   The rights violations occurred in both dictatorships and
democracies, according to the Brussels-based ICFTU, which has 141
affiliates in 97 non-communist nations and claims it represents 87
million workers.
   Its 58-page report said violations last year of union rights
ranged from denying the right of association to ``murder, torture
and imprisonment.''
   The ICFTU report said Latin American unionists faced the most
ruthless treatment.
   It said that in Brazil, more than ``200 killings occurred
related to disputes over landownership, many of which concerned
leaders and members of the National Confederation of Agricultural
Workers.''
   ``There is evidence'' most of the victims were slain by killers
hired by landowners, according to the report.
   In Colombia, paramilitary groups killed at least 74 trade
unionists and ``the real figure is probably much higher,'' it said.
   The report stated: ``The most flagrant trade union rights
violations are undoubtedly taking place in countries under
dictatorship, irrespective of their ideological orientation.
   ``However, in many countries, even those with long established
democratic traditions, there are also restrictions and
infringements of these rights.''
   The ICFTU said laws in Britain and Canada undermined the rights
of trade unions and ``in the United States serious cases of
union-busting continue to occur.''
   It gave this summary:
   _Africa: In most nations, unions are controlled by the parties
in power that forbid rivals, ban or curb the right to strike and
interfere with the organization of union activities. In Ethiopia,
the trade union movement must by law follow Marxist theory and
South Africa ``totally negates fundamental human rights.''
   _Latin America: ``Infringements of trade union rights continue
to occur on a wide scale. Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala
and Haiti, among others, continue to violently suppress union
activities.'' In Nicaragua, the human rights situation generally
has improved but ``specific violations of trade union rights
continue to occur'' including detention without trial and
persecution of union members.
   _Asia: In communist nations ``freedom of association, free
collective bargaining and the right to strike do not exist.''
Anti-communist South Korea used ``extreme police violence'' against
strikers.
   _Europe: The introduction of economic reforms in some East
European nations did not boost trade union rights. In Poland, the
courts rejected more than 30 applications for recognition by
``local enterprise sections'' belonging to the outlawed Solidarity
union federation. Romanian police broke up a demonstration of union
workers in November.
   In Britain, ``the most outrageous attack on basic trade union
rights in recent years continues to be the ban'' on union
membership in the government's intelligence gathering center at
Cheltenham.
   _Middle East: Some Arab nations allow only a single trade union
and in others, such as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar, trade
unions are banned.
   Emergency regulations remain in force in Turkey ``to restrict
human and trade union rights,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The federal government must cooperate with
cities in combating drug abuse through military interdiction, law
enforcement, treatment and education, mayors said Monday.
   The 56th Annual Conference of Mayors approved a sweeping
platform calling for federalization of the war against drug abuse.
   ``We are turning into a banana republic,'' New York Mayor Edward
I. Koch told the mayors at a luncheon session. ``This country today
is swimming in drugs.''
   Koch said cities and states can no longer effectively battle
drug dealing and use. He called for a national drug czar to
coordinate federal efforts with local jurisdictions.
   ``The enemy as of this moment is drugs,'' Koch said. ``The
Russians didn't come yesterday, they didn't come today, and I hope
they won't come tomorrow _ but drug dealers did.''
   Koch disagreed with mayors who have called for a cabinet-level
secretary of public safety, saying such a post could lead to a
national police force. However, he said drug offenders and dealers
should be prosecuted under strict federal laws.
   The platform approved by the mayors called for the president to
outline a national strategy for waging war on drugs; more money to
finance the Coast Guard's drug interdiction efforts; and
legislation that would send much more federal money to local
jurisdictions for drug enforcement, treatment and education.
   Virtually all 175 mayors attending the conference approved the
platform, said conference spokesman Mike Brown. Koch was the only
mayor to address the session on drugs.
   Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., commander of the Coast Guard, said drug
interdiction is the service's top priority, but budget cuts have
forced it to scale back by 55 percent the ships and personnel used
to intercept illegal drug shipments.
   ``That, I think, is an outrage,'' he said.
   Yost said he supports military involvement in the drug war, but
disagrees the responsibility should be turned over to the Defense
Department. Instead, the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs Service
should be charged with planning and executing interdiction efforts,
he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Byrne's Applications for Stay of Execution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court late Monday denied two
applications to halt the scheduled Tuesday morning execution of a
Louisiana man convicted of romancing, robbing and murdering a
service station worker in August 1984.
   The denials of the applications by Edward Byrne Jr., 28, set the
stage for the 100th execution in the nation since capital
punishment was reinstated more than 10 years ago.
   The first application for stay of execution filed by Byrne was
denied with the standard dissent by Justices William J. Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall, who dissent to all executions, said Supreme
Court spokeswoman Toni House. Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John
Paul Stevens indicated they also would have granted the stay, Ms.
House said, but noted that it takes five justices to grant such a
stay.
   The second application also was denied with dissents by Brennan
and Marshall, with Stevens indicating he also would have granted
the stay, she said.
   Byrne request that the court review the case was not addressed,
Ms. House said.
   Byrne was to die in the electric chair at the Louisiana State
Penitentiary in Angola for fatally bludgeoning Roberta Johnson of
Bossier City. He has admitted since his arrest that he started
dating her because she handled large sums of money at the service
station where he worked.
   He admitted hitting her in the head with a hammer, but insisted
that he never intended to kill her.

   Most Americans say a vice presidential nominee's
race and sex are irrelevant, but some independents and Republicans
would hestiate to support a black for the job, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Some Republicans also expressed reluctance about supporting a
woman for vice president, the national survey said. Independents
did not shy from a woman candidate, and Democrats did not lean away
from a black or a woman.
   The survey also indicated a substantial majority of Americans

again. Most Republicans favored another Reagan term; independents

   French voters have deprived Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand of a legislative majority and created the
prospect of an unstable governing coalition for the first time in
30 years.
   Socialists, who had won only a plurality of National Assembly
seats after Sunday's second round of voting, must seek to govern
with the help of Communists or centrists. Just a few weeks ago,
they were widely expected to gain an absolute majority.
   Also, the extreme-right National Front all but vanished from the
legislature, winning just one seat against 35 two years ago. Among
the casualties was party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.

   Louis L'Amour, one of America's
most prolific storytellers whose frontier tales of gunfighters,
lawmen and drifters enthralled millions of readers from waitresses
to presidents, has died. He was 80.
   The funeral for L'Amour, who died of lung cancer Friday at his

L'Amour said Sunday night.
   A few hours before his death L'Amour was proofreading the
manuscript of his autobiography ``Education of a Wandering Man,''
according to Bantam Books, his publisher of 33 years.
   L'Amour wrote 101 books, nearly all of them Westerns, including
``Hondo,'' ``The Iron Marshal,'' ``The Quick and the Dead,''
``Sackett's Land,'' ``Down the Long Hills'' and ``Ride the Dark
Trail.''
   Nearly 200 million copies of the books are in print; his works

   The president's guest house is meant to be fit
for a king, but when explosive gas leaked in and a chandelier
crashed onto the bed where visiting heads of state sleep, some work
was clearly in order.
   Six years and $13 million later, Blair House is now a ``guest
house worthy of this great nation,'' says Ambassador Selwa
Roosevelt, the chief of protocol, who oversaw the restoration.
   Mikhail Gorbachev couldn't stay there last December for his
summit with President Reagan because the house was closed for
repairs. But should he return this year he would find a new wing,
renovated kitchen, plumbing, fire and safety systems, new
electrical heating and air conditioning.
   Not a palace, perhaps, but not the dilapidated antique it was in
June 1982. Then the house was judged uninhabitable after gas leaked
into the boiler room and a chandelier fell on the bed, fortunately
then unoccupied.

ABC-TV special and a float in the Rose Parade.
   Former talk show host Merv Griffin, who owns the Beverly Hilton

   Merchants also are getting into the act, as only Beverly Hills

diamonds, said to be worth millions of dollars.
   The Labor Day weekend 1989 grand finale will bring together the

   The Supreme Court said Monday the government
may be forced to pay victims when a federally approved vaccine
causes the disease it was intended to prevent.
   The unanimous ruling is a victory for a Pennsylvania boy
crippled by polio, but the Reagan administration says exposing the
government to costly damages in such cases could threaten
availability of life-saving vaccines for countless others.
   In the vaccine case, the Food and Drug Administration, which
licenses more than 40 vaccines, had no immediate comment on the
ruling's possible impact.
   The court reinstated a suit in behalf of Kevan Berkovitz, who
was two months old in May 1979 when his pediatrician in Charleroi,
Pa., gave him a dose of Orimune, a polio vaccine made by Lederle
Laboratories.
   Orimune, a form of Sabin oral vaccine, was licensed by the
government in 1963.

   Police and U.S. officials said students tossed three firebombs
and two tear gas grenades at the U.S. Information Service building
in Taegu before they were seized by police guards firing tear gas.
   Police said only three students were involved in the attack in
Taegu, 150 miles south of Seoul, but local press reports said there
were up to 10 attackers and that they also hurled two homemade
bombs.
   The reports said six windows were broken and the office's sign

   President Reagan, sketching his agenda for the
seven-nation summit in Toronto, called Monday for a joint effort to
restore the battered economies of Afghanistan and the Philippines
and an international crackdown on money laundering from illegal
drugs.
   Reagan also said he would prod world leaders to complete
negotiations by the end of the year to cut back on agricultural
subsidies, which cost an estimated $200 billion a year in Europe,
North America and Japan.
   ``It's time that we in the summit nations forget about quitting
time and join in a great `venture to progress' _ a joint venture
that opens the international marketplace and that also strengthens
the weak links in the international economy,'' Reagan said in a
speech at the State Department to the Atlantic Council, a private
group dealing with foreign policy.

   Senators scurried Monday to overcome
last-minute objections by the Reagan administration to a
far-reaching welfare bill designed to help people break out of
poverty through jobs, training and education.
   Following a round of opening statements on the Family Security
Act, key senators retired to the office of Sen. Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., to try to work out differences with the
administration, which was threatening to veto the measure.
   The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
said the first session was ``very promising'' and that the meetings
would continue through the evening and on Tuesday.

   ``After 40 years, we are really excited about seeing our
relatives,'' said John Waghiyi, 64, a Siberian Yupik Eskimo born on
St. Lawrence Island, 43 miles from the coast of Siberia.
   School children waved Soviet and American flags. Local officials

   The 1 million or more Americans
infected with the AIDS virus are becoming more infectious, and the
risk to uninfected people is growing, researchers said Monday.
   ``Non-monogamous sexual contact is becoming more dangerous,''
said James Goedert of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,
Md. He presented his findings at the Fourth International
Conference on AIDS in Stockholm.
   In a study of hemophiliacs, Goedert found that condoms don't
protect against AIDS unless they are always used during sexual
relations. ``Irregular condom use is no better than no condom at
all,'' he said.

   Breast-fed babies are at high risk of getting
infected with AIDS if their mothers catch the lethal virus shortly
after giving birth, several new studies described Monday show.
   Six cases of AIDS being spread through breast milk were reported
at the Fourth International Conference on AIDS.
   ``Breast-feeding women should be aware that if they become
infected, their baby is likely to be infected as well,'' said Dr.
John Ziegler of Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Westmead,
Australia.
   He said the risk of breast-feeding is probably substantially
greater if mothers are infected after birth than if they carried
the virus before they got pregnant.

   Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft
that won't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years
after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the
launch pad, NASA scientists said Monday.
   Disturbances in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus suggest that a
mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond Pluto, John D. Anderson
of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said as NASA observed the fifth
anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past Pluto's orbit.
   Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from
home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is
searching for long gravity waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and
the boundary of the sun's influence.

   The judge who sentenced the

   Botha already has turned down such a request, despite
international appeals that he spare the lives of the five black men
and one woman convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black town
councilor.
   The campaign appeared to be resuming Monday. Neil Kinnock,

   Mikhail Gorbachev's Kremlin made another sweeping
revision of Soviet history Monday by clearing Lev Kamenev, Gregory
Zinoviev and Karl Radek, three leading Bolsheviks who perished in
Stalin's terror of the 1930s.
   The Soviet Supreme Court ``lifted the convictions'' of the
three, and the lesser-known Gregory Pyatikov, and ``is returning to
these tragic figures their honor and their names,'' the government
newspaper Izvestia reported.
   The court's decision does not mean complete rehabilitation
unless their Communist Party membership is restored. The ruling had
been expected since February, when the court reversed the death
sentence of Nikolai I. Bukharin, another old Bolshevik killed in
the purges.

   Officials on Monday showed off the $13 million
renovation of Blair House, the president's guest quarters where
visiting dignitaries can eat in one of three dining rooms,
entertain in a cozy library and have their hair styled at a private
Elizabeth Arden salon.
   ``It is not too grand, but it has elegance,'' said Chief of
Protocol Selwa Roosevelt, who oversaw the restoration. ``It is a
guest house worthy of this great nation.''
   Manager Benedicte Valentiner said she doesn't expect guests for
another six weeks because work is only 90 percent complete. The
chef, for instance, needs to a proper gas range for cooking. The
first official visitor has not been named.
   Blair House, a 115-room complex consisting of four connected
townhouses on Pennsylvania Avenue across from the White House, was
shut down in 1982 after a malfunctioning gas valve leaked explosive
natural gas during one dignitary's stay.

   Today's Highlight in History:
   Forty years ago, on June 24, 1948, Communist forces cut off all
land and water routes between West Germany and West Berlin,
prompting the United States to organize a massive airlift of
supplies into the city's western sector to counter the blockade.
   On this date:
   In 1314, the forces of Scotland's King Robert I defeated the
English in the Battle of Bannockburn.
   In 1497, the first recorded discovery of North America took
place as explorer John Cabot, on a voyage for England, sighted
land, probably in present-day Canada.
   In 1509, Henry VIII was crowned king of England.
   In 1647, Margaret Brent, a niece of Lord Baltimore, was ejected
from the Maryland Assembly after demanding a place and vote in that
governing body.
   In 1793, the first republican constitution in France was adopted.
   In 1842, author-journalist Ambrose Bierce was born in Meigs
County, Ohio.
   In 1908, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States,
Grover Cleveland, died in Princeton, N.J., at the age of 71.
   In 1915, more than 800 people died when the excursion steamer
Eastland capsized at Chicago's Clark Street dock.
   In 1940, France signed an armistice with Italy during World War
II.
   In 1947, Kenneth Arnold of Boise, Idaho, reported seeing flying
saucers over Mount Rainier, Wash.
   In 1948, the Republican National Convention, meeting in
Philadelphia, nominated New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey for president.
   In 1968, Resurrection City, a shantytown constructed as part of
the Poor People's March on Washington D.C., was closed down by
authorities one day after the permit for the campsite expired.
   In 1975, 113 people were killed when an Eastern Airlines Boeing
727 crashed while attempting to land during a thunderstorm at New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport.
   In 1982, proponents of a proposed equal rights amendment to the
U.S. Constitution officially conceded defeat, but vowed to continue
efforts to fight for equal rights for women.
   Ten years ago: A group of about two dozen neo-Nazis who had won,
but declined, the legal right to march in predominantly Jewish
Skokie, Ill., held a rally in Chicago's Marquette Park, where they
were drowned out by more than 2,000 counter-demonstrators.
   Five years ago: The space shuttle Challenger _ carrying
America's first woman in space, Sally K. Ride _ coasted to a safe
landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California, wet weather having
scrubbed a planned landing at Cape Canaveral.
   One year ago: Comedian-actor Jackie Gleason, perhaps best known
for his television series ``The Honeymooners,'' died at his home in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at age 71.
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Al Molinaro is 69. Comedian Jack Carter
is 65. Movie director Claude Chabrol is 58. Actress Michele Lee isre is
nothing else to live in. To live in the present is like proposing
to sit on a pin. It is too minute, it is too slight a support, it
is too uncomfortable a posture. ... To live in the future is a
contradiction in terms. The future is dead, in the perfectly
definite sense that it is not alive.'' _ G.K. Chesterton, English
poet, critic, essayist (1874-1936).

<HEAD>Ray Sharkey Back as Mobster in Return of `Wiseguy'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You viewers who never understood why friends
and co-workers were mad for a TV villain can catch up beginning
Wednesday when CBS reruns the ``Wiseguy'' episodes guest-starring
Ray Sharkey as mobster Sonny Steelgrave.
   ``Wiseguy'' stars Ken Wahl as undercover agent Vinnie Terranova,
who was himself so charmed by Steelgrave he almost went over to the
other side. He has since gone on to chase new villains.
   ``This is a whole new way to do television,'' said Sharkey.
``You can get actors who do mostly movies, because you've got a
story with a beginning, middle and end. It runs longer than a
miniseries and you can develop a character. I've heard someone
refer to this as a soap opera for tough guys.
   ``But I won't be back on `Wiseguy' next season. I'm history. The
only way I could come back is in a flashback. We may do that. We've
gotten so many letters asking for me that I think we should give
them something. There's even a Sonny Steelgrave Memorial Society.
They write us each week asking us to bring back Sonny.''
   Though the Steelgrave episodes that opened ``Wiseguy'' last fall
attracted a following, the show was up against NBC's ``Cheers'' and
``Night Court'' on Thursday night and didn't get big ratings. CBS
is hoping that will change if a new audience catches the show this
summer. Wednesday's episode is the two-hour movie that introduced
the character.
   Sharkey's portrayal of Steelgrave, with his murderous, mercurial
charm, has been likened to James Cagney's Cody Jarrett in ``White
Heat,'' or Humphrey Bogart's Duke Mantee in ``The Petrified
Forest'' and Mad Dog Earle in ``High Sierra.'' Sonny's apocalypse
is nearly as spectacular as Cagney's in the gasoline refinery in
``White Heat.''
   ``I meet people who memorize Sonny's dialogue and say it back to
me,'' said Sharkey. ``Just like `The Rocky Horror Show.'''
   The role in ``Wiseguy'' was a much-needed boost for Sharkey. He
had made a big splash playing an ambitious manager in ``The
Idolmaker'' in 1980, but his career dissolved into alcohol and
drugs.
   ``I went at it full-blown,'' he said. ``It was fun for a while.
Then it got crazy and by 1985 it was sickening. I lost great parts
to guys who became big stars. I couldn't get insured. I'd turn in
my urine tests knowing I would never pass.
   ``I spent several years in and out of hospitals. I'd dry out, do
a movie and end up back in the hospital. I finally found a place
that dealt with the problem and not the personalities. I spent 62
days there, came out and went right to work.''
   He was only four days out of the rehabilitation program when he
began the role on ``Wiseguy.''
   He is currently starring as a Puerto Rican angel in ``Wired,''
based on the controversial Bob Woodward book about John Belushi,
who died of a drug overdose. The angel is a fantasy element added
to the movie. Sharkey says it's like playing the dark side of
``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   The angel picks up Belushi at the morgue ``and shows him the
error of his ways.''
   ``It's great,'' Sharkey said, ``because he gets in all the Blues
Brothers dance numbers and the `Saturday Night Live' comedy
sketches.''
   In August, Sharkey is set to co-star with Jacqueline Bisset in
the romantic comedy ``Scenes From a Class Struggle in Beverly
Hills.'' In September, he is slated to play attorney Roy Cohn, the
former aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy who died of AIDS.
   After finishing the ``Wiseguy'' shooting in Vancouver, Canada,
Sharkey went to Greece and Africa for the movie ``Act of Piracy,''
playing ``a really bad guy, a gun smuggler and modern-day pirate in
the Caribbean. Those guys'll kill your whole family and take your
boat to run guns or drugs.''
   ``Sonny's different. He was a man who could carry out his own
brand of ethics. He did it with such charm and lack of guilt. And,
I think the audience likes to see bad boys having fun. Sonny was a
man who was very family-oriented. His attitude was `Don't judge me
by what I do for a living.'''

   Murphy's Law may never be abolished, but it
appears to have been at least temporarily suspended for the benefit
of the U.S. economy.
   The proposition that ``whatever can go wrong will go wrong''
seemed an apt one for followers of economic affairs over the past
couple of decades.
   Recessions alternated with outbursts of inflation until the two
evils finally came together in a phenomenon that was dubbed
``stagflation.''
   When a long period of growth finally arrived in the 1980s, it
had to be financed with huge deficits in the federal budget and
international trade. Then the stock market crashed.
   But in 1988, for a change, the surprises have been almost
entirely on the positive side. As midyear approaches, there is
little sign of any of the woes that many pundits were forecasting
at New Year's.
   ``When the year began, it appeared that the challenges facing
the global economy would prove too difficult to overcome without a
serious slowdown, if not an outright recession,'' observed David
Resler, chief economist at the investment firm of Nomura Securities
International Inc.
   ``Avoiding that unhappy outcome would require robust growth in
foreign demand for American goods, plus an adequate expansion of
manufacturing capacity so that both foreign and domestic demands
could be satisfied at reasonably stable prices.''
   In addition, Resler said, ``consumer spending would need to
increase only moderately so that the additional savings needed to
replace diminished foreign capital flows would be forthcoming.
   ``There were few optimists about the prospects of meeting those
lofty goals. But the facts now seem to indicate that the U.S.
economy is getting just that mix of growth.''
   The big surprise, of course, is that things have gone as well as
they have in the wake of the biggest stock market drop ever last
Oct. 19.
   The collective vision of stock investors and traders is supposed
to be pretty sharp. When the market takes a big dive, government
policymakers, business planners and lots of other people pay close
attention.
   But eight months after the fact, whatever calamity the crash
might have been foretelling has yet to make its presence felt
outside the securities industry itself.
   The manufacturing economy is enjoying a boom in exports, and
consumers haven't gone into hiding.
   In fact, the passage of time has given increasing credence to
the strange idea, first advanced by a few observers in the midst of
the commotion in October, that the crash actually was a beneficial
event in some significant ways.
   ``Economic performance during the first half of 1988 got a
helping hand from the stock-market plunge last October,''
economists at Merrill Lynch say in a just-issued report.
   ``That event jolted financial markets, and the financial sector
is still shaky. But the liquefication of financial markets that
occurred after Oct. 19 and the resulting decline in interest rates
supported real economic activity as 1988 began.
   ``Even though short-term rates are back to where they were in
September 1987, interest-rate-sensitive sectors, particularly
housing and consumer spending, are stronger than they would have
been had rates not declined earlier.''
   Don't be fooled by all this, say the pessimists. If the alarms
sounded by the crash for the federal budget and the machinery of
the markets themselves continue to go unheeded, they warn, more big
trouble is likely.
   What's more, they add, Murphy's Law applies particularly when
people get comfortable and complacent and think the times are going
well.
   Still, it may be possible, without tempting fate, to add a new
corollary to Murphy's Law for economic purposes: Every once in a
while, unaccountably and when least expected, something will go
right.

<HEAD>Brazilian Town had Communist Revolution before Russians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANUDOS, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This sleepy backlands town has hopes of
becoming less poor than it is because historians have found a 19th
century uprising here to be highly significant in the study of
social dissent.
   Brazilians have come to call Canudos' uprising of 1897 a
communist-style revolution 20 years before the Russians had theirs.
   But the Brazilian army and police crushed the uprising here with
bloody force.
   An army of peasants led by a messianic preacher rose up against
the government, the army and the Roman Catholic Church. At least
15,000 rebels died in combat or were massacred by soldiers.
   Now historians and scientists from the United States, Portugal
and Brazil plan to restore part of the original peasant settlement
and battleground and build a center to study the town's past and
its place in the social history of the drought-plagued and
impoverished Brazilian northeast.
   ``Canudos really scared Brazil,'' said Robert Levine, head of
the history department at the University of Miami in Florida and a
collaborator on the Canudos restoration project, said in a
telephone interview. ``It awakened Brazilians to their own internal
reality of backwardness and rural poverty and raised questions
whether the country would advance. The modernist movement after
1910 had roots there.''
   The restoration project calls for a 6,263-acre Canudos Park and
possibly a ``living museum.''
   Plans also call for a community action program to stimulate
local arts and crafts and to improve health and education in one of
Latin America's poorest regions.
   ``This is important for us,'' said acting Mayor Joao Ribeiro
Gama. ``We don't have a lot except for our history. But almost
anywhere you dig with a piece of stick you find bones.''
   In the 1890s, Canudos was a farming colony that once supported
25,000 people. Today, it seems barely inhabitable.
   It is 1,200 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro on the edge of a
region so desolate that it was for years a hideout for outlaws and,
more recently, a proposed dump site for Brazil's nuclear waste.
   The main street is a dirt road that begins and ends ends where
the town begins and ends, giving way to scrub-covered red plains
stretching to the horizon. The nearest paved road is in Uaua, 32
miles away.
   Most of the town's 12,000 residents now raise goats or work on
government projects during the chronic droughts of the Northeast.
   But on a rise overlooking the town is a reminder of its past:
the bullet-riddled wooden cross erected by preacher Antonio
Conselheiro at the original settlement.
   Antonio Conselheiro, which means Anthony the Counselor in
Brazil's Portuguese language, was a lawyer who roamed the wild
northeastern interior, preaching frugality and chastity, before
settling here in 1893. With a long gray beard and dark robes, he
looked and sounded like a Biblical prophet.
   ``Folks used to call him `the good Jesus,''' recalled Joao
Cardoso da Silva, who says his age is something ``over 100'' and is
by consensus the area's oldest living resident. ``I was just a boy
of 10 at the time, but an uncle and a grandfather of mine left home
to follow him.''
   Antonio Conselheiro set up a commune on an abandoned farm and
established strict rules: no private property, no paper money, no
outside work.
   Later he became more militant and preached tax revolt and civil
disobedience.
   ``Some say he really was a land reformer or an early
communist,'' archaeologist Yara de Ataide of Bahia State
University, the coordinator of the Canudos project, said in an
interview in Salvador, Bahia's capital.
   Peasants came from miles around to follow the new messiah, and
Canudos grew from a tiny hamlet to Bahia's second largest community
after Salvador on the coast. But the Catholic Church and the
government worried about Antonio's growing influence, and the army
was sent to break up his commune.
   However, the ill-equipped bands of peasants, fighting on terrain
they knew well, ambushed and routed three army expeditions and
Canudos became a national embarassment for the government.
   Finally, a fourth expedition of about 10,000 soldiers and police
surrounded Canudos and decimated the settlement during a
three-month siege. On Oct. 5, 1897, troops invaded the commune and
slaughtered the final holdouts.
   ``My great-aunt was there and managed to escape. She used to
tell us kids how the soldiers cut off heads and the blood ran
ankle-deep in the streets,'' said Maria dos Santos, who runs the
Brasil Hotel and boarding house in Canudos.
   Despite its impact, little has been written about the rebellion.
Few outside of Latin American scholars know about the Canudos War.
   The best account was ``Rebellion in the Backlands'' by Euclydes
da Cunha, who covered the uprising as a reporter for the Brazilian
newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. In 1984, the Peruvian novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa published ``The War of The End of the World''
based on the rebellion.
   But the government was less than eager to preserve the memory of
Canudos. One reason was that the issues it raised _ land reform,
rural guerrilla warfare, religious militants.
   ``Canudos became a model for social revolution and resistance to
central authority,'' said Ms. Ataide of Bahia State University.
   After the fighting, the settlement was burned and razed. Later a
dam was built on the Vaza Barris River below Canudos and most of
the commune was flooded by the reservoir it created.
   But the town's past won't go away.
   Luiz Carlos Lopes de Magalhaes, a mapmaker with the historic
project, walked through a seemingly trackless plain in the area
known as the Valley of Death. He knelt by a ring of stones and
pointed to a partly exposed skull, which had a jagged hole in the
forehead.
   ``This probably was a soldier,'' he said. ``They came here after
the ambush to be treated or die. There are rusty canteens and
ammunition clips all around here.''
   Magalhaes thinks Antonio Conselheiro got a raw deal from history.
   ``They make him sound like a fanatic. But a lot of people here
think he was just trying to help the poor,'' he said.
   Levine of Miami University maintains that portraying Antonio
Conselheiro as a communist or a land reformer misses the mark.
   ``He was more like an Ayatollah Khomeini or a Jim Jones, of the
People's Temple in Guyana _ an austere, devout, unworldly chaplain
who tried to follow the precepts of the Catholic Church by
withdrawing from the world,'' he said.
   ``Canudos is important to understanding the background of social
dissent. We need to study it in relation to other events in the
world, like the rise of fundamentalism in the Mid-East.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Unhurriedly and with caution, determined to
avoid the flaws that contributed to the Challenger disaster, NASA
is moving toward the resumption of shuttle flights later this
summer. This time a veteran shuttle pilot will be a launch czar and
a host of other changes have been made in hardware and procedure to
minimize risk.

<TEXT>
   On that cold day, Jan. 28, 1986, any
one of half a dozen officials, aware that the weather might be
damaging, could have halted the launch of space shuttle Challenger.
But none did, and 73 seconds after liftoff, the spaceship and its
crew of seven were destroyed in a fiery explosion.
   Never again, NASA says, will the launch decision be so flawed.
The rules have been changed, and when Discovery resumes shuttle
flights this summer, one man will have the authority to command a
launch or to scrub it.
   He will look to many experts, analyzing every scrap of
information, for help. But, in the end, the decision to launch will
be his.
   That responsibility lies with Robert L. Crippen, a 50-year-old
Navy captain who has gone into space more often on the shuttle than
any other person. He piloted the very first mission in 1981 and
since has commanded three other flights.
   ``I feel from my military training that there has to be one
person in charge,'' Crippen said. ``Somebody needed to sign on for
it, and I'm willing to do it.''
   His fellow astronauts are delighted to have one of their own
calling that critical shot.
   Rick Hauck, another Navy captain, who will command Discovery on
the first post-Challenger mission, said, ``I flew my first mission
with him in 1983, and I can't think of anyone who has more of a
broad, in-depth knowledge of the whole shuttle system. And he's a
good thinker. So Bob is the right person to be there.''
   Creation of a launch czar is just one of many changes introduced
in the program as a result of the Challenger disaster. Many have
been time-consuming and have led to delay after delay in getting
the shuttle back into space.
   Some critics say NASA has been too conservative, that it is
delaying for any reason because it has lost the nerve to launch.
Space agency officials heatedly deny this.
   ``The No. 1 priority for the U.S. space program is to get the
shuttle flying again, but we'll not fly until we feel we are
ready,'' said Rear Adm. Richard Truly, associate administrator for
space flight and NASA's highest shuttle program official. ``We'll
never have a perfectly safe vehicle, but we'll have one we'll have
confidence in.''
   The most publicly visible shuttle changes have been in the
overhaul of top NASA management. All involved in the Challenger
launch decision have been replaced. The solid fuel booster rocket
blamed for the accident has been redesigned.
   The Rogers Commission that investigated the explosion for
President Reagan said the direct cause was a small leak in a joint
between segments of one of Challenger's two booster rockets. Flames
shot past two synthetic rubber O-rings and touched off the
explosion of the huge fuel tank.
   The commission report said cold weather, 36 degrees at liftoff
time, contributed by robbing the O-rings of their resiliency,
preventing them from sealing the joint properly. Some booster
engineers had argued against launching in the cold, but their
concerns were blocked by lower level executives from reaching top
managers.
   While the shuttle fleet has been grounded, NASA has made more
than 80 modifications to the booster rockets and an additional 300
to shuttle systems and support equipment. The spaceship itself has
undergone 210 changes, including improvements to the engines,
structure, brakes and landing gear and installation of a blowout
hatch to the crew cabin and a telescoping pole the astronauts could
slide down in an emergency landing.
   ``That's a large number of changes, and we are treating the
flight as a new test flight of a vehicle that's not quite the
same,'' astronaut Hauck said.
   Less visible are the changes in the approach to launching a
shuttle.
   Items:
   _Bob Sieck, happy to have only one job, launch director, instead
of the multiple jobs he held as director of shuttle operations
during Challenger. ``The launch decision process now is more
formal, more crisp, and the responsibilities of the individuals are
more well-defined,'' he says.
   _Eugene Kranz, director of shuttle mission operations at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, overseeing an overhaul of flight

that had NASA ``struggling to meet an accelerating flight rate as
our schedules were becoming unmanageable at the time of the
accident.''

   The review, Crippen said, will be much more thorough than those
that preceded the last few shuttle launches. ``Because of the
higher flight rate and other factors, we had diverged from the high
level of detail that it had started out to be,'' he said.
   ``Following the review, we will end up with action items,'' he
said.``Some of these will be designated launch constraints, meaning
they have to be corrected and closed out before we can fly.''
   Two days before the planned launch, Crippen will activate his
newly created Mission Management Team, a group of 20 NASA and
contractor managers skilled in all elements of the shuttle system.
   ``We will look at all the changes that have occurred since the
flight readiness review, and we will report on the closure of the
launch constraint items,'' he said. ``We will start looking at
things like weather. Out of this meeting will come a decision on
whether or not to start the launch countdown.''
   The management team will meet again the next day to review
countdown progress and to decide whether to fuel the
half-million-gallon external fuel tank. At three hours before
liftoff, the members will settle before consoles in a
glass-enclosed corner of the launch control center, three miles
from the launch pad.
   NASA's leaders will assemble in another glass enclosure on the
other side of the control center called the operations management
room. Here will be people like administrator James Fletcher,
shuttle program director Arnold Aldrich, Truly, field center
directors, the agency safety director and others. The two groups
will talk by intercom and telephone.
   In the past, the final OK to launch came from the senior
management official present. He nodded assent based on the
recommendation of the launch director.
   ``The operations management room will be a more businesslike
place than we're used to,'' Crippen said. ``In the past, you could
say that if nobody showed up in that room, you could have gone
ahead and launched, with the launch director making the decision.
Now each person in that room, just like those on my Mission
Management Team, will have his own input into the launch decision.
If anyone has a concern, he can bring it to me. The lines of
communication will be open to everyone, anywhere in the system.''
   Between the two glass cages, launch director Bob Sieck and his
launch controllers will be monitoring the countdown, in touch with
the astronauts aboard the shuttle and with the flight control
center in Houston.
   Sieck says it's a luxury to be the launch director alone and not
have to be saddled with the multiple assignments he had previously
as director of shuttle operations at the Kennedy Space Center.
   Crippen emphasizes the main responsibility for the countdown
lies with the Sieck crew.
   ``They have pre-ordained ground rules and launch commit
criteria, and we are there primarily to monitor and to handle the
off-nominal occurrence, things that we were not smart enough to
foresee,'' he said.
   A key moment will come at the nine-minute-before-liftoff mark in
the count, when a planned hold will be called. At this point, Sieck
will poll the members of the launch team to determine if there are
any problems. Crippen will monitor, conduct his own poll, and then
will make the decision whether to start the clock for the final
count. ``The vote must be 100 percent or we won't go ahead,'' he
said.
   Sieck said that during the Challenger count, the results of the
poll, all positive, were relayed to the operations management room,
and the senior official there, associate administrator Jesse Moore,
Truly's predecessor, said to proceed. He and others in the room did
not know of the cold weather worries of the rocket engineers.
   ``As the launch team, we would look to that room,'' Sieck said.
``The program director was there, the associate administrator was
there, the center directors were there. But it was not clear as to
the focus of the responsibility.
   ``That shouldn't imply that the right discussions or the right
communications did not occur. But it wasn't specific, and one of
the Rogers commission findings and recommendations was to improve
the launch decision process.''
   Because of the Challenger accident and subsequent reviews of all
systems, Sieck and his team will have more systems and subsystems
to monitor more closely during the countdown.
   ``We have added more launch commit criteria _ red lines, as we
call them,'' Sieck said. ``We've added about 25 percent more
instrumentation measurements. They're primarily in the high-energy
systems, in the main engines, the auxiliary power units, the fuel
cell system and in the reactants.''
   Because of the performance of these systems over 25 shuttle
launches, Sieck said he did not expect the extra monitoring to make
a launch postponement more likely.
   But he said new weather restraints could cause delays.
   ``The weather criteria are more conservative,'' he said.
``Especially in the areas of potential severe weather and potential
triggered lightning.''
   As an example, when Challenger was launched, the rules said
there could be no clouds or lightning within five miles of the
launch pad or along the flight path. That circle has now been
increased to 10 miles.
   Intitially, at least, there will be no launch in temperatures
below 55 degrees.

   Visitors entering Forrest S.
McCartney's office can't miss this sign: ``If it isn't safe, say
so.''
   As director of the Kennedy Space Center, McCartney is overseeing
the preparation of Discovery for the first post-Challenger space
shuttle flight later this summer.
   The sign sums up his approach. If anyone, anywhere in the
system, has a concern, that person should report it.
   ``I'd rather call a timeout to take a look at those concerns
than to move on without checking thoroughly,'' McCartney said in an
interview. ``I don't want anyone on launch day to say, `Is there
something I overlooked, something I should have reported and
didn't?' We want to be sure we have done everything humanly
possible to make this vehicle as safe as it can be before it
flies.''
   Several workers have come forward with legitimate concerns.
Other reports have proved unfounded, and have caused processing
delays. McCartney says he'd rather be safe than sorry.
   McCartney, 57, was a lieutenant general in charge of the Air
Force Space Division when NASA administrator James C. Fletcher
tapped him to be center director. He was part of the space agency
overhaul after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of space shuttle
Challenger. He retired last year from the Air Force and continued
in the job as a civilian.
   McCartney has gained a reputation as a ``hands-on'' director who
takes a personal interest in his 13,000 workers and the shuttle
hardware that is checked out, assembled and readied for launch here.
   He pays close attention to the processing through daily staff
meetings, weekly sessions with center managers and monthly
conferences with key NASA shuttle officials. said.
   ``I also get out and talk with the people,'' McCartney says. ``I
want to know what they are thinking. Almost every day I personally
check the hardware _ the orbiter, the solid rocket motors. If I get
a free hour, I say it's time to go out and kick some tires, so I
get in the car and go out there.
   ``The workers talk freely with me. They discuss a full spectrum
of concerns, from processing concerns to work hours. They don't
feel intimidated. It's a good repartee, and I feel good about it.''
   When he first took over as director, NASA's target for resuming
shuttle flights was February 1988. That date has slipped several
months, and, while the delays have been frustrating, he says they
have been necessary.
   McCartney said the emphasis on quality and safety has created
enormous paperwork, or flight documentation, as he calls it.
   ``We close out flight documentation in an orderly way,'' he
said. ``We are not going to move hardware to the next station until
it is ready. It's time-consuming, but, when in doubt, don't. No one
is in a hurry to make a mistake.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The ritual is old, the setting is new. Atlanta,
the capital of the New South, full of bustle and expansive with
civic pride, is host to its first national party convention. The
delegates will find their attention firmly directed to the city's
future rather than the magnolia past.

<TEXT>
   Democrats arriving at the nation's busiest
airport for their quadrennial political binge will find the
antebellum South not only gone with the wind but without the
prospect of a sequel.
   Delegates looking for nostalgic flashbacks to crinoline
petticoats and hoop skirts, moonlight and magnolias in modern
Atlanta will just be whistling Dixie from memory and with no help
at all from the convention podium.
   ``You won't hear Dixie and you won't see any Confederate flags
at this convention,'' vows Don Fowler, a political science
professor from South Carolina who is the convention's chief
executive officer. ``Today's Atlanta is a vibrant, dynamic city of
the future, which makes it an ideal host for the party of the
future.''
   The Stars and Bars won't be quite out of sight. The Georgia
legislature put off until after the convention a battle over
redesigning the state flag, now three-quarters occupied by the
Confederate battle flag.
   While the chaos in Chicago at the '68 convention has not been
entirely forgotten, the power structure in this Sun Belt city isn't
greatly worried about unruly demonstrations when the convention is
gaveled to order on July 18.
   ``We shouldn't have any trouble with demonstrations, mainly
because everybody running this city has been organizing them for 20
years,'' allows Andrew Young, the super-cool chief salesman for
Atlanta, who in that two decade-span has moved from the ranks of
civil rights marchers outside city hall to the mayor's office
inside.
   The site selection committee, of course, was sold the new
Atlanta, which has just passed Chicago and New York as the nation's
leading convention and trade show hub, ranks as the third
fastest-growing high-tech center in the country and basks in its
poll ratings by the Cushman-Wakefield realty group as the nation's
``most livable city.''
   The ``Big Peach,'' as the locals are obliged to call this
confusing metropolis grid linked by 23 streets, roads, boulevards,
avenues and places named Peachtree, is the home of Coca-Cola, Delta
Airlines, Turner Cable News Network, Georgia Tech, Emory and
Morehouse College, the baseball Braves, basketball Hawks, football
Falcons and architect John Portman Jr., the ``atrium king,'' who
waved his T square over the decaying downtown business district and
brought forth, well, what else? Peachtree Center, 11 city blocks of
soaring glass and aerial skywalks linking seven office towers, a
mall and three hotels, including the 1,674-room Marriott Marquis,
the country's largest convention hotel.
   Georgia's capital, with its gold leaf domed Statehouse modeled
after the nation's Capitol and once echoing with the footfalls of
Eugene Talmadge, Lester Maddox and Jimmy Carter, now eagerly
projects itself as the financial capital of the South. Young
envisions it as ``the next great international city,'' a sort of
Zurich or Duesseldorf with grit and grits.
   More than 400 of Fortune's 500 corporations and five major
Japanese banks have branches in ``Hot-lanta,'' as the business boom
is boosted on T-shirts and buttons that delegates will find in
their welcome bags.
   Although it is on the sightseeing agenda for delegate spouses,
the site selection committee was steered away from Stone Mountain,
the Confederate Mount Rushmore, where the equestrian figures of
Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee gallop across
two football fields of solid granite in the world's largest
bas-relief sculpture against a sound track of Elvis Presley moaning
``Dixie.''
   ``Stonewall Jackson got run out of town long ago,'' laughed cab
driver Lucian Hayer, who had just attended ``courtesy school'' and
put new sheepskin seat covers in his 1976 Ford wagon in deference
to the arriving Democrats. ``Folks around here are more into
Michael, Jesse and Maynard Jackson.''
   Rock star Michael Jackson recently writhed to sellout crowds for
three nights at the Omni, the basketball arena where the Democrats
will perform their nominating rites in somewhat cramped quarters.
Jesse, of course, is the charismatic candidate whose clout in the
primaries could be tracked locally when his campaign headquarters
moved from a storefront to a suite of offices in a downtown bank.
Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, is said to be poised
for a comeback if Young runs for governor.
   In keeping with Atlanta's pride of racial harmony, more tourists
today ask directions to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center, with its
eternal flame, reflecting pool and the stark tomb marked ``Free At
Last,'' than to Wren House, where Joel Chandler Harris wrote of
Uncle Remus and the Tar Baby.
   During ``downtime'' at the first national party convention ever
held here, some of the 4,126 delegates and their alternates will no
doubt attend services at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King
followed his father and grandfather into the puplit.
   Auburngiven to the Cyclorama, the
huge three-dimensional evocation of the 1864 battle of Atlanta,
executed a century ago by German and Polish artists.
   Confederate soldiers up on pedestals mostly stand sentinel these
days over the graveyards of Atlanta, but there is a statue downtown
of editor Henry Grady, who a century ago eloquently proclaimed ``a
new South,'' and what may be the nation's only sculpture of Nelson
Mandela, South Africa's apartheid foe.
   What with the Jimmy Carter Library, the High Museum of Art, a
first-rate symphony orchestra, a thriving avant-garde art colony
and the refurbishing into a concert hall of the Fox theater, that
Moorish mirage of a movie palace, Atlanta has become a cultural
center of such compelling diversity that running back Herschel
Walker recently pirouetted on stage to make his ballet debut,
followed a few weeks later by Rudolf Nureyev.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Florida's citrus groves, severely damaged by
freezes in 1983 and 1985, have rebounded and near-record crops are
expected this season. The problem is, sales of orange juice and
grapefruit are on the decline, with many Americans turning to other
juices, diluted products and soft drinks.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are losing their taste for orange
juice and the demand for fresh grapefruit has soured at a time when
the Florida groves are laden with a bumper crop.
   And that has the billion-dollar Florida citrus industry worried,
worried enough to fight back with a proposed $72 million
promotional campaign.
   For the first time since such statistics have been kept, retail
sales of orange juice _ Florida's premier citrus product _ have
declined two years in a row. So has the demand for grapefruit
juice, but that's not as serious since much less of the crop goes
into juice.
   Orange juice is facing increased competition from other juices,
diluted products and soft drinks, says Dan Gunter, executive
director of the Florida Citrus Department.
   Image makers have some concerns about fresh fruit, too.
   ``Fresh citrus products lack identity, especially fresh
grapefruit,'' Gunter told the Florida Citrus Commission recently.
   The department, charged with the promotion and marketing of the
state's fresh and processed citrus products, is proposing some
hard-hitting programs and increased budgets for the 1988-89 season.
   Merchandising and publicity campaigns are being mounted to try
to convince people that orange juice is just as refreshing as any
other beverage and probably much better for them.
   ``We want to maintain orange juice as the gold standard of
juices,'' says the Citrus Department's marketing director, Bill
Gordon.
   Surveys show that the orange juice market share dropped 6
percentage points from 1980 to 1987, while apple juice gained 6
points. Orange juice sales are at 59 percent of the juice market,
with apple juice solidifying its hold on second place at 17 percent.
   Florida expects to produce 140 million 90-pound boxes of oranges
this season, 90 percent of which will go into processed juices.
   The current grapefruit crop is estimated at a near record 53
million 85-pound boxes, with production expected to soar to about
60 million boxes by the mid-1990s. Most of the state's export
grapefruit is grown in the Indian River section of the citrus belt.
   Excellent growing conditions (ample rainfall early in the season
and mild winter weather) have resulted in outstanding crops since
the 1983 and 1985 freezes, which devastated the northern sections
of the citrus belt.
   ``There can be little doubt left that our industry is making a
strong recovery from problems encountered earlier this decade,''
Gunter says.
   The projected orange crop for this season would be the largest
since the 1980-81 season, when 172 million boxes were picked. ``The
fruit just kept right on growing,'' says Bob Terry, citrus
statistician with the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service in
Orlando.
   In the coming season, the department wants to spend $39.4
million to promote orange juice sales, a 17.3 percent hike over the
current $33.6 million.
   The problem is rather more complicated with grapefruit, fresh or
otherwise, since it is seen as dour and sour, an unglamorous sort
of lump for today's life styles.
   A recent study shows that Americans have quit spooning up the
tarty fresh fruit by almost two pounds per capita since the 1970s.
Some say it is no longer trendy and that nutrition-conscious
consumers have forgotten about it in favor of more glitzy _ and
more heavily promoted _ products.
   Gunter and his crew want to ``develop an image and identity''
for fresh grapefruit in the modern world, making it, in computer
terms, more ``user friendly.''
   About half of the grapefruit crop is sold as fresh fruit.
   For the even more difficult job of selling 100 percent-pure
grapefruit juice, special TV commercials are being test-marketed in
support of merchandising and public relations campaigns to explain
the health benefits of grapefruit juice over other juices and
beverages.
   The commercials emphasize the ``unique,'' ``clean-tasting'' and
``invigorating'' attributes of the juice and are aimed primarily at
women 25-54, a category of steady users.
   The proposed budget for promoting processed grapefruit juice is
$11.6 million, up 62.1 percent from the $7.2 million being spent
this season.
   The department's proposed fresh fruit spending plan for 1988-89
is $21.7 million, an increase of 38.7 percent from the current
$15.7 million.
   While the domestic demand for fresh Florida grapefruit has
declined, the export markets have expanded dramatically over the
past two seasons and overseas shipments are expected to set records
in volume and value this year.
   ``I've never seen the situation any better,'' says grower J.J.
Parrish Jr. of Titusville.
   Japan is by far the state's best grapefruit customer, importing
almost 9 million cartons (about 42 pounds each) last season. State
citrus officials are working closely with American trade
representatives, trying to persuade Japan to expand its quotas for
the fruit.
   The Citrus Department also plans a stepped-up promotion campaign
in other Pacific Rim countries and Europe.
   Robert Behr, state director of economic and market research,
describes the problem this way:
   ``The question is whether we can respond to these increases in
production, and help demand grow accordingly to absorb them.''

   Richard Dysart, the judicial patriarch on
NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' finds himself in a cliffhanger romance with a
younger woman because of the writers strike.
   Dysart's character, Leland McKenzie, has become the object of
the affections of a somewhat aggressive third-year UCLA law student.
   Had not the Writers Guild of America walked out on March 7, the
romantic dilemma might have been resolved before the end of the
season. But the strike forced ``L.A. Law'' to end the season
without making its final two episodes.
   ``You can say Leland became the cliffhanger by chance,'' Dysart
says. ``He was approached by this lovely young lady. She's a law
student and the granddaughter of one of our clients.''
   The young woman, played by Dana Sparks of CBS' ``Falcon Crest,''
is separated from McKenzie by more than 30 years.
   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' Dysart says. ``The
writers can't do anything because of the strike. I don't know if
she's coming back next season or if they'll just drop it.''
   Clearly, Dysart is delighted that his character is involved in a
romance, even a May-December one. Although the head of the law firm
of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, he has been somewhat of an
enigma. His character has not yet been explored as deeply as some
of the others.
   Dysart, who has a hearing problem, suggested that he wear his
two hearing aids in a show in which he went into court in an age
discrimination case. Since then, he wears the hearing aids in
court. Michael Kuzak, played by Harry Hamlin, is the only one in
the law firm who knows about the hearing aids.
   The series is the first for Dysart, who has spent most of his
career on the stage. On Broadway, he created the role of the coach
in Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play ``That Championship
Season.'' He has also had parts in a number of movies, including
the recent hit ``Wall Street.''
   ``I was trying to make it by doing films and TV movies,'' he
says. ``I suppose I hoped some day a good series script would come
along. The odds against that are pretty high. I was overjoyed when
this came about. I had no doubt that it would be successful.
   ``I heard about the show and asked my agent to get a script.
After I read the script I called him and told him I wanted to talk
to Steven Bochco. My agent said, `That's funny, he wants to talk to
you.'''
   Dysart recently returned to Boston, where his alma mater,
Emerson College, awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree. ``I
earned my bachelor's and master's degrees,'' he says, ``so it was
kind of them to give me an honorary degree.'' He also returned to
his home in Maine to visit his ailing father and get in a few days
of fishing.
   He got married last Labor Day to Katheryn Jacobi, a figurative
contemporary artist. He was married twice before and has no
children. His new wife, a widow, has a 19-year-old son. She is
currently illustrating a new book on Charles Dickens.
   ``She moved into my neighborhood and we have similar cars,''
Dysart says. ``One thing led to another. We became fast friends
four years ago and got married a year ago.''
   Dysart gave little thought to acting as he was growing up in the
Kennebec Valley in Maine. He worked on the local radio station, but
when he got to Emerson his interest changed to acting. Later, he
spent four years in the Air Force in Washington, handling
assignments for investigators with the Office of Special
Investigations. He returned to Emerson to get his master's, then
headed for New York.
   ``Off-Broadway was just getting under way about that time,'' he
says. ``I worked at the Circle in the Square Theater at Sheridan
Square. We had a lot of good people there. I worked for many years
off-Broadway and Broadway.
   ``In the 1960s I got interested in repertory theater and was one
of the founding members of the American Conservatory Theater in San
Francisco. Actually, we founded it in Pittsburgh, but we moved to
San Francisco in 1967.''
   After a year in San Francisco he returned to New York to appear
with George C. Scott in a revival of ``The Little Foxes.''
   Dysart got his first movie role while in San Francisco through
his friendship with Scott. The movie was ``Petulia'' in 1968. He
also appeared with Scott in ``Hospital,'' ``Hindenburg,'' ``The
Last Days of Gen. Patton,'' and Scott's television series ``East
Side, West Side.''
   He played Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Patton movie and in a
BBC production called ``Churchill and the Generals.'' He plays
President Harry Truman in the upcoming ABC miniseries ``War and
Remembrance'' and in July will play Truman again in the CBS movie
``Day One.'' That film is about the making of the atomic bombs and
the decision to drop them on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

   ``Godspell,'' the joyous little pop musical that
put the Bible on Broadway, is back in town.
   The show, now playing at the Lamb's Theater, was directed by Don
Scardino who has a long association with the hit musical. He played
Jesus for more than 1,000 performances during the show's seven-year
run in New York.
   ``Godspell,'' based on the Gospel of St. Matthew, is one of
those classic show business tales of success: Young man
(John-Michael Tebelak) writes show as a master's project at
Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh. Show gets done on a shoestring in New
York at a small experimental theater off-off-Broadway. Gets
favorable reviews. A revised version, with new songs by Stephen
Schwartz, opens at a larger off-Broadway theater and eventually
makes its way to Broadway. At one time during the 1970s, there were
30 companies of the musical playing around the world.
   Scardino first came to ``Godspell'' in 1972 at the age of 24. He
starred as Jesus in the Toronto company of the show and later came
to New York for a two-year run.
   ``Finally, with shinsplints, a sprained ankle and nodes on my
vocal chords, I gave up the ghost and left the show,'' Scardino
says. ``After it had been running five years off-Broadway, I was
asked to open up the Broadway company.
   ``I was flattered. So I wrapped ankles, visited the throat
doctor and went on,'' says the director who started in show
business at the age of 12 as an actor.
   Throughout its long run in the 1970s, ``Godspell,'' a gentle,
free-spirited retelling of the last seven days of Jesus, kept
slowly changing.
   ``The show became a little bloated, and the simplicity
disappeared,'' Scardino says. ``Unlike a regular show where someone
directs it and the production stays that way, John-Michael (who
died in 1985) was basically the overseer of this troupe of lunatic
actors who had come out of an improvisatory style. He encouraged
the show to be flexible and free.''
   Scardino agreed to direct the revival only after discussions
with composer Schwartz.
   ``I wanted to stay true to the original intention of the show
and still have the freedom to bring it up to date,'' he says. ``I
wanted people to think they were watching the original, the show
they remembered, even though it isn't.''
   Besides changing the musical's prologue, Scardino updated a lot
of other material in the show, particularly the jokes and political
references.
   Now there are jokes about Jim and Tammy Bakker and the crisis in
evangelism. Ronald Reagan has also popped up, as has the ubiquitous
yuppie. A section of the show that was spoken now has turned into a
rap number.
   ``We've brought it up to the '80s,'' he says. ``Physically, it
looks the same as it did when it first opened, but the idiom has
been updated.''
   For the revival, Scardino hired young actors who had never done
``Godspell'' before. Most had never seen it. He has also used some
of their suggestions _ ``they are authentically young'' _ such as
incorporating a Pee Wee Herman step into the choreography. He has
taken some of their references and things that have come out of
their current frame of mind to create the show.
   ``The things I've learned by playing Jesus, I've tried to pass
along to Jeffrey Steefel who plays him in this show but without
being dictatorial about it,'' Scardino says. ``Everybody else in
the musical, I'll just give notes or suggestions. With him, I
unconsciously start to act it out or show him and that's wrong. He
is the actor.''
   The original performers in ``Godspell'' all came out of Carnegie
Tech, now Carnegie Mellon University. They had been together for
four years and had a strong background in an acting technique that
involved story theater, the telling of stories and the playing of
games.
   It's a technique not taught much lately, so Scardino asked for _
and got _ an extra week of rehearsal to do theater games such as
Blindman, trust exercises and circle games with the new actors.
They are exercises dedicated to creating an ensemble unit of actors
and break down the social barriers.
   ``It's the only show in which you have to be deprogrammed when
you leave it,'' Scardino laughs.
   The director feels the musical will find a new audience today,
even though it has only been a decade since the show was last seen
in New York, plus get many of the people who saw it before.
   ``I'm a '60s person,'' the 40-year-old Scardino says. ``We all
thought we were searching for new definitions. We thought we were
revolutionaries, either political or spiritual or whatever. But
there was a spiritual search alive and a rejection of material
values _ or at least we thought so. Then we entered the '80s and
we've come into yuppie materialism.''
   It was ``Godspell's'' naivete and honesty that attracted people
in the 1970s, Scardino says, adding that the musical had a fresh
perspective on something that had lost meaning for people _ the
Gospel.
   ``I think we are in a crisis of values now,'' Scardino says.
``Everybody seems to be involved now in another search for meaning
or a new search for spiritual values. It's the pendulum swinging,
although it hasn't swung yet. The kind of joy that `Godspell' has,
the kind of hope that `Godspell' gives, that is needed. And I think
people will come and find it as refreshing as they did before.''

   Pedro, a tiny 6-year-old with big brown
saucers of eyes, cries in fear when he sees soldiers and often
hides in the orphanage where he lives.
   Tomas, 16, is the most aggressive child at another children's
home and ``capable of breaking anything when he's angry,'' says the
home's director.
   Angel, a Salvadoran boy about 14, saw his mother killed in the
guerrilla war and ended up on the Guatemala City streets sniffing
paint thinner.
   On a wooded hillside in El Salvador, a slightly-built,
baby-faced boy who uses the nom de guerre ``William'' has an M-16
slung over his shoulder. Now 15, he says he has been a guerrilla
fighter for a year and a half.
   All are survivors and victims of Central America's armed
conflicts.
   ``The children who have seen violence, even if they haven't been
direct victims in terms of physical violence, will keep the trauma
of the effect of war for a long time. This can last for a
lifetime,'' said Agop Kayayan, representative at the Central
American headquarters in Guatemala City of UNICEF, the United
Nations Children's Fund.
   ``We're really talking about the way the next generation is
going to act or is going to think of the way things are done in
society.''
   Few statistics are available to show how many children have been
killed, wounded or orphaned by eight years of war between leftist
rebels and the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador, by the
fighting for the better part of 10 years in Nicaragua and by the
still-simmering 27-year conflict between leftist guerrillas and the
army in Guatemala.
   In Nicaragua, 40,000 children were orphaned _ the loss of one or
both parents _ in the 1978-79 Sandinista revolution that ended 42
years of Somoza family rule. An additional 11,361 children have
been orphaned in the more than six years of fighting between
U.S.-backed Contra rebels and Sandinista-government troops.
   Children form a large part, from 60 to 80 percent by some
estimates, of the more than 1 million people displaced in their own
countries. Thousands of others are among those who have fled to
neighboring countries, or to the United States, Canada or Europe.
   A Guatemalan court survey found more than 58,693 orphans as of
August 1986. But only 55 percent of Guatemalan towns responded to
the survey and the total number of orphans is estimated at 100,000
to 200,000.
   The Salvadoran government agency charged with children's welfare
has no figures on the number of orphans in El Salvador.
   Throughout the region, but particularly in Guatemala where half
the population is Indian, many orphans are taken in by relatives.
Others, like Angel, the Salvadoran boy now in Guatemala, fend for
themselves.
   Young teen-agers fight on both sides of the conflicts _ for
guerrillas or for governments.
   Lino Hernandez Trigueros, executive secretary of the Permanent
Human Rights Commission in Nicaragua, said the commission has found
12- and 13-year-olds with the military on the remote Caribbean
coast. Military service is required for those 17 to 25.
   Reporters have seen children as young as 13 in the Contra rebel
ranks.
   In the Salvadoran countryside, it is easy to spot children who
appear years shy of the 18-year draft age with the army, as well as
with the guerrillas, like ``William.''
   Where clashes are frequent, casings of spent bullets often
become the only toys children have play with.
   The trauma of living with war, in crowded refugee camps or in
constant flight, has many faces.
   ``This can be seeing security forces as people who are going to
kill or hurt rather than as security forces,'' said UNICEF's
Kayayan.
   Seeing families, relatives or neighbors killed can lead young
people to be violent themselves, he said. The effect multiplies
with the closeness of the relationship and the degree of violence.
   A drawing by a third-grade Guatemalan refugee girl at a camp in
southern Mexico shows soldiers shooting men tied to stakes.
Decapitated bodies lie between them.
   Orphanage personnel asked that children's names be changed for
this article to avoid reprisals against them.

<HEAD>PEDRO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A woman at the orphanage where 6-year-old Pedro lives says his
hiding when he sees solders is understandable. He spent most of his
short life in Guatemala's highland forests, fleeing soldiers
searching for guerrilla supporters. His mother was killed.
   When soldiers came to his village late last year, Pedro fell to
the ground and covered himself with pine boughs. His father and the
group of women the boy was with escaped, but Pedro was discovered
and wound up in the orphanage.
   ``When he saw the little girls at the home he said he didn't
like women because they had abandoned him,'' the orphanage woman
said. When she took him to look for relatives among other displaced
people, she added, ``he wouldn't go in because he saw the
soldiers.''

   Sixteen-year-old Tomas has told the director of the orphanage
where he has lived for five years that soldiers broke his father's

he was a guerrilla.''

   Mark Connolly of Childhope, an international organization
helping street children, has known Angel since not long after he
reached the Guatemala City streets in 1984, stealing and already on
paint thinner at age 9.
   One day he began telling Connolly about nightmares he has of
seeing his mother killed at their home in El Salvador.
   ``He vividly recalled to me the killing of his father, mother
and two brothers,'' he said.
   The next day, soldiers found the boy asleep at home and brought
his little sister and him to a base where his brother was a soldier.
   ``Soldiers came back to the base one day and said his brother
had been killed. Then soldiers, friends of his or his brother's,
took them to the border and told them to go across,'' he said.
   Shortly after arriving in Guatemala City, he lost track of his
sister. One day, the director says, Angel wants to go back to El
Salvador to find a younger brother.
   He has been in and out of a home run by a religious group in the
provinces.

   In many children, the trauma is hidden.
   ``What you can say is that there have been many learning
difficulties, many difficulties in relating,'' said Nicole Dagnino,
president of Enfants Refugies du Monde, a private French
organization that works with refugee children in several countries.
   Parents who are refugees become depressed, have no jobs, lose
their traditional contact with the land. The child, in addition to
having to leave his home, loses his father image.
   ``They have lost all points of reference,'' Ms. Dagnino said.
   A woman who works with refugee orphans said she had ``several
children who go around setting fire to everything.''
   But while children in orphanages often fight with each other,
she said these don't.
   ``It is as if they protect each other,'' she said.
   Perhaps worse than the direct effects, says Kayayan, is the
money that military spending takes away from health, education and
other programs to help children and the destruction of those
facilities.
   Adding to the problem is economic crisis in the already-poor
region from both the wars and other factors.
   UNICEF says infant and child deaths are on the rise in the
region and nearly two out of three of the survivors suffer some
degree of malnutrition.
   A study by the Guatemala-based Nutrition Institute of Central
America and Panama found the nutrition in rural communities of
Guatemala had worsened significantly between 1985 and 1987, a
period after the most recent peak in fighting.
   ``In the war atmosphere of Nicaragua and El Salvador it is
impossible to collect data,'' the institute's Dr. Hernan Delgado
said. ``But it is reasonable to think that with the military and
economic situations, there is a worsening in the state of health.''
   About 40 percent of children under age 5 in the Central American
region are believed to suffer some form of malnutrition. The
average includes Costa Rica and Panama, where conditions
traditionally are better.
   In 1980, 64 percent of the population was below the poverty line
and 41 percent could not afford the minimum food basket.
   But Delgado said worsening nutrition levels or infant and child
mortality were ``like the tip of the iceberg,'' the culmination of
a series of changes such as more illness or reduced physical
activity.
   ``It may be that it is not as important as all the change that
occurs, what that implies in all the children who didn't die,'' he
said.

   On the uninhabited Atlantic island of
Fassa off Guinea, the trees began to shrivel.
   When the government of the West African nation investigated, it
found the problem was 15,000 metric tons of unspecified toxic ash
shipped from Philadelphia, Pa., that had been dumped by a Norwegian
company on the island.
   Guinea's government in Conakry arrested Norway's honorary consul
general, Sigmund Strome, on a charge of complicity in the dumping.
   The Guineans cracked down on toxic waste after seeing Fassa's
trees shrivel, but the prospect of multi-million dollar paydays is
luring an increasing number of African countries into becoming
dumpsites for millions of tons of toxic waste from industrialized
Western countries.
   In Guinea's case, Aluco-Guinea, a government-controlled company,
signed a contract to accept 85,000 metric tons of waste at $50 a
ton. The government canceled the deal in April and demanded that
the waste on Fassa be returned to the country of origin.
   The government also arrested several of Ministry of Commerce
employees who granted import licenses for the waste.
   Strome, the honorary consul general, has no formal diplomatic
status, the Norwegian government said in Oslo, and was employed by
Norway's Klaveness shipping group, which engaged the vessels for
the waste shipments to Guinea.
   Tom Prestesulen, a Klaveness spokesman, described the waste as
slag ash and denied it was toxic. ``The content of toxics are well
below approved U.S. levels,'' he said.
   The Guinea case nevertheless stirred concern in neighboring West
African countries.
   ``It doesn't matter what amount of money they are offered,''
said Foreign Minister Omar Sey of The Gambia. ``You don't know, but
you mortgage the entire history of your people.
   ``You liberate your countries from colonialism and you talk
about imperialism, apartheid. But what is more horrible than
dumping nuclear and toxic waste?''
   Sey said The Gambia, a country about the size of Connecticut and
sandwiched like a sausage by Senegal, has been approached by U.S.
and French companies who wanted a site to dump toxic wastes.
   ``They have been offering handsome rewards, a lot of money is
involved,'' Sey said. ``We are talking about hundreds of millions
of dollars. The Gambia is a very poor country, but I don't think
any amount of money would lead us to agree to mortgage the future
of our countries.''
   According to government officials and representatives of the
United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) in Nairobi, nearly a
dozen African countries either have signed or are negotiating
contracts to accept industrial wastes or have been approached.
   Led by Nigeria, Africa has been unusually candid about the
problem, calling names and pointing fingers.
   ``We heard that Benin had been considering accepting nuclear
wastes from France, and on hearing this, we sent a delegation to
the Republic of Benin,'' Foreign Minister Ike Nwachukwu of Nigeria
told The Associated Press. ``We were told that they had been
approached, but that they had turned it down and would not allow
any dumping.''
   Nigeria itself has not escaped the problem, however.
   The government announced June 11 that preliminary tests of waste
secretly dumped in eastern Nigerian by an Italian company show the
substances to be poisonous. Scientists urged that anyone who
visited the dump site to undergo medical tests.
   The government also said it had seized an Italian ship in Lagos
harbor and ordered it to take the wastes back to Italy.
   A government spokesman, Yusufu Mamman, said some Nigerians and
Italians had been arrested for the dumping, but he did not identify
them.
   He told reporters five shipments of waste had been brought to
Nigeria from Italy since Aug. 26, 1987, with the latest arriving
May 20. The shipments totaled 4,766 tons, of which about 2,000 had
actually be dumped, he said.
   Earlier, Nigeria's Guardian newspaper reported that 10 European
companies covertly dumped in the country more than 20 of the
world's most dangerous industrial toxic wastes, including
radioactive materials.
   The newspaper said the wastes has been brought in falsely under
a permit granted by the government for the import of chemicals for
construction projects. It added that the wastes, dumped near an oil
terminal at Forcados, 150 miles southeast of Lagos, included such
poisonous materials as melamine wastes from Norway and
polyurethanes and ethyl acetate formaldehyde from Italy.
   While few African countries talk openly of their involvement in
dumping, they are not ignoring the problem.
   In late May, the government of the Congo announced the arrests
of five people, including an adviser to the prime minister, in what
became known as ``the industrial waste affair.''
   Political adviser Dieudonne Ganga, environment director Marius
Issanga Gamissimi, external trade director Abel Tchicou, lawyer
Vincent Gomes and artisan Jean Passi were accused of establishing a
fictious company with the intent of covertly accepting toxic wastes.
   Ganga purportedly initiated contacts with the U.S. Embassy in
Brazzaville, the Congo's capital, on a plan for the Congolese Co.
to stock 1 million metric tons of industrial waste.
   The company would have earned $4.2 million a year under a
three-year contract, the government said. Officials said the five
``had admitted their guilt.''
   The U.S. Embassy has not commented on the affair.
   Prodded by Nigeria, the Oganization of African Unity (OAU), at
its recent silver jubilee summit session, adopted a resolution
condemning the dumping of industrial wastes in Africa, calling the
practice ``a crime against Africa and the African peoples.''
   Barely a week later, the European Parliament in Strasbourg,
France, unanimously adopted a resolution banning large-scale
exports of toxic waste from Western Europe to Third World countries.

   Despite the public pronouncements, few expect any quick
resolution of the problem.
   ``Quite a lot of the business is going on somewhere in the
twilight,'' said Jan Huismans, director of the Geneva-based
International Register of Potentionally Toxic Chemicals, an arm of
UNEP. ``I think it is economics. I can't see any other benefit of
receiving this waste.''
   Money also is a factor for Western industries, which account for
the bulk of the 300 million metric tons of industrial wastes
produced annually worldwide.
   Stringent environmental laws in the West, like those imposed by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, demand on-site disposal
facilities that can cost as much as $30 million and take years to
build. And to ship toxic wastes from California _ which churns out
10 million metric tons of wastes a year _ across the United States
to a landfill in New Jersey costs about $800 a barrel.
   Industrialized countries also are under public pressure to keep
toxic landfills away from rapidly expanding residential areas.
   In return for $92.6 million, the Congo, a nation of 1.8 million
people, agreed to accept 1 million metric tons for storage or
incineration over eight years. The ``heavily polluted chemical
waste,'' as it was described, was to be shippped from the
Netherlands, Belguim, Luxembourg and West Germany.
   Van Santen, the Rottendam-based cargo firm hired to transport
the wastes, made no effort to conceal the deal.
   T.H. Looyschelder, director of Van Santen, said the firm saw a
double advantage of transporting toxic waste to Africa.
   ``Not only do we have a cheap way of disposing of waste, but the
Third World will be provided with money, knowhow and
infrastructure,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The company said similar negotiations were under way with Niger,
in north-central Africa.
   But Van Santen was forced to put the Congo deal on hold after a
spate of negative publicity.
   ``Before the transports to Africa would take place, we would
have taken samples and analyses of the chemicals involved to check
whether the transports would be within the regulations of the
various countries involved,'' Hans Hulswit, deputy director of Van
Santen, told the AP.
   ``But now that the press has painted the picture of us being
involved in illegal activities by imposing dangerous materials on
Third World countries against their will, we're bowing out.''
   Huismans, the U.N. official, said African countries aren't
prepared to handle the West's toxic wastes.
   ``In principal, there is nothing terribly wrong with dumping
toxic wastes in Africa providing the receiving countries can
properly handle the wastes,'' he said. ``Invariably, most of the
countries who accept the wastes are importing a problem that they
initially may not know is a problem.''
   Huismans, a toxicologist, said that most hazardous wastes
shipped to Africa are so vaguely described that it is impossible to
know from their names whether they are dangerous or not.
   Parts of the South Pacific and the Caribbean long have been
toxic wastes dumps. As those landfills became full, Africa became
the new dumping ground beginning five years ago.
   UNEP has drafted a Global Convention on the Control of
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes, which was discussed an
an international toxic waste conference sponsored by UNEP June 6-10
in Caracas, Venezuela. UNEP's executive director, Mostafa K. Tolba,
said it would be legally binding on signatory nations once approved
by the 50-nation group, probably next year.
   ``Most of the countries are not equipped to handle such
imports,'' Tolba said in a statement. ``That's why we must work to
get the international treaty into force to ensure adequate control
of movements of hazardous wastes crossing frontiers. ...
   ``We have received information on planned exports of millions of
metric tons of hazardous wastes from European and U.S. companies to
Third World countries such as Guinea Bissau, the Congo, Benin,
Ethiopia, Peru, Argentina, Venezuela.''
   Huismans urged preventative work on possible health hazards.
   ``I don't think we should wait until such proof is found,'' he
said. ``So far, it has been difficult to prove that any wastes have
led to serious effects on human health. But it takes time for these
things to develop.''
   Said Sey, the Gambian foreign minister:
   ``I think people have a concept that Africa is the jungle.
   ``If you cannot dump it in North America, just dump it in the
jungle because it is just trees and animals and those Africans
don't matter.''

<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While most chemical or industrial waste
finds a final resting place, some goes off on long, circuitous
journeys to nowhere.
   That's what happened with 2,100 metric tons of wastes stored in
12,000 drums from an Italian chemical company in February, 1987.
   Fifteen months later it is back in Italy aboard what Italians
call the ``ship of poison.''
   The waste was first loaded aboard a Maltese freighter at the
port of Marina di Carrara, about 60 miles southeast of Genoa, and
sent to tiny Djibouti in northeast Africa. Djibouti's authorities
turned it away.
   The vessel then took the cargo almost half a world away to
Venezuela, where it was unloaded. But people there protested and
authorities ordered the waste removed.
   It was put aboard a Cypriot freighter and taken to Syria, after
the ship was turned away by Greece. Syrian authorities inspected
the cargo, said it might contain radioactivity and ordered it back
to Italy, its place of origin.
   The Syrian freighter Zanoobia _ now, the ``ship of poison'' to
Italians _ took it to Marina di Carrara. The Zanoobia anchored off
the port for a month and five crewmen fell ill after having lived
with the cargo for four months.
   They were taken to a hospital but released after treatment of
ailments not further detailed.
   Italian officials then allowed the Zanoobia to dock May 29 in
Genoa, where another crewmen was hospitalized after complaining of
nausea and abdominal pains.
   The Zanoobia remains in Genoa while Italian authorities decide
when and how to remove its cargo and where to dispose of it in
Italy.
   It the meantime, health officials test the air and water around
the vessel to be sure it does not contaminate the area. They said
they have not found any evidence of radioactivity in the cargo, but
they still are not sure exactly what the chemicals are.
   The Italian government has appropriated $3.3 million for the
disposal but said the money would have to be repaid by Jelly Wax,
the company in Milan that contracted to dispose of the chemicals in
the first place.

   A key turning point was Gorbachev's dramatic call in January
1986 for the global elimination of all nuclear weapons by the year
2000, including a first-phase scrapping of INF missiles in Europe
by 1990.
   Ten months later, at a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, he and
Reagan agreed in principle to eliminate all but 100 INF missiles on
each side. They also came close to agreeing in principle to scrap
all ballistic missiles, a idea that went far beyond the INF
proposals and triggered an avalanche of West European complaints
that Reagan had gone too far.
   Although the West Europeans at that point were pressing hard for
completion of an INF treaty, the Reykjavik talk of eliminating all
ballistic missiles caused a serious political crisis in NATO. The
Europeans felt they had not been adequately consulted by the Reagan
administration on an issue that directly affected Western Europe's
security.
   Shortly after that summit, Jacques Chirac, then premier of
France, called on the European allies to create a new security
charter to defend their interests.
   ``The scope of the proposals put forward by both sides at the
Reykjavik summit in October seemed to shake the very basis on which
our conception of U.S.-Soviet relations is founded,'' Chirac said.
   His remark carried with it the weight of broad agreement among
the West European allies that they should insist on playing a
bigger political role.
   ``One cannot remain forever a spectator to the American-Soviet
negotiations, even if they are positive,'' Prime Minister Filipe
Gonzalez of Spain told the French mewspaper Le Monde in an
interview published Feb. 11.
   This concern is rooted partly in the allies' belief that the
United States is losing some of its international political
predominance and that economic strains induced by years of huge
budget deficits may soon force it to pull some American troops out
of Western Europe.
   In the United States, a feeling has grown in recent years that
the Europeans are bearing too small a share of the burden of
Western defense.
   In June 1984 the U.S. Senate, by a 55-41 vote, defeated a
proposal to withdraw nearly one-third of the 326,000 U.S. troops
based in Europe unless the allies did more to improve non-nuclear
defenses.
   This triggered a new effort in NATO, spearheaded by Carrington
and former a U.S. ambassador to NATO, David Abshire, to cooperate
more on defense planning and in the development, production and
buying of armaments. A key result of this was the Conventional
Defense Improvements initiative approved at a NATO defense
ministers meeting in May 1985.
   Talk of strengthening the ``European pillar'' of NATO has been
around since President John F. Kennedy coined the term in 1962. But
it has taken on added urgency in recent years, partly due to U.S.
economic problems.
   A study by political leaders and defense experts from the United
States, Canada and eight European NATO countries, published in May,
called for a high-level alliance meeting early in 1989 to revise
the trans-Atlantic pact on which Western security has rested for 39
years.
   ``A fundamental change has occurred in the U.S.-European
relationship,'' the study concluded.
   It said the Europeans should take more of the economic and
political burdens of alliance leadership, and that the United
States should accustom itself to conducting NATO business on more
even terms with the Europeans.
   As perceptions about the military threat posed by the Soviet
Union have changed in recent years, trans-Atlantic friction has
grown over how to respond to security problems outside the NATO
area.
   The U.S. bombing of Libya in April 1986 brought this conflict to
a peak. Britain was the only NATO country to explicitly support the
U.S. bombing raid, which was described by Reagan as a defensive
response to Libyan backing for terrorist attacks on Americans in
Europe. The French and Spanish governments declined to permit U.S.
F-111 fighter-bombers to cross their airspace en route from Britain
to Libya and back.
   Carrington says this marked the low point of his four years at
NATO.
   ``It was quite nasty,'' he said. ``It brought to a head the
American perception that the Europeans were really not interested
in anything that happened outside the NATO area.''
   It also hardened a West European view of the Reagan
administration as a group of ``cowboys,'' Carrington said.
   The strains eased over time, helped by the decision of several
West European countries, including Italy, Belgium and the
Netherlands, to join the U.S. Navy in mine-clearing operations in
the Persian Gulf starting in 1987.

<HEAD>Anna Maria Horsford Shapes Thelma on NBC's `Amen'</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA1 of June 13</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anna Maria Horsford has turned a supporting
role as Thelma, the unmarried, 39-year-old deacon's daughter on
``Amen,'' into one of the most popular characters on the NBC hit
comedy.
   Thelma, who's been engaged and jilted 18 times, has been
described as a ``vampy virgin.''
   Horsford said in an interview that she sees Thelma as a
reluctant spinster who, even at 39, is still holding on to her
virtue.
   ``It's always a challenge to a man to be first,'' she said.
``Don't ever assume that virtuous girls are uninteresting.''
   Horsford was born and raised in Harlem, the daughter of a
businessman, and attended New York's High School for the Performing
Arts. She said she began to draw up a history for Thelma as soon as
she was cast.
   ``She's unemployed, unmarried and living at home with her father
(played by Sherman Hemsley),'' she said. ``I wrote it all down.
Then I could see what's my attitude toward someone like that. My
first reaction was that she was spoiled by her father. She doesn't
do what she doesn't have to do.
   ``I looked for her endearing qualities, too. She'd been engaged
many times, so I looked back in my past at the girls who got the
ring but never got to the altar. I created a woman who is quiet,
strong, manipulative and secure in the sense that her life has been
consistent since childhood.''
   If Daddy spoils her, it's the handsome Rev. Reuben Gregory,
played by Clifton Davis, who puts her in a matrimonial mood. So
far, her love is unrequited.
   Before ``Amen,'' Horsford worked regularly in films, including
``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``Heartburn,'' ``Class,'' ``Crackers,'' ``The
Fan'' and ``Street Smart,'' plus in a number of television movies.
   ``I've played a lot of strong women in films,'' she said.
``Sometimes I've been a policewoman and carried a gun. But I really
hate guns and abhor screen violence. My father was shot by a holdup
man when I was 4, and thereafter he wore a gun to work. I never
dated in high school. All the boys knew Daddy carried a gun.''
   She said in her screen roles she has tried to portray strength
through her presence. ``I think a character who can scare you with
his presence is much stronger than a person who needs a gun,'' she
said. ``I try to show that in my acting.''
   Because of the regularity of her work in movies, she said she
wasn't terribly worried about whether she would land the role in
the network series. She had tested for the role in New York, then
was called to Los Angeles to test opposite Hemsley.
   ``I came out on a Sunday, auditioned on Monday and was told
there'd probably be a decision on Tuesday. Well, there was no word
on Tuesday. Or Wednesday or Thursday. By then I was back in New
York. My agent called me at noon Friday and said, `Guess what? You
have the job.'''
   NBC had made a reservation for her on a 4 p.m. plane that day.
``I said, `Oh, no, is this the way Hollywood does it?' I flew back
to L.A. and went to work the next day.''
   Horsford said she has learned that in television you have to
come out ready, with all your lines memorized.
   ``I said I'm so grateful for every lesson, for every showcase
I've done,'' she said. ``You do a sitcom and you can use everything
you've learned. You don't have time to think of criticism because
it's so fast. I think what makes a hit show is an actor giving a
lot of his or her resource to a writer.
   ``A producer hires you hoping that you can deliver. But there's
no way a producer can anticipate how the audience will respond to
you. The writers pick up little pieces of you and your personality
and put it into the script. An actor's heartache is having a great
line but then losing it because it didn't work in rehearsal. In
television, if something doesn't work the first time there's no
second chance.''
   When she moved to Los Angeles two years ago to start work on
``Amen,'' she found herself facing another problem. She had to
learn to drive.
   ``I'm an expert now,'' she said. ``I went to driving school for
seven weeks. When I first came here I got very friendly with
everyone at Paramount Studios. You get humble and ask everybody for
a ride. I still have a soft spot in my heart, too, for all the men
who let me drive and sat in the passenger seat while I was
learning.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Big''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a scene in ``Big'' in which Tom Hanks finds a giant
piano in the F.A.O. Schwarz toy store in Manhattan. Hanks, who is
really a 12-year-old in an adult's body, begins dancing over the
keys to pick out a tune. Along comes his boss, Robert Loggia,
president of a toy company. The pair tap out a joyful rendition of
``Chopsticks'' and ``Heart and Soul'' with all the airy grace of
Fred and Ginger.
   The sequence is one of the many delights of ``Big,'' which
defies the odds by scoring a home run despite being the fourth
comedy within a year about a boy who turns into a man. It is the
most thoroughly enjoyable comedy since ``Tootsie.''
   Unlike the earlier films, there's no sci-fi hocus pocus about
``Big.'' Josh Baskin (David Moscow) is an undersized pre-teener who
gets pushed around by bullies and is turned away from an amusement
park thrill ride because of his size. Before a simple-looking
fortune machine, Zoltan Speaks! he wishes to be big. The next
morning he is.
   His mother is terrified to find this adult stranger in her
house. Hanks flees to New York, holes up in a fleabag hotel where
he contemplates his predicament with his pal Billy (Jared Rushton),
the only one who knows about the transformation.
   Hanks finds work in a toy company and, with his acute knowledge
of what kids like, ascends to an important position. He encounters
a predatory female (Elizabeth Perkins) and a vengeful executive
(John Heard), but he manages to elude both. Then Perkins is moved
by Hanks' innate sweetness, and a romance of sorts ensues.
   Ending ``Big'' must have posed a problem for writers Anne
Spielberg and Gary Ross, who also co-produced. Should Hanks remain
an adult and continue the romance and career? Or should he return
as a boy to his grieving family? The conclusion is totally
satisfactory, though getting there has some rough spots.
   The plot inconsistencies are overbalanced by an absolutely
stunning performance by Tom Hanks. Using only body language and
quirky expressions, he is irresistible as the boy-man. If the
Academy ever recognizes comedy as a worthy achievement, Hanks
should be rewarded.
   After a shaky start with ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' Penny Marshall
breaks through as a comedy director of rare skill. All of the
performers are topnotch, especially the ever-faithful Robert Loggia
and youngsters Moscow and Rushton.
   A 20th Century Fox release also produced by James L. Brooks and
Robert Greenhut, ``Big'' is rated PG, but it seems like ideal
summer entertainment for the entire family.

   Home video distributors have many ways of
peddling their wares to movie enthusiasts who normally only go to
the video store to rent or buy the blockbusters or the hot movie of
the month.
   It called packaging _ and that's with a capital ``P.''
   While home video fans will flock to fetch Steven Spielberg's
``Empire of the Sun'' when Warner Home Video releases it on Aug.
10, many will find it difficult to rent, with long waiting lists.
Others might be lured by older and less popular movies.
   HBO Video has a summer sales program it calls ``Video Thrills,''
featuring 11 of its top action movies. They include ``Psych-Out,''
starring Jack Nicholson; ``Let's Get Harry,'' with Mark Harmon and
Robert Duvall; and ``Wild in the Streets,'' starring Richard Pryor
and Christopher Jones. The movies retail for $19.99.
   ``We've designed this promotion to appeal to the consumer's
desire for action-adventure titles during the summer months,'' said
Tracy Dolgin, a marketing vice president at HBO.
   Warner also has an action series called ``Heroes.'' The movies
retail at $19.98 and include ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' ``The Road
Warrior'' and ``Sharky's Machine.''
   Paramount Home Video has ``Double Play'' _ two movies for
$19.95. Audrey Hepburn stars in ``Sabrina'' and ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's.'' Cary Grant is featured in ``Houseboat'' and ``To Catch
a Thief.'' There's also ``Up in Smoke'' and ``Cheech & Chong'' and
``A Place in the Sun'' with ``Sunset Boulevard.''
   Virgin Vision offers a ``Freedom of Choice'' promotion in July
in which consumers may purchase one feature for $79.95 and get a
second for $14.95. Titles include: ``Man Outside'' with ``House of
Death''; ``Car Trouble'' with ``Midnite Spares''; and ``Ping Pong''
with ``Cry of the Innocent.''
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Orphans,'' ``Prick Up Your Ears''
and ``Wall Street.''

   ``Orphans'' (Lorimar Home Video, VHS-Beta: $79.95, Rated R)
   
   The comical mugging that opens the 1987 film ``Orphans''
indicates the dark humor to follow, but does nothing to prepare you
for the flip side _ the frightened, frightening relationship
between the hotheaded mugger and his younger brother, orphans who
keep out the world in a big decaying house in Newark, N.J.
   The actors in Alan J. Pakula's movie _ Albert Finney, Matthew
Modine and Kevin Anderson _ turn out stunning performances in a
play-like movie based on Lyle Kessler's award-winning stage drama.
   The older brother (Modine) builds a cocoon, venturing out to
make a living mugging and stealing and virtually imprisoning his
brother (Anderson) by telling him he will have an allergic reaction
and die if he goes outdoors.
   Into their violent, unreal world comes a staggeringly drunk
gangster on the run (Finney), himself an orphan and able in a flash
to dissect the complicated relationship he finds in the brothers'
littered house.
   The story is implausible but it doesn't matter much as you watch
what inevitably follows the disarming gangster's intrusion into the
orphans' lives. Modine's character, who believes he's abducted the
gangster and intends to hold him for ransom, sums it up when he
says, ``He's taking over. ... He's supposed to be a kidnap victim.''

   ``Prick Up Your Ears'' (Virgin Vision, VHS-Beta: $79.95, Rated R)
   
   A story of talent and torment, ``Prick Up Your Ears'' tells the
real-life story of British playwright Joe Orton's rise from a
working class background, to the heights of success, to a brutal
end.
   Orton (Gary Oldman) was a raw talent with a lust for life who
studied drama in London. There, he met Kenneth Halliwell (Alfred
Molina), a more cultured writer who becomes his homosexual lover.
   The two lead a closet existence before they're jailed in
different prisons for defacing library books. Orton uses the
separation to grow on his own, becoming one of the brightest
talents in London after his release.
   His career skyrockets when he connects with high-powered agent
Peggy Ramsay (Vanessa Redgrave). She nurtures his talents,
arranging for him to meet Paul McCartney for a screenplay about The
Beatles.
   Success drives the wedge deeper between Orton and his jealous
roommate, Halliwell, a psychotic whose mother died of a wasp sting
when he was a child and whose father committed suicide. Halliwell
is being left behind, covering his disappointment as clumsily as he
covers his bald head with an ill-fitting wig. The emotions boil
over to dark rage.
   To make sure he doesn't lose his lover, Halliwell hammers him to
death in a grisly scene, then takes his own life.
   The 111-minute video is rated R, mainly for homosexual love
scenes and shadowy men's room sex.

   ``Wall Street'' (CBS-Fox, VHS-Beta: $89.98, Rated R)
   
   When ``Wall Street'' hit movie theaters last year, the real
street was crashing and high-rolling traders such as Ivan Boesky
were being marched to prison.
   Anyone who thinks this movie offers any real insight into the
quirks and greed that make stock market life so enticing will be
disappointed.
   One of the many implausible aspects of this film written and
directed by Oliver Stone is that there isn't a single decent
woman's role. It could be that the film is implicitly blaming
testosterone for Wall Street's vices.
   But who cares? This movie is great silly fun, fueled by superb
acting from Oscar winner Michael Douglas, father and son Martin and
Charlie Sheen, Hal Holbrook and Terrence Stamp. There's even a
terrific walk-on by Sylvia Miles as a pushy East Side real estate
saleswoman.
   Douglas is suitably sinister as Gordon Gekko, Wall Street
dealmaker, dream-weaver and crusher of innocent companies. The
younger Sheen plays Bud Fox, a young Sammy Glick-type broker who
sees Gekko as his ticket to the big bucks. He will do anything to
get into Gekko's empire of beautiful women, limousines, cocaine and
mega-deals.
   While at Gekko's beach house he meets a beautiful but vacuous
interior decorator played (Darryl Hannah) who has big money dreams
of her own. Fidelity, it turns out, is not her strong suit _ nor
are brains.
   Gekko spins out such wisdom as ``greed is good,'' and ``every
battle is won before it is fought.''
   Fox ingratiates himself to Gekko by becoming a corporate spy and
feeding him insider information.
   But when he finds himself embroiled in a take-over scheme that
threatens to break up the airline for which his father works, this
proves too much even for the avaricious young Fox.

<HEAD>In the Groove: Dylan Reviewed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   .
   
   ``Down in the Groove'' (Columbia) _ Bob Dylan
   
   Columbia proclaims on the packaging of Bob Dylan's latest album
that he is a ``1988 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Inductee.''
   Did they think someone out there would pick up the record and
say, ``I never heard of this guy, but look, he's in the Rock 'n'
Roll Hall of Fame? How bad can he be?''
   Most anyone browsing in the Dylan section is going to be aware
that his most recent ``Knocked Out Loaded'' was pretty mediocre and
that even the darkly brilliant ``Empire Burlesque'' that preceded
it was an acquired taste.
   Dylan needs a strong, accessible back-to-basics record. ``Down
in the Groove'' is it _ with an asterisk.
   Dylan wrote only four of the 10 songs, two of which were
co-written with the Grateful Dead's Robert Hunter. The Dylan songs
are superb, and covers suit him so well, they might as well be his.
The record is so strong because he hasn't insisted on filling it
with his own material, however weak.
   Instead, he offers unique Dylanesque treatments of standards
including, believe it or not, ``Shenandoah.'' He's also backed by
an all-star lineup of pals, including Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler,
the Grateful Dead, Full Force, Paul Simonon of The Clash, Steve
Jones of the Sex Pistols, Ron Wood and Clydie and Bobby King.
   Perhaps the best cut on the album is ``Silvio,'' one of the
Dylan-Hunter collaborations, with Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir and Brent
Mydland singing backup.
   The other Dylan-Hunter tune, ``Ugliest Girl in the World,''
shows our man's sense of humor intact: ``The woman I love, she
gotta hook in her nose, her eyebrows meet and she wears second-hand
clothes, she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop, I
don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop.''
   ``Had a Dream About You Baby'' is fine hard rock, one of two
original songs Dylan wrote for his movie, ``Hearts of Fire,'' which
has not been released, though the soundtrack album is available.
   ``Down in the Groove'' opens with Wilbert Harrison's ``Let's
Stick Together.''
   ``When Did You Leave Heaven'' is a crooner's number, and Dylan's
strained wail is downright charming.
   ``Death Is Not the End'' is the other Dylan original, gospel
tinged with a Celtic dirge.
   He closes with the Stanley Brothers' haunting ballad of
alienation, ``Rank Strangers to Me'': ``I wandered again to my home
in the mountains, where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free.
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them. I found they
were all rank strangers to me.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Stardom Eludes Tom Skerritt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How can a serious actor such as Tom Skerritt
hold his own amid the pyrotechnics of ``Poltergeist III''?
   ``You don't even try in a special effects picture,'' he admits.
```Aliens' had the same feeling. You simply do them to learn from
the filmmaker. What you get out of it is to learn about lenses, how
to use the camera effectively, some of the tricks of the trade.
   ``I'm more interested in being a director and in learning about
that process than in being an actor in front of a camera. It's not
a very exciting thing being an actor in front of a camera.''
   His attitude may help explain the Skerritt film career. He seems
always to be working, but he has never ascended to superstardom. He
and Robert Redford made their film debuts in the 1962 ``War Hunt.''
Redford became an instant star; Skerritt didn't.
   In 1970, Skerritt appeared with Elliott Gould and Donald
Sutherland in the landmark comedy ``M-A-S-H.'' While his co-stars
went on to fame and fortune, Skerritt turned up in films such as
``Run Run Joe'' and ``Big Bad Mama.''
   Shirley MacLaine, Anne Bancroft, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Leslie
Browne won Academy Award nominations for ``The Turning Point'' in
1977. Skerritt as MacLaine's compassionate husband did not.
   Again with the recent megahit ``Top Gun,'' Skerritt drew little
credit for his powerful presence as Tom Cruise's flight instructor.
   If such happenstances bother Tom Skerritt, he doesn't show it.
He continues taking jobs that interest him, ranging from guest
appearances on ``Cheers'' to uncredited modeling of Guess clothes
in magazines. The other day he was working on location at the
University of Southern California in a farce called ``Hunchback.''
It was originally titled ``The Hunchback of UCLA,'' but that
university declined to be associated.
   Skerritt is a newcomer to MGM's ``Poltergeist'' series, playing
the role of the late Heather O'Rourke's uncle. He confesses he
hasn't seen the first two films.
   He didn't have any qualms about joining in the middle of the
series.
   ``I had a lot of confidence in the director, Gary Sherman,'' he
said. ``Generally, filmmaking is a matter of working with people
whose work you enjoy enough to learn from. He had mounds of
sketches of the way he was going to shoot the picture, all live
special effects. I thought, `This guy is an architectural genius.'
Indeed, he had studied at architecture school in Chicago.''
   Skerritt still hasn't reconciled himself to the loss of Heather
O'Rourke, the young star of all three ``Poltergeists.''
   ``She was an extraordinary person _ very intelligent, very
together, very focused young lady,'' he remarked, eyes misting.
Heather died on the operating table Feb. 2 at Children's Hospital
in San Diego during intestinal surgery to relieve a congenital
bowel obstruction. She had completed filming of Poltergeist III
last June.
   A Detroit native, Skerritt fell into acting at Wayne State
University, and moved west to study at the UCLA film school.
   ``I never really took acting seriously,'' he admitted. ``I was
more interested in the process of making films. I did acting
because I enjoyed it and found it therapeutic. But I also felt the
responsibility that if I was going to direct or write I should
certainly know how to act; it's an economy, a shorthand that you
learn by doing. I fell into making a living at it.''
   Skerritt's career has taken a number of wrong turns. After
``M-A-S-H,'' he was offered a role in a proposed TV series based on
the film. He declined, figuring it would be ``just another
sitcom.'' Then his agents persuaded him to move to Italy, since
Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson had achieved stardom there.
Skerritt stayed 3{ years, but the same lightning failed to strike.
   In recent times he has appeared in such fleeting films as
``Silence of the North,'' ``Space Camp'' and ``Maid to Order.'' But
a ``Top Gun'' can offset such misses.
   ``I read 15 pages of that script and I wanted to do it,'' the
actor said. ``There was no doubt of its power in terms of
commercial appeal. With Ridley Scott directing and Jerry
Bruckheimer and Don Simpson producing, there was no way that was
going to be anything but a terrific piece of film.''
   Out of ``Top Gun'' came Skerritt's debut as a fashion model. The
Guess jeans people called him for a magazine layout, and he joined
up.
   ``To tell the truth, I don't pay much attention,'' he commented.
``When people come up to me and say, `My God, you've been in every
magazine, every periodical,' I have no idea. I read Time magazine,
the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and raise my kids
and mow the lawn, pretty much.
   ``That's No. 1, isn't it: You father children and you raise
them. You don't run from the responsibility, as so many men seem to
do nowadays. I don't conceptualize this business as anything other
than the way I make a living to feed my family and pay the rent.
It's just a job.''

<HEAD>The Artists: The Endangered Euphonium and Other Instruments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Know anyone who plays the euphonium?
   When was the last time you picked up your bassoon and blew a
bouncy tune?
   The euphonium, a brass-wind instrument with a mellow tone, and
the bassoon, a woodwind instrument with a long, curved stem, are
among some less popular instruments some musicologists fear may
become as endangered as the whooping crane.
   In an effort to reverse this trend, the Settlement Music School
is encouraging its students to play lesser-known instruments.
   Robert Capanna, the executive director of the school, said the
number of students playing such endangered instruments as the
euphonium, bassoon, cello, double bass, harp, oboe, trombone, tuba,
viola, French horn and organ is declining.
   He is concerned about the trend and said he wonders what the
professional implications could be if it is not changed. Capanna
noted there is intense competition for positions in orchestras.
However, if more interest in some instruments is not developed,
that competition could wane.
   Ronald Demkee, associate conductor of the Allentown, Pa.,
symphony and the orchestra director at Freedom High School in
Bethlehem, Pa., said the quality of the performers is still high,
but there could be concern if fewer people study some instruments.
   ``The people that are auditioning seem to be more prepared than
ever,'' he said. However, the number of bassoon players at the high
school, for example, has dropped from five to one over the last
several years.
   Schools across the country are reporting the same trend as the
Settlement School, Capanna said. He attributed the swing in
interest to cuts in school music programs.
   ``Kids at an early age are not getting that exposure (of
different instruments),'' he explained.
   Settlement offers a class called ``Meet the Instruments of the
Orchestra,'' and provides scholarships for students to play such
``endangered instruments'' as the euphonium, a tenor tuba.
   ``Kids who are interested in music have a narrow frame of
interest,'' Capanna said, adding that piano and violin are, by far,
the most popular instruments being studied. ``We want to make kids
aware that there are other instruments.''
   Piano students are now encouraged to also take up the organ, and
violinists are also steered toward learning how to play the viola.
   Settlement sponsored a program in which it distributed 120,000
comic books and tapes to schoolchildren called ``Quadrus and
Friends Musical Journey.'' The books and tapes attempted to make
children aware of how music touches their lives, and how they can
become involved in music if they have the desire.
   ``The idea was to get kids to recognize ... there were people
involved in good music,'' Capanna said.
   The school of 6,000 students, aged 3 to adult, is the largest
community arts school in the nation. It was founded 80 years ago.
   The executive director said the enrollment has changed over the
last decade. Ten years ago, Capanna said, 25 percent of the
students played wind and brass instruments, the typical ``band
instruments,'' such as clarinet, flute, trumpet and the endangered
instruments.
   Now, he said, 13 percent of the enrollment are studying those
instruments. He estimated that another 50 percent of the students
are playing the piano, and the remainder are studying voice or
playing string instruments, mainly the violin.
   ``In the long run, it will level out,'' Demkee said, noting that
some students will change over to the more needed instruments.
   A lack of interest in some instruments can affect other music
students, Capanna said.
   Because so many people are playing the piano and violin, their
musical experience won't be as rich. There are limits to what the
two instruments can play together and playing with a group of
people enrichs a student's experience, he said.
   When the student is part of an audience for a musical
performance, his or her appreciation will be greater if his or her
musical experience is deeper, Capanna said.
   The popularity of the Suzuki method of teaching the violin also
has shifted interest to the instrument, he said. The Suzuki method
was developed by a doctor in Japan about 20 years ago and is a way
of teaching youngsters how to play the violin before they're even
able to read music. Therefore, the child is already playing the
violin before he knows the other options available.
   The method has since been applied to other instruments.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Madonna Is Madonna and Taylor Dayne Is Taylor Dayne</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Please, whatever you do, don't ever tell Taylor
Dayne she reminds you of Madonna or Tiffany or Debbie Gibson. That
would only ruffle those rock 'n' roll feathers.
   ``The obvious reason for comparison is that we all came out at
about the same time. The comparison, as far as I'm concerned, stops
there,'' Dayne says. ``Madonna is Madonna, and Taylor Dayne is
Taylor Dayne.
   ``There is space for everyone but you have to be good,'' she
said while in New York to shoot a video for ``I'll Always Love
You,'' a sentimental ballad off her debut album for Arista.
   With two recent hit singles from her LP, ``Taylor Dayne, Tell It
to My Heart,'' two videos and another in the making, the
25-year-old performer says the only direction for her now is up.
   ``I always knew I wanted to be a star,'' she said. ``I don't
like the word `success' _ it's phony and materialistic. You end up
summarizing your life in one word.''
   She sighed and a big smile crossed her face. ``I'm happy,'' she
said.
   ``Taylor Dayne, Tell It to My Heart'' recently went gold with
sales of more than 500,000 units. In the music industry, that's
considered pretty good for a debut LP.
   The album includes a collection of dance songs, love songs and
remakes, all in the rhythm and blues style with which Dayne flavors
most of her music.
   ``My biggest influence was the radio. I've always liked
blues-oriented rock,'' said the singer, who grew up loving the
music of the Allman Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Steve Perry and Bad
Company.
   ```Upon the Journey's End' is one of my favorites on the
album,'' Dayne said. It's a romantic duet with Billy C. Scott.
   The catchier tunes on the album include the dance-tempo ``In the
Darkness,'' an update of ``Want Ads,'' a hit made famous by the
female soul vocal trio Honeycone in the 1960s, and a new version of
David Lasley's ``Where Does That Boy Hang Out.''
   Dayne grew up in Baldwin, N.Y., made her debut when she was 16
years old at a high school dance with a band she and her friends
had put together. While majoring in music at Nassau Community
College, she joined a band called Felony. She spent nearly two
years with them, quit and joined a pop-new wave band called The
Next as lead singer. She stayed with them for about two years
before deciding to go solo.
   ``I'm so glad I'm not where I was a year ago,'' Dayne said, as
she recalled the days when she sang Russian Gypsy songs at a dinner
club in Brooklyn, N.Y. With the lyrics written out phonetically,
she could memorize them in a night. ``I do have a lot of friends
and memories from there. I also understand a lot of Russian now.''
   ``Tell It to My Heart,'' a dance-tempo single which Dayne
produced with Ric Wake, quickly climbed to the Top 10 on the
charts. That was just before Arista picked her up with an option
for an album and then released her next hit single, ``Prove Your
Love,'' which climbed to the Top 20 on the singles charts.
   Dayne travels a lot these days. She jets between Europe, where
she has gained in popularity, and the United States where she still
lives on Long Island. Accompanying her on each trip is Ollie, her
Yorkshire Terrier.
   ``He comes with me everywhere,'' Dayne said, ``absolutely
everywhere.''
   When not working, she likes to spend time on the boardwalk at
Long Beach. ``I'm a New Yorker, this is my place,'' she said.
   While she moves ahead in her career at a hectic pace, Dayne said
she doesn't have time for a serious relationship.
   ``My music and my career just took over; I had to put my
feelings on hold,'' she said. ``I get lonely sometimes but I have
my music, my friends and my dog to keep me company. I guess I'm
just waiting for someone to sweep me off my feet.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Reynolds Price Resurrects Rosa and Wesley</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reynolds Price is a great believer in the power
of the unconscious, so when two characters he introduced to readers
a quarter-century ago rooted themselves in his imagination he put
away his novel-in-progress and let them take over.
   The result is ``Good Hearts'' (Atheneum, $18.95), in which we
catch up on the story of Rosa and Wesley Beavers, the central
characters of Price's first novel, ``A Long and Happy Life.''
   In the 1962 work, Rosacoke Mustian and Wesley Beavers crossed
the line from innocence to adulthood in an isolated patch of rural
North Carolina. In the newest work they are married, middle-aged
and entrenched in Raleigh, she working as a college secretary and
he as an auto mechanic.
   Price, probably best known for ``Kate Vaiden,'' his 1986 novel
that won the National Book Critics' Circle award for best work of
fiction, was asked in a recent interview why he resurrected these
characters after so long an absence.
   ``I tried to start a novel about someone else, and this idea
kept coming forward to my mind as I was making notes for another
subject, and it seemed to be wise to go ahead and obey the
impulse,'' he said.
   It wasn't as if the characters had been living in his head
growing old with him, he explained: ``Normally when I finish any
given book I really sort of erase them in the computer, let that
file go. But who knows what the unconscious mind is doing all that
time.
   ``I think an enormous amount of my work is done by that part of
my mind, and I would think that most of the creative writers that I
know _ as well as a great deal of the scientific community _ find
that a lot of their work is done by a part of their brain over
which they have very little control.''
   Price, 55, is the author of seven novels and 10 other books,
including an impressive collection of essays, ``A Common Room,''
published last year. Except for a few years as a Rhodes Scholar in
Oxford, England, he has lived all of his life in North Carolina.
   Like Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor, two writers he greatly
admires, Price has enjoyed staying put, teaching at Duke University
in Durham and writing about the kind of people he knows intimately.
   ``Good Hearts'' opens with Wesley fleeing his marriage in what
amounts to a midlife crisis _ if the term can be used without
derision _ and a tragic event that befalls Rosa as a consequence.
The story is told from many characters' points of view, although
Rosa's presence dominates due to her tough-mindedness and a kind of
radiance that Price bestows upon her.
   The idea of marriage as a sacred bond resounds throughout the
novel, a belief Price says he shares with his characters.
   ``As a basically religious person, I myself feel certain kinds
of human commitments _ matrimonial commitments, parental
commitments _ do indeed have a kind of sacred force to them and are
broken or maligned at a very serious risk to the person who does
it.''
   Despite some dark moments, ``Good Hearts'' ends with a sense of
optimism and promise, a trait common to many of Price's works. The
author was asked if that is a conscious goal on his part.
   ``I think it's probably emotionally characteristic of the kind
of person I am,'' he said. ``I'm someone who _ with a normal number
of exceptions _ who's had a very lucky and a very happy life till
now. So I don't tend to assume the worst about things.
   ``I'm also someone who feels that it's one of the goals of a
work of art to assist people onward in the world. If what you've
got to say really is that we should all get on the window ledge,
slit our wrists and fall eight floors, I don't see much point in
saying that. That's not an errand worth doing, in my opinion.''
   Price's ``normal number of exceptions'' to his happy life
includes being stricken by astrocytoma, a cancerous nerve tumor in
his spinal cord that has left him a paraplegic since 1984. He said
that being confined to a wheelchair has at least had the advantage
of allowing him more time to write.
   ``One of the major things it's taught me to be is very, very
patient. When your legs are paralyzed you've either got to get very
able to sit still and do things slowly and gradually and accept an
awful lot of tiny frustrations, or else you're going to go crazy
fast.''
   He joked that cocktail parties are difficult because ``you're
sitting there like a potted plant and the most boring person in the
world corners you and you can't excuse yourself to go get an hors
d'oeuvre.''
   Hypnosis lessons he began taking for pain control led him to
explore memory regression with his therapist, which in turn led to
his latest project _ a book of memoirs ``looking at the major
emotional figures in my childhood and early youth.''
   Eventually he hopes to get back to that novel that Rosa and
Wesley chased away. But he'll let his unconscious dictate when.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Marty Robbins' Home Video Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than five years after his death,
country music star Marty Robbins is on home video as a singing
cowboy roaming the West, armed with a guitar rather than a pistol.
   ``The Drifter'' is rare footage shot in 1965 and 1966 that
Robbins hoped to use in a television show. Since it was done in
black and white, the program was never sold because color had just
revolutionized the industry.
   ``The show has previously been aired in only a couple of test
markets,'' said Robbins' son, Ronny, who is overseeing the
mail-order marketing of the video for Marty Robbins Enterprises.
``The fact that they were shot in black and white only adds to
their uniqueness.''
   Robbins laced much of his music with a macho western feel before
he died of cardiac arrest on Dec. 8, 1982, at age 57.
   His best known song was ``El Paso,'' a gunfighter ballad in 1959
that earned him a Grammy Award. It is one of several tunes he sings
in the video.
   During his 30-year career, he wrote some 500 songs and had 18
No. 1 hits. Among them were ``My Woman, My Woman, My Wife,''
``Devil Woman,'' ``A White Sport Coat (and a Pink Carnation),''
``El Paso City,'' ``The Hanging Tree,'' ``Some Memories Just Won't
Die,'' ``Among My Souvenirs'' and ``Singing the Blues.''
   Some 30 of Robbins' 101 albums are still available.
   ``There wasn't any kind of country song he couldn't sing and
didn't have a hit with,'' said Ronnie Pugh, a researcher at the
Country Music Foundation.
   ``He did cowboy songs, Hawaiian songs, calypso songs. He did
love ballads, he did rockabilly in the '50s and then did the
Nashville Sound, the smoother style in the late '60s and early
'70s.''
   ``I think his versatility was responsible for the longevity of
his career,'' Pugh said. ``He very successfully went with trends
and set trends.''
   Robbins performed on the Grand Ole Opry from 1953 until his
death almost 30 years later. A friendly, gregarious entertainer, he
bantered with the audience and often stayed at the Grand Ole Opry
House after the show ended to sign autographs for as long as an
hour.
   ``He was a fan's favorite,'' Pugh recalled about Robbins'
appearances on the Opry. ``He always got encores right up to the
end. The fans loved him.''
   Robbins sang the title song to the Clint Eastwood movie, ``Honky
Tonk Man,'' which was released two weeks after Robbins died. He
also appeared in 18 low-budget movies and sang the theme for
others, such as ``The Alamo'' and ``The Hanging Tree.''
   The sandy-haired, mustachioed performer was chosen for induction
into the Country Music Hall of Fame two months before his death.
Two other members, Tex Ritter and Grandpa Jones, appear with him on
``The Drifter.''
   Among the songs performed on the video are ``El Paso,'' ``Cool
Water,'' ``Tumblin' Tumbleweed,'' ``Streets of Laredo'' and ``Red
River Valley.''
   Ronny Robbins found the video material in a Nashville bank vault
after the bank kept sending bills for the storage.
   ``They were in three big vaudeville-looking chests,'' he said.
``There was not even any dust on them. The seal was totally intact.
It was like I opened a time capsule; it looked like they had just
been put in there yesterday.
   ``Daddy used to talk about the video market and how big it would
be. I didn't have the foresight to believe what he was talking
about. He was right; everyone has a VCR now. I think that's why he
stored them.''
   The younger Robbins recalled that his father, who grew up in the
Phoenix area, was always captivated by the old West.
   ``I think he was a link with the past he wanted to be a part of.
He was such a big fan of Gene Autry's. This was part of his life
and this was his way to preserve part of it.
   ``His grandfather was a quote-unquote Texas Ranger, a poet, a
medicine man. He looks like Buffalo Bill, a caricature of the West.
It ingrained the early West in him. And being from the Phoenix area
in the 1930s, it was like the West.
   ``We'd drive home for Christmas and we'd get in Texas and he'd
start singing songs. You could see him lighting up and looking
around. He loved the mountains and the desert.''
   Pugh says there's no country singer today as versatile as
Robbins was.
   ``I don't see anybody like him now,'' he said. ``There are
popular singers, but they draw from one or two styles and go with
that. In his time, Red Foley (who died in 1968) was about that
versatile. But I can't think of anyone today that way.''

accident 20 years ago, the last thing she considered was going to a
chiropractor.
   ``My grandfather was an orthopedic surgeon,'' says Wilkinson,
53. ``The only thing I ever heard was, `Stay away from them.'''
   But reinjury of her neck nine years ago led to severe headaches,
neck spasms and faulty reflexes. Visits to an orthopedist, a
neurosurgeon and her family doctor provided no relief.
   Finally, despite her reservations and her husband's opinion that
chiropractic was ``hocus pocus,'' Wilkinson sought the help of a
chiropractor.
   The results have been ``darn near miraculous,'' she says. ``No
pain, no headaches, full functioning.''
   Others who have found relief, including athletes like runner
Mary Decker and tennis star Ivan Lendl, echo Wilkinson's glowing
review. And physicians are reluctant to criticize chiropractic
after four chiropractors won an antitrust lawsuit against the
American Medical Association.
   But the profession still struggles for credibility.
   ``We still meet lots of prejudices and unfair treatment,'' says
Steve Elliott, past director of the Texas Chiropractic Association.
   The four chiropractors filed suit against the AMA and other
groups 11 years ago, alleging they conspired to destroy the
chiropractic profession. A federal judge agreed in September and
forbade the AMA from discouraging members from associating with
chiropractors. The AMA is appealing the ruling.
   ``I see a lot of patients that deal with chiropractors, and
generally they are not accepted very well by the general medical
community, but they do help a lot of people,'' said Dr. Lawrence
Robbins, a neurologist specializing in headache treatments in the
Chicago suburb of Northbrook.
   Robbins and Dr. Richard H. Sidell were the only two physicians
willing to comment out of a dozen orthopedists and neurologists
contacted in the Chicago area. Doctors at Northwestern University
Medical School and Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center
declined comment, as did the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons.
   ``It's my feeling there are chiropractors who totally abuse what
they're doing, but on the other hand, I've worked with
chiropractors who are totally honest and who are doing a perfectly
reasonable job.'' said Sidell, an orthopedic surgeon.
   It has been only 15 years since an AMA official called
chiropractors ``rabid dogs and killers'' in the midst of a
systematic campaign by the nation's largest organization of doctors
to squelch chiropractic.
   Yet chiropractic is thriving. The number of U.S. practitioners
grew from 13,000 in 1970 to more than 30,000 in 1985, the last year
for which figures are available, according to the American
Chiropractic Association.
   Chiropractic, derived from Greek words meaning ``effective
hand,'' is based on the theory that disease may be caused by
interference with nerve function, which practitioners try to
correct by manipulating the spine and other joints.
   Chiropractors differ from physicians in that they perform no
surgery and prescribe no drugs, preferring to let the body try to
heal itself after full nerve function is restored.
   It is 93 years since Canadian immigrant Daniel David ``D.D.''
Palmer cured the deafness of his janitor in Iowa by manipulating
his spine. His experience with the janitor, who had become deaf
after wrenching his back, led to Palmer's development of
chiropractic principles and establishment of the first school to
teach them in Davenport in 1898.
   There are now 15 U.S. chiropractic colleges accredited by the
Council on Chiropractic Education. Students must complete 4,200
classroom hours of medical education over four years, similar to
medical school.
   The curriculum includes anatomy, physiology, nutrition,
pathology, public health, clinical and laboratory diagnosis,
gynecology, obstetrics, pediatrics, X-ray technique and
interpretation, geriatrics, psychology and ethics.
   ``The standards are getting greater each year,'' said Dr.
William L. Ramsey, vice president for academic affiars at Logan
College of Chiropractic in St. Louis. To be accepted into an
accredited chiropractic school, students generally must have a
``C'' average in two years of undergraduate study, including
biology, chemistry and physics.
   Far from the stereotype of the medical school dropout,
chiropractic students are more typically people who have already
established credentials in nursing, physical therapy, teaching and
dentistry, Ramsey said. ``Twenty-two percent of students have
master's degrees or better.''
   Elliott said stories abound about chiropractic's efficacy,
``from wonderful miracle cures to horrible tortures.''
   ``Fortunately, it's not like that,'' he said during a radio
interview in Liberty, Texas, where he practices. ``Most people have
an idea that we just work on backs and that we pop necks or pop
backs... But our main emphasis is to check out the overall
integrity of the structural parts of the body.''
   Treatment may relieve conditions ranging from constipation to
work-related injuries to sciatica, a low-back pain that shoots into
the leg, and scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine, he said.
   Chiropractic is trying to gain credibility with something it has
never had: scientific proof of its effectiveness, said Steven Wolk
of the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research in
Arlington, Va. The lack of research arises from ``a fundamental
problem of funding,'' he said.
   Wolk said mainstream medical research has been financially
supported largely by the federal government and pharmaceutical
companies _ neither of which has had any interest in exploring
chiropractic.
   To fill the void, the foundation has earmarked $5 million over
the next six years to commission independent research into two
areas where chiropractic seems to hold the most promise: low back
pain and headache.
   Until large clinical studies can be done, patients will have to
rely on their own best judgment about disagreements over
chiropractic that prevail in the medical community and about the
varying skill levels among chiropractors.
   As Chicago-area sports trainer Bob Gajda told Tennis magazine,
``You have 64 percent that tend to be average, and you have 10
percent that tend to be geniuses, and then you have the lower end
of the spectrum that should be shot in front of a Mexican jail.''

<TEXT>
   From an abandoned blimp base, scientists are
peering beyond the stars and studying how the earth moves.
   Their work guides ships at sea, satellites in space and even a
cab driver in Chicago, and could someday help predict earthquakes.
They also found that the generally stable Miami area is rising a
fraction of an inch a year.
   On the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory's Richmond station
south of here are optical and radio telescopes, a visiting German
laser system and soon a gravity meter, all designed to pinpoint
locations and distances.
   ``We're observing continental drift, changes in the earth's
crust and movements along fault lines, as well as the earth's spin
and wobble,'' says Alice Babcock, one of 10 civilians at the
station and its director. ``As far as I know, this network is the
only source of such measurements.''
   The station, which costs less than $500,000 a year to run, is
part of a NASA network used by the United States, Soviet Union and
other satellite-launching nations to program guidance systems and
pinpoint locations.
   The data is being fed into a growing worldwide satellite network
that will become the definitive source for navigators. It is not
only available to ships, planes, satellites and submarines, but to
motorists via computerized maps.
   ``I met a Chicago taxi driver who had a receiver mounted in his
cab _ he said it was quicker and more accurate than using a map,''
says Ms. Babcock. There are even hand-held receivers can pinpoint
location and headings for hikers, explorers and rescue teams.
   Richmond, set up in 1949 at a World War II blimp base, also has
the only backup to the Master Clock at the U.S. Naval Observatory
in Washington, a basis for accurate time measurement all over the
world. The cesium-fueled clocks at Richmond, which measure time by
the radioactive element's rate of decay, are checked constantly
against those in Washington to prevent errors.
   The exact time is shared with other points by bouncing the
information off satellites. Even at the speed of light, phone lines
are useless for comparing the readings because switching stations
can slow the signals.
   However most of the staff's time is spent looking upward. The
60-foot diameter radiotelescope seeks out quasars, small sources of
intense radio emissions billions of light-years away at the edge of
the visible universe.
   ``If one of them seems to be moving, we know it's really the
earth that's wobbling,'' says Ms. Babcock. The measurements are
constantly checked and rechecked to see how the earth and points on
its surface are changing.
   In addition, researchers from the Wettzell Station in West
Germany are using a mobile laser telescope to fire green light
beams at a two-foot orbiting LAGEOS satellite covered with 40
four-inch mirrors. The beam bounces 3,500 miles back to show up on
a screen in a trailer crammed with electronic equipment.
   ``You can do a lot of things with this information. It's a very
accurate position fix for a satellite, or for points on earth,''
says German scientist Walter Etling. Distances over 1,000 miles can
be calculated to within an inch or two using this method, he says.
   The Richmond scientists plan to install by year's end a gravity
meter, a metal ball suspended in a magnetic field that can measure
minute changes in mass below it. And Ms. Babcock hopes to install a
laser system that can bounce beams off mirrors left on the lunar
surface by U.S. and Soviet moonwalkers.
   The new systems may eventually have to replace the observatory's
optical telescope, which will become as useless as Washington's
when encroaching development lights up the night skies and makes
stargazing impossible.
   Ms. Babcock has no doubt ever more exotic measuring sticks will
be available. ``In this field, the technology is changing so fast
we never really get to a standard system.''

   Experts hope a boat found near a pharoah's
pyramid will answer questions about ancient Egypt, but they're not
studying the way it was built _ they're looking at the wood it's
made of.
   ``There are 2{ centuries of information in one piece of wood
from that boat,'' says Peter I. Kuniholm, a Cornell University
archaeologist and tree-ring expert who is studying pencil-like
cores drilled out of the planks of the 30-foot-long boat probably
buried more than 3,800 years ago in Dashur.
   It and three similar boats were buried near the pyramid complex
of Senwosret III so he could use them in the afterlife, says Diana
Craig Patch, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History Egyptologist.
   Industrialist Andrew Carnegie bought the boat in 1901 and
shipped it from Egypt to Pittsburgh. Two of the others are at the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the third is at the Field Museum of
Natural History in Chicago.
   Kuniholm hopes rings in the samples will pinpoint the boat's age
and create a framework to help date Egyptian objects and determine
when events occurred.
   Dendrochronology, the science of tree ring dating, was
established in 1930 when Andrew E. Douglass of the University of
Arizona studieaille said.
   ``You take living trees of a particular species in a particular
area, and you measure the pattern of wide and narrow rings,'' he
said. ``You can then go back to ancient timbers from buildings, for
example, and measure the ring patterns, and if they overlap in
time, you should be able to link those patterns together.
   ``You're basically piecing together this master pattern, which
is anchored at the present day.''

<HEAD>Chiropractic Struggles For Credibility Despite Court Victory</HEAD>

   CHICAGO _ Those who have found relief through chiropractors'
spinal manipulation sing its praises, and physicians are reluctant

   Only in recent years, though, has enough wood been collected
from medieval ruins, ice layers, artifacts and other sources to
date objects more than 5,000 years old, said Michael G.L. Baillie
of Queen's University in Belfast, Ireland.
   The science increasingly is revealing more than just the age of
objects, including data about the weather or environment 5,000
years ago. The spacing of rings represents time intervals when
trees were alive and growing. The width of each ring reflects the
weather each growing season, and comparison of many samples from
one region gives a climate pattern.
   ``You take living trees of a particular species in a particular

Baillie said. You can then go back to ancient timbers from

<HEAD>Arteries May Produce Signals Leading To Clogged Arteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deposits that clog the body's arteries,
contributing to heart disease and other problems, may result in
part from hormones produced by the arteries themselves, new
research suggests.
   ``Our results illustrate that the cells of the blood vessel wall
are not mere bystanders in disease of the blood vessel wall but can
play an active role by secreting important hormones,'' says Dr.
Peter Libby of Tufts University.
   Deposits on the artery walls contribute to heart attacks, high
blood pressure and other circulatory problems. These deposits,
known as plaque, are made of fat as well as overgrowth of smooth
muscle cells.
   The new research shows that muscle cells taken from plaques
produce a powerful hormone, platelet-derived growth factor, that
stimulates the muscle cells to grow. If so, arteries may become
clogged because their cells are both producing this hormone and
responding to it by growing. Why is still unclear.
   Platelet-derived growth factor was first isolated from
platelets, blood cells that help to form clots. However, research
has shown that other cells can also make this hormone.
   The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, was
conducted on cells in test tubes. Researchers say cells in the body
may act differently.

<HEAD>Mountain Lions Are Surrogate Moms For 10 Wildcat Embryos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts hope surrogate mothers will
help save the endangered Florida panther.
   The implantation of 10 embryos _ one of them half panther _ in
two Texas mountain lions, marks the second use of in vitro
fertilization in cats, says Tom Logan of the state Game and
Freshwater Fish Commission. ``The success rate for the procedure in
humans is about 17 percent. Since it's only been done to one other
cat, and since that was only a month ago, there's no way of telling
what the odds are for our two surrogate mothers.''
   Researchers mixed 50 eggs from three Texas mountain lions with
sperm from a Florida panther and two mountain lions to get the
embryos, which were implanted June 3 by Dr. Melody Roelke at the
University of Florida veterinary school.
   ``We should be happy if even one embryo is carried to full term
and is born,'' said Roelke, of the Florida Panther Reintroduction
Project. Pregnancies in the cats are 93 days long.
   Mountain lions are used because they are nearly identical
biologically to panthers and because wildlife laws forbid the use
of endangered animals in any experimental program. Experts believe
no more than 30 panthers remain.
   The first in vitro attempt was last month at the National Zoo,
Logan said. That involved a leopard cat, said Roelke.

<HEAD>Fetal Cell Implants May Help Fight Parkinson's</HEAD>

   Fetal brain tissue implanted in two Swedish
Parkinson's disease patients appears healthy six months after
surgery, and a University of Colorado researcher says that may
signal new hope for sufferers of the disease.
   The two transplants are believed to be the first monitored
closely enough to produce scientifically reliable results, said Dr.
Barry J. Hoffer, professor of pharmacology at the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center and part of an international team
responsible for the clinical trials.
   Hoffer said it's too soon to tell if the tissue transplanted
late last year will produce noticeable improvement in the
recipients, two middle-aged women in advanced stages of the
neurological disorder that affects 500,000 Americans.
   Parkinson's is a progressive destruction of nerve cells. Victims
suffer tremors and increasing muscle stiffness until they cannot
move normally.
   In the experimental therapy, a small cluster of brain tissue is
removed from an aborted fetus and injected into the patient near
the base of the brain. In animals, the fetal cells develop into
nerve cells that produce dopamine, a central nervous system
transmitter that Parkinson's disease patients lack.
   The use of fetal tissue has sparked controversy in anti-abortion
circles.

<HEAD>Researchers Closing In On Alcoholism Gene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they're on the trail of a gene
that could lead to a blood test to identify people vulnerable to
alcoholism.
   A study of 30 families, each with at least two alcoholic male
siblings, showed a possible link between alcoholism and the MNS
blood group, a genetic marker determining blood type, says Shirley
Y. Hill of the University of Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric
Institute & Clinic.
   ``Eventually, we may be able to screen people and tell them how
great their risk is of being an alcoholic,'' Ms. Hill says.
   Among members of any one family, the alcoholics' MNS blood group
had similarities not apparent among the blood group in the
non-alcoholics, she says. ``We don't know what the gene is. It
could be a gene that affects the way people react to alcohol, the
way the brain reacts. It could be a gene that's important in
developing a compulsive personality.''
   Research points to the existence of such a gene, but not its
location. Studies show that children of alcoholics face four times
the risk of becoming alcoholics themselves, even when separated
from the alcoholic parents at birth and adopted by a non-alcoholic
mother and father, Ms. Hill says.
   The findings are to be published in the journal Alcoholism:
Clinical and Experimental Research.

   Share prices dropped in morning trading Tuesday on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the U.S. dollar fell slightly in
foreign exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose to
its second highest level ever on Monday, lost 102.39 points to
finish the morning session at 27,934.15.
   On Monday, the market's main barometer closed at 28,036.54
points, just 35.48 points short of its record high registered last
Thursday.
   ``A wait-and-see position spread in morning trading'' among many
market participants prior to the release of U.S. monthly trade
figures for April, slated for later Tuesday in Washington, said
Minoru Maeda of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Maeda declined to say what Japanese investors expected the April
figures to reach.
   Kin Ogino of the securities firm Goldman Sachs said the stock
market dropped because of profit-taking following its recent ascent
and because of the upcoming U.S. figures.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar opened at 125.15 yen, down from
Monday's close of 125.19 yen, and traded between 125.05-125.18 yen
before closing the morning session at 125.07 yen.

   OPEC members have recessed their midyear
conference until Tuesday so the 13-nation cartel's oil ministers
could informally discuss disagreements over a proposed new quota in
production.
   The conference opened Saturday and was recessed after Sunday's
meeting until Tuesday morning. Afterwards, two Arab oil ministers
left, with one expected to return by Tuesday but the other saying
he might not.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers have
been considering whether to change an existing agreement among 12
of the members that limits the cartel's oil output to 15.06 million
barrels a day.
   That quota, which was extended in December and expires June 30,
was aimed at supporting oil prices at $18 a barrel but prices have
been well below that.

of $500 million to $750 million in common stock and about $2.5
billion in debt securities.
   The Icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the
holding company, including its interests in Texaco and Trans World
Airlines Inc.

Burnley proposed a drug testing program for interstate drivers of
large trucks and passenger buses to make the nation's highways
safer.
   Burnley's announcement Friday follows similar proposals unveiled
in March for the aviation industry and in May for railroads.
   He cited a June 1987 test of 317 tractor-trailer drivers in
Tennessee that showed 15 percent of the drivers tested positive for
marijuana, cocaine or prescription stimulants.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission moved
toward tightening the requirements for deciding whether mutual
funds can describe themselves as ``no-load'' funds.
   In no-load funds, which many investors prefer, no sales fee is
charged. But, since 1980, no-load funds have been allowed to use
some of the money from investors to pay for certain sales and
promotional expenses.
   The commission voted 4-0 Friday to ask for comment on a proposal
that would tighten regulation of how these expenses are assessed
against mutual funds. It would also prohibit funds that assess
these hidden charges from describing themselves as no-load funds.

   Still pictures and written words may capture
high school and college graduates' best memories but a video
yearbook is what's needed to really go beyond the sounds of
silence, students and industry executives say.
   ``There are a number of pitches we use,'' said Bob Levitan,
president of Durham, N.C.-based Yearbook Enterprises. ``It brings
those black and white photos to life by capturing the excitement
and emotion that a print yearbook can't always do.''
   Levitan said his company, like others in the field, don't try to
undercut sales of the traditional yearbook but offer the video as a
supplement.
   Videos cost between $20 and $40 depending on their length, which
can range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes.
   A yearbook, which must go to print midway through the second
half of the school year, cannot always include things like senior
prom and graduation.
   Yearbook Enterprises works with about 50 colleges and high
schools in teaching students how to use video equipment and buying
the rights to songs that young filmmakers want to use as background
music.
   ``It's educational,'' said Levitan, who filmed Duke University's
yearbook for two years before graduating in 1983. ``Students grew
up watching MTV. This is an opportunity to create with video.
They're creating their own MTV.''
   One student attracted by the idea was John Zager, an 18-year-old
senior at Lawrenceville Prep.
   He has coordinated filming and sales of his school's video
yearbook, which sells for $39.95, for the past two years. He said
sales expanded this year because more students became aware of a
video's knack to recapture the feeling of student plays and
homecoming football games.
   ``There's something about sitting down and watching events in
color,'' said Zager, of Wayne. ``It gives you an honest sense of
the school.''
   Princeton junior Caroline Havens, who worked on her school's
30-minute video, agreed.
   ``This is a more living type of yearbook,'' said the 20-year
junior from New London, Conn. ``We don't try to downplay
(traditional) yearbooks but this is a lot more lively.''
   The video yearbook companies take different approaches. At
Campus Camera, a New Jersey company co-founded by two former
cameramen from an Atlantic City television station, the philosophy
is ``leave the filmmaking to us.''
   ``Our quality of equipment is equivalent to a TV station,''
co-owner David Pashuck said. ``I wouldn't hand that over to a
student.''
   Pashuck said students also might tend to only film their
friends. Outside cameramen prevent that and guarantee a quality
product.
   And Pashuck and his partner have enjoyed their first year with
the two schools _ Mainland Regional High School in Linwood and
Mater Dei High School in Middletown _ that they've worked with.
   Pashuck said Campus Camera, like other video yearbook
enterprises, will grow in the years ahead by capitalizing on
people's expanding familiarity with video equipment.
   Steve Sullivan, the 30-year-old head of Dallas-based Video
Yearbook Inc., said the job brings smiles in addition to profits.
   ``I've been doing some of the shooting myself,'' Sullivan said.
``The excitement _ you forget about it once you get out of high
school. This is one way to keep it forever.''

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today rose to
their second highest level ever, and the U.S. dollar also
strengthened against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 151.66-point
loser on Friday, closed at 28,036.54, up 116.18 points, or 0.41
percent. It was 35.48 points short of its record high on Thursday,
when it closed at 28,072.02.
   Volume was a moderate 900 million shares, down sharply from
Friday's 2.2 billion.
   A stock analyst at a Tokyo brokerage, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said traders were awaiting the release in Washington on
Tuesday of U.S. trade figures for April.
   Little news was available to affect the Tokyo market, because
Sunday was a newspaper holiday in Japan and no papers appeared
today.
   Electricals, automobiles, precision machineries and drugs rose,
along with financial and foodstuff issues. Steels, textiles and
chemicals fell.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
125.19 yen, up 0.34 yen from Friday's finish.
   ``The dollar was supported by favorable prospects for the U.S.
trade figures for April,'' said a foreign exchange dealer, also
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But trading was sluggish, and the dollar moved in a narrow range
of 125.00-125.20 yen. Dealers were waiting for the trade data
before placing major orders, he said.
   An exchange dealer at another commercial bank said the dollar
rose on a weekend remark by the vice chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board. Manuel Johnson told reporters Saturday in West
Germany he thought ``there would be a certain tolerance for (the
dollar to rise).''

<HEAD>For Ashland Oil, 1988 Has Been Good and Bad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Ashland Oil Inc., 1988 has been one
public relations disaster after another.
   First there was an oil spill. Then there were complaints about
pollution. Now a federal trial has gone against it.
   It all started Jan. 2 when a 4-million-gallon storage tank
collapsed near Pittsburgh, sending more than 700,000 gallons of
diesel fuel into the Monongahela and Ohio rivers in one of the
worst inland oil spills in U.S. history.
   Two weeks later, the company was fined $95,000 for violating air
pollution standards at its Catlettsburg refinery.
   State air quality officials received 80 complaints from nearby
residents during three weeks in February and March.
   In mid-March, a report by the federal Environmental Protection
Agency said Ashland had violated regulations at its hazardous-waste
dump near the refinery.
   But perhaps the biggest public relations problem of all hit
Friday, when a U.S. District Court jury in Covington ruled that the
company engaged in racketeering in 1980 when it made payments to
foreign government officials to obtain crude oil.
   The jury awarded nearly $70 million to former vice presidents
Bill McKay and Harry Williams, who said they had been fired for
refusing to take part in the payments and for telling U.S.
government agencies about the money.
   Ashland Oil, which is Kentucky's largest corporation and the
nation's largest independent oil refiner, said it would appeal.
Whether the awards are whittled down by higher courts remains to be
seen, but the company expects any payment to be covered by a $75
million policy with Home Insurance Co.
   Money aside, however, observers say Ashland has an image problem.
   ``The public perception is that something must be wrong if it
(the case) has gone this far,'' said Larry Lad, an assistant
professor of management at Indiana University.
   Louisville attorney Charles H. Zimmerman Jr. said some lawyers
following the case figured Ashland would win by persuading jurors
its past business practices were commonplace.
   Zimmerman said the jury's decision may reflect some anger among
consumers. ``There is the feeling that big business _ the Fortune
500 companies _ have gotten away with murder,'' he said.
   A public explanation might improve Ashland's image, suggested
Gerald Meyers, former chairman of American Motors Corp. and author
of ``When It Hits the Fan,'' a book on corporate crises.
   ``The way to lose in the court of public opinion is to hide
behind your lawyers,'' Meyers said.
   He said the burden of repairing the company's public image rests
with its current chairman, John Hall. ``Nobody is as believable as
the chief executive officer,'' Meyers said.
   That's a notion Hall reinforced in January, when he drew
national praise for publicly discussing the massive oil spill.
   Ashland spokesman Dan Lacy said Saturday that he thinks Hall
will make a statement, although it won't come until the company
files legal motions related to Friday's decision. Ashland has 10
days to do so.
   Lacy said the public relations problems have masked an otherwise
good financial year for the company.
   In the six months that ended March 31, Ashland earned $67
million, not including a one-time gain of $31 million, compared
with $22 million a year earlier. Revenue also rose, to $3.9 billion
from $3.2 billion in 1987.
   ``If you really want to know how the year has been for the
company, it has been very good,'' Lacy said. ``I think the
shareholders are pleased by the performance of the company.
   Ashland has interests in petroleum, coal, chemicals and
construction.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
early European trading today, and dealers said activity would
remain sluggish until Tuesday's release of the latest U.S. trade
figures.
   Gold prices fell in Europe from Friday's closing bids but were
up slightly from the late bid price in New York. Gold plunged
almost $7 an ounce in New York on Friday to $449 after European
markets closed, largely because of falling oil prices.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Frankfurt said the dollar received
support from a remark by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson on Saturday. He said there is some room for the
currency to rise.
   But traders said the market will remain hard to move until
release of the U.S. April trade deficit. Frankfurt dealers
predicted the deficit would show a widening to $12.2 billion from
an adjusted $11.95 billion in March.
   ``Everyone's waiting for the figures,'' said a dealer at a large
Frankfurt bank.
   ``Very little business will be done today,'' predicted one
trader with a major Italian commercial bank in Milan. Both spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 125.19 yen, up from 124.85 late
Friday. Later, in London, it was quoted slightly higher at 125.12
yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates: 1.7221 West German marks, up from 1.7180; 1.4425 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4355 5.8220 French francs, up from 5.8040; 1.9133
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9280; 1,281.65 Italian lire, up from
1,278.50; and 1.22075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2191.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.8250 to buy one pound, up from $1.8175.
   Bullion dealers said trading was also quiet pending Tuesday's
release of U.S. trade figures.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $451.10 a troy ounce and
at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $450.50, both down from late Friday's bid of
$456.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $450.50, down from $458.00 late
Friday.
   Hong Kong financial markets were closed today to celebrate the
official birthday of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.98 a troy
ounce, down from 7.17 late Friday.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the 12-nation European
Economic Community on Monday approved an accord establishing formal
relations with the Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, or Comecon.
   The agreement was initialled by EEC and Comecon officials last
week in Moscow. It is to be put into force at an official signing
ceremony in Luxembourg on June 25.
   The pact sets the stage for exchanges of information but doesn't
establish bilateral trade relations.
   It marks the Communist bloc's first official recognition of the
EEC since the Common Market was created 31 years ago. For years,
Moscow and its Communist allies virtually ignored the EEC, calling
it a quasi-military extension of the American-led NATO alliance.
   The EEC and Comecon have been negotiating the terms of a joint
declaration on mutual recognition since September 1985.
   EEC member nations include: Britain, West Germany, France,
Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece,
Spain and Portugal.
   Moscow's partners in Comecon are Poland, Romania, Hungary,
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Cuba, Vietnam and Mongolia.
   Trade between EEC and Comecon members totaled about $50 billion
last year, about half of which was between the EEC and the Soviet
Union, according to the June issue of East-West Publications, a
Brussels-based newsletter.
   The EEC has sought to emphasize bilateral contacts with the
Comecon member countries rather than bloc-to-bloc relations. This
is mainly because the Common Market says Comecon does not have
equivalent authority to decide trade and other issues for its
members.
   Last week, the Soviet Union and East Germany submitted formal
requests to open their own bilateral diplomatic relations with the
EEC.
   The EEC hopes to wrap up a bilateral trade and cooperation
agreement with Hungary this year. During their Luxembourg meeting,
the foreign ministers gave the EEC negotiators new instructions for
the Hungary talks.

   The stock market opened lower today as traders
moved to cash in on the previous week's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 4.98 points at
2,096.73 in the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.54 million shares. Gainers
slightly outnumbered losers, with 496 up, 423 down and 491
unchanged.
   Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking as the Dow

   ``We've had a long run, and the market's backing off a little,''
said Hildegarde Zagorski, a second vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Many expect traders will be keeping a sharp eye on the
merchandise trade report for April, due to be released on Tuesday.
But Zagorski said traders are more interested in the trend than the
actual deficit figure.
   ``And the trend seems to be in our favor,'' she said.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was off 1[ at 50}. Carl C.
Icahn said he has held talks with Gulf Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil
Ltd. about the possibility of forming a joint venture to take over
Texaco.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks eased
0.08 to 152.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.48 at 308.85.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average 8.36 to 2,101.71,
finishing the week with a net gain of 30.41 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the

Buying Texaco</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn says he
discussed a joint acquisition of Texaco Inc. with two Canadian oil
concerns and that Citibank verbally agreed to finance such a deal.
   The disclosures were contained in a weekend deposition of
Texaco's largest shareholder conducted by attorneys for the oil
giant, reported today by the Wall Street Journal.
   The deposition was part of escalating legal maneuvers between
Icahn and Texaco over his attempt to buy the company for $60 a
share, which values it at $14.6 billion.
   Icahn and Texaco have been engrossed in an acrimonious takeover
dispute since last month, the latest episode in the troubled oil
giant's attempt to normalize following its prolonged
bankruptcy-court ordeal.
   The investor, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco stock, is
conducting a proxy fight for five seats on the company's board in
an effort to pressure management into letting shareholders vote on
his takeover offer. Results of the proxy contest will be disclosed
at the company's annual meeting this Friday.
   Icahn disclosed to Texaco lawyers that in the last two weeks he
held separate discussions toward a possible takeover partnership
with Gulf Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Ltd. Icahn also said a Citibank
representative assured him that financing a Texaco takeover was
``eminently doable.''
   His disclosures could substantiate Texaco's claim that Icahn has
improperly failed to disclose the extent of his takeover talks with
other parties. Icahn has denied any wrongdoing.
   Other court documents unsealed at the request of the New York
Times indicate Icahn once tried to arrange the purchase of a large
stake in Texaco held by the investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis,
Roberts & Co. to Canadian investor Marc Belzberg, but the deal
never happened because of a price disagreement.
   Texaco attorneys say those documents suggest Icahn may have
improperly attempted to find allies for coordinated purchases of
Texaco stock as part of a broader plan to take over the company.
Icahn has denied such charges in the past.
   On Friday, Icahn said he was forming a new holding company to
act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions, including a bid for
Texaco. He said the holding company intended to raise up to $3.25
billion through an offering of stock and debt securities.
   The Icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the
holding company, including its 36.1 million shares of Texaco and
its interests in Trans World Airlines Inc. and ACF, a leasing
company.
   Icahn began acquiring Texaco stock last year when the company
was mired in bankruptcy-court proceedings and its stock was trading
$20 lower than the current price of about $51 a share.
   Texaco sought federal bankruptcy protection in April 1987 when
it faced a record $10.53 billion judgment to Pennzoil Co. awarded
by a Texas jury that found Texaco improperly interfered with
Pennzoil's attempt to buy Getty Oil Co. Texaco settled with
Pennzoil two months ago by paying it $3 billion and has proposed a
post-bankruptcy recovery involving the sale of $5 billion in assets.

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers today met informally to
discuss whether to change their existing oil production quota, amid
speculation that the talks have stalled.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday
adjourned its regular midyear conference to allow the 13-nation
cartel's oil ministers to informally discuss disagreements.
   The conference began Saturday and will resume Tuesday.
   The ministers have been considering whether to change an
existing agreement among 12 of the members that limits their oil
production to 15.06 million barrels a day.
   That quota, which was extended in December and expires June 30,
was aimed at supporting oil prices at $18 a barrel.
   Iraq has refused to sign the agreement because it wants an
output quota equal to that of Iran. Iraq, at war with Iran since
September 1980, was granted a quota of 1.54 million barrels a day
in a previous agreement. Iran's daily quota is 2.369 million
barrels.
   Some OPEC members want to cut production to push oil prices up,
while others want to increase output or at least hold it steady to
take advantage of an expected increase in demand later this year.
   But analysts believe OPEC is so deeply divided it will extend
the existing agreement for at least three months.
   ``We are working on compromise,'' Indonesian oil minister
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said today. ``There are agreements on most
of the issues.''
   He said he strongly believed the cartel would make a decision
either Tuesday or Wednesday.
   ``There will definitely be an agreement,'' added Saudi Arabian
oil minister Hisham Nazer.
   But ministerial sources from two countries also said Sunday that
the cartel _ expecting a stalemate _ was most likely to extend the
current production quota.
   ``There's a degree of disappointment and confusion,'' said Alan
Sinclair, an oil analyst at the London investment firm Smith New
Court Ltd.
   Adding to the confusion was the departure of two Arab oil
ministers, with one expected to return by Tuesday but the other
saying he might not.
   Mana Saeed Oteiba, the United Arab Emirates' oil minister, said
Sunday he was returning to his country for consultations with his
government and that he might or might not return. He gave no reason
for his sudden departure.
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa Sabah will leave today, but
will return in time for the Tuesday session, members of his
delegation said.
   Observers speculated that Sabah was going to London to appear
before the British government's Monopolies and Mergers Commission
about Kuwait's purchase of more than 20 percent of British
Petroleum Co. earlier this year.
   ``The fact that Oteiba must consult with his supeiors is very
reminiscent of a stall. It's awfully convenient, isn't it?'' said
Peter Gignoux, managing director of the international energy
department at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London.
   Oil markets were disappointing today, with the spot price of
North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude
oil, falling to 55 cents to $15.30 a barrel and then held steady on
the spot market.
   The 13 members of the cartel are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon,
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling On Federal Home Loan Bank Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that states indirectly may tax interest paid to financial
institutions from investments in Federal Home Loan Bank bonds.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' rejected a challenge to a Maryland bank franchise tax.
   The Maryland National Bank challenged the tax, seeking a refund
of $197,310 it paid under protest to the state for the years 1979
through 1982.
   During that period, the bank reported $2.82 million in interest
from FHLB bonds.
   The sum was included in the bank's net earnings that were
subject to Maryland's franchise tax, which is imposed on financial
institutions for the privilege of doing business in Maryland.
   The difficulty over whether earnings from FHLB bonds are taxable
arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws.
   A 1932 law that created the FHLB generally exempts the bonds
from taxes.
   But a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a
``non-discriminatory franchise tax'' on ``stocks and obligations of
the United States government'' that generally are exempt from state
and local taxes.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the state franchise tax,
ruling in October that the 1862 law takes precedence.
   The state court based its ruling in part on a 1975 opinion by
the general counsel's office of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   The state court said a franchise tax paid for the privilege of
doing business in the state is not the same as a direct tax on a
bank's income.
   The state court also said the tax does not violate the
Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which binds states to adhere to
federal law.
   The case is Maryland National Bank vs. State Department of
Assessments, 87-1080.

<HEAD>NEC Earnings Rise 69 Percent In Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NEC Corp., the Japanese electronics giant, said
its profit rose 68.7 percent in its latest fiscal year from the
depressed level of a year earlier, partly because of a recovery in
its world-leading sales of semiconductors. Sales climbed 10.8
percent.
   The company predicted further gains in its current fiscal year,
which ends March 31, 1989, estimating gains of about 90 percent in
profit and 7 percent in sales.
   NEC said its profit rose to 25.4 billion yen, or about $205
million, from 10.3 billion yen in the previous year. Revenue rose
to 2.71 trillion yen, or $21.9 billion, from 2.45 trillion yen a
year earlier.
   NEC announced its profits on Friday in Tokyo, but the report was
not circulated in the United States until Monday.
   In addition to a recovered market for semiconductors, NEC cited
``steady progress'' in such fields as communications equipment,
computers, industrial electronic systems and home electronics.
   Domestic sales rose 12.2 percent and overseas sales rose 7.2
percent. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies _ mainly
subsidiaries in the United States and other countries _ jumped 146
percent, partly on the strength of a stronger yen.
   The results in yen were translated into dollars at a rate of 124
yen to the dollar.

   The stock market moved slightly lower today as
traders took time out to cash in on the previous weeks' gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 6.23 points at
2,095.48 in the first hour and a half of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 47.67 million shares at 11 a.m.
Losers outnumbers gainers by about 10 to 9 with 537 up, 582 down
and 551 unchanged.
   The Dow started the week about eight points shy of its
post-crash high, and analysts said it was time for some
profit-taking.
   ``We've had a long run, and the market's backing off a little,''
said Hildegarde Zagorski, a second vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Optimism that the market will move higher still prevails. Robert
Ritter, a senior vice president and technical analyst at L.F.
Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, said the slight selloff gives
investors ``an opportunity, because it doesn't appear the up move
is over.''
   Many expect traders will be keeping a sharp eye on the
merchandise trade report for April, due to be released on Tuesday.
But Zagorski said traders are more interested in the trend than the
actual deficit figure.
   ``And the trend seems to be in our favor,'' she said.
   A flurry of other economic indicators are also due to be
released this week, including retail sales, industrial production,
business inventories, factory capacity and housing starts.
   With plenty of cash on the sidelines, some analysts speculated
that investors may be waiting for clearer signals about the economy
before jumping back into the market.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mostly Lower In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
mostly higher then turned mostly lower today as rainy weather
dampened bullish enthusiasm on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures were lower from the start, reflecting weekend
rains in the drought-stricken northern Plains, analysts said.
Reports of rain today in the western Corn Belt quickly put soybean
and corn traders on edge and prices for those commodities turned
lower as well.
   ``Some traders are very nervous about rain showing up (in the
central Midwest) in the next three days,'' said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He noted that the November soybean contract, for delivery of
new-crop beans, fluctuated within a 9-cent range in the session's
opening minutes. ``That shows you the amount of hesitancy and
uncertainty here,'' Lespinasse said.
   Oat futures continued to climb on the perception that dry
conditions have already destroyed part of the U.S. oat crop,
analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 6\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.68 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
3\ cents lower with July at $2.56 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 6
cents higher with July at $2.66 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to
16 cents lower with July at $8.70 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 71.90
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .50 cent lower with
August at 74.90 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .40 cent
higher with June at 51.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.27 cent lower to .10 cent higher with July at 49.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Friday.

   The Supreme Court today barred states from
banning all direct mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential
clients.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled in a Kentucky case that states
violate free-speech rights when they prohibit lawyers from
soliciting business by sending truthful and nondeceptive letters to
people they know face particular legal problems.
   Writing for the court, Justice William J. Brennan said states
may require lawyers to file copies of such soliciting letters with
a state agency authorized to penalize actual abuses.
   But Brennan said the potential for abuse does not justify a
total ban, as imposed in Kentucky.
   ``Our recent decisions involving commercial speech have been
grounded in the faith that the free flow of commercial information
is valuable enough to justify imposing on would-be regulators the
costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false, the helpful
from the misleading and the harmless from the harmful,'' Brennan
said.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The three dissenters _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia _ said it was time
to overturn the 1977 Supreme Court decision that first overturned
the legal profession's longtime ban on any type of lawyer
advertising.
   ``Rather than continuing to work out all the consequences of
(the 1977 ruling's approach) we should now return to the states the
legislative function that has so inappropriately been taken from
them in the context of attorney advertising,'' O'Connor wrote for
the three.
   The court's 1977 decision said a total ban on lawyer advertising
violates free-speech rights.
   Like other commercial speech, however, lawyer ads are
constitutionally protected only when truthful and nondeceptive.
   The court in 1978 expressly prohibited lawyers from seeking
business through in-person solicitation of people known to have
legal problems.
   But today, the court said that in some cases solicitation
through direct mailings must be allowed.
   ``Admittedly, a letter that is personalized to the recipient
presents an increased risk of deception, intentional or
inadvertent,'' Brennan said. ``But merely because targeted,
direct-mail solicitation presents lawyers with opportunities for
isolated abuses or mistakes does not justify a total ban on that
mode of protected commercial speech,'' he added.
   Kentucky's total ban, fashioned by the state's Supreme Court,
follows the American Bar Association model rule that direct-mail
solicitation be banned ``when a significant motive for the lawyer's
doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain.''
   The ABA model, now declared constitutionally unsound, has been
adopted by Idaho, Nevada, North Carolina, Washington and Wyoming.
   Three states _ Arizona, Arkansas and Indiana _ adopted
direct-mail bans more restrictive than the ABA model. They also now
are likely to fall in the face of a free-speech challenge.
   In Kentucky, the ban on targeted direct-mail ads was challenged
by Richard D. Shapero, a Louisville lawyer.
   Shapero had wanted to send a letter to potential clients against
whom foreclosure lawsuits had been filed, but he was told that
mailing such a solicitation would violate the state lawyer-ethics
rules.
   Shapero's case now returns to the Kentucky Supreme Court for
further study.
   The case is Shapero vs. Kentucky Bar Association, 87-l6.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States fell for the second straight week to 889, down nine
rigs from the previous week, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   After jumping 13 two weeks ago, the count fell by seven in the
tally announced last week.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
The rig count totaled 814 a year ago.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma lost 11 rigs, Kansas
dropped four and Colorado three, while Texas was off by two and
Ohio by one. New Mexico gained seven rigs and Michigan picked up
three, while California, Pennsylvania and Louisiana each gained
two. There was no change in the count in North Dakota and Wyoming.

   The Supreme Court today allowed banks to use
subsidiaries to engage in underwriting and dealing in some
securities.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand a ruling that
such activity does not violate a 1933 law aimed primarily at
protecting the financial stability of banks by restricting them
from speculating in stocks and bonds.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor voted to hear
arguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant such
review.
   The 1933 federal law, the Glass-Steagall Act, was passed by
Congress in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929.
   The law placed various restrictions on banks, in large measure
to protect deposits from being squandered on Wall Street.
   In recent years, the wall of separation between commercial and
investment bank activities has been lowered.
   At issue in the case acted on today were rulings by the Federal
Reserve Board allowing some of the nation's leading banks to use
subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in municipal revenue bonds,
mortgage-related securities and commercial paper. The latter is a
form of IOU used by corporations to finance short-term debt.
   The Federal Reserve Board last year said bank subsidiaries may
underwrite and deal in such securities as long as they do not
exceed 5 to 10 percent of the subsidary's gross revenue.
   The board said that is in line with the Glass-Stegall Act's
requirement that banks may not affiliate with an organization
``engaged principally'' in underwriting or dealing in securities.
   The board's rulings were challenged by the Securities Industry
Association, a trade group of underwriters, brokers andd securities
dealers.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in February upheld the
Federal Reserve Board decisions, and the Reagan administration
urged the justices to leave intact the appeals court rulng.
   Justice Department lawyers said the Federal Reserve Board acted
properly, and that any change in banking regulations should be left
to Congress.
   The government noted that a moratorium Congress imposed on the
type of banking activities involved in the dispute expired in
March, and Congress has not renewed it. Moreover, legislation is
pending to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act.
   Reacting to today's decision, Edward I. O'Brien, president of
the Securities Industry Association, said, ``We are disappointed
the Supreme Court decided not to hear our appeal to prevent banks,
through affiliates, from engaging in a wide range of securities.''
   ``But we are pleased the Federal Reserve itself has erected a
series of firewalls ... to prevent banks from taking excessive
risks within the securities arena which would further weaken banks
and thus endanger the nation's economy,'' O'Brien said.
   Charles Pistor, president of the American Bankers Association,
said, ``This is another hole in the anti-competitive Glass-Steagall
Act and another important victory for consumers. But, before large
numbers of bank customers will benefit, we need to repeal the
Glass-Steagall Act and allow all banks to offer securities
services.''
   The case is Securities Industry Association vs. Federal Reserve
System, 87-1513.

<HEAD>Noboru Who? Poll Reveals Americans' Ignorance Of Japanese Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll released Monday found that only four of
1,500 Americans could name the Japanese prime minister, while 90
percent of 2,000 Japanese knew the U.S. president was named Ronald
Reagan.
   For the record, the Japanese leader is Noboru Takeshita, the
leader of Japan's dominant Liberal Democratic Party, who succeeded
Yasuhiro Nakasone as prime minister seven months ago after serving
as finance minister in Nakasone's cabinet.
   The poll was conducted jointly in May by the Tokyo Broadcasting
System and CBS. Most of the questions involved trade issues.
   Seventy-two percent of the Americans polled said they favored
protection for domestic agricultural markets, while about 60
percent of the 2,000 Japanese surveyed said the same about their
markets.
   Forty-three percent of Americans said Japan's barriers on
imports of U.S. beef and citrus fruit were improper, and only 14
percent considered them fair.
   Among Japanese respondents, 59 percent said the restrictions
were fair and 29 percent unfair.
   The network released the survey results on its news programs one
day before Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith reopens
stalemated talks with Japanese officials over beef and orange
imports in Tokyo.
   Japan has said it will phase out beef import restrictions over a
three-year period, but needs a 70 percent tariff on U.S. beef to
keep prices in line with domestic levels. U.S. officials want a
substantially lower tariff.
   U.S. negotiators are also expected to urge Japan to liberalize
its citrus market in three years, instead of the five-year period
proposed by Tokyo.
   The margin of error in the poll was not specified.

   Share prices closed lower on the London Stock
Exchange Monday amid a bout of jitters ahead of Tuesday's scheduled
release of U.S. trade figures for April.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 11.0 points, or 0.59 percent, at 1,838.8.
The low for the day was 1,833.3, while the high _ registered as the
market opened for trading _ was 1,848.9.
   Volume was a thin 316.2 million shares, down from Friday's 497.6
million shares.
   In New York, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was 0.53
points higher at 2,102.24 by the end of the London trading session,
having been down about 12 points earlier. However, London equities
were not able to shake off the negative influence of Wall Street.
   The U.S. April trade figures were expected to show a slight

<HEAD>Bloomingdale's Announces 2 Percent Job Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bloomingdale's announced Monday it was laying
off 245 employees, or nearly 2 percent of its work force, as part
of the cuts ordered by Campeau Corp. at Federated Department Store
Inc. divisions.
   Bloomingdale's, with 14,000 employees, was the last Federated
department store division to announce layoffs. Eighty-six employees
were let go from Bloomingdale's organization offices, while 159
were cut from its stores and catalog operation.
   No sales positions were eliminated, Bloomingdale's said in a
statement.
   There had been reports Bloomingdale's expected to lay off 400
employees. The company said Monday some jobs were saved through
transfers and by the assignment of personnel to the chain's Chicago
store, which is scheduled to open in September.
   Campeau ordered cuts at all Federated divisions after it took
control of the retailer last month. Layoffs were earlier announced
among Federated's corporate staff and at the Abraham and Straus,
Burdine's, Goldsmith's, Lazarus and Rich's divisions.
   Industry observers have said the cuts were long overdue.
However, some Wall Street analysts said there may be adverse
effects on merchandise selection as a result of the layoffs.

   The stock market eased slightly in afternoon
trading today after ek about eight points shy of its
post-crash high, and traders began the session by cashing in on the
previous weeks' gains. The Dow had been off about 10 points before
turning upward.
   ``Every time it dips, there are bargain hunters out there flush
with cash'' who buy equities, said Charles Jensen, chief technical
analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
   But the Dow continued to seesaw and gave up some ground as the
afternoon wore on.
   Institutional investors, mutual funds and foreign buyers are
sitting on the sidelines ``with an uncommon amount of cash,''
Jensen noted.
   Many expect traders will be keeping a sharp eye on the
merchandise trade report for April, due to be released on Tuesday.
But traders are likely to be more interested in the trend than the
actual deficit figure.
   A flurry of other economic indicators is also due to be released
this week, including retail sales, industrial production, business
inventories, factory capacity and housing starts.
   Some analysts speculate that investors may be waiting for
clearer signals about the economy before jumping back into the
market.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
mostly lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts
for rain in the Midwest later this week.
   But corn futures finished slighly higher, reflecting uncertainty
about the amount of moisture that drought-ridden croplands are
likely to receive, analysts said.
   ``There is some rain coming in and the market, at least today,
felt it would be beneficial'' for the crops, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Volume was markedly lighter than in last week's sessions, which
saw grain and soybean futures rise dramatically as traders bet on a
lengthy dry spell. Soybean futures rose last week to more than $9 a
bushel, a 4{-year high.
   Rain dampened wheat fields in the northern Plains on Sunday and
showers were reported moving eastward from the western edge of the
Corn Belt on Monday.
   ``There were a lot of traders on the sidelines, watching, hoping
and praying,'' Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.69{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.59 a bushel; oats were
6 cents lower to 2 cents higher with July at $2.62 a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 8 cents lower with July at $8.78 a bushel.

   The stock market eased slightly today after
seesawing in a narrow range.
   Analysts noted that traders are reluctant to take on large
positions ahead of Tuesday's release of merchandise trade figures
for April. The trade report is the first in a flurry of economic
indicators due to be released this week that should shed a strong
light on the state of the economy.
   ``There is a feeling of optimism ... that the numbers will paint
a picture that the economy is slowing from the breakneck
inflationary pace of the first three months, and that's what the
market needs,'' noted Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First
Albany Corp.
   That optimism was reflected in the ability of the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials to hover around the 2,100 level.
   ``The most revealing thing about this market is that ... we
can't drive it down,'' noted Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and
director of technical research at Gruntal Financial Inc.
   ``The ability of the Dow to hug the 2,100 level is a signal that
this market has started some kind of a summer rally,'' he said.
   The Dow started the week about eight points shy of its
post-crash high, and traders began the session by cashing in on the
previous weeks' gains. The Dow had been off about 10 points before
turning upward and then seesawing throughout the rest of the
session.
   Institutional investors, mutual funds and foreign buyers are
sitting on the sidelines with plenty of cash, and their decisions
about whether to re-enter the market could hinge on the upcoming
economic data.
   Among the reports to be issued this week are retail sales,
industrial production, business inventories, factory capacity and
housing starts.

<HEAD>Drug Industry Reacts to Supreme Courts' Vaccine Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling Monday on
vaccine liability likely affects only a small group of
pharmaceutical manufacturers, but may substantially change how the
government approves future inoculations, industry analysts said.
   The nation's high court said those harmed by a vaccine can sue
the government agencies that approved its use.
   ``This is very good for the vaccine companies, but there are not
that many of them,'' said Richard Vieter, a drug industry analyst
with Merrill Lynch Co. ``One might look ahead to vaccines such as
AIDS vaccines and other bio-tech applications, though.
   ``It seems the government will have to exert quite a bit more
care in the approval process to prevent placing the government in a
liability situation,'' Vieter said.
   The court, in a 9-0 vote, reinstated a suit by the parents of a
Pennsylvania boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of a
federally approved vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories of
Wayne, N.J., a subsidiary of American Cyanimid.
   Richard Stover, an analyst with Smith Barney in New York, said
the question of whether the government can be held liable for
approving drugs and vaccines that eventually harm someone has been
hotly debated for years.
   ``It should be very significant for that part of the industry
and Lederle in particular,'' he said.
   Martha Homma, a spokesman for Lederle, said the company's top
executives and legal department want to study the decision before
issuing a comment.
   Lederle shares the majority of the vaccine production business
in the United States with Merck Co. of Rahway, N.J., American Home
Products' Wyeth Division of New York and CDC Life Sciences Inc., a
Canadian company.
   Officials from American Home Products and Merck Co. also
declined to comment, though one Merck executive said ``it's about
time'' the government is held accountable for the approval process.
   Mark Grayson, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers'
Association, said the group's legal department also wants to study
the decision before any statement is made.
   Justice Department lawyers argued before the court that if such
damage suits are allowed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
which currently tests and licenses vaccines, may be forced into the
business of insuring them, jeopardizing the entire drug-approval
process.
   The polio vaccine Orimun, a form of Sabin oral vaccine, was
administered to 3-month-old Kevan Berkovitz in 1979. Three months
later, the child contracted polio and is now paralyzed, partially
deformed and can breathe only with the help of a machine.
   The vaccine was approved by the federal government in 1963. The
Berkovitz's suit was rejected by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia in 1987.

   The stock market seesawed in a tight range
Monday but still managed to hold its ground ahead of a key report
on the nation's trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chips fell 2.31 points to close
at 2,099.40.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 10-to-9 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
769 issues up, 696 down and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 125.31 million shares,
down from 155.71 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
151.717 million shares.
   The Dow started off the week about eight points shy of its
post-crash high, and traders began the session by cashing in on the
previous weeks' gains. The Dow fell about 10 points before turning
upward and continuing its flirtation with the 2,100 mark.
   But ``this general level has presented some pretty stiff
resistance for the market,'' noted Hugh Johnson, a senior vice
president at First Albany Corp.
   ``It's pretty clear we will need a catalyst ... (such as) some
news that gets us over the hump,'' he added.
   Tuesday's report on merchandise trade figures for April is
probably not enough to singlehandedly boost the Dow beyond the
2,100-point ceiling, analysts said. But the trade report is only
the first in a flurry of economic indicators due to be released
this week.
   ``There is a feeling of optimism ... that the numbers will paint

   Despite the dullness of the day's trading ``the most revealing

   Other reports to be issued this week include retail sales,
industrial production, business inventories, factory capacity and
housing starts.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco fell 1] to 50{. The oil
giant's largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, revealed he has put $310
million in escrow to back his bid for Texaco and that he has held
talks with Gulf Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Ltd. about the
possibility of forming a joint venture to acquire Texaco.
   Prices were mostly lower elsewhere in the oil patch, with
Atlantic Richfield off 2 at 84{, Amoco Corp. off 1{ at 78\, Chevron

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Sag As Rain Prospects Improve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices sagged and trading activity lagged Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for rain in the
Midwest later this week.
   Grain futures finished mixed, however, reflecting uncertainty
about the amount of moisture that drought-ridden croplands are
likely to receive, analysts said.
   On other markets, coffee futures slumped; livestock and meat
were mostly lower; energy futures declined; precious metals were
slightly higher; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 agricultural and
industrial commodities retreated 1.26 points to 256.35.
   Soybean futures, which hit 4{-year highs above $9 a bushel last
week, turned lower on reports that showers were moving eastward
from the western edge of the Corn Belt.
   ``There is some rain coming in and the market, at least today,
felt it would be beneficial'' for the crops, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Activity was markedly lighter than in last week's sessions,
which saw grain and soybean futures prices rise dramatically as
traders bet on a lengthy dry spell.
   ``There were a lot of traders on the sidelines today, watching,
hoping and praying,'' Lespinasse said.
   Analyst David Bartholomew of Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in
Chicago noted a significant reduction in soybean contract purchases
by commercial firms and said commercial buying interest may have
peaked last week.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a 6- to
10-day outlook calling for above-normal temperatures and normal
precipitation in most major U.S. crop-growing areas during the
first five days of next week.
   Also after the close, the Agriculture Department reported U.S.
soybean planting was 90 percent complete as of Sunday with most of
the crop in fair to good condition.
   The USDA reported slight deterioration in the corn crop but said
most of the crop remained in fair to good shape, and said 9 percent
of the winter wheat crop had been harvested, with most of that crop
also in fair to good condition.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.69} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 cents
higher with July at $2.59{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents lower to 2
cents higher with July at $2.62 a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to
8{ cents lower with July at $8.77 a bushel.
   Coffee futures posted sharp losses on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange in New York in response to milder-than-expected weekend
weather in Brazil, which produces about one-third of the world's
coffee.
   Coffee traders had bid up prices last week on expectations of
freezing temperatures during the weekend in Brazil.
   A freeze would have threatened Brazil's 1989-90 coffee crop,
which is at the sensitive bud stage, but not the 1988-89 crop,
which is now being harvested, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in New
York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Coffee settled 1.75 cents to 2.23 cents lower with July at
$1.3630 a pound.
   Frozen pork-belly futures fell sharply for the fifth consecutive
session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as prices continued to
seek a level that will encourage sales of near-record supplies of
frozen bellies on the cash market, analysts said.
   Near-month hog futures were supported by stronger cash markets.
Cattle futures were pressured by weak technical and fundamental
factors and by jitters about this Friday's monthly cattle-on-feed
report from the Agriculture Department.
   Live cattle settled .37 cent to .78 cent lower with June at
71.95 cents a pound; feeder catle were .60 cent to 1.25 cents lower
with August at 74 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent lower to .40
cent higher with June at 51.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1 cent to 1.93 cents lower with July at 48.35 cents a pound.
   Energy futures fell in response to indications that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting this week in
Vienna, Austria, will take no action to reduce production of crude
oil, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 30 cents
lower with July at $16.43 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to .50
cent lower with July at 43.75 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.58 cent to .71 cent lower with July at 48.51 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures were nearly unchanged while silver advanced
slightly on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled 50 cents to 70 cents higher with August at $453.80
a troy ounce; silver was 2.9 cents to 4 cents higher with July at
$7.055 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .60 point higher at 271.70.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher; Gold Rises After Falling in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly Monday, but brokers
said trading was extremely quiet prior to the release of monthly
U.S. trade figures and the Toronto economic summit.
   Gold prices also advanced slightly in restrained U.S. trading
after falling more than $7 an ounce in Europe. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted gold at $449.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up from $449 late Friday.
   Foreign-exchange dealers attributed the sluggish trading partly
to their own reluctance to speculate about the dollar's movement
prior to the Commerce Department's report on the U.S. trade deficit
for April, due Tuesday morning.
   The trade numbers are a powerful influence on the dollar because
they have become the most visible symbol of the United States'
unrelenting appetite for imports, a sensitive political and
economic issue.
   The nation's deficit shrank to a three-year low of $9.7 billion
in March, surprising many traders and giving the dollar a
substantial boost. But some fear the March number was grossly low
and the April deficit could therefore be unexpectedly high, despite
a strengthening of U.S. exports in recent months.
   Estimates on the April deficit ranged from below $9 billion to
above $14.5 billion.
   ``Each number has exasperated traders because it is so
unpredictable,'' said Frank Watson, vice president and chief
corporate dealer in Swiss Bank Corp.'s New York office. ``But last
month's numbers were so good that the chances of a surprise seem
sort of big.''
   Varick Martin, vice president of foreign exchange at Union Bank
of Switzerland's office in New York, said another big restraint on
trading is the summit of leaders of seven industrialized
democracies, starting Sunday in Toronto.
   ``I can't expect anything to happen (to the dollar), even with
the trade numbers, until the Toronto summit is over,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.19 Japanese yen, up slightly
from 124.85 yen late Friday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted
at 125.10 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York, the
dollar was worth 125.12 yen, higher than its 124.88 yen on Friday.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.8165 from $1.8175 late
Friday. Later in New York the pound was quoted at $1.8165, cheaper
than $1.8178 late Friday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.7227 West German marks, up from 1.7211; 1.4407 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4391; 1.2207 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2199;
5.8195 French francs, up from 5.8135; and 1,280.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,278.88.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.7241 West German marks, up from 1.7180; 1.4424 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4355; 5.7265 French francs, down from 5.8040;
1.9345 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9280; 1,281.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,278.50; 1.2203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2191.
   Gold futures prices rose slightly in U.S. trading. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for immediate delivery
was quoted at $449.60 an ounce, up 50 cents from late Friday.
   Earlier in London gold fell to $449 from $456.20 late Friday. In
Zurich, Switzerland, gold closed at a bid price of $448.50, down
from $458 late Friday. The sharp drops were largely a response to a
plunge in U.S. gold prices late Friday because of falling oil

<TEXT>
   Johnson & Johnson said Monday it
would buy back up to $500 million worth of its stock and seek
permission to issue $500 million in debt, both for ``general
corporate purposes.''
   The stock buyback would account for about 6.4 million shares of
the drug and health care giant's 172.4 million common shares
outstanding.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Johnson & Johnson
jumped $1.62{ to close at $79.12{ a share.
   Spokesman Robert Kniffen said the company must file its plans
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $500
million of debt or debt warrants.
   Analysts took the announcement in stride.
   ``They, like a lot of drug companies, have plenty of money and
not much to do with it,'' said Michael A. Martorelli, an analyst
with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   He said the amount of the stock buy-back was not large in light
of Johnson & Johnson's financial base of about $900 million in cash
and securities.

<HEAD>Prospective Owner Says It Plans to Expand Airline, No Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group planning to acquire Braniff
Inc. for about $100 million said Monday that it intends to expand
the airline and will guarantee job security to Braniff employees
for at least three years.
   The announcement came three days after Braniff's majority owner,
the Pritzker family of Chicago, said it would sell its 64 percent
stake to an investor group formed by Paine Webber Group Inc.
   Braniff has struggled financially for years and lost an
estimated $100 million in the Prizkers' first year of ownership in
1983. It lost $9.02 million in 1987.
   Paine Webber said in a statement Monday that the investor group
it leads ``plans to expand Braniff and has no plans to reduce the
size of Braniff's aircraft fleet or to withdraw from any cities
presently served by the airline.''
   In addition, Paine Webber said the prospective new owners intend
to enter into agreements with Braniff's labor unions to protect
employee job security for at least three years.
   The statement also said the new owners intend to sell
unidentified airport leasing interests and rights to American
Airlines. A price wasn't disclosed.
   Braniff has a 35-aircraft fleet and operates mainly out of hubs
at Dallas and Kansas City.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices edged higher Monday as oil prices
slipped and traders looked ahead to the release of U.S. trade
deficit figures for April.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond rose \ point, or $2.50 per $1,000 in
face value, as its yield fell to 9.01 percent from 9.04 percent
late Friday.
   Market watchers said a fresh decline in oil prices helped
alleviate some of the recent worries about inflation, which erodes
bond values.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for the
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 30 cents to close
at $16.43 per 42-gallon barrel. The 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to come up with a new pricing
and production agreement over the weekend at its ministerial
meeting in Vienna, Austria.
   Analysts said bond trading was relatively quiet in advance of
the trade figures due to be released Tuesday morning.
   ``Everyone is waiting for the trade number,'' said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   He said the consensus among economists is that the trade deficit
widened in April slightly from a seasonally adjusted $11.95 billion
in March. He expects a deficit of $12.5 billion.
   The release of the trade figures has often caused a sharp
reaction in the currency markets, and that has often had an impact
on bond prices.
   Meanwhile, interest rates at the Treasury Department's latest
auction of three-month securities were unchanged from a week ago
while rates on new six-month bills fell slightly.
   The Treasury sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.44 percent, identical to last week's
rate. It sold $6.4 billion in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 6.67 percent, down from 6.72 percent last week.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, dropped to 7.46 percent last
week from 7.59 percent the previous week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose about [ point, intermediate maturities rose
about \ point and long-term issues were up nearly { point, the
financial information service Telerate Inc. said.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.11 to 109.88. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.51
to 1,150.21.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.35 to 281.90.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices of municipal bonds rose 3-16
point, according to the Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 1 basis point to 6.44
percent, six-month bills rose a basis point to 6.66 percent and
one-year bills were unchanged at 6.94 percent. A basis point is
one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7{ percent, up from 75-16
percent late Friday.

<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc. announced Monday it
is selling its subsidiary E-II Holdings, acquired recently in a
takeover duel, to an affiliate of the privately held Riklis Family
Corp. for $950 million in cash and $250 million in securities.
   American Brands, based in Greenwich, said it will buy back seven
companies including five that it expects will accelerate
development of its emerging core businesses in hardware and home
products and office products.
   The company also said it planned to continue an ongoing program
to buy back its own stock.
   The E-II companies being retained by American Brands include
Aristokraft Inc., Waterloo Industries Inc., and Twentieth Century
Companies Inc. as well as Day-Timers Inc. and the Vogel Peterson
Co., previously acquired from E-II by American Brands' ACCO World
subsidiary.
   American Brands will also buy back from E-II two other
operations _ the Stiffel Co. and Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchens Inc.
   American Brands said Riklis will pay about $950 million in cash
and $250 million in preferred stock for the remaining operations of
E-II Holdings. E-II also has $1.5 billion in subordinated debt.
   The purchase price for all the companies being retained by
American Brands _not including Stiffel and Aunt Nellie's, still in
negotiation _ is $645 million.
   American Brands acquired the outstanding common stock of
Chicago-based E-II in February for $17.05 per share in a deal worth
about $1.1 billion.
   The acquisition followed a brief but fierce battle in which
American Brands launched a bid to take over E-II after the
Chicago-based company said it might try to acquire American Brands
by gaining control of the company's board of directors through a
shareholder vote.
   The move employed successfully by American Brands is nicknamed
the ``Pac Man'' defense after a popular video game in which a
player tries to swallow his enemy before being eaten himself.
   Analysts were not surprised at Monday's announcement of American
Brands' intent to sell some E-II companies.
   ``They have said all along they wil sell portions of E-II,'' Roy
Burry, senior vice president of research at Kidder Peabody Co. said.
   Burry said the deal ``turned out well'' for American Brands and
the ``shareholders of E-II got rich because of the price they got
for their stock.''
   American Brands Chairman and Chief Executive officer William J.
Alley said the company expects the transactions ``to produce a
positive impact on earnings per share in 1988 and even better
returns next year.''
   The companies being sold with E-II include Culligan
International Co., Samsonite Corp., Samsonite Furniture Co., Home
Fashions Inc., Lowrey's Meat Specialities Inc., Beatreme Food
Ingredients Inc., Frozen Specialities Inc., Pet Specialities Inc.
and Martha White Foods Inc.
   Riklis also owns Rapid American Corp., McCrory Stores and
Faberge-Elizabeth Arden.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. has received a
$1.5 billion order for 61 of its MD-80 series airplanes from
Scandinavian Airlines System, the aircraft maker announced Monday.
   The order includes firm commitments to buy 24 planes and an
option to buy 37 more. The $1.5 billion figure is for all 61
planes. McDonnell Douglas declined to put a value on firm orders
alone, spokesman Don Hansen said.
   Based on the estimated price of $22 million to $25 million which
industry sources put on the MD-80, the firm orders would be worth
around $900 million.
   SAS ordered four models of the MD-80, a twin-engine,
medium-range jetliner that seats up to 150 passengers. The order is
divided among MD-81, 82, 83 and 87 models. The planes are scheduled
for delivery in 1991 and 1992.

<TEXT>
   Finance ministers of the European Economic
Community Monday agreed to liberalize the movement of capital
throughout the 12-nation trading bloc.
   The new legislation will have to be put into force by eight of
the 12 member countries by July 1, 1990.
   Spain and Ireland have been given until 1992 to implement the
law. Greece and Portugal have not been assigned a specific
timetable.
   The agreement is a crucial step towards achieving a borderless
internal market within the EEC by the end of 1992.
   The legislation will, for example, allow citizens of one EEC
nation to open a bank account in another EEC country. It will also
increase competition among European banks by allowing them to offer
services throughout the trading bloc.
   ``It should make it possible for (European financial
institutions) to catch up with Tokyo and New York,'' said Jacques
Delors, president of the EEC's executive Commission.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of migrant workers are picking
strawberries after waiting weeks for crops to ripen and straining
the resources of social service agencies who provided them food and
shelter.
   Cool weather slowed the ripening of the strawberry crop, which
traditionally is ready for harvest by June 1. Officials said an
unusually heavy influx of 20,000 migrant workers, many from Mexico
and Central America, have been waiting for the work to begin.
   Warm weather over the weekend ripened many fields in the
northwestern portion of the state, and others are expected to be
ready for picking soon. Oregon is the nation's second-largest
strawberry producer after California.
   ``A lot of fields just turned red over the weekend because of
the good weather,'' Tom Graven, a division field supervisor for the
state Employment Division, said Monday.
   Roy Malensky, owner of Oregon Berry Processing Co. in Hillsboro,
west of Portland, said it was too early to say how many of the
migrants would be put to work because picking hasn't begun yet in
many fields.
   ``Last year it started with a bang and kept on going. This year
it's starting slowly and won't get into full flow till this
weekend,'' he said.
   Social service agencies have made repeated appeals for food and
blankets for the migrants, who hav been living with as many as 50
others in one room.
   The Salvation Army, one of several charitable organizations
helping feed and clothe the migrants, has distributed more than 277
tons of food and more than $100,000 worth of clothing, blankets and
items such as soap, detergent and cooking utensils.
   Once the harvest is in full swing, ``it will considerably
decrease the demands upon us,'' said Titus Herman, spokesman for
the Salvation Army in Portland.
   ``I know that many of them still have obligations to contractors
and in some cases to farmers for food,'' Titus said of the pickers.
``...Maybe for the next couple of weeks they still will be
technically without any money, but beyond that they will have money
and chances are the social services will be able to step out of the
situation, maybe not completely but considerably. We're already
seeing a decrease in demand.''
   The 1987 strawberry crop ripened early, and 20 percent of it was
left in the fields because of a picker shortage. Growers complained
that pickers were confused over the new immigration law and refused
to cross the border.
   The state still produced a bumper crop of 94 million pounds that
sold for a record $31.5 million.
   This year, migrants began arriving as early as April. Some say
they mistakenly were told they had to file immigration legalization
documents by May 4, the deadline for aliens not involved in
agricultural work.
   The agricultural workers have until Nov. 30 to file the papers.
After that, employers who hire illegal migrant workers will face
stiff penalties.

   Dart Group Corp. announced Monday that its
earnings dropped by more than 50 percent in the first quarter from
a year earlier, largely because of two unsuccessful attempts to
take over other companies.
   For the first quarter ended April 30, the retailer's net income
was $10.7 million, or $5.89 a share, down from $28.5 million, or
$15.24 per share, in the same period in 1987.
   First-quarter revenue increased, on the other hand, to $96.6
million from $85.8 million a year earlier.
   During the first quarter of 1987, Dart made a greater profit on
the sale of stocks acquired in an unsuccessful attempt to take over
Supermarkets General Corp. than it did earlier this year, when it
sold stock purchased in a hostile takeover attempt of Stop & Shop
Cos., said Dart spokesman Stanley Rubinstein.
   Among its holdings, Dart Group owns Crown Books Corp. and Trak
Auto Corp.

<HEAD>Company Says It Offered to Top Bid for Dome</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cantario Petroleum Ltd. said Monday it
had proposed to top Amoco Canada's $4.18 billion bid for Dome
Petroleum Ltd., but a Dome executive said his company declined to
consider the proposal because it was conditional and Dome had
questions about the financing.
   Brian Little, a Dome executive, told reporters that Cantario's
proposal included a condition that Dome cancel its agreement to be
acquired by Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. before Cantario made its
formal offer.
   The previously-undisclosed proposal was revealed on the first
day of a fairness hearing before Justice Gregory Forsyth of the
Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. Forsyth is to decide whether to
allow Amoco to close the acquisition deal that Dome shareholders
approved last week.
   When Forsyth asked which parties objected to the deal, a lawyer
representing Toronto businessman Abdul Rehman told the judge that
his client, acting as an agent for Cantario, had proposed to pay
about $4.9 billion for Dome last June.
   Rehman was in the courtroom, but refused to answer reporters'
questions about Cantario or its bid.
   The lawyer, Garold Switzer, told Forsyth he would argue that the
Cantario bid should have been disclosed to shareholders before they
voted on Amoco's offer last week. Shareholders, who voted 88
percent in favor of accepting Amoco's offer, were not informed of
the offer.
   Little said the Cantario offer wasn't disclosed because ``we
didn't think there was anything to disclose.''
   Dome asked Cantario to remove the condition on its offer and was
ready to review it, Little said, but Cantario said its bid was
valid only if the Amoco deal ended.
   Little said Cantario told Dome it had a line of credit with a
major Canadian bank, but that the chairman of the bank denied the
line of credit existed. He said Dome went back to Cantario and was
told Cantario was trying to arrange credit with another bank but
never got back to Dome.
   When asked by reporters why Cantario hadn't gone public with its
bid before now, Switzer said his client had hoped one of the other
parties to the Amoco deal would succeed in blocking it.

<HEAD>Bank Of New York, Irving to Meet in Takeover Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of Irving Bank Corp. and Bank of
New York Co. Inc. plan to meet Wednesday to see if they can resolve
their bitter takeover dispute, the companies disclosed Monday.
   Irving Bank, the target of a hostile $1.1 billion takeover bid
by Bank of New York, proposed the meeting after a state Supreme
Court justice, Herman Cahn, informally suggested the two sides
explore whether there was any way to conclude the dispute on a
friendly basis, Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said.
   Cahn is hearing one of several suits that have been filed in the
case.
   The meeting is to include the chairman of each company as well
as two board members from each concern who are not employees of the
company.
   Brady cautioned that he did not expect Bank of New York to bring
any new proposals to the meeting, and indicated he did not believe
Irving's willingness to meet necessarily signaled the end of its
resistance to the hostile bid.
   Telephone calls to Irving after business hours on Monday were
not answered.
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving fell 25
cents a share to $64.75 while Bank of New York rose 12.5 cents a
share to $33.50.
   Irving Bank said in a letter to Bank of New York that it was
``ready to receive and consider any proposal Bank of New York
wishes to make.''
   It noted in the letter that ``if we were to merge, the senior
management of each would have to participate fully in structuring a
transaction.''
   Irving said it planned to be represented at the meeting by its
chairman, Joseph A. Rice; its president, Samuel F. Chevalier, and
two or more of its outside directors, among others.
   Bank of New York representatives will include Bank of New York's
chairman and chief executive, Carter Bacot, and two of its outside
directors, among others, said Brady.
   Bank of New York is making a tender offer of $15 in cash and
1.575 of its shares for each of Irving's 18.5 million shares
outstanding.
   Irving has rejected the offer, and opted for a friendly merger
with the state-run Banca Comerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second
largest bank.
   The Banca Commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that includes sale of Irving assets, several cost-cutting
measures and a special dividend. The proposal still requires
regulatory approval.

<TEXT>
   Kaiser Steel Corp., which is
reorganizing under protection of a federal bankruptcy court, said
Monday that Richard E. Stoddard, a Denver accountant and attorney,
has been named to the new position of chief executive.
   The appointment has been approved by the unsecured creditors of
the one-time industrial giant, and has been submitted for approval
to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Denver, which is handling Kaiser's
Chapter 11 case.
   Stoddard, 37, managing director of the Denver law firm of Roath
& Brega, has worked in the past with employee- and retiree-owned
companies. Under Kaiser's reorganization plan, retirees would be
the biggest stockholder group through two trusts that deal with
retirement and medical benefits.
   Kaiser, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors
in February 1987, moved its headquarters from Fontana, site of its
closed plant, to nearby Rancho Cucamonga this month.
   The reorganization plan before the court calls for Kaiser to
develop a 900-acre industrial park on the site of the Fontana
plant, and to open a dump for municipal waste at its shuttered
Eagle Mountain iron ore mine in Riverside County.
   Kaiser Coal Co., a subsidiary with idled mines in Sunnyside,
Utah, and Raton, N.M., will file a separate reorganization plan.

<HEAD>Report: Industrial Output to Grow 16 Percent in First Three
Quarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's industrial output should grow by 16.3
percent during the first three quarters of this year, while the
inflation rate could reach 13 percent during that time, according
to an official report.
   The China Daily quoted Wu Minglu, economist for the National
Research Center for the Development of Science and Technology, as
saying industrial output will total $236 billion in the first nine
months of the year.
   At the end of April, China's industrial output value was 17.9
percent higher than at the same time last year, the fastest growth
in two years.
   The Chinese government has expressed concern about the rapid
growth rate and tried to clamp down on credit and the beginning of
new construction projects.
   The high growth rate, led by expansion of light industry, has
strained government finances and depleted scarce raw materials
needed for key heavy industry projects.
   In 1987, industrial output rose by 16.5 percent while the gross
national product grew by 9.4 percent.
   China's commodity retail volume was up by 23.1 percent and
retail prices rose 10.7 percent in the first quarter of this year,
both highs for the past several years.
   Wu said that as the state moves to end price controls over more
commodities, inflation will continue to rise, hitting 12 percent in
the second quarter and 13 percent in the third.
   Chinese economists regard inflation, spurred by rising consumer
demand and the removal of price controls on some food products, as
the most serious issue confronting the nation's economic reforms.

   A federal court jury for the first time held
a cigarette company partly responsible for the death of a smoker,
finding Monday that Liggett Group Inc. failed to warn the public
about the dangers of cigarettes and violated its promise to produce
a safe product.
   The jury awarded $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone, whose wife Rose
died of lung cancer in 1984, but rejected his claim of a conspiracy
among the three tobacco companies that produced the products his
wife used.
   The damage award was based on the jury's finding that Liggett
violated its expressed promise to consumers to make a safe product,
thus contributing to Mrs. Cippollone's death.
   It also found that Liggett failed to warn the public about the
dangers of cigarettes, but awarded no damages because it found Mrs.
Cipollone 80 percent responsible for her death.
   Liggett, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. were exonerated
of conspiring to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.
The jury awarded no punitive damages.
   Mrs. Cipollone, who was 58 when she died, smoked Chesterfield
and L&M cigarettes, both made by Liggett, before Congress required
the U.S. surgeon general's health warnings on cigarette packs in
1966. She smoked for 40 years, later using brands made by Lorillard
and Philip Morris.
   ``The tobacco companies have claimed for the last 20 years that
they are invincible,'' said Alan Darnell, an attorney for
Cipollone. ``This shows they are not ... they are just like any
other company.''
   Liggett Attorney James Kearney said he was pleased by the
verdict. ``The jury specifically rejected any claims of (punitive)
damages,'' he said. ``The floodgates have been closed even firmer
than they were before.''
   Cipollone's main attorney, Marc Z. Edell, said he was unsure
whether the verdict would lead to more tobacco liability suits.
   ``I think the jury, for whatever reason, didn't like Rose
Cipollone. That's the problem. They never met Rose Cipollone,'' he
said.
   However, Liggett attorney Donald Cohn said he regarded the
jury's award of $400,000 as ``sympathy,'' and said he would appeal.
   Edell, Cipollone's attorney, said he would ask the judge to
overturn the jury's decision that Liggett pay no damages for the
suffering of Mrs. Cipollone. That money would have gone to her
estate, unlike the $400,000 that goes to Cipollone.
   Cipollone, 64, of Lakehurst, said he was glad the trial was
over, ``and I'm glad the verdict came out halfway a win.''
   ``It wasn't 100 percent. I'm glad that we won partial, but it's
a start,'' he said.
   Asked if his wife would be happy about the jury's findings, he
said: ``I don't really know. She started the suit, and I told her
I'd continue 'til the end.''
   The jury began deliberations last Tuesday. As the forewoman
answered each question from the court clerk, a gasp rose from the
courtroom packed with industry lawyers, analysts and reporters.
   ``This is basically a victory for the defense,'' Cohn said.
   The tobacco industry, with $35 billion in revenue, waged an
extensive and expensive defense against the suit, fearing that a
loss could unleash a flood of multimillion dollar liability
lawsuits.
   Cipollone's attorneys had said the case was especially
significant because they got permission to introduce numerous
secret corporate documents that spoke of a ``gentleman's
agreement'' not to do cancer research, of an industry strategy to
create ``doubt about the health charge without actually denying
it,'' and of a research program designed ``so that results cannot
harm'' the industry.
   The companies said statements in the documents represented the
views of individuals and were taken out of context.
   U.S. financial markets were closed when the verdict was
returned. One analyst suggested tobacco stocks might suffer early
in Tuesday trading but the decision would be considered an industry
victory in the long term.
   ``I consider this a major plus for the cigarette companies. It
is a loss but not a major loss,'' said Allan Kaplan, a tobacco
industry analyst with Merrill Lynch.
   During the four-month trial, Cipollone charged that Lorillard,
Liggett and Philip Morris misled the public about the dangers of
cigarette smoking and contributed to Mrs. Cipollone's death.
   The companies contended that she knew the risks but chose to
smoke anyway. They also argued that smoking is not a proven cause
if cancer, and that her type of cancer hasn't been linked to
cigarettes anyway.
   To support the suit's contention that Liggett violated its
promise to consumers, Edell introduced examples of Liggett's
advertising from the 1950s. One said, ``Rosalind Russell says L&M
Filters are Just What the Doctor Ordered!'' Another ad said:
``Nose, Throat and Accessory Organs Not Adversely Affected By
Smoking Chesterfields.'' Another said: ``Play Safe, Smoke
Chesterfields.''
   On Wednesday, the jury asked to see a copy of testimony she gave
to lawyers the year of her death and trial testimony by an
addiction expert who certified Mrs. Cipollone was dependent on
cigarettes.
   On Friday, they asked if the 1984 surgeon general's report on
smoking and health was in evidence and whether they could see it.
It was not, and the judge said they could not.
   The suit, filed in federal court Aug. 1, 1983, is one of only a
dozen or so to go to a jury. Hundreds of others were dismissed or
faded away in the face of the overwhelming legal strength of a
well-heeled industry. Another hundred are pending, with lawyers in
those cases closely watching the Cipollone trial.
   Liggett Group Inc. of Durham, N.C., has 3.6 percent of the
$22-billion-a-year cigarette market. It has a net income of $30.7
million on sales of $531.9 million and is the nation's sixth
