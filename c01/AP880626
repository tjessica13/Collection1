   The Marine Corps on Sunday released the names
of the seven Marines killed Saturday in a helicopter crash in Japan.
   The CH-53D chopper crashed on Shikoku Island during a routine
flight from the Marines' air station at Iwikuni to another corps
air station at Futenma, where the craft was based.
   A Marine Corps spokeswoman, Lt. Elizabeth Kerstens, said the
cause of the accident was under investigation.
   The victims, who were members of Heavy Helicopter Squadron 462,
were based at the Marine Corps air station at Tustin, Calif., and
on a six-month assignment in Japan, Kerstens said.
   The seven were identified as Capt. Michael E. Bermel, Cataldo,
Idaho; 1st Lt. Patrick C. Fleming, Bay City, Mich.; Staff Sgt.
Stephen R. Yoder, San Bernardino, Calif.; Sgt. Eric C. Mau,
Bakersfield, Calif.; Sgt. Donald R. McKay, Westlake, Ohio; Sgt. Jay
A. Watkins, Spirit Lake, Iowa; and Cpl. Jason W. Chase, Bayside,
Calif.

<HEAD>Two Sides Reach Agreement on Territory's Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of New Caledonia's separatist movement and
the islands' conservative pro-French deputy reached agreement early
Sunday on the future of the troubled territory, Prime Minister
Michel Rocard announced.
   He said that under the accord, Paris will assume direct control
of the South Pacific territory for the next 12 months, with New
Caledonians voting in referendum in 10 years on the issue of
self-determination.
   Rocard also said he would propose to President Francois
Mitterrand that the French people be consulted in a referendum on
new institutions to be set up to develop the territory.
   Tensions in New Caledonia, an island group 1,000 miles east of
Australia, have remained high 21 people were killed in May when a
French army assault team stormed a cave to free 23 hostages held by
native Melanesian separatists.
   Thirty people have died in violence in New Caledonia since April
22.
   The accord reached Sunday came after negotations in Paris
involving Rocard, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, head of the Kanak Socialist
National Liberation Front, and deputy Jacques LaFleur.
   The Kanaks, or Melanesians, represent about 43 percent of the
New Caledonia's 145,000 residents, and most favor independence. The
rest of the population comprises descendents of European settlers,
Asians and Polynesians, most of whom prefer to remain French.
   France colonized the islands in 1853.
   Rocard brought Tjibaou and LaFleur together last week for their
first meeting since 1982. He said they both would take the
agreement to their respective constituencies and call for approval.
   Tjibaou called the agreement reached Sunday ``an important
step'' but said the New Caledonia problem has not been solved and
native Melanesians will continue to demand independence.
   He said the talks were difficult because the demands of the two
sides were contradictory and because of the tense atmosphere in the
territory.
   ``Each side now is committed to halt bloodshed and end mourning
for many families, '' Tjibaou said.
   A statement issued by Rocard called on the territory's
inhabitants to ``be hopeful for a new page has been turned, not by
arms but by dialogue and tolerance, by hard work and good will.''
   Rocard made a solution to the New Caledonia problem a priority
after Mitterrand named him prime minister 45 days ago. The
agreement seems likely to restore some of Rocard's prestige, which
was tarnished after the Socialists failed to win a majority in
legislative elections that followed the May 8 presidential vote.

   A new Airbus jetliner carrying more than
130 people crashed into a forest Sunday during an air show
demonstration flight, killing at least three people and injuring
98, officials said.
   Many victims were believed to be first-time fliers who paid for
a ride on the twin-engine Airbus A320, which was delivered to Air
France only Thursday.
   Witnesses said the plane, which touts a state-of-the-art
electronic flight system, had just passed over the airfield hosting
the show when it crashed, tearing a nearly 500-foot path through
the woods.
   Part of the plane caught fire.
   A control tower official said the jet appeared to lose power as
it passed over the field in Habsheim, a village about 15 miles from
the Swiss border.
   Monday's editions of the Paris daily newspaper L'Humanite quoted
the jet's pilot as telling a rescue worker: ``I wanted to to
increase the power but the aircraft did not respond.''
   ``It was about 20 meters (65 feet) above the ground with its
flaps and landing gear down when it clipped some trees at the end
of the runway and crashed in the forest,'' Bernard Labalette, an
amateur pilot, was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying.
   Visibility was perfect.
   A 25-year-old woman passenger who did not give her name was
quoted by AFP as saying she heard trees brush against the fuselage.
   ``From then on things went fast,'' she said. ``The plane hit the
ground hard and we had the feeling of an abrupt jolt. Then there
was a fire in the front of the aircraft.''
   Flight attendants deployed evacuation chutes and the woman said
she and other passengers slid down and ran away, fearing an
explosion.
   Rescuers worked throughout the afternoon to evacuate dozens of
people trapped in the battered plane. The impact broke the plane's
wings and smashed the cockpit windows. The fuselage was blackened
from smoke, AFP said.
   Local officials said 50 people were hospitalized. It was not
clear how many were on the jet as there was no official passenger
list. Authorities said at least 136 were aboard.
   Officials said the pilot, Michel Asseline, and the co-pilot,
Pierre Mazieres, were not injured.
   Initial reports said four people were killed. The local
officials, not named in accordance with French practice, later said
they were able to confirm three deaths. They said some victims were
badly burned.
   ``There was an explosion and a cloud of smoke. But from the
control tower we couldn't see,'' said the tower official, who did
not give his name.
   He said about 1,000 people were at the show and that many on the
plane were making their first flight. At such air shows, spectators
are invited to participate in an ``air baptism,'' or take their
first flight for a small fee.
   The plane made six flights on Saturday.
   The A320, built in Toulouse, France by a European consortium,
went into service in April for Air France and British Airways. It
was conceived and certified for flight by a two-member crew,
eliminating the navigator.
   Early this year, pilots and flight engineers of Air Inter, the
largest French airline, called a series of strikes to protest the
use of only two cockpit members in A320s, saying it was unsafe.
   In London, British Airways suspended service on its two A320
aircraft as a precautionary measure pending information on the
cause of the accident in Habsheim, which is just outside Mulhouse
and 250 miles east of Paris.
   Air France President Jacques Friedman said that as a precaution,
the airline was replacing an A320 due to fly to Dusseldorf and
Berlin on Sunday night with a Boeing 737 and cancelling a
Paris-Zurich flight.
   French Transport Minister Louis Mermez said a commission of
inquiry would begin work Monday.
   The Airbus A320 can carry 168 passengers. Airbus Indusrie, its
manufacturer, has orders to purchase 500 of the craft.
Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines agreed to buy some of the
A320s for delivery in 1990 and 1991.
   ``I doubt (the crash) would have an impact on our decision to
purchase from Airbus,'' Alan Muncaster, staff vice president of
corporate communications for Northwest, said Sunday. ``But
obviously we would want to check into the cause of the crash.''
   Air France has three of the aircraft, British Airways has two
and Air Inter, the French domestic airline, has one, Airbus said.
   ``We are disturbed, shocked and saddened,'' said Airbus press
spokesman Robert Alizart in Toulouse. He said it was the first
crash of an A320.
   Alizart said it was too early to say whether the future of the
aircraft, which received its certification Feb. 26, could be in
doubt.
   The plane has a range of about 3,700 miles and consumes 40
percent less fuel than similar two or three engine jets.
   It is the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully
computerized flight-control system the manufacturer says permits
safer, electronically controlled flight. Instead of the old control
column in front of the pilot, there is a ``pistol-grip'' side stick
linked to five computers that modify and relay the pilot's
directions to wing and tail flaps.

<HEAD>U.S. Drought Could Cause Severe Drop In World Grain Stocks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worldwide grain stocks could sink to their lowest
levels of the decade and lead to possible food shortages if the
crippling U.S. drought continues for another two weeks, according
to a U.N. organization.
   But officials at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization say
favorable weather and crop prospects have created a brighter farm
picture in most of the rest of the world.
   Before the U.S. drought took hold, the Rome-based U.N.
organization already was projecting that world grain production in
1988-89 would not match consumption and that stocks would drop
close to the level the agency considers the minimum necessary to
safeguard world food security.
   ``Now with the U.S. drought, the question is how much is U.S.
production going to be drawn down,'' Peter Newhouse, chief of the
agency's global information and early warning service, said in an
interview Friday.
   ``It's still too early for firm projections. It all depends on
the rain in the next two weeks,'' he said.
   The organization had projected June that the United States would
produce 279 million tons of this year's targeted 1.67 billion tons
of grain worldwide. But that was before the worst drought since the
Great Depression parched the Midwest.
   ``If the present dry weather were to continue over the next
couple of weeks, then there would be a severe shortfall in U.S.
crops, particularly maize (corn),'' Newhouse said. ``We had already
projected that with normal weather conditions, the stocks could
fall close to the minimum level. Now if the drought continues,
there's a distinct possibility it could fall below that.''
   The U.N. organization considers the minimum level to be 17
percent to 18 percent of the projected global consumption of wheat
for the following year. The last time the level fell to the minimum
level was in 1981.
   Stocks have not dropped below the minimum since the mid-1970s.
They hit a low of 14 percent during the global food crisis of
1972-73.
   ``If stocks go below the mininum level, it would mean the world
is more vulnerable than it should be and could face food supply
difficulties,'' Newhouse said.
   ``We've still got a cushion ... but if the cushion is going to
be used up, it looks like the food situation on a global level is
going to be a lot tighter.''
   Newhouse said the organization ``will have to be very vigilant''
in monitoring U.S. cereal crops and those in Asia, the Soviet Union
and Africa.
   ``Fortunately, harvest prospects outside the United States and
Canada are generally favorable,'' Newhouse said.
   ``At this moment, we don't see any widespread drought problems .
.. nothing dramatic,'' said Rene Gommes of the agency's
agro-meteorological department.
   The only country that produces more cereal crops than the United
States is China with about 350 million tons annually. Third is the
Soviet Union with 200 million tons.
   Newhouse said harvest prospects were good in the Soviet Union.
   In China, drought has hit some areas and floods have hit others.
``But at this point we're not worried about China,'' he said.
   An important factor for world crop production is the monsoon
season in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, which were hit by severe
drought last year.
   ``The monsoon started in May on time this year, but it's still
far too early to say what will happen,'' Newhouse said.
   One of the world's most serious food supply situations is
occurring partly as a result of heavy rainfall in areas often prone
to drought conditions. Swarms of migrating desert locusts, who
breed in rainy conditions, have invaded the Sahel region of
sub-Saharan Africa.
   The infestation ``is of unprecedented dimensions and will affect
the food security of 15 African countries, from the Atlantic Ocean
to the Red Sea,'' the U.N. group's director-general, Edouard
Saouma, said Friday.
   In African countries such as Angola, Mozambique, Sudan and
Ethiopia, civil war has aggravated crop failures. In Ethiopia,
where drought and famine killed up to 1 million people in 1984-85,
more than 7 million people are reported threatened by the drought
and last year's crop failures.
   The crop planting season is now under way in Ethiopia so it
won't be known until the end of the year whether the country can
recover, Newhouse said.
   In Latin America, northeast Brazil suffered severe drought last
year but the weather has improved and Newhouse believes the harvest
will recover. Mexico, however, is expecting a shortfall of more
than 1 million tons in its wheat harvest, he said.

   Thunderstorms battered scattered areas from Colorado to Alabama
Sunday night, causing tornadoes in at least three states and at
least two deaths in North Carolina, including a boy on a bicycle
hit by falling trees.
   The North Carolina storm produced lightning fires and toppled
power lines, leaving one-third of the city of Greensboro
temporarily in darkness, authorities said.
   Two falling trees fatally injured 8-year-old Tim Marshall while
he was riding his bicycle to his Greensboro home about 6:45 p.m.,
Police Sgt. Joe Deich said.
   ``It was just the worst possible timing,'' said John Langerman,
a witness. ``He was riding pretty fast, and if he had been two
seconds faster or two seconds slower, nothing would have happened.''
   Lightning struck and killed Terry Lynn Knox, 38, of Mooresville
about 6:30 p.m. as he was headed for shore in a pontoon boat on
Lake Norman, north of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County Police said.
   About 7:30 p.m., the National Weather Service reported a solid
line of thunderstorms that stretched across northern North Carolina
from Elizabeth City across the Virginia border north of Rocky
Mount, and southwest across the northeast Piedmont north of Raleigh
to the northwest Piedmont south of Greensboro. The storms were
moving at about 30 mph, but winds were reported as high as 55 mph.
   In southeast Alabama, two homes were destroyed by what witnesses
described as a tornado and dozens of vehicles were damaged when
winds ripped part of the roof off the Dothan airport.
   Thunderstorms across Colorado triggered heavy rains in some
areas, a tornado in open country in Adams County east of Denver,
and winds that blew windows out of a home near Franktown.
   One strong thunderstorm dropped 1.1 inches of rain and pea-sized
hail in 35 minutes south of Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County.
That cloudburst caused local street flooding.
   Severe thunderstorms in Kansas spawned at least one tornado in
the south-central part of the state, the National Weather Service
said.
   A tornado touched down about 8 p.m. in a rural area just north
of Partridge, said Joanne Angell, a supervisor with the Reno County
Sheriff's Department. No damage or injuries were reported.
   A cluster of heavy thunderstorms also rumbled northwestward
across the Red River from northern Texas into southwestern
Oklahoma, said Gary Szatkowski, a National Weather Service
forecaster.
   Szatkowski said the storms produced rainfall of up to an inch,
but not enough to ease drought conditions.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes In Front Of Singleton's Home, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small bomb was hurled at the home listed as
the address of rapist-mutilator Lawrence Singleton on Saturday
night, but the explosion caused no injuries or property damage,
authorities said.
   The homemade bomb detonated in the front yard of the one-story
home just before 9 p.m., said Hillsborough County Sheriff's Lt. Ken
Allen.
   ``Lawrence Singleton was not in the house, his whereabouts are
still unknown at this time,'' Allen said.
   Singleton's brother, Walter, and sister-in-law, Diane, were the
only people in the home when the device exploded, leaving a heavy
white cloud, the officer said.
   While many in the quiet Forest Hills neighborhood heard the
explosion, there were no witnesses to who threw the device, Allen
said. Experts were examining bomb shards to determine what type of
device it was.
   Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker,
chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead in a
ditch southeast of San Francisco in 1978.
   The gray-bearded 60-year-old former merchant seaman, who grew up
in Tampa, spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in a California
prison. He completed a year-long probation and is now a free man.
   During his probation, Singleton was forced to flee six
California towns after residents objected to his presence. He ended
up finishing his probation in a trailer on the grounds of San
Quentin prison.
   Two weeks ago, he listed the address with authorities as
required of convicted felons under state law, but he has never been
seen there. His brother has said Singleton lives ``about two hours
away,'' but refuses to say exactly where.
   Angry area residents have held two meetings in the past month
asking deputies to locate Singleton so they can stop living in
fear. A local businessman and a radio station have each offered
Singleton $5,000 if he will pack up and go anywhere else.

<HEAD>Baja Governor's Brothers Accused in Major Cocaine Smuggling Ring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two brothers of the state governor of Baja
California Sur are under arrest on charges they took part in a
sophisticated drug ring that smuggled cocaine from Colombia to the
United States, authorities said.
   Authorities also said they arrested four others who participated
in the operation.
   The arrests were announced late Friday by the federal attorney
general's office.
   Authorities said rancher Agustin Liceaga Ruibal, 48, and
businessman Rene Liceaga Ruibal, 46, were part of a smuggling ring
that operated clandestine air strips, safe houses and
money-laundering businesses in several Mexican states.
   An emotional Gov. Victor Manuel Liceaga Ruibal called the case a
``family tragedy'' during a hastily called news conference in La
Paz, the state capital, late Friday. He said he knew nothing of his
brother's activities.
   ``I am completely clean,'' he declared.
   The governor said state authorities cooperated fully with the
federal investigation and would continue to do so.
   Authorities said his brothers allowed at least one of their
ranches to be used for clandestine air strips where drug-laden
planes en route from Colombia to the United States refueled.
Investigators said they have tracked at least 10 flights.
   In addition to the governor's brothers, four other people were
arrested: Jose Pineda Trinidad, Antonio Alcantara Varela, Ramon
Escamilla Vazquez and Maria Alicia Marquez Solis.
   Pineda Trinidad, who also used the name Jose Ponce de Leon, was
identified as head of the ring.
   Authorities said he laundered drug profits through his money
exchange house in Guadalajara and a real estate company. The
profits were allegedly stashed in U.S. and Mexican banks and in
Panama, where authorities said they found $10 million in a single
account.
   Panama has been recently reported to be a regional banking
center for drug smugglers. In February, a U.S. grand jury in
Florida indicted its military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
on drug-trafficking charges.
   The attorney general's office said it has seized Pineada
Trinidad's property, which also included three homes and four
ranches in the central state of Jalisco.
   Authorities did not say when or where the arrests were made, but
said all six suspects were transferred to Mexico City to face a
variety of drug charges.

<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge awarded $7.5 million to a
man who was seriously hurt in a collision with a drunken driver
after ruling that Padre Island National Seashore rangers were
negligent in failing to arrest the driver earlier.
   U.S. District Judge Spencer Williams granted the award Friday to
Randy William Crider, 33, of Corpus Christi, a motorcyclist who
lost an arm and a leg in the 1983 collision with a car driven by
John Lee Landry, 23.
   The Interior Department, which oversees federal parks, and the
U.S. attorney's office will decide whether to appeal the decision
within 60 days, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Wayne Campbell.
   ``We think that the $7.5 million is fair, but no amount of money
can compensate for what Randy Crider has suffered,'' said his
attorney, Ben Sley. ``This, however, will give him the chance at a
meaningful life.''
   Crider said park rangers Larry Couser and James F. Copeland had
stopped Landry 10 hours before the accident for driving 40 mph in a
15-mph zone on a public road on Padre Island. The rangers ticketed
Landry and allowed him to continue,
   Williams, who was brought from San Jose, Calif., to Corpus
Christi to hear the case, ruled March 17 that not arresting Landry
was ``an act of negligence and that, as a consequence, an accident
occurred.''
   Evidence at the trial showed that Landry had consumed 7 or 8
ounces of liquor and had smoked several marijuana cigarettes in the
three or four hours before he was stopped for speeding. Sley had
argued that the marijuana could have impaired Landry's actions for
12 to 24 hours and that the alcohol intensified the effects of the
marijuana.
   Landry, who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in the
accident, was sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Sley, who had sought $75 million, said the case could lead
authorities around the nation to tighten enforcement of
drunken-driving laws.
   ``I think (the award) sends a message throughout the nation that
authorities have to enforce the drunk-driving laws or face serious
liability exposure,'' he said.
   However, Padre Island rangers have not changed enforcement of
drunken-driving laws since the March ruling, said park
Superintendent John D. Hunter, the park's superintendent.
   ``We might seek a little more advice from the U.S. attorney, but
our rangers are operating pretty much status quo,'' Hunter said,
adding that the judgment places an unfair burden on his rangers.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The new military government has
chosen as president of the important Games Control Commission a
Jean-Claude Duvalier supporter who has kept a low profile since the
dictator fled two years ago.
   The appointment of Abel Jerome, a retired army colonel, was
announced over the state-run television station Friday night along
with that of other new civil servants.
   They were selected by the new military government of Lt. Gen.
Henry Namphy, who swept into power earlier this week after ousting
civilian President Leslie Manigat.
   The weekly lottery, which generates hundreds of thousands of
dollars, is a national passion. There are almost as many ticket
stalls in the capital as grocery stores.
   The Games Control Commission is the body established to ensure
the lottery is not rigged and that winners collect earnings.
   Under the Duvalier regime, the corrupt administrative body was a
lucrative source of income for the dictators and their allies.
   Jerome is widely reported to have participated in the 1964 mass
murders of a number of prominent families in Jeremie, a town in
southwestern Haiti. He has gained a reputation for exceptional
brutality after those and other killings.
   Jerome has maintained a low profile since the February l986
uprising that sent Duvalier into exile in France, ending 29 years
of dictatorship by his family.

   A man shot his wife, son and baby daughter
in the head before turning the gun on himself Saturday night, but
spared a 2-year-old daughter who survived the rampage uharmed,
police said.
   Winston Coghiel, 33, shot his 30-year-old wife, June, as she sat
on their living room couch, said police Lt. James Henwood.
   Coghiel then shot 3-year-old son Winston Jr. and 9-month-old
daughter Kimberley, who were also found in the living room, Henwood
said. The man then shot himself with the .38-caliber Browning
automatic.
   All four were dead of gunshot wounds to the head when family
members found them, the lieutenant said. There were no signs of a
struggle.
   The surviving daughter, Celeste, was not hurt, but was taken to
Children's Hospital, Henwood said. She was released later in the
evening.
   Family members told police that Coghiel had been depressed and
was convinced people were after him, Henwood said.

   A four-week-long U.N. session on
disarmament missed its deadline and dragged on into Sunday after
bitterly divided delegates failed to agree on a formula for world
peace.
   The session, which was scheduled to end Saturday night, was
extended after delegates could not reach a consensus on issues
ranging from missile defense systems known as ``Star Wars'' to
monitoring land-based weapons.
   After the progress of the U.S.-Soviet summits, the failure of
this first General Assembly session on disarmament in six years to
meet its timetable put on public display the deep divisions that
still exist between East and West.
   Delegates to the $7.4 million session, which has heard 135
speakers since it began May 31, could only agree to allow a
negotiating committee to continue work Saturday night. Informal
consultations were expected through the night before participants
reconvened, possibly early Sunday.
   Delegates have been locked in intense, sometimes acrimonious
debate in efforts to forge a final document settng forth an agenda
for peace.
   The United States and some of its Western allies were at odds
with most other nations on numerous issues, including priorities
for nuclear and conventional disarmament, Third World disarmament
and identifying Israel and South Africa as regional offenders.
   Delegates and U.N. officials said it was uncertain whether the
world body would be able to adopt a final document by consensus and
avoid a divisive vote.

   A 25-year-old man was killed by lightning,
and another climber was injured as they scaled a dangerous route in
Eldorado Canyon State Park called the Naked Edge, authorities said.
   The 21-year-old survivor, who suffered burns and an ankle
injury, was in stable condition at Boulder Community Hospital on
Saturday night, according to a statement by the Boulder County
Sheriff's Department.
   Both climbers had to be lowered off the rock face by members of
the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, who had to work their way up the
back side of the canyon wall to reach them.
   The identities and addresses of the climbers were not released
pending notification of relatives.
   ``One climber had just reached (the top of the face), but hadn't
quite gotten over it,'' said Alice Daubenbis, who lives in the
canyon. ``Then I heard the lightning, it hit on the Naked Edge.''
   One man was at least 550 feet from the bottom of the canyon, and
it took rescue workers about an hour to reach the climbers,
Daubenbis said.
   The Naked Edge has ``some of the most dangerous, hard climbing
in the world,'' she said.

<HEAD>Police Suspect Israeli Soldier Lied About Arab Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities suspect that an Israeli reserve
soldier who claimed he was stabbed by four Arabs while hitchhiking
lied because he was late returning to his base, a police
spokeswoman said Sunday.
   On Saturday, a bomb exploded near an Israeli bus as it headed to
a Jewish settlement 37 miles north of Jerusalem in the occupied
West Bank. It damaged the vehicle but caused no injuries.
   The 38-year-old soldier, Chaim Yosef, said the Arabs assaulted
him and tried to grab his weapon Saturday as he hitchhiked at the
Mesubim junction near the coastal city of Tel Aviv, an army
spokesman had said.
   The Israeli Itim news agency said Yosef told police he was
stabbed four times.
   However, Tel Aviv police spokeswoman Shlomit Herzberg said
Sunday that Yosef had only scratches on his arm, not stab wounds.
She said his version of events ``is suspect and we are checking
whether it is correct.''
   Herzberg, reached by telephone, said police believed the soldier
may have made up the story to avoid punishment for failing to
report on time for military duty.
   Police detained several Arabs for questioning immediately after
the reported assault, but they were later freed, Mrs. Hertzberg
said.
   Earlier Saturday, troops shot and wounded a Palestinian in the
West Bank town of Nablus.
   A total of 211 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the
6{-month-old uprising in lands the Israelis seized in the 1967
Middle East War.

<HEAD>State Bar Accuses Famed Divorce Lawyer Of Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marvin Mitchelson, the celebrity divorce
lawyer for such stars as ``Dynasty'' vixen Joan Collins, is facing
misconduct allegations filed by the State Bar stemming from alleged
mishandling of clients' money.
   The State Bar's trial counsel office filed documents Friday
asking for a disciplinary hearing into allegations that Mitchelson
failed to return unearned fees of up to $25,000 promptly after
several clients fired him.
   ``We have in excess of 20 complaints against Mr. Mitchelson,''
State Bar chief trial counsel James A. Bascue said.
   Among those who filed complaints were actress Julie Newmar and
Eleanor Revson, sister-in-law of the founder of Revlon Cosmetics.
   Mitchelson, 60, who made headlines by winning palimony payments
for Michele Triola, the unwed, live-in girlfriend of actor Lee
Marvin in 1976, could face disciplinary actions ranging from a
simple warning to disbarment.
   Mitchelson said he was surprised by the allegations, which he
called ``a sudden attack.''
   ``I'm highly visible so I may be a prime target, but
nevertheless I will vigorously defend myself against these charges
as I have defended every case I've ever had,'' Mitchelson said by
phone from Tokyo.
   ``All these complaints are old complaints and at least two of
them have been previously rejected by the State Bar,'' he said.
   Ms. Newmar, who starred as ``Catwoman'' on the 1960s TV series
``Batman,'' Ms. Revson and others complained that Mitchelson took
retainers from them and delayed or refused to return unearned
portions of the fees after they fired him for alleged deception,
the Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
   The Bar also charged that Mitchelson failed to deposit clients'
funds in trust accounts, charged ``unconscionable'' fees, failed to
perform promised work, lied to a client and twice improperly asked
a client to withdraw her complaint to the State Bar over the return
of unearned fees.

<HEAD>Kabul Airport Blaze Destroys Eight Soviet Jets; Guerrillas
Suspected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire at the Kabul airport destroyed
eight Soviet jet fighters and may have been the result of an attack
by Moslem guerrillas, Western diplomatic sources said Sunday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said their
counterparts in the Afghan capital first noted the fire on Friday.
   ``It looks like a (guerrilla) attack,'' said one western
diplomat.
   He said that reliable sources in Kabul reported seeing two
rockets hit the airport about two hours after the fire started.
   Diplomats said Soviet and Afghan government forces were fighting
U.S.-backed guerrillas just west of the airport, on the northern
outskirts of the capital.
   They said reports coming in late Saturday claimed eight Soviet
Su-25 jet fighters exploded one after the other at the northwest
end of the airport.
   A telex report from one Western embassy said: ``The loss is one
of the largest soviet air losses of the war.''
   Guerrilla activity was reported on the rise around Kabul, with
insurgents frequently moving within rocket range of the city.
Guerrillas claimed to have rocketed the airport last week but not
on the day reported by diplomats.
   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to replace
one Marxist government with another and battle the anti-communist
insurgency. Soviet troops began withdrawing May 15 under the terms
of a United Nations-sponsored peace accord.

   The world-record holder in long-distance
tobacco spitting won his ninth accuracy title in the 34th annual
National Tobacco Spitting Contest, but was upset in the distance
contest by a novice.
   Restaurateur Jeff Barber, 27, of Ocean Springs hit three
bull's-eyes in three attempts to take the accuracy title Saturday,
proving he didn't bite off more than he could chew.
   But in the distance competition, Barber, nicknamed ``The
Faucet,'' spat 27 feet, 5 inches, far short of his 33 feet, 7{-inch
effort listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. Newcomer David
Singleton, 18, of Raleigh, took the 1988 distance title with a spit
of 28 feet, 10 inches.
   Eschewing health warnings about the dangers of chew, 11 men
turned out for the accuracy contest and an even dozen for the
distance. In the women's contest, two showed up at Billy John
Crumpton's farm 5 miles west of this Smith County town.
   Defending champion Peggy Woods, 31, of Brandon took her third
consecutive title with a spit of 15-2{ to win the women's title. An
accuracy contest was not held for the women.
   Woods said she could have spat farther, but the heat brought on
by the continuing drought had dried out her mouth.

   Tennessee's new automobile license
plates have given some county clerks a devil of a problem, but
others are managing to exorcise the trouble.
   Several clerks have been fielding complaints from motorists who
are unhappy that the number on their new three-letter, three digit
tags is 666 _ which some believe is the mark of the devil.
   ``Most of them won't take it when they get it,'' said Davidson
County Clerk Bill Covington. ``You might draw the wrong kind of
crowd.''
   Covington said his office has withdrawn the 666 plates from
Davidson county's stockpile _ all 366 of them.
   ``The thought never entered out minds,'' said Danny Shelton,
manager of Tennessee's license plate program of the 666
combination, which occurs every thousand plates. ``Registrants do
not have to accept the plates when they're issued.''
   Not all motorists have felt compelled to reject the number _
even one who's a man of the cloth.
   ``A lot of people mentioned it to me, especially since I'm a
minister,'' said John Miller of Nashville, pastor of the Tusculum
Church of Christ, who accepted a plate with 666. ``The beast is
very, very evil. But it has nothing to do with what number is on
your license plate or your Social Security card.''

   An Airbus A320 jetliner carrying 127
people crashed during an air show in eastern France, killing at
least two people and injuring 60, district government officials
said.
   Witnesses said the Air France jet, which went into service a
month ago, clipped some trees at the edge of an airport runway and
crashed in a field nearby.
   An unidentified passenger, a 25-year-old woman, was quoted by
Agence France-Presse as saying that she heard she heard tree
branches rub against the plane's fuselage.
   ``Things started moving fast,'' she said. ``The plane hit the
ground hard and we had the feeling of a abrupt jolt. Then there was
a fire in the front of the aircraft.''
   She was quoted as saying that the plane's evacuation chutes were
deployed and many passengers aboard slid down and got off, running
a distance from the plane because they feared an explosion.
   The twin-engine jet was taking part in an air show in overcast,
humid weather.
   An official at the Ministry of Transport in Paris said the
accident occurred at 2:50 p.m. (8:50 a.m. EDT) while the plane was
on a low-altitude demonstration flight above the Mulhouse-Habsheim
airport. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Medical evacuation helicopters and ambulances rushed to the
airport, located about 18 miles north of the Swiss city of Bale.
   The new twin-engine plane can carry 163 people. It features a
fully computerized flight-control system and went into service last
month with Air France and British Airways.
   The plane is manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a consortium of
European aircraft companies led by its French and German partners.

   The car carrying Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan crashed into the back of a Jeep on Sunday and
slightly injured a Chinese woman, Pakistani officials said.
   Yaqub-Khan expressed regret over the accident and concern for
the woman when he met later with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen.
   Pakistan Embassy official Nisarullah Baluch said the jeep was
ahead of the foreign minister's convoy, which was driving from the
airport. The Jeep's driver misunderstood police signals to pull
over and instead stopped, and the foreign minister's car struck it
in the rear.
   A woman who was sitting in the back of the open-ended vehicle
fell out, Baluch said. He said she was taken to a hospital with a
slight head injury.
   Yaqub-Khan is the first Pakistani official to visit China since
Pakistan's President Mohammad Zia Ul-haq abruptly dissolved the
National Assembly and dismissed Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo
and other ministers on May 29.
   Zia acted just as Junejo returned home from a trip to China.
   Yaqub-Khan, who resigned as foreign minister last year for
personal reasons, has resumed the post in a caretaker government
pending elections.
   In a speech prepared for delivery at a welcome banquet given by
Qian, he said the fact that his first visit in office was to China
showed the ``exception relationship'' between the two countries.
   Yaqub-Khan is scheduled to meet Monday with Chinese Premier Li
Peng. Topics are likely to include Afghanistan, where both
countries long have pushed for the current Soviet withdrawal.
   Li, who took office in April, has promised his first trip abroad
will be to Pakistan.

<HEAD>Farmer Has 14,000 Bushels Of Wheat On Hand To Weather Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB IMRIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STERLING, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four steel bins filled with unsold grain
are Mel Rodenburg's hedge against a drought that wiped out his
1,300 acres of wheat, oats and rye this spring.
   As the drought drags on and grain prices soar, he's one of
thousands of farmers who stand to make a tidy profit from selling
their share of the billions of bushels of wheat and corn stockpiled
around the nation.
   ``The drought makes it tough going, but, yes, we are going to
get along quite comfortably,'' said Rodenburg.
   Rodenburg, 57, has 14,000 bushels of wheat stored in the bins on
his 3,000-acre farm. The wheat is worth $3.85 a bushel, up $1.15
from a few weeks ago. The price likely will rise much more, perhaps
as high as $7 a bushel, some have speculated.
   While some farmers worry whether they will have anything to sell
at all this year, Rodenburg and his 26-year-old son, Alan, worry
whether they will sell too soon.
   ``If you sold it this week and it made another $1 jump next
week, it would make you feel sick,'' Alan Rodenburg said. ``If you
screw up a decision this year, you are screwing up. It just about
gives you an ulcer trying to figure out what to do.''
   The Rodenburgs represent a segment of the nation's farmers
likely to withstand the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days of
the 1930s.
   According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, farmers hold at
least half of the 1.2 billion bushels of wheat and 5.6 billion
bushels of corn in storage.
   In North Dakota, the nation's second-largest wheat producer
after Kansas, 300 million bushels of wheat are held in storage, an
amount equal to the state's average annual yield, according to the
state Wheat Commission.
   ``People who do hold these stocks and do sell them are going to
make a nice profit on it,'' said Brad Karem, the Agriculture
Department's farm program analyst.
   ``I think that's private enterprise,'' said Milton Hertz, head
of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
``It's terrible that a drought has to create something like that.''
   Some of North Dakota's farmers have as much as 60,000 bushels of
grain, mostly wheat, stored on their farms and under government
loan, estimated Alan Falk, an ASCS price support specialist in
Fargo.
   Farmers stand to make a profit on the stockpiled grain, even if
they have to pay off their government loans to get it out of
storage, said Neal Fisher, deputy administrator of the state Wheat
Commission. At last year's loan rate, they could make $1.50 to $2 a
bushel, he said.
   Rodenburg is hesitant to talk about his good fortune at a time
the drought could drive some of his neighbors out of business.
   The most he will say is that his farm income could be half of
normal: ``But I don't know. Let's leave it like that.''
   A combination of insurance, government help, good planning and
plain good luck will offset his losses.
   Insurance covers the seed and fertilizer on the crops that were
destroyed.
   His land payments are minimal, since he owns 2,000 acres of his
farm free and clear. What debt he does have is covered by
$37.50-an-acre government payments on 900 acres of highly erodible
land he took out of production.
   An emergency measure by the Agriculture Department let him cut
the healthy crop of alfalfa on that land for hay.
   He'll lose some of his government payment on the land he hays,
but the first field he cut produced about 1{ tons per acre, and he
thinks hay may eventually sell for as much as $100 a ton. The
potential income ``is going to be unreal,'' more than enough to pay
for the baler he recently bought at a farm auction, he said.
   The government also may make up for the income Rodenburg lost
when his crop was destroyed. Farm-belt members of Congress want the
Reagan administration to pay farmers the price guaranteed them when
grain prices were low. That subsidy could mean at least $10,000 to
$15,000 more for Rodenburg.
   Years of ``hard work and reasonably good management'' allowed
Rodenburg to pay off loans on the 2,000 acres of land he owns
debt-free, but his fortunes could take a drastic turn if the
drought lasts another season, he said.
   ``Next year, if we are standing here like this and under the
same circumstances, I will be painting a far gloomier picture for
us,'' he said, standing in the baking afternoon sun alongside his
grain bins.
   ``I think I would be better off getting a good crop,'' the
farmer said. ``I don't believe you could ever have a drought where
it indirectly really benefits you.''

<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunspot activity is increasing rapidly and,
during the next few years, could lead to the most intense solar
disturbances ever recorded, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said Sunday.
   Intense disturbances on the sun can have serious effects on
Earth, including interference with broadcasting, damage to
sensitive electronic systems in satellites and disturbances in
electrical power and telephone transmissions.
   Some scientists also have speculated that activity on the sun
could affect the climate on Earth, an idea that has prompted
considerable controversy in the meteorological community.
   Changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallel
with changes on the sun over the years. However, proving that the
two are connected has, so far, eluded science.
   Sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years.
Climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns in
the United States over periods of 11 years in the central and
western states and over 22 years in the eastern states.
   The current cycle began in September 1986 and already has seen
record rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun,
according to Gary Heckman, head of the NOAA-Air Force Space
Environment Services Center in Boulder, Colo.
   The most active previous solar cycle occurred in 1958. Activity
on the sun is already at about the same rate as in that year, but
with somewhat more intensity.
   Heckman noted that in a typical cycle sunspots increase to their
maximum in about 4.3 years and then take some 6.6 years to decline
to a minimum again. But cycles with rapid increases, as in the
current case, have higher and earlier maximum levels.
   Sunspots themselves do not affect the Earth, but are used as
indicators of other solar activity which does, such as solar flares
and geomagnetic storms, bombarding the Earth with radiation.
   Among the potential problems associated with an increase in
solar activity, according to Heckman, are:
   _Increasing activity by the aurora borealis or northern lights
(also the aurora australis, or southern lights, in Antarctica).
   _Interference with some kinds of radio communications and
broadcasts.
   _Disturbances in electrical power transmission systems,
pipelines and long-line telephone networks.
   _Damage to satellites' electronic systems.
   _Altered orbits of some satellites.
   _Radiation hazards to astronauts and aircraft passengers at high
altitudes.

bloc countries he has not been able to visit.
   While most attention on the five-day trip has focused on the
pope's remarks about Jews and the Holocaust, John Paul has also
been looking to millions of Catholics in Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   On Saturday, about 20,000 Yugoslav Catholics crossed the border
to the nearby Austrian town of Gurk for an outdoor Mass. The day
before, the pope said Mass for 80,000 Catholics, mostly Yugoslavs
and Hungarians, in the town of Trausdorf near the Hungarian border.
   The pope has visited Poland, his Communist homeland, three times
since he became head of the Roman Catholic Church in 1978. But so
far, Communist governments have imposed barriers that have kept him
from visiting millions of Catholics in Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
East Germany, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.
   Czechoslovak Catholics in particular have been in conflict with
Communist authorities, who until this year had not permitted any
new bishops in their country since 1973. Earlier this month, Prague
authorities finally allowed three new ones.
   The estimated 20,000 Yugoslav Catholics joined about 40,000
Italians and Austrians for the outdoor Mass on Saturday in Gurk.
   ``You all give testimony of the power of Christian faith to
overcome boundaries,'' John Paul said. ``Coming from several
cultures, you as the people of God speak the one language of common
belief.''
   ``Unfortunately today in Europe, even in your regions, the
ancient roots of faith are threatened in various ways,'' the
pontiff said, changing briefly from German to Italian in his homily.
   He continued: ``Christians must, however, react as a community
to this challenge. They must unite even more and stay even closer
together.''
   On Friday, he said his Mass for the 80,000 Catholics, mostly
Yugoslavs and Hungarians, in Trausdorf. Several hundred Poles and
several dozen Czechs also were on hand.
   Addressing the local Austrian Catholics, the pontiff said:
``This diocese and its bishop are well aware of their function as a
link in particular with the peoples of Eastern Europe.''
   ``You are ready to cultivate contacts with them and to share
with them, materially and spiritually,'' he said. ``Must not the
salvation Christ has given us again be spread to the farthest
bounds of Europe?''
   Some Austrian newspapers hailed the Mass as a major gesture
toward Eastern Europe.
   ``Trausdorf: A Signal for the East Bloc,'' trumpeted Vienna's
Kleine Zeitung daily newspaper in its Saturday editions.
   Other newspapers, though, felt that the pontiff had kept his
remarks deliberately low-key, possibly in hope of not upsetting any
chances he may have of visiting any new Eastern European countries.
   ``He overcame barriers by not putting up any,'' said the
conservative Die Presse daily newspaper of Vienna.

   George Bush calls it his ``truth squad,'' an
army of Republican stand-ins with orders to take shots at opponent
Michael Dukakis. The Democrat's camp has a less charitable label:
``hit squad.''
   No matter the name, the Bush surrogates _ made up of senators
and House members, governors, and other prominent Republicans _ are
already having an impact on the 1988 presidential race.
   The surrogates are fanning out across the country and
criticizing the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, sometimes
speaking in the same cities hours before or after Dukakis, a
technique the Bush campaign calls ``bracketing.''
   For a national campaign strapped for cash, the tactic is
inexpensive and enables the vice president to get mileage from the
sharp attacks without having to utter the words himself.
   The Republican strategy became apparent during a Dukakis swing
through the South last week when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spoke
in Nashville and Miami a day ahead of Dukakis, branding the
Massachusetts governor soft on crime and an opponent of the death
penalty.
   Dukakis called it negative campaigning and derided McCain as
someone who ``doesn't know beans from brown bread.'' But the GOP
footwork was not lost on Dukakis strategists.
   A few days later, Bush delivered a strong law-and-order speech
to the National Association of Sheriffs in Louisville, Ky. After
the room cleared, one sheriff lingered near the press area. Wearing
a large ``Dukakis'' sticker, he was hard to miss.
   Sheriff Robert C. Rufo of Suffolk County, Mass., which includes
the city of Boston, suggested the vice president _ not Dukakis _
lacked a crime-fighter's record.
   ``At all these conventions, there are going to be very strong
Dukakis supporters. They're not going to be shy,'' said Leslie
Dach, communications director for the Dukakis campaign.
   But Dach said that, while Dukakis will have some surrogate
speakers, he will not field anywhere near the number that Bush is
using.
   ``Ultimately, this kind of tactic is not going to work. George
Bush's problem is he hasn't articulated his own vision of the
future. And that's what people want in a president, they're not
looking for somebody who can organize a hit squad,'' Dach said.
   Although surrogates have been used before, including elected GOP
officials who spoke out vociferously in 1984 in behalf of President
Reagan's re-election effort, the Bush campaign is seeking to turn
the practice into a science _ carefully targeting speakers to
subjects and audiences.
   ``We have about 10 out there now. By the fall, we'll have 100,''
said Alixe Glen, a Bush spokeswoman.
   Bush, who says the surrogate speakers will play a vital part in
his campaign, told reporters last week that he thinks the
differences between him and Dukakis remain out of focus _ and
that's where the surrogate speakers will help.
   ``I've got to spell it out (the differences) and get surrogates
_ those other people who believe as I do _ to spell it out,'' Bush
said.
   Some of the surrogates have specific assignments.
   For instance, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu's marching orders
are to chip away at Dukakis' so-called ``Massachusetts miracle,''
which the neighboring governor derides as the ``Massachusetts
mirage.''
   On Friday, for example, Sununu told reporters no one should be
surprised at Dukakis' signing a $40 million cigarette tax into law
because ``everytime he's had a problem, he's run to a tax increase
_ even when he ran the first time and gave an iron-clad commitment
there would be no tax increase.''
   Former Massachusetts Gov. Ed King is also speaking on behalf of
Bush with the same message, and Illinois Gov. James Thompson and
New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean have also been active as surrogates.
   To counter his high negatives among women voters, Bush is
counting on a number of prominent GOP women, including Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas to get out
the word that he is concerned with issues that affect women.
   Vanquished GOP presidential rivals Rep. Jack Kemp of New York
and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas are also busy on the surrogate circuit.
Dole, the Senate minority leader, ``has already been to nine state
conventions and we will be to 20,'' said Dole aide Walt Riker.
``He's just crashing his way downfield.''
   The Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee are
sharing the expenses of the surrogate program.
   But one Republican skeptical of the ultimate value of the
technique is McCain, the Arizona senator who dogged Dukakis in the
South.
   ``The Dukakis people were clearly stunned by this,'' said
McCain, noting that Democrats retaliated by attacking him at home
for missing Senate votes while campaigning for Bush.
   ``I was gone 24 hours. I missed five votes, all of which were
either non-essential or carried by margins such as 92-to-3.''
   McCain said that surrogate speakers have been used extensively
in the past by both parties and that he believes the concept ``is
helpful but only minimally'' to candidates.
   ``That's why I was intrigued at the way Dukakis and his people
overreacted,'' McCain said. ``I think it's ridiculous that he
responds by saying I don't know the difference between beans and
brown bread. What kind of response is that?''
   McCain, who said he does know the difference, is turning down
the RNC's offer to pay for his trip.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who expects to speak extensively
in the West, said the surrogate program is a chance to correct what
he claims are misconceptions among voters that are hurting Bush in
the polls.
   ``A lot of the polls show either two-fifths or three-fifths of
the people polled said that Dukakis was more conservative than
Bush. That isn't a loss of focus, that's a loss of your
eyeglasses,'' Simpson said. ``There isn't any way Dukakis is going
to pull that one off.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Furlough Program At Center Of Dukakis-Bush Crime
Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Republican George Bush wages an aggressive
effort to portray Michael Dukakis as a liberal who is soft on
crime, the man at the center of the vice president's pitch is
behind bars in a Maryland prison.
   Convicted murderer and rapist William Horton Jr. is as much a
part of the debate over crime this presidential campaign season as
the opposite views on the death penalty espoused by the two
candidates.
   Bush now mentions Horton by name, in campaign rhetoric laced
with attacks on a Massachusetts furlough program that allowed
Horton to be released from prison although he was serving a life
sentence for murdering a 17-year-old boy. In 1987, during his 10th
furlough, Horton fled to Maryland, twice raped a woman and
assaulted her fiance.
   ``I think Governor Dukakis owes the people of the United States
an explanation,'' Bush said last week in Illinois. ``What did the
Democratic governor of Massachusetts think he was doing when he let
convicted first-degree murderers out on weekend passes?''
   A day earlier, Bush was told of Dukakis' statement that 45
states and the federal prison system offer some form of furlough.
The vice president responded that ``none, except Massachusetts, had
furlough programs for first-degree murderers.''
   But, according to several correctional associations and
publications, at least 16 states offer furloughs to first-degree
murderers. Massachusetts no longer is among them: Dukakis
reluctantly signed a law banning first-degree lifers from furloughs.
   ``Ralph Waldo Emerson said that foolish consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds,'' Dukakis said when he signed the bill
in April. ``I try to listen; I try to learn.''
   Since the Massachusetts program began in 1972, 117,700 furloughs
were granted to 10,553 inmates. Of the 426 escapes, 11 occurred
during the 4,908 furloughs granted to first-degree murderers.
   ``Massachusetts actually had a pretty good record,'' said Brian
Bemus, a researcher at the National Institute of Corrections data
center in Boulder, Colo.
   Bush has amended his attack on the furlough program, accurately
saying in recent days that Massachusetts, until April, had the only
furlough program in the nation for inmates sentenced to life
without parole.
   Campaign aides say the vice president will continue his attack.
   ``He finds this program of furloughing murderers with no-parole
sentences represents the worst sort of approach to crime,'' Bush
spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Friday. ``The furlough issue is
important because it shows how Dukakis' record on crime contrasts
with the vice president's positions. As this issue has been
elevated, I think the American people are shocked at the Willie
Horton example.''
   Faced with growing criticism from Bush and increased media
attention on the furlough program, the Dukakis camp has fired back
with national furlough statistics showing the Massachusetts
furlough-escape rate is below average and by invoking the name of
Bush's boss, President Reagan, who as governor of California
supported furloughs even after two convicts killed people while on
furlough in the early 1970s.
   Like Reagan, Dukakis inherited the furlough program from a
governor of the opposition party.
   ``These are part and parcel of all kinds of responsible
correction programs,'' says Dukakis, who has spent much of the past
week defending the Massachusetts program, largely by citing a 14
percent drop in crime in his state over the past five years.
   ``Our view is that the vice president is trying, through the
furlough issue, to obscure the facts,'' Dukakis issues adviser Tom
Herman said in an interview. ``The fact is that while crime is
going up nationally, crime is dropping dramatically in
Massachusetts.
   ``He also is using it to obscure the unenviable crimefighting
record of the Reagan-Bush administration,'' said Herman, who spent
much of last week researching furlough programs. ``Bush is reacting
to this issue in a sense that tells me he's running scared.''
   If the criticisms continue, aides say, look for Dukakis to adopt
the strategy he used when former rival Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee criticized the Massachusetts furlough program during the
primary campaign.
   ``Al, the difference between you and me is that I have to run a
criminal justice system. You never have,'' Dukakis said during an
April debate in New York. That kind of response to Bush would fit
in with the Dukakis strategy to attempt to characterize Bush as a
do-nothing vice president.
   Among corrections officials and criminoligists, furloughs are
considered an effective rehabilitation tool.
   ``Most knowledgeable correctional workers, prisoners and others
interested in work furlough see it as a progressive correctional
program,'' said a 1975 review of one program _ that of
then-California Gov. Reagan.
   ``There is no way that we're ever going to be 100 percent able
to give you a program where the parole board or the furlough
program has fallen down,'' said Professor James Fox of Northeastern
University's School of Criminal Justice.
   He also questioned the relevance of the furlough issue in
presidential politics.
   ``If freeing a murderer on furlough is the issue, then it's moot
because murder is, except for in rare cases, a state crime and the
president doesn't really deal with murderers,'' Fox said.

   Torrential rains in various parts of
Bangladesh have killed nine people and left thousands homeless,
officials and press reports said Sunday.
   Six people drowned Saturday when their boats sank in heavy rains
on the overflowing Matamuhuri river near the port city of
Chittagong, about 100 miles southeast of Dhaka, newspaper reports
said.
   Two people died in northern Sherpur district and one in
neighboring Netrokona district when more than 5,000 mud and straw
huts collapsed during heavy monsoon rains, the Dainik Bangla said.
About 25,000 people were left homeless.
   More than 200,000 people in Sunamganj district were trapped on
the roofs and terraces of their homes, the reports said.
   The waters of the northeastern rivers Surma, Someswari and
Muhuri rose above the danger point following the rains, the Dainik
Bangla reported.
   Relief officials in Sherpur said government rescue teams moved
almost 10,000 people to shelters.
   Since last month, about 50 people have died in monsoon flooding
in Bangladesh, according to press reports.

   With less than a month to go before the
Democratic National Convention, incomplete housing arrangements
threaten the party's hopes for a smooth kickoff to its biggest
media event of the year.
   But some of those who will be covering the gathering say they
don't expect problems severe enough to be noticed by the Democrats'
real audience _ the millions of American voters who be will
watching or reading about the convention across the country.
   While the city has been sprucing up for the visitors, the host
committee and party organizers sometimes have been slow to provide
information to reporters and others who have to make arrangements
of their own, said Jane Maxwell, Cable News Network's vice
president for special events.
   But she said the problems probably won't affect the picture CNN
presents to the public.
   ``The fact is we have to be ready for the event because they
aren't going to delay it for us,'' she said.
   Ms. Maxwell and her counterpart at CBS, David Buksbaum, gave
convention organizers good marks for helping with television
coverage. The complaints from news organizations center on
off-the-floor matters, especially housing.
   ``Hotel rooms are really a problem,'' said NBC producer Phil
Alongi, who said the network has received only a few rooms in
downtown hotels.
   ``I just can't find enough words to describe how much trouble
they're going to be in,'' said Mary Pat Clark, the office manager
of the Los Angeles Times' Washington bureau, who said housing
arrangements started much later in Atlanta than in previous
convention cities.
   The convention has fared better on other fronts.
   A newly opened rapid rail station at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport means delegates can reach downtown in 15
minutes for an 85-cent fare. Those traveling the route by car will
have to contend with ongoing construction on the I-75-85 ``downtown
connector,'' but the disarray has not proved a major problem to
larger conventions.
   The city long ago gave up on Mayor Andrew Young's initial hope
that a renovated Underground Atlanta entertainment district could
open in time for the convention, but delegates will be offered
excursions on a steam-powered train line newly extended to the
Stone Mountain tourist attraction.
   Once the Atlanta Hawks were defeated in the National Basketball
Association playoffs, workers began building the huge stage,
network anchor booths and other fixtures of the convention at the
Omni Coliseum.
   ``It does seem finally to be coming together and more and more
of the details are slowly being revealed,'' said David B. Cooper,
associate editor of the Akron Beacon Journal and deputy convention
manager for Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Bob Murphy, a senior producer at ABC, said, ``We are on schedule
and there's nothing new from any other convention in dealing with
Democrats. They always appear to be somewhat disorganized in the
very beginning and then everything seems to fall in place.''
   Murphy said his network has rejected some of its assigned hotel
rooms because they are not close enough for key personnel.
   Some disputes were inevitable because some of the convention
hotels are located in the suburbs. Ms. Clark, who has worked on six
previous political conventions, said the situation was made worse
when organizers started making assignments much too late.
   Overbooking can be expected, she said, leading to a last-minute
scramble for canceled rooms. In Atlanta's case, she said, ``They're
going to have chaos.''
   And if maintenance workers strike the Atlanta Hilton & Towers,
as threatened in a long labor dispute, delegates from California,
Tennessee, Louisiana and Wyoming will be looking for new rooms.
   Convention spokeswoman Ruth Berry said hotel managers were told
in an April letter it would be July 11 before housing plans could
be finalized. She said only three of 107 managers responded with
questions about the arrangements.
   But one hotel manager who asked not to be named said, ``I can't
even get the Democrats to return a phone call. I've been calling
them for a week. That tells me that they can't tell me anything
because they're still confused.''
   ``I think it's fair to say we're behind schedule,'' Ms. Berry
said. ``We're in a different situation than San Francisco (site of
the 1984 convention). San Francisco had a lot more downtown hotel
rooms. But everybody will get one.''
   Wally Podrazik, co-director of media arrangements and facilities
and a veteran of three previous conventions, says everything will
be ready in time.
   Podrazik took over in late May, succeeding Bob Ferrante who was
dismissed after complaints that the media effort was disorganized.
   ``I was coming in just about when people were giving final
answers or close to final answers'' on convention logistics,
Podrazik said.
   Maurice Johnson, superintendent of the U.S. Senate Press
Photographers' Gallery, said efforts to coordinate coverage have
been hampered because of delays in receiving plans for
photographers.
   Johnson, who has worked on four previous Democratic conventions
in his current position and covered others as a news photographer
dating back to 1948, said, ``They're usually hectic, but this is a
lot worse than previous ones.''

   Students throwing firebombs and rocks
battled riot police Sunday around the Roman Catholic cathedral and
started a blaze in a 15-story building after authorities blocked a
march.
   Brief running clashes broke out around Myongdong Cathedral as
hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black helmets
stopped students from marching in the streets.
   Firebombs hurled by students at police started the blaze in the
ground floor of an office building. Smoke poured from two floors as
firefighters and police extinguished the blaze, which apparently
was started by accident.
   The building had been closed and there were no reports of
injuries from the blaze. Police officers said offices on the ground
floor were damaged.
   A number of students and police officers were hurt in the
fighting, but there were no figures on injuries or arrests.
   Radicals called for a major rally and march at the cathedral to
mark nationwide riots in June 1987 and press for the overthrow of
the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   But hundreds of police stopped many students from reaching the
cathedral. Only about 200 got through. The students at the
cathedral stormed out to break police lines so others could get
through, but they were driven back by tear gas.
   Radicals use the cathedral as a sanctuary because police do not
enter for fear of offending public opinion and church authorities.
   Student leaders, addressing the rally in the cathedral grounds,
denounced Roh and former President Chun Doo-hwan as dictators.
   Speakers demanded Roh and Chun be punished for the bloody
suppression in 1980 of an anti-government revolt in the southern
city of Kwangju in which at least 191 people were killed.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan!'' students shouted.
   Protesters also chanted ``Yankee go home!'' and speakers charged
the United States helped suppress the Kwangju revolt and backed
military rule in South Korea.
   Radical groups had called on people to show support for the
protest by honking car horns and joining the rally, but there were
no signs of public support. The radicals are a small minority, and
few South Koreans support their demands for reunification of the
Korean Peninsula and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South.
   The students, some armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks,
started to march out of the cathedral compound. Protesters leading
the march hurled firebombs at police blocking surrounding streets.
   Riot police tossed tear gas grenades and rifle squads fired
volleys of tear gas to drive back the attacking students.
   Priests used the cathedral's public address system to appeal to
students to stop fighting and police to stop firing tear gas. Both
sides ignored the appeals.
   Fighting stopped later as flames and smoke poured from the
building hit by firebombs.

   The Athens Seismological Institute said the quake hit at 7:51
p.m. Saturday and was centered 34 miles south of the Greek capital.
It measured 4 on the Richter scale.
   ``It was a very small quake, and not many of us felt it,'' said
a police officer in Poros. ``There were no casualties or damage.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage.

   Tea-drinking Chinese are turning to coffee for

   Most of that coffee is imported, and agricultural officials
worried about the country's scarce foreign currency are scrambling
to boost domestic coffee production, the China Daily newspaper said.
   It quoted Yang Peisheng of the Ministry of Agriculture as saying
Chinese now consume 21,000 tons of coffee beans a year, with all
but 1,300 imported. He said China is seeking $2.6 million in
foreign investment to start its own coffee plantations.
   Coffee has become a popular gift among sophisticated urbanites
due largely to television ads showing well-dressed couples beaming
at each other over cups of steaming coffee, the report said.

<TEXT>
   In the early 1970s, then-Gov. Ronald
Reagan firmly defended a work furlough program for California
prison inmates that was similar to the Massachusetts program that
Vice President George Bush has attacked recently.
   And just as Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis today faces
political criticism for violent crimes committed by inmates on work
furloughs, Reagan also faced complaints from conservative
politicians and police officials that his policies had put
dangerous criminals on the streets.
   Like Dukakis, the expected Democratic nominee for president, who
continued a work furlough program started under a governor of the
opposite party, Reagan inherited his furlough program from
Democratic Gov. Pat Brown.
   Reagan implemented Brown's program vigorously and boasted that
California had one of the most progressive inmate rehabilitation
programs in the nation and that he was reducing California's prison
population while other states were struggling with prison
overcrowding.
   But after two inmates were charged with murders committed while
on work furlough passes, Reagan fired one top manager of the
program and closed one of five work furlough centers.
   At one point, conservative legislators were demanding the
resignation of Reagan's director of prisons, and the Los Angeles
chief of police, Ed Davis, who is now a Republican state senator,
complained to Reagan that ``about 40 percent of our serious and
violent offenders are on active parole from your Department of
Corrections.''
   Reagan resisted the demands to fire his director of prisons and
stood behind the furlough program, which still operates today under
slightly more restrictive rules.
   In addition to the work furlough program, Reagan also
administered a probation subsidy program under which counties were
paid a $2,000 annual bonus for each convicted felon who would
otherwise go to state prison who they instead placed in a county
jail or community rehabilitation program.
   As a result of the two programs, Reagan became the only
California governor in modern times to have the prison population
decline during his tenure.
   Bob Gore, information officer for the California Department of
Corrections, said during Reagan's administration, inmates with
clean records in prison were eligible for work furlough, even if
they had committed violent crimes such as murder. Today's work
furlough rules exclude inmates convicted of murder and other
violent crimes.
   But the two work furlough cases which resulted in California
murders in the early 1970s both involved inmates with no history of
violence _ a burglar and a forger.
   The burglar's case came first and attracted the most attention
because he killed a police officer. But the forger's case three
months later, although receiving only minimal public attention,
triggered a shake-up of the California program.
   Two days after the first murder by a work furlough inmate,
Reagan vigorously defended the program during a general news
conference, saying that California was ``leading the nation in
rehabilitation,'' but that ``obviously you can't be perfect.''
   ``More than 20,000 already have these passes ... and this was
the only case of this kind, the only murder,'' Reagan said.
   The first murder was on Oct. 25, 1971, when officer Phillip
Riley stopped David Brenenstahl, who was driving a reported stolen
car in the exclusive Marina del Rey district of Los Angeles. As
Riley attempted to handcuff Brenenstahl, the suspect wrestled the
officer's gun away from him and shot him.
   Brenenstahl, who had been sentenced to state prison three years
earlier for burglary, was on a 72-hour work furlough at the time
and had just obtained a job as a machinist which would have
qualified him for early release from prison.
   Brenenstahl was later convicted of second-degree murder for
Riley's death and sent back to state prison. He was paroled in 1981.
   The second murder occurred on Jan. 21, 1972, when Gerald F.
Mitchell and his wife, Karen, were accosted outside their Orange
County apartment by a gunman in a robbery attempt. When Mitchell
resisted, the robber shot him once in the heart and fled.
   The gunman was later identified as William Cartwright, a
convicted forger on a work furlough.

<HEAD>Pentagon Doesn't Expect Immediate Slowdown in Contract Awards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The defense industry fears that the
investigation of fraud and bribery in Pentagon contracting will
cause a slowdown in contract awards and new layers of oversight,
but the Pentagon says it doesn't expect that fallout any time soon.
   ``We are at least weeks, if not months, away from the kind of
evidence which would point to looking at the acquisition process
(for an overhaul),'' says Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief
spokesman.
   In the meantime, the process of awarding contracts ``has not
ground to a halt,'' Howard said. ``It couldn't if we continue to
stay in business.''
   However, industry officials were nearly unanimous in their
concern about the impact of the probe.
   The investigation ``is very bad news for all of us because of
the effect it's going to have on the reputation of the industry in
total, and because of the stimulus it will provide for additional
regulations and oversight,'' W. B. Jones, a vice president of the
Grumman Corp., said last week.
   ``We'll get regulations and stipulations on what consultants may
do,'' said Joseph Campbell, an aerospace analyst for the Paine
Webber Group Inc.
   Larry McCracken, manager of media relations for Raytheon Corp.,
said, ``Most people believe the procurement process will probably
slow down a bit because of new people being moved into some of the
positions (at the Pentagon). The whole process,'' McCracken said,
``will just be a more cautious process.''
   Several companies are also worried that existing contracts will
be canceled because of evidence of wrongdoing and ``they may have
to rebid projects already under way,'' said Herbert C. Hetu, a
spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, meanwhile, said
Sunday that an earlier study of Pentagon contracting found that
contractors already are overaudited and often don't have the
opportunity to make adequate profits. And he expressed a fear that
the scandal could lead to cuts in defense spending.
   ``I certainly hope that this is not used as an excuse by the
professional Pentagon bashers for cutting out enough funding for
the defense of this nation,'' Weinberger said on NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press.''
   The investigation of defense fraud, started by the Naval
Investigative Service nearly two years ago and now directed by the
Justice Department, surfaced on June 14 when FBI agents served more
than three dozen search warrants around the country.
   The warrants named some of the nation's largest defense
contractors along with industry consultants and Defense Department
workers. Among the most prominent of the consultants was Melvyn
Paisley, who until April 1987 was an assistant secretary of the
Navy.
   Justice Department officials say the inquiry centers on
allegations that Pentagon executives took bribes from private
military consultants who were selling classified contract
information to their corporate clients.
   To date, the Pentagon's only official response to the
investigation has been to reassign six officials of the Navy and
Air Force to other jobs pending the outcome of the investigation.
   The reassignments, including a man holding the fairly
high-ranking position of deputy assistant secretary of the Navy,
are not of sufficient number to create important gaps in the
procurement bureaucracy, the services said last week.
   ``We just don't foresee any type of impact on the award of
contracts because of these moves,'' said Lt. Janet Mescus, a Navy
spokeswoman.
   Howard and other officials say the scandal is simply too young
to directly affect the awarding of contracts. With about 60,000
contracts being awarded every work day _ 15.3 million contracts
totaling $156.5 billion were distributed in fiscal 1987 _ there is
a momentum that is not easily arrested, they said.
   ``This is a massive organization,'' Howard said. ``It has 50,000
people writing contracts or involved in the contractual process.''
   Another Pentagon executive agreed: ``There's no impact on
awards. You can't stop buying F-A-18s when the Navy needs F-A-18s
for its carriers. It doesn't work that way.''
   Industry officials counter that if they are premature with their
fears, the handwriting is on the wall. Indeed, many say they are so
concerned that they don't want to talk about the scandal for fear
of fanning publicity.
   One executive, demanding anonymity, explained: ``Here I am,
staring at more competition to begin with because the defense
budget is being cut; facing reduced (profit) margins because of
regulatory changes, and you want me to talk about a probe that is
spreading the impression the entire defense industry is crooked. No
thanks.''
   Underscoring the pressures being produced by the investigation,
a Senate committee flirted briefly last Friday with legislation
that would have allowed the government to suspend payments to
defense contractors under investigation in the case.
   The committee decided such action would be premature, but there
were predictions the matter would arise again on the Senate floor.

<HEAD>Kabul Airport Fire Destroys Eight Soviet Jet Fighters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western sources said Sunday that a
fire at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan destroyed eight Soviet jet
fighters and may have been the result of an attack by Moslem
guerrillas.
   The diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
reports coming in late Saturday said eight Soviet Su-25 jet
fighters exploded one after the other at the northwest end of the
airport.
   A telex report from one Western embassy called it ``one of the
largest Soviet air losses in the war.''
   The sources said their counterparts in the Afghan capital first
heard of the fire Friday morning. The explosions and tracer-like
eruptions indicated the fire also set off some ammunition, they
said.
   ``It looks like a (guerrilla) attack,'' said one Western
diplomat in Islamabad.
   He said reliable sources in Kabul reported seeing two incoming
rockets, likely fired by insurgents, hit Theo Oga Airport about two
hours after the fire was first noticed.
   Diplomats said the Saturday reports indicated the Soviet planes
were parked almost two miles away from where the rounds hit Friday.
   Soviet and Afghan government forces were fighting U.S.-backed
guerrillas just west of the airport, on the northern outskirts of
the capital, diplomats said.
   The fire has shut down activities at the airport, the sources
said. They said no fixed-wing aircraft have been seen landing there
since the fire began, and that one Soviet Il-76 transport plane was
seen being diverted on approach.
   However, at least one commercial flight of the Afghan airline
Ariana arrived in New Delhi from Kabul on Saturday, passengers
said. Civil and military planes use the same runways at Kabul but
it was not immediately known how many Ariana planes are using the
airport.
   Earlier reports had described heavy military traffic at the
airport as Soviets stepped up the resupply of Afghan government
troops when the Red Army started its nine-month withdrawal from
Afghanistan on May 15.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to back
the Kabul government in its war with Afghan rebels. They began
withdrawing under an accord signed April 14 in Geneva.
   Guerrillas claimed to have launched rocket attacks on the
airport last week but not on Friday.
   In another development, Afghan and diplomatic sources reported
rebels shot down an Afghan transport plane on June 16 near the
embattled eastern garrison town of Khost.
   Diplomatic sources said Afghans put the casualty toll at 30 to
40 but were not able to confirm whether all the victims were
military.
   The sources said the incident has reduced the number of
nighttime flights into Khost. The flights have been the only means
to resupply the garrison, which is surrounded by guerrillas near
the Pakistan border.
   Guerrillas have taken dozens of communist posts in eastern
Afghanistan since Soviet and Afghan government troops began
redeploying after the Geneva accord.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets began the nine-month withdrawal
on schedule on May 15. The Soviet-backed Kabul government said only
Soviet troops, not Soviet military advisers, will leave.

   Police on Sunday used sticks to break
up a march by women protesting a decree that made Islam the supreme
law of Pakistan, a witness said.
   The witness said that in the eastern city of Lahore, police
confronted about 150 women demonstrating against the law, which
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq put into effect June 15 in a
televised address to the nation.
   The witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police
lashed out with batons.
   The decree makes Islam ``the supreme law of Pakistan,'' but it
will not affect the rights of non-Moslems or the country's business
contracts with other nations, Zia said.
   
   The women said they feared the measure would negate Moslem laws
introduced in 1961, which acknowledge a woman's right to divorce as
well as to demand the registration of marriages and divorces.
   Witnesses said the protesters, who later held a sit-in, also
condemned the United States for suporting ``the dictator of
Pakistan.'' Police arrested six of the protesters.
   On May 29, Zia, who is also army chief of staff, fired his
entire civilian government and dissolved the National Assembly. He
charged the elected ruling bodies with failure to implement the
Islam codes.
   Zia hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days, but
he hasn't set a date.
   In the southern port city of Karachi, the head of Pakistan's
opposition People's Party, Benazir Bhutto, warned the president
against postponing elections.
   ``This time you (Zia) cannot escape elections,'' Bhutto said in
front of a rally of thousands.
   In 1979, Zia ordered the hanging of former prime minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir's father, after overthrowing him in a
1977 military coup.
   Members of Bhutto's People's Party were among the demonstrators
in Lahore.

   Farmhand Gus Daniels toils for minimum wage
on a cotton and soybean farm, scraping by during the searing
drought in a tin-roofed sharecropper's house that has no running
water and not even an outhouse.
   ``It's hot enough out there to make a man quit,'' said Daniels,
41, on the fifth straight day of 100-plus-degree temperatures in
the upper Mississippi delta.
   ``You don't want to go out in the heat. But when it's time to go
to work, I'll be there,'' Daniels said Saturday. ``We survive the
best we can in this county down here. Can't do nothing but
survive.''
   The worst drought in 50 years, coupled with a combination punch
of record high temperatures, hits everyone in Tunica County, one of
the poorest areas in the country. The heat always seems the hottest
for those at the bottom of the bottom, but they shrug it off.
   ``I was raised in the hot weather,'' said Daniels, the son of a
sharecropper who also was the son of a sharecropper.
   Daniels earns $3.35 an hour to work a sweat-soaked, 12-hour
shift that begins at 7 a.m. daily.
   Although sharecropping has virtually vanished, some of the
shabby shanties remain. Daniels lives with his wife and 6-year-old
daughter in an unpainted wooden shack consisting of two rooms, a
kitchen and a bedroom.
   Flattened cardboard boxes serve as wallpaper. The toilet is a
bucket or a space behind a barn. Water is hauled from town a mile
away. The family pays no rent but has to pay the electric bill.
   The house has one fan; air conditioning is a fantasy. Nothing is
insulated, and the paneless windows have screens patched together
with tape.
   On a rare day off Saturday, Daniels sharpened tools and tinkered
with his truck in the front yard, which adjoins a cotton field. The
farm he works, which he calls a plantation, is irrigated and has
weathered the hot, dry spell so far.
   ``It got so dry, the boss was laying off. I guess he felt sorry
for us,'' said Daniels, listening to the blues on his pickup's
radio.
   In northern Mississippi, clay soil that should be as black as
buckshot pellets looks white because the moisture's been baked out
of it. Dust clouds rise behind tractors like smoke from a fire,
then settles on long, straight rows of crops struggling to survive
on lands as flat as a tabletop.
   At the end of a dusty dirt road in the middle of a cotton field
outside of Tunica, Jerlean Simmons hung a load of laundry in the
wilting midday sun.
   ``It's too hot for anything,'' said Mrs. Simmons, 35.
``Everything's drying up. I know it's affecting the farmers. I
couldn't even raise a garden. It burned up.''
   The hum of three electric fans droned from the old
sharecropper's house, consisting of three bedrooms and a kitchen
topped by corrugated tin. It has no running water and no toilet.
Plastic sheets make do as window panes.
   Mrs. Simmons' 16-year-old daughter, also named Jerlean, worked
three days last week and four days the week before as a cotton
chopper.
   The job is as unglamorous as it sounds. For 10 hours a day at
the minimum wage, laborers chop weeds with hoes along cotton rows.
   ``It's the only kind of work we can find to do,'' said Mrs.
Simmons. ``It's the only way to make a living when you ain't got no
job. Jobs is hard to find.''
   About 200 hands work as choppers in Tunica County, where cotton
is still king but the per capita wage is $6,800, about 30 percent
lower than average in Mississippi. But the dry weather even puts a
crimp in that grueling endeavor.
   ``It's so hot and dry, the weeds aren't growing,'' said Owen
Bibb, a farmer who laid off 15 choppers on Friday because he didn't
need them anymore.
   Cotton farmers kill weeds with chemicals. But unless rain falls,
the chemicals don't do their job.
   ``It's been so dry, chemicals don't work very well. Choppers get
the escape weeds,'' said county agent Dwayne Wheeler.
   ``It's not glamorous work,'' Wheeler said. ``I did it for a
while. It didn't take me long to figure out I didn't want to do
that the rest of my life.''
   Five miles down the road from Tunica, at a crossroads near a
granary, sits Clayton. It's the home of the D&R One-Stop, a gas
station, grocery store, beer garden, pool hall and sandwich shop
under a shingled roof. Sweaty men sat outside on a wooden bench in
the unpaved parking lot, where an outdoor thermometer read 110
degrees in the shade.
   ``Everything's burning up,'' said a farmhand who identified
himself as Rock, sipping an icy drink after working the fields
until noon. ``It's hot as hell. If it don't rain, there ain't going
to be nothing for nobody to do. Right now, it's rough. All we can
do is look to the Lord.''

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Research on Medicare, Medicaid Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is making decisions about the $120
billion-a-year Medicare and Medicaid programs on the basis of
federal research that is often delayed or of poor quality, the
General Accounting Office reported Sunday.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the Health Care
Financing Administration was producing reports that ``were often
not fully responsive to congressional needs, were frequently late
and were variable in their technical adequacy.''
   The GAO attributed some of the problems to the lengthy review
and revision process conducted by administration policy makers both
inside and outside the health field.
   More than 45 million elderly, disabled and poor Americans rely
on Medicare and Medicaid to pay for their health services. The
Health Care Financing Administration oversees the two programs.
   The financing administration also conducts research at the
request of Congress or the president when cutbacks or changes are
being contemplated, to determine their impact on health care.
Recent studies, for example, have examined the Medicare prospective
payment system for hospitals and state regulations on Medigap
policies that insure people for services uncovered by Medicare.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on human resources, said the GAO report
raises serious questions about how important decisions affecting
health care are made.
   ``If policies are made on the basis of inadequate or misleading
information, or if the information needed is not provided on time,
then we can expect health care to deteriorate,'' Weiss, who
requested the report, said in a statement.
   The GAO said concerns about the quality of Health Care Financing
Administration research had been expressed since 1980 by Congress,
congressional agencies, the Department of Health and Human
Services, and others. It said quality had not improved much in the
last eight years.
   Part of the reason, the GAO said, was that Congress was
mandating more and more studies while the administration was
reducing the health care agency's staff and resources.
   The GAO studied three areas and made the following comments:
   _Relevance. The office said that reports to Congress suffered
from a combination of vague mandates, lack of formal communications
between lawmakers and researchers, and administration reviewers who
deleted relevant information on the basis of policy considerations.
   _Timeliness. The GAO found that of 28 reports due before the
summer of 1986, 26 were delivered late or were still overdue. The
lateness was attributed primarily to a review-revision cycle
involving officials at the health care financing agency, the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of
Management and Budget. Reviews ``often have lasted for months or
even years,'' the agency said.
   _Technical quality of research. More than one-third of the
projects awarded by the health care financing agency in one year
were disapproved by review panels on the basis of technical
inadequacy, the GAO found. This was blamed on a flawed award
process and a finding that ``a technical perspective did not always
dominate reviews'' by the health care financing agency, the
Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of
Management and Budget.
   The deputy administrator of the health care financing agency,
Glenn Hackbarth, denied that his agency has been improperly
influenced by policy considerations.
   ``Obviously, on policy issues, we do have a policy perspective
that we advocate. I don't think that's unfair,'' he said. ``I do
not think there are instances where we have tried to mislead
Congress by deleting relevant, factual, technical information.''
   Hackbarth said that Congress, rather than the review process, is
to blame for tardy reports. He said lawmakers require long lists of
studies without considering the money or staff available to do them.
   ``It should be no surprise to anyone that there are more studies
than there are resources and the end result is late reports,'' he
said.
   Hackbarth admitted that his agency has sometimes awarded grant
money to projects that are technically weak, but said it has been
done when the agency had virtually no alternative.
   ``We can either not do any research on a pressing problem or we
can decide to go ahead with a proposal that is not technically
everything we would like it to be,'' he said. ``Sometimes we do the
latter and I think it is entirely defensible.''
   The GAO report recommended a number of steps it believes the
Department of Health and Human Services should take, among them an
assessment of whether health care financing agency has enough staff
and resources to handle the reports mandated by Congress and sought
by the administration. It also said the department should develop a
formalized review process to ensure timely delivery of reports, and
make sure there is better communication between researchers and
lawmakers.

   An Airbus A320 jetliner carrying 127
people crashed into a forest during an air show in eastern France,
killing at least two people and injuring more than 80 others,
officials said.
   Rescue workers said 10 to 25 people were trapped inside the
battered fuselage, which tore a nearly 500-foot-long path through a
forest at the end of an airport runway, Agence France-Presse
reported.
   District government officials said two of the 82 injured people
were seriously hurt.
   The Air France jetliner was making a demonstration flight at an
air show, and many of its passengers were making their first
flight, district government officials said.
   The plane's wings were broken and the cockpit windows smashed.
The fuselage was blackened from smoke and was covered with white
foam that firefighters were using to prevent a fire, AFP said.
   The air show, which was expected to attract 30,000 people, was
held at Habsheim airport in Habsheim, a village of 3,600,
government officials said. It is about 15 miles from the
international airport of Mulhouse-Bale near the Swiss border.
   The twin-engine Airbus A320 is a new model that went into
service in April for Air France and British Airways.
   An official at the Ministry of Transport in Paris said the
accident occurred at 2:50 p.m. (8:50 a.m. EDT) while the plane was
flying at a low altitude near the Habsheim airport. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses said the aircraft struck some trees at the end of a
runway.
   ``It was about 20 meters (65 feet) above the ground with its
flaps and landing gear down when it clipped some trees at the end
of the runway and crashed in the forest,'' Bernard Labalette, an
amateur pilot who was near the scene of the crash, was quoted by
AFP as saying.
   Other witnesses said they heard a series of explosions after the
crash.
   Labalette was quoted as saying that rescue workers had a
difficult time reaching the scene of the accident because it was in
the middle of a forest.
   A 25-year-old woman passenger who did not give her name was
quoted by AFP as saying she heard trees brush against the fuselage
after the aircraft flew over the airport.
   ``From then on things went fast,'' she said. ``The plane hit the
ground hard and we had the feeling of an abrupt jolt. Then there
was a fire in the front of the aircraft.''
   Flight attendants deployed evacuation chutes and the woman said
she and other passengers slid down them and ran from the aircraft
because they feared an explosion.
   According to the officials in the government office, who are not
named under French practice, the pilot, Michel Asseline, and the
co-pilot survived the crash ``shaken up but not injured.''
   The Airbus A320 can carry 168 passengers. Airbus Industrie, its
manufacturer, has 500 orders to purchase the craft.
   According to Airbus officials, the plane was delivered to Air
France last Thursday.
   ``We are disturbed, shocked and saddened,'' said Airbus press
spokesman Robert Alizart in Toulouse, where the aircraft is
manufactured.
   He said a team of experts from Airbus would be sent to the site
to determine the cause of the crash.
   He said it was too early to say whether the future of the
aircraft could be put in doubt.
   The plane, built by a European consortium led by its French and
German partners, received its certification Feb. 26.
   It is the first aircraft equipped with electronic flight system
and controls that are beside the pilot instead of in front of him.
It consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar two or three engine
jets it is designed to replace.

   The Communist Party conference opening Tuesday
could play a role in changing the nature of the party and making it
more responsive to the people than it has been since it came to
power in 1917.
   Proposals to be discussed at the 19th All-Union Party Conference
could, if accepted by delegates, limit the power of the
20-million-member organization and that of its general secretary
and chief reformer, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is high time party workers stopped doing the work of
economic managers and stopped interfering in day-to-day production
activity,'' Gorbachev told Leningrad party workers in October.
Instead, he said, the party should focus on politics and ideology.
   The party has been searching its soul since Gorbachev launched
his ``perestroika,'' or restructuring, program in April 1985. The
results are proposals that sociologist and Gorbachev supporter
Tatyana Zaslavskaya has said would have caused ``mass shock'' three
years ago.
   The conference is expected to examine the possible reforms,
called ``theses,'' that could shift the party's focus _ from
running the day-to-day Soviet economy and bureaucracy to a more
purely political role of winning the people's hearts and minds.
   The reforms are aimed at eliminating the heavy-handed,
centralized administration introduced by dictator Josef Stalin in
the 1920s and at dismantling the ``cult of personality'' associated
with almost every Soviet leader since then.
   If conference members support the suggested legal reforms, their
party would be more open to the people than it has been since
taking power in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
   Many of the new theses are designed to revive the days when
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin led the revolution and created a Communist
Party that set general policy and left day-to-day affairs to a
network of soviets, or local governing councils.
   Today's Communist Party does much more _ it administers the
government, fills bureaucratic posts and tells workers what to do.
Since Stalin instituted five-year economic plans in 1928, party
officials have set production quotas and pressured everyone, from
government ministers to factory and farm managers, to meet them.
   The proposed theses say the party's new assignment is to ``work
out a theory and strategy of social development, domestic and
foreign policy and the ideology of socialist rejuvenation.''
   Theses to be examined at the conference include:
   _Encouraging freer debates at party meetings, where the party
leader now speaks first and delegates rarely offer criticisms or
suggestions of their own.
   _Tightening party membership requirements to draw only ``really
worthy people with superior political, moral and business
qualities,'' and reviewing all 20 million members.
   Sociologist Zaslavskaya has complained the proposal doesn't make
clear who is to conduct this review, and warns of possible abuses.
   _Expansion of multi-candidate elections, conducted by secret
ballot, for officials to the Central Committee.
   Another proposal is designed to make officials more accountable
for their work by limiting party officials to two, five-year terms,
and legislators to one, five-year term. The new proposal could
limit the term of Gorbachev himself, as the party's general
secretary.
   The limit on terms is bound to anger officials who spent years
accumulating power and privilege. In 1961, the late premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev persuaded the party to pass a similar rule, and it
contributed to his ouster three years later. The rule was later
revoked.

<HEAD>League of Women Voters Starting Postcard Campaign to Get Debates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The League of Women Voters is starting a
nationwide postcard-writing campaign to try to get the 1988
presidential candidates to agree to debate under its sponsorship.
   Two postcards, one addressed to Republican George Bush and one
to Democrat Michael Dukakis, are being sent to league members with
an accompanying letter from Nancy Neuman, chairwoman of the group's
education fund.
   ``The shameless attempt by the two parties to `steal' the
debates threatens more than the league,'' the letter said. ``It
threatens the voters.''
   The postcards urge the two likely nominees to commit to the
league's general election debates. The league is asking its members
to mail the postcards to the two candidates.
   The group has sponsored presidential debates since 1976, but
this year has been fighting with the Democratic and Republican
parties which are holding their own debates.
   Dan Schnur, a Bush spokesman, said, ``We will wait and see what
the two parties decide. We are not closing any options.''
   ``I know we are committed to the Democratic National Committee
and Republican National Committee debates,'' said Steve Akey, a
Dukakis spokesman. ``At this point that is all we have committed
to.''
   Both the league and the parties are proposing three debates for
the presidential candidates and one for the vice presidential
candidates.
   The league has announced debates in Birmingham, Ala.;
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn.; Boston and Los Angeles. The parties
announced debates in Annapolis, Md.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; Omaha,
Neb.; and Pittsburgh.

   ``Meese is a Pig,'' a slogan first plastered
on construction fences, building walls and traffic signal boxes in
the nation's capital, has turned into a thriving enterprise that
can't keep up with demand.
   T-shirts calling for the ouster of Attorney General Edwin Meese
III are the hottest-selling item ever stocked by Common Concerns, a
downtown Washington bookstore, manager David Marcuse says. He
estimated that about 1,000 of them have been sold so far.
   The T-shirts are produced by a group of about 60 punk rock
musicians and fans, who say they got into the business after they
were arrested for putting up posters with the ``Meese is a Pig''
slogan in places where no posting is allowed.
   Group members say they decided to sell T-shirts to get out their
message in another way and to raise money to cover their legal
expenses.
   ``We weren't intending to become a T-shirt fashion fad,'' said
Mark Andersen, spokesman for the group.
   To date, only one member of the group is making the shirts, and
Andersen said that ``he goes to sleep, gets up and makes T-shirts,
goes to sleep, gets up and makes T-shirts.''
   The business got some free publicity last week after a bicycle
messenger reported that he had not been admitted into the Justice
Department because he was wearing the shirt.
   But by the end of the week, the Justice Department said it would
allow people wearing the shirt inside the building.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said in an interview
this weekend that the department doesn't take the T-shirts too
seriously.
   ``I know it's hard to believe, but we spend 13, 14 hours a day
thinking about serious matters involving law enforcement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Drives Out Iranian Force From Marsh Area</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY8</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said its troops Sunday drove out the
last Iranian occupiers from its southern Howeizah marshes. Iran
claimed Iraq used poison gas in the battle and in another attack,
killing 60 people and injuring 4,000.
   The marshes were held by Iran since 1984 and were Iran's last
foothold in southern Iraq. It was Iraq's third major land victory
since April in the nearly 8-year-old war, and President Saddam
Hussein was quoted as calling it ``the last of the difficult
battles'' and predicting ``final victory soon.''
   Iraqi officers who took part in an assault Saturday said
paratroopers were dropped behind Iranian lines to cut them off
while ground forces moved eastward.
   The Iraqi 3rd Army Corps, spearheaded by units of the elite
Presidential Guard, drove the Iranians back across the border and
pursued them into Iran.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a
military communique as saying the Iraqi forces withdrew into Iraq
on Sunday.
   Fighting still raged Sunday in the marshes east of the Tigris
River and 80 miles north of Basra. But by all accounts the main
battle was over.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, acknowledged that Iraqis had ``gained control'' of the
Majnoon islands in the swamplands and pushed its forces out of the
Majnoon sector.
   But it charged the Iraqis seized the islands through ``extensive
use of chemical weapons to force Iran's combatants to retreat.''
   IRNA said that Iraqi warplanes also dropped bombs containing
nerve, cyanide and mustard gases Saturday near the southwestern oil
city of Ahvaz, 60 miles east of the marshes, killing 60 people and
injuring 4,000.
   The Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified ``authoritative source''
in Baghdad as denying chemicals weapons were used.
   Iraqi military communiques Saturday said fighter-bombers
attacked military targets southwest of Ahvaz to prevent Iran from
moving up troops to reinforce its beleaguered Majnoon garrison.
   Iran has repeatedly accused Iraqi of using chemical weapons in
the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. Chemical weapons were outlawed under
a 1925 Geneva treaty.
   Iran claimed its anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi jet
Saturday. Iraq denied losing any planes.
   The Iraqis, displaying a new aggressiveness after six years of
defensive warfare, recaptured the Faw Peninsula in southern Iraq on
April 18 and drove the Iranians out of a bridgehead east of the
port city of Basra on May 25.
   IRNA said Iranian fighter-bombers attacked Iraqi troop
concentrations and strongpoints around Majnoon on Sunday,
``inflicting heavy casualties and losses.''
   The Iraqi agency said that the 6th Army Corps launched a
secondary offensive in the Howeizah sector Sunday, mopping up
pockets of Iranian resistance and overrunning ``sand embankments''
built by the Iranians as a last line of defense near the border.
   The new push ``ended the enemy presence'' in the region, the
Iraqi agency quoted a military communique as saying.
   The Iraqis claimed ``large numbers'' of Iranians were killed or
wounded in the Majnoon fighting, with more than 2,000 captured
along with ``big quantities'' of weapons and other equipment.
   The loss of the Majnoon islands, a network of sandy islets
linked by earthen causeways and pontoon bridges in the
1,000-square-mile marshes, means Iran's only bridgehead remaining
in Iraq is territory Iran seized in the northern Kurdistan
mountains in recent months.
   Western military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Iraqis heavily outnumbered the Iranian defenders in
Majnoon.

<HEAD>Jackson, Dukakis Forces Talk Party Unity in Agreeing on Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats headed home early Sunday after producing
the party's shortest platform in decades in a spirit of harmony
that left Jesse Jackson's forces talking unity and Michael Dukakis'
campaign satisfied there was nothing in the document to embarrass
the likely nominee.
   The Democratic Platform Committee wrapped up work in a marathon
session Saturday night on a party blueprint for what it calls ``The
Restoration of Competence and Hope.''
   Michael Dukakis's delegates easily turned aside Jackson efforts
to add planks that would have committed the Democrats to raise
taxes on the wealthy, freeze the Pentagon budget, double education
spending, commit the United States to no-first-use of nuclear
weapons, and call for Palestinian self-determination.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said Sunday no
decisions had been made on which if any of the issues Jackson will
fight for on the floor of next month's convention in Atlanta.
   She said Jackson himself must make that decision, taking into
account not only gains he made on both the party's platform and
rules for 1992, but ``how he sees his own future politically.''
   As it stands, the broad-brush, moderate platform makes no
dollars-and-cents promises, but vows the Democrats will ``restore
competence, caring and incorruptibility'' to Washington and
``reverse seven years of `voodoo economics,' `trickle down'
policies and fiscal irresponsibility.''
   ``There's nothing in the document with which he disagrees,''
said Dukakis issues director Christopher Edley, who observed that
on issues such as acid rain, health care and defense the platform
is less specific than the Massachusetts governor has been.
   But if the entire platform was tailored to suit Dukakis, many
passages also bore Jackson's stamp, from its call for an indexed
minimum wage to its declaration that South Africa is a terrorist
state to a slap at corporate raiders and to a commitment to
same-day and mail-in voter registration.
   ``Although we have differences ... about 95 percent of all the
issues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolved
in a peaceful and in a unified way, and I know that scares the
Republicans to death,'' former Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher
said late Saturday shortly before the panel finished its work.
   It was Hatcher who offered the first minority amendment
Saturday: a shotgun Jackson budget plan that would have raised the
tax rate on 600,000 upper-income Americans from 28 to 50 percent
and frozen the Pentagon budget for five years. It went down,
108-44, in the only stand-up vote the committee took.
   The committee handled without rancor nearly a score of other
amendments by voice votes, rejecting some key Jackson stands but
accepting others, including ones calling for Third World debt
relief and significant increases in child care aid for low- and
middle-income families.
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the party chairman, exulted that the Platform
Committee had followed his instructions to avoid ``a litany of
social, cultural or ideological buzzwords.''
   ``Common sense politics has given us a short statement of
principle all Democrats can run on in November,'' Kirk said in a
statement from Washington.
   Mike Barnes, the former Maryland congressman who led Dukakis's
platform team, told reporters that in working on the past four
party platforms, ``I have never seen a situation that was anywhere
near this united.''
   He said it showed ``the Democratic party really has matured and
is ready to take the reins of government.''
   ``There may be in Atlanta some further discussion of these
issues,'' Barnes predicted. ``That's normal. But I'm confident that
if there is, it will be done in the same spirit we saw here in
Denver.''
   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor and former
chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said
Jackson lost on the centerpiece of his campaign, the budget plan
for tax hikes and a military freeze, but won on the second most
important issue: South Africa.
   She said some of the issues it lost on were ``important but not
central'' to Jackson's campaign, but she declined to be specific.
   In weighing floor fights, she said, ``We ought to look at the
effect it will have on the convention itself. Will it be divisive
for no important reason? Is it worth the trade-off in divisiveness?
... (Does) the issue need the open and visible support of a
convention or ... would it only be icing?
   ``There have indeed been significant differences between Jesse
Jackson and Michael Dukakis during this campaign,'' she said.
``Those did not evaporate at Mackinac and Denver. What did happen,
however, is that the governor and the reverend in these proceedings
moved closer together.''
   The committee staff was still working Sunday to finalize the
language of the amended platform, which will not be final until
approved by the convention in Atlanta on July 19.
   But it was expected to run around 4,000 words _ a tenth the size
of the 1980 and 1984 platforms and the shortest since the terse
platforms that Franklin D. Roosevelt ran on in 1932 and 1936.

<HEAD>Police Search For Clues In Singleton Home Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police were scrutinizing remnants of a crude
homemade bomb tossed at the home of rapist Lawrence Singleton's
brother, but had no idea Sunday who hurled the explosive in a
normally quiet Tampa suburb.
   Walter Singleton and his wife, Dianne, were alone in their house
when the bomb exploded Saturday night in their front yard, about 30
feet from the front door, said Hillsborough County sheriff's
spokesman Debbie Carter. They were uninjured.
   Bomb squad experts were looking for fingerprints and other clues
Sunday on bomb bits picked out of the lawn, she said.
   ``Our bomb squad has the fragments that are left; we think it
was a homemade device,'' she said. ``We found pieces of cardboard
and duct tape. We're processing them so hopefully we'll be able to
tell something from that.'''
   There were no arrests by midday Sunday, and no one saw the bomb
tossed.
   Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker,
chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead in a
ditch southeast of San Francisco in 1978. The girl survived.
   A 60-year-old former merchant seaman who grew up in Tampa,
Lawrence Singleton spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in a
California prison.
   He completed a year-long probation and is now free to live where
he pleases. During his probation, he was forced to live in a
trailer on the grounds of San Quentin prison grounds because of
bitter protest in several communities that were proposed as homes
for him.
   The blast left an impression about four feet across in the yard,
but no damage to the house that Singleton listed with state
officials as his Florida address, said sheriff's Maj. Ron
Poindexter.
   ``At first we thought it was a lightning bolt, then we looked
out of our window and saw smoke,'' said neighbor Harrie Grimes.
   Neighbors happened to see a red vehicle in the area, but
authorities don't know if it was the same one from which the bomb
was hurled, Ms. Carter said.
   Since Lawrence Singleton registered his brother's address with
the state, neighbors have been frightened and upset. A local
businessman and a radio station have each offered Singleton $5,000
if he will pack up and go anywhere else.
   Walter Singleton says his brother lives ``about two hours away''
from here, but refuses to say exactly where.
   Ms. Carter said it was unclear if the bombing would further
upset residents of the Forest Hills neighborhood.
   ``It's too early to tell if this is going to add fuel to the
fire, so to speak,'' she said. ``We have patrols in the area that
make periodic checks on Mr. Singleton's home.''

<TEXT>
   Two years ago, an editor besieged by Jim
Fitts' letters to his newspaper suggested that the retired
agriculture teacher start up his own publication to voice his
opinions.
   Fitts took the advice, and today his fledgling weekly is in the
midst of a legal battle involving First Amendment rights.
   Fitts, the 62-year-old editor of Williamsburg County's The Voice
newspaper, not only stirred up the political powers that be in this
poor, rural county of some 40,000 people. His denunciation of two
politicians and subsequent arrest on criminal libel charges caught
the attention of journalists around the country.
   Fitts has gone to jail once and could go again for expressing
his opinion in a newspaper. He awaits word Monday on whether he has
been indicted by a Williamsburg County grand jury on criminal libel
charges.
   If indicted and convicted, he faces a fine of up to $5,000 and a
year in jail.
   ``Clearly, we've got a political commentator making a political
statement about two politicians,'' said Jane Kirtley, executive
director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in
Washington. ``It seems to me that punishing someone for speaking is
not an American concept.''
   But Fitts' targets see something more in the caustic column he
wrote before the June 14 primary elections.
   State Rep. B.J. Gordon and state Sen. Frank McGill say Fitts'
attacks, in which he accuses them of stealing and corruption
without offering evidence, are lying, hurtful shots that deserve to
be punished.
   ``Freedom of the press is not to go around with freedom and
accuse people of committing crimes,'' Gordon said.
   The two politicians have brought what is believed to be only the
fourth criminal libel suit in South Carolina in 40 years, and the
first in the nation since 1984.
   Although civil libel cases are not unusual and often result in
the awarding of monetary damages to the aggrieved party, criminal
libel cases are rare because they can send a journalist to jail.
   Fitts, who spent 13 years as an agriculture teacher in Dillon
and North Myrtle Beach and 20 years as Clemson University's
agricultural extension agent in Williamsburg County, retired in
1986 and began sending letters to the county's only newspaper over
a controversial school board issue.
   After a while, he said, the editor suggested Fitts needed his
own paper to publish his opinions.
   ``I said, `That's a good idea; I hadn't thought about that,'''
he recalled in an interview Thursday.
   Roughly six months later, in January 1987, a new weekly began
rolling off the presses, and from the beginning it expressed Fitts'
outspoken style.
   ``I've always been opinionated,'' he said. ``I just have an
opinion and I have no problem sharing it.''
   He may have a problem sharing it for a while, however. The judge
who set his bond also put him under a gag order forbidding him to
discuss his arrest. He spent a weekend in jail under $40,000 bond
before he was released on his own recognizance.
   Gordon and McGill think Fitts crossed the line with a May 17
column, in which he wrote: ``I will say to you, without fear of
contradiction, if every black in Williamsburg County would start
stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives,
they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their
time in power.''
   The column gave no specifics, and when asked what he thought
they had stolen, he said only that they had taken the pride of
people of Williamsburg County.
   He stressed that he was not apologizing for what he wrote but
acknowledged that he could have chosen his words better.
   ``I'm not trained as a journalist. I don't know how to polish
things,'' he said. ``Maybe if I had polished it, I could have
gotten it across better.''
   Fitts, who is black, has said that the dispute with the two
politicians is economic, not racial. Gordon is black and McGill is
white. The Voice, with a circulation of 2,300, has a largely black
readership.
   Despite what people like Kirtley say, Gordon and McGill's lawyer
said the criminal libel law is still a good one.
   ``I don't think the press has been fair in the matter,'' said
attorney Wallace Connor. ``I can understand ... they want to
protect themselves.
   ``There is a statute in this state against libel and slander.
They (the media) say that it's antiquated, but as long as it's a
law, it ought to be obeyed,'' Connor said.
   ``Also, if it's antiquated, the Ten Commandments are antiquated,
because they were written 5,000 years ago and it says `Thou shalt
not bear false witness,''' he said.

<HEAD>Most Children Entering Chicago Public Schools Lack Basic Skills,
Survey Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half the children who enter the Chicago public
school system are unable to say their first and last names or to
speak in complete simple sentences, a new survey of kindergarten
teachers indicates.
   Also, most of the youngsters are also unable to identify basic
shapes such as squares and circles, hold a pencil or crayon
correctly, sit still to listen to a brief story, or settle disputes
without physical aggression, the survey found.
   The findings, published Sunday in the Chicago Sun-Times,
resulted from a poll in late May by the newspaper indicating that
Chicago's public schools are overwhelmed with many low-income
children who start kindergarten unprepared for basic classroom
learning.
   ``The sad thing is, these kids are not only illiterate _ they're
incompetent,'' said philanthropist Irving Harris, who has sponsored
innovative pre-school programs for families at the Robert Taylor
Homes public housing project.
   ``There's a difference,'' Harris said. ``You don't have to be
literate to have common sense sense and be able to do things.''
   The newspaper also surveyed kindergarten teachers in the
affluent suburb of Wilmette, where the vast majority of children
entering their classes could perform all of the basic tasks.
   The survey also found that the overwhelming majority of Wilmette
kindergartners had been read to by their parents and taken to a
zoo, library or museum, but most Chicago kindergartners had not
enjoyed those experiences.
   Based on estimates given by their teachers, 51 percent of
Chicago kindergartners percent could not tell both their first and
last names, compared with only 3 percent in Wilmette; 52 percent in
Chicago could not speak in complete sentences, compared with 8
percent in Wilmette; and 59 percent in Chicago could not identify a
square, circle and triangle, compared with 18 percent in Wilmette,
the newspaper said.
   Half to nearly three-fourths of the Chicago kindergartners also
could not indentify primary colors, draw a recognizable human
figure, or tell a story with a beginning, middle and end.
   Teachers were asked to give the total number of children they
teach and then estimate what percentage could do various things at
the beginning of the school year.
   Chicago Schools Supt. Manford Byrd Jr. said the results
reflected ``a failed social policy,'' in which the schools are
expected to make up for the neglect and lack of support low-income
families face. The survey proved that there should be more state
support for pre-school programs for children from low-income
families, he said.
   In Chicago, 74 percent of the pupils in the survey were from
low-income families, compared with only 4 percent in Wilmette.
   The Sun-Times said it conducted a random sampling May 20 to 26
of Chicago kindergarten teachers, receiving responses from 196 of
the 285 teachers who were sent questionnaires. Those responding
teach 7,122 children, or 24 percent of the citywide kindergarten
enrollment.
   Four of the six kindergarten teachers in Wilmette responded to
the 45-item questionnaire. The newspaper did not estimate a margin
of error for the survey.

   The Boy Scouts have rescued this isolated
city from the possibility that it would run out of drinking water
by the end of a drought-baked summer.
   A 2-mile-long, 8-inch pipeline, planned to be finished in a few
weeks, will link a Boy Scout camp reservoir with an undersized,
rundown municipal water system. The Scouts are letting the town
have the water for free.
   ``It gets a little thirsty around here when it doesn't rain,''
Alan Birket, city water supervisor, said last week.
   The Scout organization agreed to help last October after the
town of about 5,000 in a coastal valley 120 miles north of San
Francisco declared a state of emergency. Officials expected the
city's reservoir to run out by Thanksgiving.
   A convoy of trucks from a variety of government agencies hauled
in pipe loaned by the state. Forklifts from private companies
unloaded it. Workers from the state conservation youth corps began
clamping it together. All was at no cost to the ranching community
in Mendocino County.
   Then the rains came, so the pipeline was left unfinished.
However, only two-thirds of the normal 50 inches fell, not enough
to ward off fears that the city could run dry this summer.
   Now the city plans to finish the pipeline and begin pumping
water before its reservoir is drawn too far down.
   But some folks think the pipeline should already have been
completed in Willits, the only California city that's declared a
state of emergency because of the drought.
   ``People are always talking about it. It's not even finished.
It's just sitting out there,'' said Kelli Fuller, a 30-year-old
waitress at Mom's Place on Main Street, which is also U.S. 101.
   People aren't really worried, though, she added, plunking down
glasses of water for two customers who hadn't asked for them, in
violation of voluntary city conservation rules. She explained, with
a shrug, ``It's hot today.''
   Water conservation will shift from voluntary to mandatory
Friday, city Manager Bill Van Orden said. People who wash cars or
hose driveways can be fined $500. Sprinklers also will be shut off
at some city parks.
   ``If you waste water, you have neighbors telling on you,'' he
said.
   Voluntary measures, Van Orden said, have cut average daily water
usage significantly because ``the city officials asking for
cutbacks are residents' next-door neighbors, not people they don't
know _ like in larger cities.''
   ``We're all running around with dirty cars and not watering our
yards in the daytime,'' said Elin Crawford, an adult education
teacher.
   The drought has worsened water problems Willits already faced,
but the city is working to ensure that the headaches don't persist.
The city has secured $3.3 million in state loans to improve its
water system and expand its reservoir.

   Soviet Jews demanding the right to emigrate
gathered on a Moscow street Sunday, but within minutes their
posters were ripped down and police took away the group's leader.
   Yuri Semenovsky and about 10 other Soviet Jews came to the
Arbat, a bustling pedestrian mall in central Moscow, to protest
legislation they say prevents them from leaving the country.
   Soviet officials say the only bar to emigration is knowledge of
state secrets, but Semenovsky and the others said they cannot leave
because of a law requiring documentation that they don't owe money
to relatives or ex-spouses.
   A law passed in August 1986 requires that the documentation be
provided by would-be emigrants' relatives. Semenovsky said Soviet
citizens have no legal way to make a relative provide such
information.
   ``The courts are no help,'' said the former mathematician, who
lost his job when he applied to leave the country more than two
years ago. ``They have been told not to get involved in cases
involving refuseniks. More than 200,000 Soviet Jews want to leave,
but can't.''
   At 4 p.m., Semenovsky and the others, members of a refusenik
group called the Poor Relatives, assembled in front of a building
on the Arbat. They taped four small posters on the wooden fence
that surrounds the building.
   One read: ``If you want to know the truth about refuseniks, and
not the usual lies and filth from the newspapers and Central
Television, read the informational leaflet from the `Poor
Relatives' Group.''
   Scores of Soviets assembled to scan the posters.
   Ten minutes after the posters went up, two men dressed in
civilian clothes ripped them down, walked away and threw them into
the trash.
   A water truck usually used to hose down Soviet streets passed
close to the group clustered around the posters, forcing them
closer to the wooden fence.
   ``It's the KGB,'' said Semenovsky.
   A police lieutenant came up to Semenovsky and asked him to
accompany him to a district court. Semenovsky asked if he was being
detained.
   ``I invite you to accompany me because of administrative
violations you have committed,'' the policeman said.
   ``What violations?'' Semenovsky asked.
   ``You know very well,'' the lieutenant said.
   Semenovsky refused to go, and the lieutenant left.
   A few minutes later, four uniformed police officers picked their
way through the scores of people who had gathered around the
demonstrators and grabbed Semenovsky.
   The policemen held the refusenik tightly under the arms as they
took him to a small green sedan. He was then driven away.
   Jewish emigration last month from the Soviet Union reached
1,145, its highest monthly total in seven years, but Jewish
activists say tens of thousands of Soviet Jews have had their
applications for an exit visa rejected.
   Semenovsky has said he cannot get an affadavit from his former
wife, Galina, that attests he does not owe her any money. He said
he tried three times to get Soviet courts to force her to give him
the document but that the courts refused.
   On Saturday, about 200 people refused to allow police to break
up a demonstration on Moscow's Pushkin Square by the Democratic
Union, a recently created group that wants to challenge the
political monopoly of the Communist Party.
   At least three people were detained by police at that protest.
Also Saturday, 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and dissident Andrei
D. Sakharov joined former political prisoners and leading Soviet
intellectuals at an officially condoned rally in north Moscow to
demand a monument to the victims of Josef V. Stalin's purges.
   Authorities have announced they will take tough measures during
the nationwide Communist Party conference, which begins Tuesday, to
prevent unauthorized demonstrations in Moscow.
   ``I don't expect the party conference to deal with the problem
of Soviet Jews,'' Semenovsky said before his arrest. ``They have
said they will deal with ethnic relations, but not with our
emigration problem.''

   The national YWCA, facing a court battle over a
Washington state chapter's decision to hire a man as a leader, has
voted to retain the all-female status it has held for 130 years,
its national president said Sunday.
   But the organization's board of directors postponed a vote on
whether to expel the Tacoma, Wash., chapter for hiring a man as
executive director, said President Glendora McIlwain Putnam.
   The chapter has sued to remain a part of the national
organization, which concluded its 31st national convention Sunday
at a downtown hotel.
   At the five-day meeting, an estimated 1,200 delegates from local
chapters across the country voted overwhelmingly to continue to
exclude men as full voting members, Ms. Putnam said.
   ``It is now more important than ever that the YWCA remain an
autonomous women's membership movement because of the serious
challenges which confront women in the areas of employment,
housing, child-care and poverty,'' she said.
   ``The YWCA's position is an affirmative response to inequity and
disparity which continue to be the rule rather than the
exception,'' she said.
   The Young Women's Christian Association in the United States was
founded in 1858 as an organization exclusively for women, partly to
address the problems of housing, poverty-level wages and
educational opportunities for young women who flocked to cities
during the Industrial Revolution.
   ``The fundamental focus of our organization has been the same
... the empowerment of women and girls ... making them more in
control of their lives,'' Ms. Putnam said.
   Under the group's constitution, men can participate as
associates, but not as full, voting members. The constitution also
says that executive directors should be full, voting members, said
spokeswoman Claire Carroll.
   Earlier this year, the Odgen, Utah, chapter became the first in
the country to lose its affiliation for allowing men to join as
full members. The chapter still has time to reconsider its action
before it is barred from using the YWCA name and logo, Ms. Putnam
said.
   Although recent court decisions have forced several formerly
all-male groups such as the Jaycees to admit women, Ms. Putnam said
she does not consider the YWCA policy discriminatory.
   Those earlier court rulings have been aimed at allowing women
into places ``where business is discussed,'' she said.
   ``We're not a marketplace issue. We don't come to the YWCA to
discuss business,'' Ms. Putnam said. Rather, the YWCA offers
services aimed solely at women, such as child-care, programs for
battered women and fitness classes, she said.
   ``Women need a place where they can be comfortable expressing
their problems, their fears, the way they face the world. They need
to discuss it with other women,'' she said.
   Pene Modahl, president of the Tacoma chapter's board of
directors, has said that hiring Alan Tiger as executive director
will not hurt that goal. She called him ``the best possible
candidate, who happened to be a man.''
   The Tacoma chapter filed suit June 10 in Pierce County, Wash.,
Superior Court seeking to bar the national board from expelling it.
   Ms. Putnam said she did not know when the board would vote on
whether to expel the chapter, but guessed that it might happen at
the next board meeting in October.
   Tiger, 36, who was hired in May, has vowed that the chapter will
retain its commitment to women. ``We have to ask ourselves, when in
the women's movement do we stop talking about men and women and
start to talk about humanity?'' he said.

Clashes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bomb destroyed a Palestinian leader's
car Sunday and killed his two young sons in south Lebanon.
Dissident Palestinian guerrillas stormed a Beirut refugee camp in
clashes with Yasser Arafat's faction.
   Police said eight people were killed and 14 wounded as Arafat's
loyalists and Syrian-backed dissidents of Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising faction fought with mortars and rockets in the
Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh shantytowns.
   By police count, 120 people have been killed and 516 wounded
since the power struggle for control of the camps in Beirut's
southern outskirts flared May 1.
   Police said artillery duels raged from dawn to dusk, when the
dissidents stormed Chatilla, capturing two of their four bases
seized by Arafat's Fatah faction a month ago.
   In the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp outside the southern port of
Sidon, the two sons of Mohammed Mrad, a central committee member of
the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, were killed in the car bomb, police reported.
   They were identified as Ali, 13, and Mazen, 6. Police said the
bomb exploded when Ali turned on the ignition of his father's
Mercedes outside the family home.
   A Democratic Front statement charged that Israel's Mossad secret
service was behind the attack.
   Mossad has been blamed for the assassination in April of
Arafat's military commander, Khalil Wazir, in Tunis, and for the
killings of three of his senior officers in Limassol, Cyprus, in
February.
   In Beirut, two neutral guerrilla factions, the Democratic Front
and the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
condemned Mousa's offensive as ``a total, systematic obliteration''
of the camps.
   The two groups in a joint statement called on Syria to
``intervene to put an end to the tragedy of the two camps.''
   Among Sunday's victims were two Syrian soldiers killed and
another wounded when a stray shell hit a checkpoint they were
manning near Bourj el-Barajneh, police reported.
   In the Beirut camps, witnesses said many residents fled during a
lull in fighting Saturday, packing their belongings and seeking
safety in Moslem west Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Mousa and other radical factions opposed to Arafat's policies
broke away from the Palestine Liberation Organization in a 1983
Syrian-backed mutiny.
   But the Democratic Front and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine rejoined the PLO in 1987.
   The radical factions, opposed to any negotiations with Israel,
have bitterly condemned a statement by Bassam Abu Sharif, a close
Arafat aide, saying the PLO would recognize Israel in return for
direct peace talks.
   Information Minister Mohammed Salman of Syria said in Damascus
on Saturday that his country, the main power broker in Lebanon,
will not intervene ``materially'' to end the Palestinian feuding.
   Syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west and
south Beirut. But troops who surround the two refugee camps have
made no move to stop the fighting.
   The battles have flared despite a reconciliation between Arafat,
the PLO chairman, and President Hafez Assad of Syria last April to
end a 5-year-old feud over who would control the Palestinian
movement.
   The movement seeks an independent homeland for Palestinians.

   A moderate earthquake shook a wide area of
Southern California on Sunday, knocking bottles off shelves and
startling residents, but there were no reports of serious damage.
At least four people were treated for minor injuries.
   The quake, centered 3 miles north-northwest of here, struck at
8:04 a.m. and registered 4.5 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
said Robert Finn of the California Institute of Technology
Seismology Lab in Pasadena. Instruments at the U.S. Geological
Survey in Golden, Colo., recorded a slightly higher reading, 4.7.
   Upland, in San Bernardino County, is a city of about 50,000
people located 40 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``It felt really strong, like it wasn't going to stop. We've had
numerous people calling in,'' said Upland police dispatcher Judy
Jauregui. ``We've had a lot of audible alarms, but no damage.''
   The temblor was felt in downtown Los Angeles and as far away as
Saugus, some 70 miles northwest of the epicenter, and Palm Springs,
about 70 miles to the east. It was followed by several aftershocks.
   Hospitals in Upland and in Chino, a couple of miles south,
reported treating four persons for minor injuries. Pomona Valley
Community Hospital had to operate on emergency power for about 2}
hours when the quake knocked electricity out.
   ``We have units checking the city for damage,'' said Chino
Police officer Diane Ritter. ``It jolted pretty good here. We have
alarms going off all over.'' She said there no immediate reports of
serious damage.
   There were a few reports of broken windows and cracked stucco.
At the Ramona Village convenience store in Chino, bottles fell off
shelves.
   A dispatcher for the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said
she received 25 to 35 calls from rattled residents, but no reports
of damage or injuries.
   ``It was my first one,'' said the dispatcher, who recently moved
to California and declined to identify herself. ``It was just a
pretty big rumble. But nothing dropped down. I was kind of excited
that I finally felt one. I've been hearing about them for so long.
   ``I did get under my desk,'' she said. ``I was a good girl.''
   Earlier Sunday morning, a small quake was recorded in Northern
California, but there were no reports of injury or damage.
   The state Office of Emergency Services said the 12:54 a.m.
temblor registered 3.1 on the Richter scale, with an epicenter 7
miles north of Santa Clara. Santa Clara police said no one called
about the earthquake and it was not felt at the police station.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake measuring 3.5 on the scale can cause slight damage
in a populated area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   An East German couple was
pulled to safety from the Baltic Sea on Sunday after fleeing their
communist homeland in a small boat, officials said.
   A spokesman for the coastal border patrol in Bad Bramstedt north
of Hamburg said a West Germany rescue ship picked up the couple
after they slipped past East German coast patrols.
   The West German officials did not identify the couple, saying
only that the man was 34 and his wife 22 years old.
   The escape brings to more than 30 the number of people who have
fled East Berlin and East Germany to the West this year.

   Five armed men on Sunday kidnapped a
New York University professor who was visiting his homeland to give
a lecture, but they freed him unharmed 5{ hours later, police said.
   Professor Ralph Bultjens, 48, was pushed into a car outside his
Colombo home by the gunmen and driven away at about 4 p.m., said
police, speaking on condition of anonymity. He was released at 9:30
p.m., police said.
   They declined to say where Bultjens was freed or whether any
ransom was demanded or paid.
   No reason for the episode was given. Police said initially they
did not know if the gunmen belonged to a militant group. Later they
refused to answer questions.
   According to a man who answered the telephone at Bultjens' home,
the professor was picked up by police after his release and taken
to police headquarters for brief questioning.
   The man, who refused to identify himself, said Bultjens was back
in his house about an hour after he was released but did not want
to come to the telephone.
   Bultjens was in his homeland to deliver a lecture in honor of
opposition leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike's late husband, Solomon,
who was the prime minister of Sri Lanka in the late 1950s.
   The lecture was scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Bandaranaike
Memorial International Conference Hall.
   Police said earlier they were investigating whether Tamil
separatists or militant Sinhalese were involved in the abduction.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, are waging a guerrilla war in Sri
Lanka for more autonomy from the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who
control the government and military.
   Bultjens is neither a Tamil or a Sinhalese, but a member of the
minority ``Burgher'' community, made up of descendants of European
colonialists.
   The professor, a specialist in Asian studies, has been teaching
at New York University and the New School for Social Research in
New York City.
   His books include ``Tradition and Change in Modern Asia,'' ``The
Decline of Democracy'' and ``China After Mao.''
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka said they had no
information about the abduction.

   Hans Urs von Balthasar, a prominent
Swiss theologian whom Pope John Paul II appointed cardinal four
weeks ago, died Sunday, church officials said. He was 82.
   Bishop Otto Wuest of Basel, in a brief statement, said that with
von Balthasar, ``one of the century's greatest theologians,''
passed away.
   Cause of his death was not immediately announced. Von Balthasar
had been scheduled to leave for Rome on Monday to be elevated to
his new rank along with 24 other newly designated cardinals.
   Von Balthasar was born Aug. 12, 1905 in Lucerne. After studies
in Switzerland, Germany, and France, he was ordained in 1936.
Except for a brief period as religious caretaker of Swiss students
in the 1940s, he concentrated on writing theological works.
   His 1952 essay, ``The Razing of the Bastions,'' was considered
to be one of the most important works published in preparation of
the Second Vatican Council.
   After the 1963-65 council, however, he wrote texts that were
critical of conciliar reforms. Since then, he had been rated as
pro-conservative.
   His nomination May 29 by Pope John Paul II came as a surprise to
many Catholics. He told reporters that as an obedient member of the
church he accepted the honor but added that he had asked the
pontiff several years ago to ``spare me any titles.''
   Von Balthasar held honorary doctorates from the University of
Washington in St. Louis, Mo., and from universities in Edinburgh,
and Muenster and Freiburg, West Germany.
   There was no word on survivors or when funeral services were
scheduled.

   Four American Jews said Sunday after
returning from Vienna that they were beaten by Austrian police when
they demonstrated against Pope John Paul II's meetings with
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim.
   The four made the charge during a news conference at Ben Gurion
Airport and also said they encountered anti-Semitism from some
Austrians during their weekend of protests in Vienna.
   Rabbi Avi Weiss of the Riverdale Synagogue in New York said he
and three students were beaten by police after they displayed a
large photograph of Waldheim in a Nazi uniform at Mauthausen, a
former concentration camp that the pope visited.
   ``We felt the pope's visit to Mauthausen was obscene ... after
he embraced Waldheim whose hands are red with Jewish blood,'' Weiss
said. ``This is an effort by the pope to de-Judaize the Holocaust.''
   Jewish groups have complained that the pope did not mention Jews
during his visit to the former Nazi camp, though he mentioned by
name some Catholics who died there.
   Jewish organizations have charged that Waldheim, who was in the
German army in World War II, was involved in war crimes.
   He denies the allegations but was barred from visiting the
United States after the U.S. government found evidence Waldheim was
involved in deporting Balkan citizens during the war.
   The men with Weiss were Eyal Shenzer, leader of a Jewish student
group, Jacob Davidson, head of the Jewish Student Organization of
North America, and Glen Richter, coordinator of the New York
City-based Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.
   Hometowns for Shenzer and Davidson were not available.
   The four said they were cursed by Austrian citizens, some of
whom shouted ``Heil Hitler!'' when they demonstrated in Vienna. But
they said they also met Austrians who supported their views.

   Vigdis Finnbogadottir swept to a third
term as Iceland's president, overwhelmingly defeating another woman
for the post, according to final ballot results released Sunday.
   Mrs. Finnbogadottir had more than 94 percent of Saturday's vote
and her rival, Sigrun Thorsteinsdottir, garnered less than 6
percent.
   Election officials said about 75 percent of the 173,800 eligible
voters in the sparsely populated Atlantic island nation cast
ballots.
   Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir, who conceded defeat in a television
interview after polls closed Saturday, said the election had been a
great victory for all ``democratic and freedom-loving people in
Iceland'' as opposed to the ``autocratic and monarchist''
supporters of the establishment.
   President Finnbogadottir said in a television interview she was
delighted by the results and that any incumbent president would be
satisfied with such overwhelming support.
   Vigdis, as the president is popularly known among the 250,000
Icelanders, was the world's first democratically elected woman head
of state. She defeated three men in 1980.
   She was re-elected without opposition in 1984 and was host of
the Reykjavik superpower summit in October 1986.
   Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir has been active within the Humanist Party,
which so far has failed to get a representative elected to the
Althing, the world's oldest parliament.
   Mrs. Thorsteinsdottir ran on a platform of giving the
presidential office a more active role. Mrs. Finnbogadottir
maintained that the presidency was created as a ceremonial post and
should remain so.
   The real power in Iceland rests with the prime minister,
Thorsteinn Palsson.
   Saturday was the first time an incumbent president has faced a
re-election challenge since Iceland, formerly under Danish rule,
became a republic in 1944.

guy'' Hollywood roles, gave audiences at Portugal's leading film
festival a down-to-earth view of acting.
   ``You turn up at the right time, say the lines you're told to,
then go home,'' Mitchum, 71, replied to a question last week on how
he interpreted a role.
   Then he elaborated. ``Sometimes they ask you to say the lines
louder or softer,'' he added at a news conference at the fourth
annual Troia Film Festival at a resort about 30 miles south of
Lisbon.
   Danny Huston, son of the late American director John Huston,
also attended the festival for the screening of ``Mr. North,'' his
debut as a feature film director. The film stars Mitchum in a role
that was to have been played by John Huston.
   Debbie Harry, vocalist with the 1970s New York pop group
Blondie, was another guest at the festival. ``Hairspray,'' a film
in which she plays the ambitious mother of a 1960s Baltimore``hair
hopper,'' was showed.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Move On From Nuclear Policy To AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Conference of Catholic
Bishops paused Sunday for prayer and relaxation before turning from
a debate on nuclear policy to one on the morality of teaching about
AIDS prevention.
   The Roman Catholic bishops held a public Mass Sunday morning and
scheduled a cookout and prayer session in the evening, a day after
approving a report that critics said was not strong enough in
urging disarmament.
   The report, approved by a strong voice vote of the approximately
280 bishops, opposed deployment of President Reagan's proposed
Strategic Defense Initiative. But it did not question the morality
of continuing research on the ``Star Wars'' missile defense system
within the bound of existing arms treaties.
   The bishops planned to end their four-day meeting at St. John's
University here Monday by taking up a paper that says teaching
about condom use would help prevent the spread of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Some bishops oppose the statement, saying it will be
misinterpreted as condoning sex outside of marriage and the use of
artificial birth control, both contrary to Roman Catholic doctrine.
   The report on nuclear policy was approved as an update to the
bishops' 1983 pastoral letter on nuclear deterrence.
   The new report says, ``it is our prudential judgment that
proposals to press development of SDI do not measure up to the
moral criteria outlined in this report.''
   The report recommended that ``defense spending as a whole not
absorb a morally disproportionate percentage of the federal
budget.''
   The Rev. Thomas Gumbleton, auxiliary bishop of Detroit and the
head of the peace group Pax Christi USA, said he will continue to
work for the day when the bishops will say unequivocably that a
policy of nuclear deterrence is immoral.
   Gumbleton estimated that 50 to 60 of the bishops at the
conference feel the way he does. He said he and other bishops are
planning to issue their own statement on deterrence as a supplement
to the conference report.
   ``This report should not be the last word we say on nuclear
deterrence,'' said Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, archbishop of
Chicago, who chaired the committee that wrote the report.
   Benedictine Sister Ann Malerich, a member of Pax Christi, called
the report ``a step in the right direction.''
   ``Weapons aren't the answer,'' said Lucille Kuhl of Rochester, a
former coordinator of Pax Christi. ``They haven't solved a problem
yet. Why not try something else? Maybe we as a people have to be
more active in speaking out, rather than leaving it to our
bishops.''
   In other business Saturday, the bishops approved a campaign to
raise $20 million for retirement funds.
   Many orders can't afford to support older members because fewer
younger people are joining, and the cost of care is escalating. It
costs $400 million annually to care for the 40,000 men and women in
religious orders who are 70 years and older, according to Sister
Oliver Hudon, the head of the church's retirement project.

   The last time Ella Fitzgerald sang at a jazz
festival here, she looked grandmotherly. This time, slim and sexy
in a small-waisted gray gown and a sparkling orange pants suit, she
was more in Lena Horne's category
   Saturday night's JVC Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall
thrilled the audience, which seemed to be mostly in their 20s and
30s, musically as well. There were spontaneous standing ovations
and cheering at particularly telling bits of scat singing, growling
imitations of Louis Armstrong and triumphant high notes.
   The greatest novelty, which worked superbly, was the 70-year-old
singer's doing an oldie, ``Ain't Nobody's Business,'' to a disco
beat.
   Guitarist Les Paul, who has performed in Carnegie Hall 10 times
but never before sat in the audience, said: ``To me, she's an
instrument. She has that fantastic pitch.''
   The concert lasted 2{ hours, with Miss Fitzgerald singing except
for a brief segment after intermission by her trio, witty pianist
Paul Smith, her longtime bassist Keter Betts and new drummer Frank
Capp.
   She recently resumed performing after an absence of several
months, her health problems seemingly behind her. She was
hospitalized last year with diabetes and had coronary bypass
surgery in 1986.
   Her voice was strong throughout. She drew cheers and chuckles,
opening with ``Mr. Paganini,'' which begins, ``The concert was over
in Carnegie Hall.''
   She sang a lot of Duke Ellington, every song enjoyable _
``Caravan,'' ``Love You Madly,'' ``Sophisticated Lady,'' ``Squeeze
Me,'' ``Satin Doll,'' and a gently swung ``Take the A Train.''
Cheers followed her into the wings after ``I Can't Give You
Anything but Love,'' sung first in the style of Rose ``Chi Chi''
Murphy, then of Satchmo.
   Miss Fitzgerald never ``talked'' her songs or sat down on a
stool placed on the stage. In the second half, she sang seemingly
with more ease and open, warm tone. She also projected more feeling
than she sometimes has done in the past, especially in a Gershwin
medley.
   The audience, getting its first look at the slim pants suit
after intermission, whistled and cheered the lines ``Tell Lizzy
Arden to leave me alone; my shape is my own'' in her kickoff tune,
``The Lady Is a Tramp.''
   Miss Fitzgerald sang a bossa nova in Portuguese, did ``A House
Is Not a Home'' when somebody yelled a request for it, scatted and
did some dance steps to a swinging ``Stomping at the Savoy.''
   The audience didn't want to let her go, and she came back for
several encores _ ``You Are the Sunshine of My Life,'' ``Mack the
Knife'' and ``I Only Have Eyes for You.''
   She told the cheering audience she'd like to take them with her
to the next gig; the audience was ready to go.

<HEAD>Police Destroy Building, Palestinians Claim Soldiers Injecting
Them</HEAD>

   Israeli troops declared a curfew in Gaza City
on Sunday, then blew up the second floor of a building from where
they believe a firebomb was thrown that burned two Israeli soldiers.
   In the West Bank, residents of the Al-Amari refugee camp told
reporters Sunday that Israeli soldiers injected at least two men
with an unknown substance to pry from them information about other
Palestinians.
   In Jerusalem, police uncovered several Palestinian guerrilla
units blamed for organizing protests and throwing firebombs at
police patrols and the car of Commerce and Industry Minister Ariel
Sharon, Israel radio reported.
   The report said the units were attached to the Syrian-backed
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the Moslem
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad.
   It did not say how many Palestinians were involved. A firebomb
missed Sharon's car on May 24.
   The explosions in Gaza City came in the wake of a firebomb
attack Monday night that seriously injured two soldiers driving
through the city in a jeep.
   An Arab reporter said he heard at least four blasts after the
army announced a curfew over loudspeakers, saying residents should
not be frightened if they heard explosions. He said he could not
see the blasts because he had to remain in his home under the
curfew order.
   The reporter said some damage was caused to the shops on the
first floor of the building and the army ordered residents to clean
up debris caused by the explosions.
   Earlier, he said, at least six shopkeepers were called to
military headquarters over complaints of firebombs thrown from
their buildings.
   At least 211 Palestinians have been killed since the Arab
uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied territories. Four Israelis
have died.
   In the Al-Amari refugee camp, Nader Mahli, 24, said soldiers
seized him on Friday and injected him through a hypodermic needle
while asking him the names of stone throwers and members of the
Shabiba, a PLO youth movement.
   The army said it was investigating the report.
   Mahli said the soldiers took the syringe from a black attache
case, then blindfolded him. He said he felt the soldiers try to
inject him in the forearm, then do so on the inside of the elbow.
   ``The pain was exactly like any injection,'' he said. ``I
thought I was being poisoned. I was very afraid.''
   The young man showed two marks on his arm he said were from the
injections and deep scratches on his upper arm which he said the
soldiers also inflicted.
   One of the soldiers told him, ``After I inject you, you will
tell me everything,'' Mahli said.
   Another Palestinian, Ismail Dahoud, said he was questioned along
with Mahli and saw the injection being given.
   Mahli said he had chills and a headache Friday night. The next
day he went to Maqaseed Hospital in east Jerusalem, but doctors
could not find anything wrong with him.
   A hospital official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mahli had bruised veins from an injection, but it was impossible to
tell what substance he had been given.
   Masaad Jaber, a driver for the United Nations, said his
19-year-old son, Midhad, was also seized in the camp Friday by four
soldiers who gave him an injection while questioning him.
   Jaber said he sent his son to the home of an uncle and was
trying to find a house outside the Al-Amari camp.
   ``I don't want to live here anymore after what happened to my
son,'' he said.

   Vice President George Bush on Sunday
accused Congress of inaction in the fight against drugs, but a
representative of Democrat Michael Dukakis immediately turned the
blame on the Reagan administration.
   In speeches at a conference of the Fraternal Order of Police,
Bush and Dukakis supporter Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., each
laid the blame for failing to quell the drug crisis at the other's
doorstep.
   Bush, the certain Republican presidential nominee, also said he
would be tough in prosecution of drug dealers and would convert
unneeded military bases into minimum security prisons. He said he
had no specific bases in mind but would expect his secretary of
defense to review the matter.
   On the drug issue, Bush said, ``Congress is full of rhetorical
heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law enforcement,
some of them go AWOL,'' short for absent without leave.
   He said Congress reduced the administration's Coast Guard budget
request last year by $72 million, and by $864 million over four
years.
   But DeConcini claimed it was the administration that did the
cutting and Congress that restored dollars for drug-fighting
efforts. He said the Reagan administration's 1988 budget sought a
$900 million cut in anti-drug funds, including money for Coast
Guard and Border Patrol interdiction efforts. It also included a 60
percent cut in drug prevention and education programs.
   DeConcini said Congress restored 70 percent of the funds and he
labeled Bush's claim of congressional laxity as ``just a bogus
argument.''
   In a prepared statement, DeConcini also accused Bush of personal
failure as head of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction
System.
   DeConcini said the panel ``was found to be an organization of
half-empty offices lacking organization'' and added that it
virtually ignored the air charters that are ``the most commmon
means of smuggling cocaine into southern Florida.''
   DeConcini said he was addressing the group as a surrogate for
Dukakis, who has sewn up the Democratic presidential nomination and
is spending a few days vacationing in Nantucket, Mass.
   In a news conference after his speech, Bush debunked a report
that his aides have zeroed in on Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas as the
leading candidate to become Bush's running mate.
   ``Nobody is authorized to peak in my behalf,'' Bush said of the
report in Sunday's New York Times.
   ``We have not begun the process in terms of lists,'' he said.
``There isn't a long list or a short list.''
   Dole, while campaigning for Bush on Saturday in Oregon, was
asked about chances he would be the running mate and said: ``If I
got the call, I'd say, `Mr. Vice President, let's talk,' but that
hasn't happened.''
   Discussing what he will look for in a running mate, Bush said,
``I want to have an inclusion of the vice president on things. That
suggests a certain philosophical compatibility, not on every single
issue, but a philosophical compatibility and a tempermental
compatibility ... so you're not looking over wondering if the vice
president is posturing and cutting up the president.''
   In his remarks to the police group, Bush called for: mandatory
testing of ``anyone responsible for the public safety,''
recriminalization of drug possession in states where it has been
decriminalized, the death penalty for drug kingpins and those who
commit drug-related murders, and continuation of the ``zero
tolerance'' policy aimed at users of drugs in even small amounts.

<HEAD>Paisley Reportedly Able to Win Pentagon Job Despite Bribery
Allegations</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 5th graf, Lawrence E. Barcella, with 3 new grafs to
include Barcella comment</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melvyn R. Paisley, a central figure in the
growing Pentagon fraud scandal, was able to win a top Defense
Department post despite widespread allegations that he had bribed
government officials and wiretapped competitors, according to a
published report.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that two executives of the
Boeing Co. had sought to get Paisley fired from his job 10 years
ago because they were alarmed about his conduct, which they said
included charging fees for prostitutes to his expense account.
   ``Usually every major company has one guy who does the dirty
business,'' former Boeing executive James Durst told the Times.
``He was the guy.''
   Durst, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
Thursday night, said he passed along information to the government
more than six years ago that Paisley had bragged of committing a
felony wiretapping operation and of committing bribery
internationally on military projects.
   Lawrence E. Barcella, Paisley's lawyer, called the allegations
``unfounded'' and suggested they came from people with axes of
their own to grind. He called Durst ``a disgruntled ex-employee.''
   ``I just really think that dredging up 5-, 10- and 15-year-old
unproven and unfounded allegations ... is really stooping beneath
the barrel,'' Barcella said.
   Calls to a Boeing spokesman were not immediately returned.
   Paisley's reputation has been that of a fast-living playboy who
left behind a string of allegations of questionable conduct.
   Durst described Paisley as a ``hard-drinking, two-fisted man's
man'' who would stop at nothing to get his way. ``He loved to talk,
he loved to brag. Mel had certain priorities: women, money and
business _ particularly women,'' he said.
   The latest revelations about Paisley's past raise questions
about how he could have passed FBI background checks necessary to
become assistant secretary of the Navy in 1981 with access to the
government's highest secrets about weapons and reconnaissance
satellites.
   One of Paisley's three ex-wives, Mildred R. McGetrick, said she
told the FBI at the time that Paisley ``was dishonest with money''
and had accepted cash and gifts as gratuities. McGetrick's sister,
Mickey Pierson, said she had sent a letter to then-Senate Armed
Services Committee Chairman John Tower saying that ``Mr. Paisley
has been known to take bribes.'' Tower's panel was then considering
Paisley's nomination as a top aide to Navy Secretary John Lehman.
   The Times said Paisley, who worked for Boeing for 27 years, had
hired James E. Gaines while a Boeing executive and later brought
him to the Pentagon as a deputy. After Paisley left the Defense
Department, Gaines stayed with the Navy and is suspected of having
supplied classified material to Paisley, who used it in his
consulting work.
   Paisley's office and home were searched by the FBI as part of
the investigation into the alleged bribery scandal. No one has been
charged in the case.
   Durst said Paisley loved to brag, and had told colleagues about
bugging a competitor for a military contract in 1970, about bribing
U.S. military officers overseas and about hiding payoffs and wild
parties with prostitutes on his military-contract expense reports.
   When he went to work for Lehman, ``People used to laugh and say
he won't last six months,'' Durst said. ``As soon as they do a
security check, he'll be out. I guess they never did. We never
thought he'd last.''
   Durst said at one point a prominent Boeing consultant in
Australia, Sir Edwin Hicks, complained that Paisley was so blatant
in his offers of payoffs there that Paisley was made ``persona non
grata'' in Australia.
   ``Information is the essence of the business,'' Durst said.
``There are good ways to do it and bad ways. Mel, unfortunately,
always used the bad ways.''

   An 11-year-old pilot took off Sunday for
a 4,100-mile trip to the northernmost tip of Alaska, a flying feat
her dad says is the first for a girl.
   Jennifer Hudgens, wearing oversized bows on her blonde curls,
sat on four pillows so she could see out the window of her Cessna
182, which lifted off about 11 a.m. from an airstrip here for the
first hop of the weeklong journey.
   ``I really like the idea of flying,'' said the sixth-grader who
last year talked her Army pilot dad, Maj. Richard Hudgens, into
giving her lessons. ``It took him a while to let me. He didn't want
me to do it. But now he helps me.''
   Hudgens will go with his daughter on the flight to Point Barrow,
Alaska, which will feature overnight stops in Huntsville, Ala.;
Sioux City, Iowa; and the Canadian cities of Regina and Fort St.
Johns.
   Jennifer and her dad believe she will be the youngest girl to
make such a cross-country flight. The youngest boy is 9-year-old
Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
   Aliengena in April completed a 6,000-mile flight in a Cessna 210
across the country and back. He set out to beat the record set in
August by 10-year-old Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, Calif.
   The National Aeronautics Association credited him with beating
Marshall's record.
   Hudgens contacted that agency to see about his daughter setting
an official record, but was told its officials are not interested
in keeping records for young pilots anymore because it had become a
nuisance.
   ``It won't be official, but I'll still know it's a record,'' he
said Sunday.

   A special General Assembly session on
disarmament ended in failure Sunday after delegates failed to adopt
a final document on nuclear arms reduction.
   The session ended Sunday morning after committee meetings could
not end differences in disarmament positions held by the Soviet
Union and developing nations and a more cautious approach backed by
the United States and some of its Western allies.
   The four-week session of the 159-member General Assembly, the
third in 10 years to focus on disarmament, cost the financially
ailing United Nations about $7.4 million.
   Delegates never voted on a final document. Committee delegates
decided not to attempt to pass a resolution without consensus.
   The General Assembly has no enforcement power over its
decisions. Delegates believed a final resolution adopted by
consensus, however, would carry the moral authority of expressing
the will of the world community.
   The United States and some of its Western allies opposed most
other nations on issues ranging from the U.S. space-based defense
program known as ``Star Wars,'' the monitoring of land-based
weapons, and a Soviet call for a joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban.
   U.N. officials described the past week's committee debates as
``very intense and arduous.'' Some delegates said there were sharp
confrontations and shouting in at least one closed session.
   ``A certain country which should have important disarmament
responsibilities had insisted on its position. That was a major
reason that consensus was not achieved,'' said Chinese delegate Yu
Mengyia, referring to the United States.
   Soviet Union delegate Vladimir F. Petrovsky also noted that no
agreement was possible ``because of the actions of some states.''
   U.S. delegate Max Friedersdorf said the United States
``regretted very much that it had not been possible to achieve
consensus on the chairman's draft document, which had been
acceptable in large part to most delegations.''
   During the special session, the Soviets called for the
elimination of all nuclear weapons by the end of the century; troop
reductions of 500,000 soldiers each by the Warsaw Pact and NATO and
a ban on ``Star Wars.''
   Since the session began May 31, the United States was also at
odds with other positions favored by the Soviet Union, including an
expanded role for the United Nations in multilateral verification
of nuclear weapons and naval nuclear disarmament.
   The United States favored emphasis on conventional disarmament,
especially in Europe, where the Warsaw Pact is regarded as having
military superiority.

   Republican George Bush criticized Michael Dukakis' understanding
of foreign policy on Sunday, saying his Democratic rival comes to a
``troubling conclusion'' in emphasizing conventional weapons.
Backers of Jesse Jackson and Dukakis struck a unified note this
weekend in agreeing on a party platform noteworthy for its brevity.
   The vice president said Dukakis' lack of experience in foreign
policy is fertile ground for debate and Bush said he will spell out
their differences on conventional weapons and strategic defense.
   The all-but-certain GOP nominee said Dukakis' increased emphasis
on conventional forces and calls for cuts in nuclear systems
indicates a ``troubling conclusion about winnability for a
conventional force war in Europe.''
   The issue ``is a very serious debate that has not been joined
... will be joined by me,'' Bush told reporters en route to
Columbus, Ohio, for a campaign appearance. ``Obviously he (Dukakis)
will have to join it. I think I will come out well on that.''
   Bush, in a speech to the Fraternal Order of Police, accused
Congress of inaction in the war on drugs and cited the $72 million
cut in the Reagan administration's Coast Guard budget request.
   ``Congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issues of drugs,
but when it comes to law enforcement some of them go AWOL,'' Bush
said at the organization's national board meeting in Ohio.
   Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, addressing the
group as a surrogate for Dukakis, disputed Bush's claims, noting
that the administration's 1988 budget sought a $900 million cut in
anti-drug funding, including money for Coast Guard and Border
Patrol interdiction efforts. It also included a 60 percent cut in
drug prevention and education programs.
   DeConcini said Congress restored 70 percent of the funds and
said Bush's claim is ``just a bogus argument.''
   Dukakis has criticized the Reagan administration for permitting
Coast Guard budget cuts, saying, ``How can we possibly be serious
about fighting a war on drugs when we're cutting Coast Guard
patrols by 55 percent? It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasons
I'm running for the presidency.''
   The Massachusetts governor is vacationing in Nantucket this
weekend, staying at the home of friends. The likely Democratic
nominee received promising news from his party platform delegates
in Denver where a blueprint plan was worked out.
   Dukakis' backers easily turned aside Jackson efforts to add
planks that would have committed the Democrats to raise taxes on
the wealthy, freeze the Pentagon budget, double education spending,
commit the United States to no first use of nuclear weapons and to
a call for Palestinian self-determination.
   The committees handled without rancor a number of amendments,
rejecting some key Jackson stands but accepting others, including
ones calling for Third World debt relief and significant increases
in child care aid for low-and middle-income families.
   ``Although we have differences ... about 95 percent of all the
issues that came up between these two campaigns have been resolved
in a peaceful and in a unified way, and I know that scares the
Republicans to death,'' said former Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard
Hatcher who introduced a Jackson budget amendment that failed.
   Mike Barnes, the former Maryland congressman who led Dukakis'
platform team, said that in working on the past four party
platforms, ``I have never seen a situation that was anywhere near
this unified.''
   In Nantucket, Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan said the
Massachusetts governor spoke with his senior aide Jack Corrigan
before departing for his four-day vacation on Friday and did not
receive a briefing after the vote by the Democratic Party's
platform committee.
   While the action was taken amid signals of party unity, and
displayed Dukakis' strength in controlling the platform issue,
Gearan made no claim that the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta next month would be free of floor battles over the platform.
   ``We have a good working relationship with Jackson's campaign,
and things are going well,'' Gearan said.
   But he added, ``I think he's said all along there could very
well be some floor fights at the convention.''
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said no
decisions had been made on which if any of the issues Jackson would
fight for on the floor of next month's convention in Atlanta.
However, she said that the two Democrats ``in these proceedings
moved closer together.''
   Jackson, campaigning in St. Croix, said he doesn't want a
convention of floor fights, but indicated that he wasn't satisfied
with the weekend work of the platform committee.
   ``There will no doubt be some minority positions taken to the
floor,'' he told reporters. ``I do not think bland is beautiful.
People ought to be specific, ought to make promises, ought to keep
promises, ought to be make commitments. People have given a
mandate.''
   The moderate platform, which will not be final until approved by
the convention in Atlanta on July 19, is expected to run about
4,000 words _ the shortest since the terse platforms that Franklin
D. Roosevelt ran on in 1932 and 1936.
   In Iowa, meanwhile, Dukakis picked up 10 delegates at the state
convention, and party spokesman Phil Roeder said nine uncommitted
delegates will back the Massachusetts governor, giving him a 49-12
advantage over Jackson. At the GOP state convention, Bush gained
all 37 delegates.
   The two presidential contenders both finished third in Iowa's
initial contest five months ago.

   Brother fought brother and the North won
again Sunday as more than 8,000 uniformed men re-enacted the final
charge of the Battle of Gettysburg to commemorate its 125th
anniversary.
   Griff King of the 2nd Virginia Regiment planned to participate
in Pickett's charge against a line of Union troops, where his
brother would defend a ridge with the 93rd Pennsylvania Regiment.
   ``We don't agree on anything anyway,'' said King, a 35-year-old
machine operator from Weston, W.Va.
   About 12,500 mock soldiers and civilians in period garb took
part in the three-day re-enactment billed as the largest ever,
organizers said.
   Some 140,000 people witnessed the event over three days,
according to organizers with Napoleonic Tactics Inc., which staged
the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the actual
battlefield.
   Following a series of cannon blasts by both sides, a 200-yard
line of Confederate troops gave a rebel yell and marched
shoulder-to-shoulder up to a wall defended by Union troops.
   Troops for the North and South traded volley after volley in an
engagement staged at one-third its original scale.
   ``It was a great battle,'' said John McQueen, a 37-year-old
marketing manager from Atlanta who repeatedly fired for the 52nd
Ohio Regiment as soldiers for both sides fell around him.
   ``The rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldn't touch
them,'' he said.
   Confederate troops fell back after an hour of fighting in the
re-enactment.
   The event ended with soldiers standing in silence for an
invocation to those who died in the actual battle. A bugler played
taps while 75 cannons fired one after another.
   As more than 60,000 people massed along a hillside Sunday to
witness the mock charge, a woman stood in 19th-century black
mourning dress to remind them of the consequences of war.
   ``Mourning is appropriate for battle because men die ... women
had to carry on,'' said Lanie Alligood, whose beau ``died'' during
fighting Saturday.
   Ms. Alligood, 34, of Atlanta, said she traveled with a group of
about 15 women from Georgia, most of whom dressed in black.
   The Battle of Gettysburg occurred July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000
Union and Confederate troops were killed or wounded over the course
of the battle.
   Major Gen. George E. Pickett's unsuccessful charge with more
than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the
Confederate's final offensive push of the Battle of Gettysburg.
   ``If the Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil
War, then Pickett's charge was the turning point of the Battle of
Gettysburg,'' said Kim Holien, a historian with the U.S. Army
Center of Military History.
   King said he decided to join the Confederate army because he
believes in states' rights over the encroachment by the federal
government, a battle he said continues.
   ``The battlefield is the courtroom now,'' said King, as he
packed up his tent before the final charge.

   The ``gender gap'' giving Democrat Michael
Dukakis an early lead over Republican George Bush might disappear
on Election Day, said former presidential candidate Shirley
Chisholm who warned that factors dividing female voters should not
be underestimated.
   Even though most women prefer Dukakis, the likely Democratic
nominee, it doesn't mean they will vote for him in November,
Chisholm told about 1,000 delegates to the National Organization
for Women conference in Buffalo.
   ``We're not as monolithic as led to believe,'' she said, noting
regional, economic and age difference among women voters.
   ``You constantly talk about being 53 percent of the vote, but if
you are unable to deliver that, you will be ignored,'' said the
former Brooklyn congresswoman who ran for president in 1972.
   Chisholm said there was similar talk of a gender gap in 1984
when the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George Bush handed
the Democratic ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferrao a
disastrous defeat.
   ``Many women, particulary southern women, couldn't identify with
Ferraro,'' she said. ``We've got ask why and learn from our
mistakes.''
   Part of the problem, she said, is that feminists are often
intolerant of opposing views.
   For the last decade, she said, women's right groups have judged
candidates mainly on their abortion postions. Women candidate who
are not pro-choice are often opposed, she said.
   ``You can't use one issue as a litmus test,'' she said. ``You
can't be that emotional about politics.''
   She said Democratic women should recognize that the party will
need to have a southerner or someone acceptable to southerners on
the ticket if it expects to win in November.
   ``You had better be prepared to accomodate the more conservative
views of southern women if you expect to maintain national
political power,'' she said. ``You can't afford to alienate them.''
   Chisholm campaigned for Jesse Jackson this year.

   A teen-ager beat his mother to death
the morning he was to graduate as valedictorian of his class,
apparently because she was being overbearingly protective, police
said Sunday.
   ``He claimed his mother wouldn't give him any freedom,''
Detective Lt. Richard Clute said.
   William Shrubsall, 17, was in jail without bond Sunday after
police said he confessed to using a baseball bat to crush the skull
of his 56-year-old mother, Marianne, during an argument about 3
a.m. Saturday. The boy said his mother hit him first, Clute said.
   Shrubsall, who is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, was charged
with murder just 10 hours before he was to graduate with honors
from LaSalle High School.
   The graduation ceremony was held as scheduled Saturday, but with
no valedictory speech and no mention of the killing, said principal
Ralph Guerrucci.
   Guerrucci said school officials did not want to remind the class
of 250 students of the tragedy, ``but it definitely dampened the
day.''
   ``The graduates were understandaly upset. ... Obviously, they
don't want the day to be remembered by what happened to their
valedictorian,'' the principal said.
   Friends and neighbors reacted with disbelief that the crime
could have been committed by the handsome and popular teen-ager,
who hoped to become a lawyer and was to attend the highly selective
University of Chicago in the fall.
   ``You can't say anything bad about him. ... He was just
supernice,'' said Darlene Irish, a neighbor whose father had called
police. ``And his mom was one of those, `Can I do anything for
you?' persons. ... She was always helping.''
   A classmate, Larry Lang, said he'd never seen Shrubsall get
angry. Another classmate, Terry Adamec, said he couldn't believe
Shrubsall committed the crime.
   ``He had everything going for him,'' Adamec said. ``A class
valedictorian wouldn't do something like that. He was the smartest
guy in the whole school.''
   Shrubsall's attorney, Paul Cleary, said the boy and his mother
outwardly seemed to enjoy a good relationship, but had a history of
problems that led up to the killing.
   ``He made a detailed statement of that to police and it will
come out in court,'' Cleary said.
   The Buffalo News reported that Mrs. Shrubsall had physically
beaten the boy on previous occasions. The newspaper quoted an
unidentified source as saying that despite the boy's success in
school, his mother pressured him to do more.
   The newspaper report did not offer any evidence of beatings, or
discuss when or how often they may have occurred.
   Clute said the slaying occurred during an argument over
Shrubsall's returning late from his girlfriend's house two blocks
away.
   Mrs. Shrubsall had called the girl's home demanding that her son
return, and when he arrived she was waiting for him in the
driveway, police said.
   An argument continued inside with Mrs. Shrubsall threatening to
call the girl's parents. When she picked up the telephone, the boy
tried to stop her and she struck him in the face with the receiver,
police said.
   Police said the two had lived alone in their well-kept suburban
home since Shrubsall's father, William Sr., died in 1985.

   Temperatures across the southern Great Lakes plunged 30 degrees
Sunday from the day-before record high readings, while hot and
humid weather smothered the South and thunderstorms poured heavy
rain over parts of Texas.
   Thunderstorms also extended from the southern coast of New
England across the mid-Atlantic states to Kentucky. Lightning
knocked out power throughout Cape Cod, Mass., for at least six
hours Sunday morning.
   Sunday afternoon readings across the southern Great Lakes, in
the 100s Saturday afternoon, were in the upper 60s and 70s, with
low humidity. Temperatures in Cleveland and Toledo and Findlay,
Ohio, all were 32 degrees cooler than at the same time Saturday.
   The South, however, was not so fortunate. Temperatures reached
100 degrees Sunday over portions of western Kentucky, Tennessee,
Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina.
   Several record high temperatures were set in the Tennessee
Valley. For the seventh day in a row, Huntsville, Ala., with a
record high of 99 degrees, set or tied a record high.
   In northwest Texas, more than 4 inches of rain fell Sunday
morning at Childress. In Real and Uvalde counties near San Antonio,
where 3 to 5 inches of rain fell Saturday, the National Weather
Service issued flash flood warnings.
   Thunderstorms were scattered from the Carolinas across the Gulf
Coast states to southeast Texas. Portions of the Rockies and the
Plateau region also reported thunderstorms.
   Besides the record in Huntsville, records for the date were set
in Apalachicola, Fla., at 96, and in Chattanooga, Tenn., at 101.
Records were tied in Glasgow, Mont., at 103 and Paducah, Ky., at
101.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 103 at Palm Springs, Calif. The low
for the day was 43 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Rockies and the Plateau region across the southern Plains
and the lower Mississippi Valley to the south Atlantic Coast.
   Thunderstorms will range from Florida and southern Alabama
across southern Georgia to southern South Carolina. Widely
scattered showers will fall over portions of eastern New York and
New England.
   Highs in the 80s or 90s were forecast over most of the nation;
in the 60s and 70s from the Great Lakes region to the northern and
mid-Atlantic coastal states; also in the 60s and 70s along the
Pacific Coast and in much of Washington state; around 100 degrees
over western portions of the Dakotas and between 100 and 110
degrees in the desert Southwest.

   Club-wielding police brutally dispersed thousands
of Crimean Tatars who massed Sunday to protest the Kremlin's
refusal to give them back their homeland, a protester said Sunday.
   Server Tuvarchy, who took part in the demonstration in the
Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent, said 5,000 people gathered on the
city's Revolution Square in front of Communist party headquarters.
   ``The militia beat people,'' Tuvarchy, a Crimean Tatar activist,
said in a telephone interview. ``I myself took a girl to the
hospital who had been beaten so badly she was unconscious.''
   Tuvarchy said at least two people had been arrested. He said at
Tashkent's southern railway station, up to 300 Tatars had been held
by police to prevent them from taking part in the protest.
   In Moscow, dissident Valery Senderov quoted telephone reports
from Tashkent as saying up to 20,000 people took part in the
demonstration in front of Communist Party headquarters.
   ``The demonstration was roughly broken up by militiamen who
kicked the participants and beat them with clubs,'' Senderov said
in a telephone interview. He said reports telephoned from the scene
said hundreds may have been injured.
   The demonstration in Tashkent, about 1,600 miles southeast of
Moscow, was called to protest a government decision this month that
denied the Crimean Tatars their own homeland, Senderov said.
   On June 9, a government commission led by President Andrei A.
Gromyko ruled that there were ``no grounds for establishing a
Crimean autonomy.''
   That announcement was a major setback for the Tatars, who for
decades have been demanding a return to their ancestral homeland on
the Black Sea. Dictator Josef V. Stalin deported the Tatars from
the Crimea during World War II for allegedly collaborating with the
Nazis.
   The Crimean Tatars, who today number from 250,000 to 300,000,
were absolved of the war collaboration charge in 1967 but were
still not allowed to return en masse to the Crimea.
   A statement issued by the government commission said the Soviet
Union had eased restrictions that barred some Tatars from returning
to the Crimea.
   ``Since the middle of 1987, some 2,500 Crimean Tatars have been
granted residence permits and fixed up with jobs in the Crimea,''
the commission said.
   Crimean Tatar leaders have said those measures are inadequate,
and they have demanded the revival of the Crimean Tatar autonomous
region abolished by Stalin.
   Senderov said the demonstrators in Tashkent were also protesting
the treatment of Crimean Tatars in Moscow. Authorities in the
Soviet capital, bent on preventing Tatar demonstrations during the
nationwide Communist Party conference that begins Tuesday, are
immediately sending Crimean Tatars who arrive in Moscow back home,
Senderov said.
   One activist drew a 10-day jail term for arguing with a Moscow
police officer, he said.
   Senderov said the protesters in Tashkent managed to deliver a
petition listing their grievances to someone at Uzbekistan's
Communist Party headquarters before the protest was broken up.
   The government commission on the Crimean Tatars was established
last summer, after members of the ethnic group held an
extraordinary overnight demonstration at Red Square to press their
demands.

   A group that helped defeat a referendum to finance
a rail and subway system in Dallas and its suburbs recommended
Sunday that a streamlined transit authority find other ways to ease
traffic congestion.
   Some 59 percent of the voters in Dallas and 15 suburbs, the area
served by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, rejected a proposal Saturday
to sell $1 billion in bonds to begin construction of a 93-mile
commuter rail system.
   The outcome was a victory for a group called Sensible Metro Area
Rapid Transit, which waged a small-budget campaign against the bond
proposal.
   ``I think DART is at a crossroads,'' former Dallas County Judge
David Fox, a leader of the citizens' group, said Sunday. ``The
election is now behind us. We now have the opportunity to reassess
where we are, what we've learned, and decide how to proceed from
here.''
   Saturday's results represented a turnabout from 1982, when 58
percent of the voters approved the measure that established DART, a
regional agency that was to develop a mass transit plan, including
a regional rail system.
   The decision throws the transit agency's future into question
because suburbs may call an election to withdraw from the agency.
Dallas suburbs contribute about 45 percent of its financing.
   The agency had no official contingency plan in the event of a
defeat and ``will return to the drawing board,'' said Charles
Anderson, its executive director.
   Some transit authority board members see the bond vote as a
mandate to develop a new transportation plan.
   Virtually all of Dallas' major freeways are at least 20 years
old, and most are burdened with traffic that meets or exceeds
capacity.
   Members of citizens' group say the area's traffic problems can
be solved by systems other than rail. Many of the recommendations
the group made Sunday included restructuring and streamlining the
transit authority, which critics say has become a bloated
bureaucracy.
   The group also recommended that the transit agency develop a
regional mobility plan that does not require incurring long-term
debt.
   Bill Ceverha, president of the citizens' group, said such a plan
could include some rail, but added, ``The election shows that the
economics of mass transit are so fundamentally different today than
they were a generation ago that they (the voters) regard fixed rail
and subway solutions as folly.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday condemned
the Nazi killings of thousands of severely handicapped people as
``the worst forms of barbarism'' and warned of mankind's potential
for violence and destruction.
   ``Human life should not be divided into that which is worth
living and that which is not,'' John Paul told 1,000 elderly, sick
and handicapped people in Salzburg's cathedral.
   In the German Third Reich, the Nazis killed thousands of the
handicapped under what they called ``euthanasia programs'' or mercy
killings.
   ``Decades ago, this division led to the worst forms of
barbarism,'' said the pontiff on the fourth day of his five-day
visit to Austria.
   The 50th anniversary of Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany has
prompted widespread soul-searching in this Alpine nation. Jewish
leaders have called on him to urge Austrians to come to terms with
the country's Nazi-era past.
   The pontiff often has called for greater respect for the
handicapped and for elderly people who are sick. The Vatican is
vehemently opposed to mercy killing, saying it goes against
Christ's teachings.
   After the prayer service, the pontiff donned a green robe and
warned of drug abuse in an outdoor Mass before 25,000 people in
Salzburg's Residence Square.
   In his homily, John Paul cited ``the fear of man's dangerous
potential for violence and destruction'' and urged parents to
``help your adolescent sons and daughters to withstand the
temptations of escaping into the sham world of drugs.''
   Also Sunday, in a gesture of reconciliation, the pontiff took
part in an ecumenical prayer service in a Lutheran church with
representatives of 12 other Christian churches and denominations in
Austria.
   Papal trip organizers said the service was one of the first in
which the pontiff has participated in a Protestant church.
   The pope said many Catholics and Protestants shared suffering in
World War II and ``experienced their deep union in Christ's cross,
especially in the extremely difficult ordeal of the concentration
camps,'' he said.
   In an afternoon talk to about 150 young people in Salzburg's
Catholic youth center, the pontiff again referred to the 1933-1945
Nazi era.
   ``Nobody can undo what has already been done,'' the pope said.
``Even the best psychologists cannot free us from the burden of our
past. Only the omnipotence of God can do this.''
   Many Austrians actively supported Adolf Hitler after the 1938
annexation, although the Nazis targeted Jews, leftist politicians
and other foes for immediate arrest and persecution.
   The pontiff told the youths that God ``cleanses even the
contaminated soil of our souls with the mercy of forgiveness and
thus gives us the strength for honest reconciliation with the
people we have hurt.''
   He also told them that if past failures are simply swept under
the rug, ``they will poison our spiritual environment.''
   On Saturday, he called the suffering of Jewish and Christian
victims of the Nazis ``a gift to the world.''
   Four American Jews said Sunday that they were beaten by Austrian
police when they demonstrated against the pope's meetings with
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim.
   The four made the charge during a news conference at Israel's
Ben Gurion Airport and also said they encountered anti-Semitism
from Austrian people.
   Rabbi Avi Weiss of the Riverdale Synagogue in New York said he
and three students were beaten by police after they displayed a
large photograph of Waldheim in a Nazi uniform at Mauthausen, a
former concentration camp that the pope visited.
   Waldheim has denied allegations by Jewish groups that he
participated in war crimes while serving with the German army in
the Balkans during World War II.
   In Vienna, the Kurier daily newspaper reported that Austrian
television canceled an evening broadcast of the film version of a
story the pontiff wrote in 1960 when he was bishop of Krakow,
Poland.
   The newspaper said that RAI Italian radio and television
requested the cancellation so that the new film can first be shown
to the pope at a private screening in July.
   Austrian television will show the film version of the pope's
work, called ``The Goldsmith's Shop,'' this fall, Kurier said.
   The pontiff retired for the night in Salzburg. He was scheduled
to return to Rome from Innsbruck Monday evening.

   Pope John Paul II plans to announce an overhaul of
the Vatican government aimed at streamlining the organization,
Italian newspapers reported Sunday.
   The reorganization is to be announced Tuesday, the day the
pontiff is scheduled to formally install 25 cardinals.
   The reforms will increase the Roman Catholic Church's control
over the Vatican bank, give the Secretariat of State more power and
establish a commission for relations between the Vatican and its
lay employees, the newspapers said.
   The church hierarchy has been discussing the reform of the
Vatican government, known as the Curia, for several years.
   The Milan-based newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the plan
would give the College of Cardinals responsibility for supervising
the Vatican bank, officially called the Institute for Religious
Works, which has traditionally answered only to the pope.
   The bank has been the subject of controversy since Italian
authorities issued arrest warrants in February 1987 for its
president, American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, and two of its lay
employees in connection with Italy's largest banking scandal.
   Prosecutors accused the men of being accessories to the
fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano in 1982.
   Italy's Constitutional Court ruled earlier in July that Italian
courts could not prosecute the three because the Vatican was
considered a sovereign state under treaties between Italy and the
Vatican.
   According to the newspaper reports, the reform will trim the
influence of the Vatican's ``Foreign Ministry'' _ the Council for
the Public Affairs of the Church _ making it just another
department of the Secretariat of State.
   The Council has functioned as part of the Secretariat but has
enjoyed a high profile and a certain amount of autonomy.
   The last major reform of the Curia was announced in 1967 by Pope
Paul VI. It provided that modern languages could be used in
official documents, made diocesan bishops members of all Vatican
government departments and implemented changes brought about by the
Second Vatican Council, which ran from 1962-65.

   A partly deaf boy found wandering in
Mexico last year was fitted with a hearing aid Saturday and taken
to an airport in the hope he would recognize an aircraft that would
help lead to his identity.
   The boy, nicknamed Sabath, frequently tugged at the device
tucked behind his left ear and was distracted by the noise of
takeoffs and landings.
   Officials at the Juarez center for the Development of the
Integrated Family named the unidentified boy Sabath because he was
found on a Saturday _ sabado in Spanish. News reports have spelled
the boy's name as Sabat, but Leticia Cota of the family agency said
the name is spelled Sabath.
   A hearing test two weeks ago determined the freckle-faced boy
was deaf in the right ear and had about 20 percent hearing in the
left. The $760 hearing aid was donated by an El Paso audiologist.
   Sabath communicates mostly through gestures and drawings. Some
of his pictures seem to indicate he survived a plane crash that
killed his parents and sister.
   For that reason, Sabath was taken to El Paso International
Airport after he was fitted with the hearing aid Saturday morning.
Officials hoped he would recognize the type of plane he may have
crashed in, but the boy paid little attention to the aircraft.
   ``It was not as successful as I anticipated,'' said Luis Torre,
a caseworker with the Texas Department of Human Services who
accompanied the boy.
   Sabath was found wandering near downtown Juarez Nov. 7, 1987.
Because Sabath does not speak, write or use sign language, U.S. and
Mexican officials have been unable to determine where he is from.
   The FBI was called into the case when Mexican officials noticed
Sabath prefers American food and cartoon characters to their
Mexican counterparts, leading them to believe Sabath could be
American.
   Officials trying to identify Sabath have chased leads in
Illinois, Oklahoma and France.
   The newest lead comes from Tampico, Mexico, where a woman says
her son disappeared about seven months ago. She described her son
as deaf, about 8 years old, with brown hair, freckles and light
skin _ a good description of Sabath. Officials are waiting for the
woman to send pictures of her son, said FBI spokesman Terry Kincaid.

<HEAD>British Airways Suspends Service on A320s</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-France-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways suspended service on its two A320
aircraft as of midnight Sunday, hours after a new Air France plane
of the same type crashed during an air show and killed at least
three people.
   The narrow-bodied short-to-medium-range A320 jet entered
commercial service in April, and British Airways took possession of
its second this month. Air France took delivery Thursday of the
plane that crashed Sunday.
   British Airways announced it was suspending both its A320s from
routes between London's Gatwick Airport and various European
destinations starting at midnight.
   ``Following discussions with Airbus and the Civil Aviation
Authority, we have decided to suspend the A320 services as a
precautionary measure pending further information on the cause of
today's accident,'' an airline spokeswoman said.
   She said alternative planes had been arranged and she did not
anticipate any cancellations of flights. She was not identified, in
keeping with British practice.
   The Airbus A320 received its certification Feb. 26.
   The A320 was conceived and certified for flight by a two-member
crew, eliminating the navigator.
   Early this year, pilots and flight engineers of Air Inter, the
largest French airline, called a series of strikes to protest the
use of only two cockpit members in A320s, saying it was unsafe.
   According to witnesses, the Air France plane, taking part in a
show in eastern France near the Swiss border, made a low pass over
the small Habsheim airfield, clipped some trees at the end of the
runway and plunged into a forest.
   A London spokesman for the manufacturer, the four-nation Airbus
Industrie consortium in which Britain has a large stake, refused
comment on the possible effects for the consortium, saying only:
``Investigators are looking into the incident along with the French
Civil Aviation Authority. There will be a full investigation.''
   David Learmount, air transport editor of the respected journal,
Flight International, said the A320 had been the most successful
aircraft ever in terms of winning record orders before it was even
in service.
   Furthermore, he said, the circumstances of a display flight and
an ordinary commercial passenger flight were quite different.
   ``Display flights during a show are designed to show the people
on the ground and on board the maximum use that that aircraft could
provide,'' he said. ``I don't predict that the aviation world is
going to react violently to this.
   ``However, I am not saying that this is a situation to be
dismissed. ... It needs a lot of very, very careful looking into,''
Learmount said.
   The A320 is the first aircraft equipped with electronic flight
system and controls that are beside the pilot instead of in front
of the pilot. The jet consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar
two or three engine jets it is designed to replace.

<HEAD>Heart Association Approves Plan to OK Some Foods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Heart Association approved a
system Sunday to identify and endorse processed foods that meet the
group's dietary guidelines.
   The association said it will look mainly at the salt,
cholesterol and fat levels in food products in deciding whether to
endorse them as ``heart-healthy.'' Items bearing the group's seal
of approval are expected to reach shelves within a year.
   ``We regard this new initiative as a logical expansion of the
American Heart Association's well-established role as the public's
chief advocate, and efforts to reduce premature death and
disability from heart disease and stroke,'' said Dr. W.W. Aston of
Dallas, chairman of the AHA task force that studied the product
approval idea for the past two years.
   The first group of foods that will be examined by an independent
testing group will be margarines, cooking oils and salad dressings.
The association does not expect to endorse meats, fruits and other
non-processed food items.
   The recommendation was made at the annual delegate assembly in
St. Louis, which began Friday and ended Sunday. There were about
140 affiliates and scientific counsels represented at the delegate
assembly. The delegates are the policy-making group for the AHA.
   Heart and blood vessel diseases are the nation's leading
killers, and took nearly 1 million lives in the United States in
1985, the most recent year for which statistics are complete. The
AHA said nearly 65 million Americans have one or more forms of the
diseases.
   Members of the task force said Sunday that dietary control is
one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease. Since 1961, the AHA has been recommending a diet low in
fat, salt and cholesterol as a way to help reduce heart disease.
   ``Many Americans have adopted healthier eating habits, and
dietary improvements recommended by the AHA clearly have played a
part in the welcome decline in heart attack and stroke death rates
that we have seen in the last two decades,'' Aston said.
   He added that two independent nationwide surveys of consumers
and health specialists showed that they responded favorably to the
AHA's efforts, and wanted more specific information about fat and
cholesterol levels.
   The program will include creation of a consumer health
information program. It will establish a toll-free national
nutritional telephone hotline that will be staffed by registered
dietitians who will give information about nutrition and risk
factors for heart disease to the public and health professionals.
   The program also will include media campaigns and a brochure
listing products that receive the AHA stamp of approval. The
brochures will describe the program and provide other facts about
risk factors, with an emphasis on the dangers of cigarette smoking
and high blood pressure.

<HEAD>AMA's Proposal To Create New Class of Health Worker Draws Nurses'
Fire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 4 final grafs with opening speech, administrator's
recommendation about animal research.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Nurses are squaring off with the nation's largest
group of doctors for a battle this week over a physicians' proposal
to offset the nursing shortage by creating a new class of bedside
hospital worker.
   Doctors attending the American Medical Association's annual
policymaking convention, which opened Sunday, will debate a plan to
establish a new type of lesser-trained hospital worker to provide
some care to patients at bedside.
   AMA officials believe their plan for ``registered care
technologists,'' who would handle such chores as changing bandages
and taking vital signs, would be an innovative step toward easing
the nation's nursing shortage.
   But the proposal has drawn harsh criticism from the American
Nurses' Association, which contends the best answer to the shortage
is to improve working conditions and pay nurses better salaries.
   ``It's an impractical, poorly thought-out proposal,'' said Mary
Foley, a nurse from San Francisco and an elected Cabinet member for
the nurses' association. ``It could be potentially very dangerous.''
   She said nurses often help diagnose problems with patients and
act as a backstop to doctors. The technogists wouldn't have the
expertise to spot medical complications or other problems in a
patient, she said.
   Lillian Joel, president of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
association representing 188,000 nurses, plans to testify against
the proposal during a hearing Monday at the AMA convention. The
Illinois Nurses' Association also has organized a protest rally
Monday morning.
   Dr. William Hotchkiss, AMA president, disputed the nurses'
concerns and contended the bedside technologists would give nurses
more time to perform vital, highly technical patient-care
management tasks.
   ``It is in addition to nurses,'' Hotchkiss said. ``We are not
threatening the nurses in any way. We want all the nurses we can
get.''
   Dr. Joseph Painter, an internist from Houston, said the AMA's
Board of Trustees devised the proposal because the nation's
shortage of nurses is projected to hit 300,000 by 1992.
   ``We're dealing with a major shortage that doesn't look like it
will improve,'' Painter said. ``We don't see this as a turf problem
between medicine and nursing. ... Our view is the person who is
really suffering from this acute shortage of bedside care is the
patient.''
   The AMA wants to test its idea on an experimental basis in
states that now have the worst shortage of nurses, he said.
   The board's proposal would create three levels of ``registered
care technologists.'' The first, an assistant technologist, would
be a high school graduate who could begin working with patients
after two months' training.
   The worker could become a full licensed technologist with an
additional seven months' on-the-job training. With nine months of
more specialized training, the worker would become an advanced
technologist who could work in critical care units, Painter said.
   ``We thought it should be an apprentice-type training program,''
he said. ``We wanted to appeal to a different type of applicant who
might not want to spend two to four years in college, but who would
want to earn while they learn.''
   But Ms. Foley, a nurse at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San
Francisco, called the proposal ``misguided.''
   ``We do have a crisis right now because there is a shortage of
nurses. But the solution to that is not to create an alternative
health-care giver with lesser skills,'' she said.
   The proposal also has drawn criticism from within the AMA ranks.
The Ohio delegation to the convention introduced a resolution to
scrap the idea, contending it ``would further dilute the pool of
available individuals for the nursing profession and would increase
the cost of medical care by creating a new category of health care
provider.''
   Sunday was an opening session of the House of Delegates, whose
420 members act as a policymaking legislature for the
295,000-member AMA.
   Dr. William Hotchkiss of Chesapeake, Va., gave his farewell
speech as outgoing president of the AMA, saying members must work
to counter the attitude among a small number of doctors ``that the
profession is no longer worth fighting for and ... is no longer
worth pursuing as a career.''
   James Sammons, the AMA's executive vice president, told the
convention in a written report that doctors and scientists must be
prepared to battle animal rights activists trying to ban the use of
animals in medical research.
   ``I'm afraid that unless we undertake a massive effort to
protect biomedical research ... these people are going to force
medical science into a choice between experiments on animals and
experiments on humans,'' Sammons said.

<TEXT>
   Residents of a disputed region in the southern
Soviet Union voted at a public meeting to end a monthlong general
strike, Soviet media reported Sunday.
   The work stoppage began in the Nagorno-Karabakh region on May 23
to press demands that the predominantly Armenian region, part of
the republic of Azerbaijan, be annexed to neighboring Armenia.
   The legislature of Azerbaijan refused to cede the region, and
the governments of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh have asked the
Moscow-based Supreme Soviet legislature to intervene.
   However in Moscow, a Soviet deputy justice minister, Mikhail
Vyshinsky indicated at a news conference Sunday that the region
could not be transferred to Armenian control without the consent of
Azerbaijan.
   ``As long as the decision about the transfer of
(Nagorno-Karabakh) is not taken by Azerbaijan, the Constitution
does not allow a change in borders of the territory of a
republic,'' Vyshinsky was quoted by the official Tass news agency
as saying.
   Nagorno-Karabakh residents met in the region's administrative
center, Stepanakert, on Saturday night and voted to end the strike,
the Communist Party daily Pravda and Radio Moscow reported.
   ``On the whole, the participants in the meeting took a
constructive decision: to restore the rhythm of work,'' Pravda
said. It said a majority had agreed with the decision.
   Pravda also said some in the crowd had not agreed with a call
from the head of the regional Communist Party, Z. Movsesyan, that
they renounce the use of ``strong-arm methods'' as a means to
pressure authorities into accepting their demands.
   Participants also rejected a suggestion that they wait until the
end of a nationwide Communist Party conference, scheduled to begin
Tuesday, to see what actions they should take in line with the
conference's decisions, Pravda said.
   The newspaper did not elaborate, but the decision could mean
that demonstrations are planned in Nagorno-Karabakh during the
conference, the party's first in 47 years.
   Delegates at the conference are expected to discuss relations
between the more than 100 ethnic groups in the Soviet Union,
although the disagreement over Nagorno-Karabakh is not specifically
on the agenda.
   The dispute has sparked huge demonstrations in Armenia and
unrest in Azerbaijan. Officials say 32 people, including 26
Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were killed in rioting in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait in late February and early March.
   Reports also said eight Armenians and eight Azerbaijanis were
injured in fights in two Armenian villages this month.
   The labor daily Trud, in a Sunday report on the effects of the
strike, said the situation in Stepanakert was ``red hot'' and that
people were hiding at home rather than going to work.
   During the strike, factories stood idle, transport did not run
and railway cars carrying foodstuffs remained unloaded, Trud said.
It said the strike had cost the region about $50 million in losses
in non-industrial goods alone.
   Trud said the strike had been a ``stab in the back for
perestroika,'' Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program for economic and
social restructuring.

   A senior Cuban official on Sunday admitted
an increased Cuban military presence in southern Angola but
defended the move as an appropriate response to what he called a
brutal South African attack on the area.
   But Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said Sunday he has warned the
Cubans that the military buildup could start an explosive
confrontation.
   Jorge Risquet Valdes, chairman of the Cuban Communist Party's
foreign affairs committee, spoke at a news conference a day after
two days of U.S.-mediated peace talks on southern Africa ended in
Cairo.
   The United States, South Africa, Cuba and Angola participated in
the talks, the third in a series. The talks were aimed at resolving
the civil war in Angola, where Cuba has thousands of troops, and
ending South African rule in South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   A senior U.S. State Department official told reporters Sunday
the talks had achieved progress ``in atmosphere and procedure.''
But he said political decisions were necessary to bridge gaps
between the countries involved.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some
parties to the talks had hinted at concessions. He did not
elaborate.
   He said among new elements in the peace talks were Cuban-Angolan
agreement for total Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and
Soviet-American contacts to resolve a number of international
problems, including southern Africa.
   ``Basic political decisions still have to be made, and there is
not much time to make them because of the military situation,'' the
official said.
   Valdes blamed an alleged South African attack on Angola last
December with 9,000 troops and heavy equipment for Cuba's military
buildup in the country.
   ``This brutal escalation launched by South Africa was really
what made it necessary for the Angolan government to ask Cuba for
an increase in forces in necessary quantity, both men and
equipment, in order to rebut this offensive and to overcome it,''
Valdes said.
   ``The increase of Cuban troops, we did not deny ... It is the
proportionate and appropriate response to an increase in brutal
attacks launched by South Africa on Angola.''
   Interviewed by the British Broadcasting Corp. on his way back to
Johannesburg, Botha said he told the Cubans that ``with the
closeness of a large number of military forces'' to the Namibian
border ``you only need a spark to set a big fire to explode.''
   Valdes would not discuss how many Cuban troops are in Angola. He
refused to confirm or deny South African claims that 15,000 to
17,000 Cubans now are in southern Angola and more than 50,000 in
the country as a whole.
   He said Cuba sent forces to Angola in 1975 at the request of
Luanda's Marxist government.
   In the peace talks, which started last month in London, the
United States has been trying to set up a formula using a Cuban
withdrawal from Angola as a trigger to get South Africa to start
granting Namibia independence.
   Valdes said final agreement would foreshadow a ``gradual and
total'' withdrawal of Cuba's military contingent.
   He gave no details. The leading Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram said
the Angolan-Cuban delegation had offered a Cuban withdrawal program
to be complete in four years. South Africa said it should take no
more than eight months.
   A new round of talks is scheduled for next month in Cairo.

   Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno toured a
West Bank refugee camp Sunday and met with Palestinian leaders who
urged him to press the United States to hold talks with the PLO.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres welcomed Uno at Ben Gurion
Airport. The 22-hour trip was the first visit to Israel by a
Japanese Cabinet minister. Uno, 65, also has visited Egypt, Jordan
and Syria on his Middle East tour.
   At a dinner hosted by Peres, Uno stressed the urgency of
reaching a Middle East peace settlement.
   ``The state of affairs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is daily
shown on the televisions in Japan, and the Japanese people are
following the developments in this region with ... deep
apprehension,'' he said. ``The situation demands an early
solution.''
   Japan supports an independent Palestinian state and has urged
Israel to withdraw all its forces from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
It has also urged Israeli negotiations with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which Israel considers a terrorist group.
   In Beirut, Lebanon, the Japanese Red Army terrorist group
released a statement condemning Uno's visit to Israel. The group
launched a bloody attack on Lod airport near Tel Aviv in 1972 that
left 28 people dead.
   After his arrival, Uno visited the West Bank's Dheisheh refugee
camp, where he pledged $250,000 in Japanese aid to build a new
community center.
   ``I am fully aware of your indefatigable way of life under the
difficult conditions in the refugee camp and of the severe
situation in the West Bank and Gaza since last December,'' he told
a small group of Dheisheh residents.
   Japan will grant another $250,000 to U.N. relief operations in
the territories, he said.
   After briefly stopping at the Western Wall, the holiest site for
Jews in Jerusalem's old city, Uno held a 50-minute meeting with six
Palestinian leaders at an east Jerusalem hotel.
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini,
Gaza lawyer Faez Abu Rahme, journalist Radwan Abu Ayyash, former
mayor Mustafa Natsche and businessman Said Kenaan attended the
meeting.
   The meeting was held behind closed doors, but the Palestinians
issued a statement saying they welcomed Japan's support for an
international Mideast peace conference as well as its call for
Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories.
   Kenaan told reporters the Arab leaders urged Uno to pressure the
United States to respond to a document released by PLO leader
Yasser Arafat's senior political adviser, Bassan Abu-Sherif.
   The document, publicized this month, proposed negotiations with
Israel toward a two-state solution.
   ``We asked him to press the U.S. to accept the Abu-Sherif
document,'' Kenaan said. ``We endorse _ every one of us _ the
Abu-Sherif statement and hope it will convince the Israelis that
Palestinians are ready for peace.''
   During an afternoon meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
Uno shared his impressions of the difficult living conditions he
saw at the refugee camp.
   Shamir responded by urging Japan to participate in his proposal
to revamp the camps and find new housing for the residents, said
Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner.

   A couple who camped in a hospital lounge
while their ailing daughter awaited a liver transplant opened a
house Sunday to help other families avoid that same ordeal.
   Charles and Marilyn Fiske held an open house Sunday at The
Family Inn, a renovated structure here with room for 10 families.
The families can stay at the house, located near area hospitals,
for $10 per night.
   ``The child who is ill is pretty well taken care of,'' Fiske
said as dozens of neighbors, builders and sponsors of the project
toured the rambling home. ``It's the rest of the family that can't
understand why it's going on. It's just overwhelming. If they can
come some place, put their feet up and have their families come on
weekends, it doesn't make it go away but it just puts it in
perspective.''
   The house has a large kitchen, extra bathrooms, several pay
phones, a laundry in the basement and a den with a television.
   ``I think there's two things we're providing,'' said Fiske.
``One of them is a place to stay. Another is contact with other
families.''
   Marilyn Fiske had her hands full Sunday making sure daughter
Jamie didn't make a clean sweep of a cookie tray set out for
visitors. Now 6, Jamie was running, jumping and playing along with
other youngsters at the open house.
   In the fall of 1982 a family in Alpine, Utah, saw a television
report of a speech made by Charles Fiske at a New York
pediatrician's convention pleading for help. Four days later, the
Utah family lost their 11-month-old son in an accident. The boy's
liver was transplanted into Jamie in an operation Nov. 5, 1982, in
Minneapolis.
   The hospital where the operation took place was, at the time,
one of the few in the country that performed the operation. The
Fiskes, from Bridgewater, Mass., spent three months in Minnesota.
The couple spent the first week living in the hospital waiting
room. Subsequently, Mrs. Fiske found a boarding house and her
husband visited from Massachusetts on weekends.
   Mrs. Fiske began taking notes of some of the problems she and
the family encountered during Jamie's hospital stay. She said the
notes were the beginning of The Family Inn.

<HEAD>Laos Holds First Nationwide Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laos held its first nationwide
elections Sunday since the Communists seized power in that
Southeast Asian nation 13 years ago, the official Laotian news
agency KPL said.
   The agency report, monitored in Bangkok, said voters cast
ballots for 4,462 candidates running for 2,410 seat on
district-level People's Councils.
   The district elections are to be followed in mid-November by
those at provincial and national levels while village elections are
to take place later, according to Laotian officials.
   The elections appear to be another sign of greater openness in
Laos. Over the past year, the government has promoted
capitalist-style reforms of the economy and plans to decentralize
the bureaucracy.
   The agency said 1,793,000 eligible voters _ representing 47
percent of the population _ cast secret ballots in the nation's 113
districts.
   The highest-level elections will be for 79 seats in the Supreme
People's Assembly, which was formed Dec. 2, 1975, and assigned to
draft a Constitution and prepare the country for elections.
   Laotian official are unclear as to why it has taken so long for
the elections to be held. The Constitution is not expected to be
completed until next year.
   Real power in Laos still rests with the Communist Party and its
highest body, the Politburo. The Poliburo is led by Kaysone
Phomvihane, who fought the French colonialists and then led the
guerrilla war against the U.S.-backed Vientiane government that
fell in 1975.

   The drought-diminished Mississippi River near St. Louis
re-opened to more than 500 barges after a three-day dredging
operation, while Texas farmers whose cattle had to eat cactus were
faced with flash floods after weekend thunderstorms dumped five to
10 inches of rain.
   The weather cooled dramatically around the southern Great Lakes
but remained hot and humid in the South.
   Meanwhile, in Washington, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee estimated Sunday that food prices will increase 2 percent
to 4 percent next year because of the drought.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., interviewed on CBS' ``Face the
Nation,'' also said his committee would monitor market activity in
farm products.
   Thirty-nine tows pushing the barges on the Mississippi had been
idled by the low water levels but were able to move through the
newly dug channel by Saturday midnight, Coast Guard Cmdr. Tim
Josiah said Sunday.
   An additional 1,000 barges were reported waiting at St. Louis to
head down river.
   At Memphis, Tenn., on the lower Mississippi, Brig. Gen. Thomas
A. Sands of the Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday the river may
fall soon to less than 20 percent of its normal flow.
   However, both Sands, who is president of the Mississippi River
Commission, and Rear Adm. William Leahy of the Coast Guard
predicted that commercial traffic on the lower Mississippi will
continue through the summer although periodic barge backups and
groundings can be expected.
   Sands and William Leahy toured the area with Robert Page,
assistant secretary of the Army for civil works.
   ``There are problems on the river, but they are manageable,''
Page said. ``We'll keep it open.''
   In Nebraska, the high temperature failed to clear the 100-degree
mark for the first time in eight days Sunday, but drought
conditions lingered and people talked more and more about the
resemblance to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.
   Monsigner Edward O'Donnell of Omaha recalled residents flocking
to the air-conditioned Orpheum Theater to avert the heat in the
1930s. He said the summers of 1934 and 1936 were ``scorchers.''
   ``I remember we slept on the porch at night to keep cool,''
O'Donnell said.
   Gretchen Musser, 79, of Omaha, was living in rural Rising City
in 1934, when only 14 inches of rain fell in Nebraska. It was the
lowest annual rainfall since 1864.
   ``It was hot for weeks at a time. Real hot. Without letting up.
It lasted year after year,'' she said.
   Severe thunderstorms slashed across Alabama Sunday and caused
serious damage in the southeast corner of the state, where two
homes were destroyed by what witnesses described as a tornado.
Dozens of vehicles were damaged when winds ripped part of the roof
off the Dothan airport.
   Emergency management officials reported no serious injuries from
the storm, which provided the second straight day of much-needed
rain for some drought-stricken areas.
   ``The rains (in Texas) ... have helped quite a bit,''
particularly in the southeast part of the state, said metereologist
Larry Peabody of the National Weather Service forecast center in
San Antonio, Texas.
   The weather service issued flash flood warnings for Real and
Uvalde counties near San Antonio, where three to five inches of
rain fell Saturday.
   In Arkansas, some rain showers fell across the southern
two-thirds of the state Saturday, but Lee Harrison, a deputy
meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Sunday the
showers didn't amount to much.
   Although a day of prayer proclaimed for Sunday by Gov. Bill
Clinton didn't produce substantial rain, it did seem to have some
effect: ``Attendance is picking up,'' said the Rev. Harmon
Whitehurst of the United Methodist Church at Weiner.

   Gay couples marched in matching colors, San Francisco's mayor
brought his family, and balloons were released to memorialize AIDS
deaths as half a million people participated in gay pride
celebrations nationally Sunday.
   Police estimated 100,000 people marched down New York's Fifth
Avenue, stopping for a period of silence as 10,000 balloons bearing
messages and poems to people who have died of AIDS were released.
Similar balloon releases occurred in San Francisco and West
Hollywood, Calif.
   ``The balloons are symbolic of the freedom we, as homosexuals,
have to fly free and be proud of what we are,'' said Kenn Kidd, an
organizer.
   About 25 members of three organziations _ Jews for Morality, the
National Coalition to Prevent the Spread of AIDS and the Committee
for the Defense of St. Patrick's _ protested opposite St. Patrick's
Cathedral, condemning homosexuals and shouting ``AIDS spreaders''
at parade participants.
   In Hartford, Conn., about 600 gay activists chanting ``Gay
bashing, we say no, homophobia's got to go,'' marched Saturday
through downtown to the state Capitol. Activists attributed a
bludgeoning death last month to anti-homosexual bias.
   Chicago's parade attracted several hundred marchers and many
more spectators, and ended with a rally that attracted about
70,000, police said.
   A focus was support of a proposed human rights ordinance
approved by a City Council committee Thursday that would prohibit
discrimination on the basis of age, martial status, disability or
sexual orientation. Church groups have lobbied against it.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer was scheduled to speak at the rally
but didn't show up.
   In Seattle, three congressional candidates turned out to court
about 15,000 people who marched and rallied to cap a Lesbian and
Gay Pride Week.
   In San Francisco, Art Agnos became the first mayor to take part
in the city's annual Gay Freedom Day parade, which drew more than
160,000 marchers and spectators.
   Agnos rode with his family in a black 1931 Lincoln Continental.
The parade also featured 175 floats and contingents, escorted by
the group Dykes on Bikes, hundreds of leather-clad,
motorcycle-revving lesbians.
   In addition to the traditional sprinkling of female
impersonators and leather-clad, buttock-flashing cowboys, there
were more serious contingents, such as Living Sober, a group of
recovering drug addicts and alcoholics.
   In West Hollywood, gay couples wearing matching colors strolled
arm-in-arm along the parade route. Drill teams and marching bands
entertained 150,000 people in the 19th annual Los Angeles Gay and
Lesbian Pride Celebration.
   The parade grew somber as participants released 12,000 purple
helium-filled balloons, each bearing the name of a person with AIDS.
   ``The AIDS crisis has brought together the gay and lesbian
communities and has helped bring people out, not just to the
festival, but to their families and their friends,'' said organizer
Gary Jonker.
   ``I watched in 1982 and I don't know if there was any AIDS
groups present, said Gary Farnsworth, a student at City College of
San Francisco, watching the parade there. ``Then last year it
seemed so heavy into AIDS, which is valid _ it's important.
   ``For all the thousands of people marching today in this parade,
more than a thousand of them won't be here next year,'' he said.
   The AIDS-related concerns stem from the fatal virus' rampant
spread through the male homosexual community. Nationally, 65,099
AIDS cases have been reported since June 1981, resulting in 36,874
deaths.

<HEAD>First Stone Laid for Monument to Soldiers Killed in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first stone was laid Sunday for a monument in
Moscow to the more than 13,000 Soviet soldiers who have been killed
fighting in Afghanistan, the official Tass news agency said.
   The monument, which includes an eternal flame to the dead, will
be built in Friendship Park, a popular spot in the Soviet capital's
northwest near the Moscow River, Tass said.
   It said veterans of the Afghan war sang songs at a ceremony for
the laying of the cornerstone Sunday, a day celebrated here as
``Soviet Youth Day.''
   The creation of the memorial was a sign that the Soviet Union
may be increasingly coming to grips with the costs of the war it
did not win.
   During much of the 8{-year Soviet involvement in Afghanistan,
the state-run media and officials made scant mention of Soviet
soldiers who had been killed. Many of the war dead were buried with
no hint on their tombstones of where or why they had died.
   The Soviets have been more frank about the casualties under
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openess.
   The government disclosed on May 25 that 13,310 Soviet troops had
been killed and 35,478 wounded since the Soviet Union intervened in
Afghanistan in December 1979. The Kremlin began withdrawing its
troops on May 15 under a U.N.-brokered agreement concluded the
previous month.
   Tass said the war monument will be erected to ``Soviet soldiers
who died while fulfilling their internationalist duty in
Afghanistan.'' According to official Soviet thinking, the Red Army
did not intervene in Afghanistan, but came to the aid of a Marxist
government beleaguered by a nationwide insurgency.
   Tass said that for Sunday's ceremony, a lamp was lit at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin that honors World War II
dead, and brought to the spot in Friendship Park where the
cornerstone was laid.
   The lamp will be kept by the state-sanctioned Soviet Peace
Committee until the monument is completed, Tass said.
   Members of the Peace Committee and the Moscow city organization
of the military reserve collected donations for the monument and
for the construction of a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers
wounded in Afghanistan, Tass said.

<HEAD>One In Six Of Chicago's Public Housing Units Sit Vacant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one out of every six public housing units
in Chicago sits vacant while tens of thousands of applicants wait
for a place to live, a new study shows.
   Housing Authority executive director Vincent Lane attributed the
problem in part to street gangs who have taken over some of the
buildings, frightening residents away.
   ``Decent people know when these guys are in a building. They try
to get out. They move. When units become available in that
building, nobody takes them,'' Lane said.
   In the past year, 1,550 of the Chicago Housing Authority's
40,840 units, or more than four apartments a day, have become
uninhabitable, the Chicago Tribune reported in Sunday editions.
   A total of 6,218 units are vacant, according to the Chicago
Sun-Times.
   At the Robert Taylor Homes on the South Side, the Housing
Authority's largest public housing project, gangs have ``taken over
or have a foothold'' in half of the 56 buildings, Lane said.
   The vacancy rate has risen to 40 percent in some of the
buildings controlled by gangs, compared with 6 percent at two
Robert Taylor buildings not dominated by gangs, he said.
   ``The problem is critical. The more vacancies you have, the more
they proliferate. It's like a cancer eating away,'' said Lane.
   Cuts in funds, labor and equipment are also to blame for the
problem, Lane and other officials said.
   But others blamed bureaucratic inefficiency. Former Housing
Authority board member Patricia Crowley contended that many of the
40,000 people on the waiting lists are dead or can't be located.
   The authority has cut its work force from 2,880 to 1,957 in the
last year because of federal cutbacks, the Tribune said.
   So, instead of quickly repairing apartments when tenants move
out, the authority boards up units, which are often run-down after
years of abuse by tenants.
   But by boarding up the apartments, the authority is telling
gangs ``that they can move in and do their number on it,'' Lane
said.

<HEAD>Famous Divorce Lawyer Blasts Televised Rape Accusation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs grafs 11-12 `The lawyer' to restore full name of Ms.
Barrett-Whitney.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson on Sunday
described two former clients who claimed he raped them as
``professional extortionists'' after they described the alleged
attacks on a television program.
   ``It's ridiculous because I've spent my life defending women,
not attacking them. After their complaints were filed, I went and
took a lie detector test on both women, and it came out 100 percent
that I had had nothing to do with them,'' Mitchelson said.
   He commented after the CBS program ``60 Minutes'' featured an
investigation that began after Kristen Barrett-Whitney and Patricia
French made the allegations against the lawyer.
   ``These women are charlatans, they can cry on cue,'' he said.
``They know it didn't happen, and I know it didn't happen. They're
professional extortionists, that's what you run into in this
business. When you're a high-profile figure, these people come
after you.''
   Ms. Barrett-Whitney said she paid Mitchelson $25,500 to
represent her in a palimony action, only to have him rape her in a
bathroom. The CBS program quoted Ms. French as saying she was raped
by Mitchelson and another former client as saying he fondled her
and took a bubble bath in front of her.
   Ms. Barrett-Whitney and Ms. French complained to police, who
recorded a conversation between Mitchelson and Ms. Barrett-Whitney
in which the attorney said, ``I have no bad feelings against you,
and I wasn't in any way trying to traumatize you,'' the CBS report
said.
   Los Angeles Assistant District Attorney Dan Murphy said: ``There
certainly are things that Mr. Mitchelson says in that tape which
make the hair in the back of my neck stand up. I say, you know
something, something's cooking here.''
   But the district attorney's office decided there was not enough
evidence to prosecute, Murphy said.
   The ``60 Minutes'' report said that when Mitchelson was told
about the story, ``he cried and pleaded with us not to air this
report,'' offering ``10 great stories'' if the program dropped the
Mitchelson piece.
   ``I urged them not to do it because it was untrue, but it's a
misrepresentation for (60 Minutes correspondent) Mike Wallace to
say I begged him not to do it,'' Mitchelson said from his Los
Angeles office.
   The lawyer said Ms. Barrett-Whitney has 13 aliases and has filed
seven different lawsuits totalling $300 million against several
professionals, doctors, psychiatrists, lawyers, dentists, ``all
claiming the same thing.''
   He said Ms. Barrett-Whitney came to him for palimony and later
several other suits, but he refused to take the other lawsuits.
   ``When I refused to take them, then she decided to leave me and
claim that I sexually attacked her,'' Mitchelson said.
   He said Ms. French wanted him to sue a minister for a supposed
sexual attack.
   ``When I found it to be groundless, I said I wouldn't do it.
Even still, she sent me nice letters for months trying to get me to
take the case, months after the fictitious attack on her supposedly
happened,'' he said.

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A week-old fire along the Montana-South Dakota border broke away
from an army of more than 1,200 firefighters again Sunday and raced
northward six or seven miles across thousands of acres of timber,
officials reported.
   Officials were uncertain how many additional acres had burned,
but their best estimate was that the fire covered more than 50,000
acres Sunday night in the Custer National Forest, said Jack
Hendley, a spokesman at the Interagency Fire Center in Billings,
Mont.
   Meantime, the number of widespread forest and brush fires
continued to run far above average and to concern fire officials
across the nation, though some fires were being brought under
control.
   More than 700 acres of drought-seared grassland burned in
Southern California. At least 10 people were injured _ one
seriously enough to be hospitalized _ and four residences burned
before firefighters controlled a 215-acre blaze Saturday in the
high desert community of Apple Valley.
   Aided by overnight rainfall and cooler, humid weather, 200 Idaho
firefighters controlled the 137-acre Tyndall Meadows fire in the
Boise National Forest Sunday and planned to begin demobilizing
Monday.
   In Old Town, Maine, weekend rain also helped to remove the
immediate threat of forest fires in some areas, but rangers said
Sunday that rainfall was too light to make any difference in most
of the state's northern woods.
   A fire that scorched at least 200 acres in the Allagash region
of Maine was reported under control Sunday, but rangers said
lightning posed a constant danger.
   In the western Maine woods, Assistant Regional Ranger Kenny Wing
said Saturday's rain removed the danger for a couple of days.
   ``But with a little bit of sunshine and a little bit of wind,
we'll be right back where we were,'' Wing said.
   Flames from the Montana fire came within 300 yards of a ranch
near the South Dakota border Saturday night before firefighters and
air-dropped flame retardant turned the blaze away, officials said.
   ``It was very extreme, a pretty tense situation,'' said fire
information officer Michelle Ravnikar.
   Fire had burned 39,680 acres as of Sunday morning. So far,
firefighting costs have topped $900,000 and are expected to reach
$1.75 million, and timber losses are predicted at $2.5 million.
   The Maine Forest Service reported 10 to 15 new fires a day last
week, compared with the usual two or three a day in June. As of
late last week, 556 fires had burned more than 2,200 acres this
year in Maine.
   Louisiana Office of Forestry firefighters normally battle about
100 fires during June, but so far this month 511 fires have been
reported.
   Approximately eight times as many acres of land have been lost
this month as in June 1987.
   High temperatures, consistently low humidity and windy days have
combined to make conditions excellent for fires and only a long,
steady rain will make things better, officials said.

   Four steel bins filled with unsold grain
are Mel Rodenburg's hedge against a drought that wiped out his
1,300 acres of wheat, oats and rye this spring.
   As the drought drags on and grain prices soar, he's one of
thousands of farmers who stand to make a tidy profit from selling
their share of the billions of bushels of wheat and corn stockpiled
around the nation.
   ``The drought makes it tough going, but, yes, we are going to
get along quite comfortably,'' said Rodenburg.
   Rodenburg, 57, has 14,000 bushels of wheat stored in the bins on
his 3,000-acre farm. The wheat is worth $3.85 a bushel, up $1.15
from a few weeks ago. The price likely will rise much more, perhaps
as high as $7 a bushel, some have speculated.

   ``It's hot enough out there to make a man quit,'' said Daniels,
41, on the fifth straight day of 100-plus-degree temperatures in

   ``You don't want to go out in the heat. But when it's time to go

   Worldwide grain stocks could sink to their lowest
levels of the decade and lead to possible food shortages if the
crippling U.S. drought continues for another two weeks, according
to a U.N. organization.
   But officials at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization say
favorable weather and crop prospects have created a brighter farm
picture in most of the rest of the world.
   Before the U.S. drought took hold, the Rome-based U.N.
organization already was projecting that world grain production in
1988-89 would not match consumption and that stocks would drop
close to the level the agency considers the minimum necessary to
safeguard world food security.
   ``Now with the U.S. drought, the question is how much is U.S.
production going to be drawn down,'' Peter Newhouse, chief of the
agency's global information and early warning service, said in an
interview Friday.
   The organization had projected June that the United States would
produce 279 million tons of this year's targeted 1.67 billion tons
of grain worldwide. But that was before the worst drought since the
Great Depression parched the Midwest.

federal research that is often delayed or of poor quality, the
General Accounting Office reported Sunday.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the Health Care
Financing Administration was producing reports that ``were often
not fully responsive to congressional needs, were frequently late

   The GAO attributed some of the problems to the lengthy review

   The Communist Party conference opening Tuesday
could play a role in changing the nature of the party and making it
more responsive to the people than it has been since it came to
power in 1917.
   Proposals to be discussed at the 19th All-Union Party Conference
could, if accepted by delegates, limit the power of the

and chief reformer, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is high time party workers stopped doing the work of

activity,'' Gorbachev told Leningrad party workers in October.
Instead, he said, the party should focus on politics and ideology.

   George Bush calls it his ``truth squad,'' an
army of Republican stand-ins with orders to take shots at opponent
Michael Dukakis. The Democrat's camp has a less charitable label:
``hit squad.''
   No matter the name, the Bush surrogates _ made up of senators
and House members, governors, and other prominent Republicans _ are
already having an impact on the 1988 presidential race.
   The surrogates are fanning out across the country and
criticizing the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, sometimes
speaking in the same cities hours before or after Dukakis, a
technique the Bush campaign calls ``bracketing.''
   For a national campaign strapped for cash, the tactic is
inexpensive and enables the vice president to get mileage from the
sharp attacks without having to utter the words himself.

   A company that provides ``dial-a-porn''
services and an anonymous group of ``consenting adults'' have filed
lawsuits to prevent a new law banning pornographic telephone
messages from taking effect July 1.
   The suits were filed in federal courts in Los Angeles by an
affiliate of one of the country's largest dial-a-porn providers and
in New York by a group calling itself ``Consenting Adults Telephone
Rights Association.''
   The government has agreed not to enforce the law until July 25
at the earliest, after a California federal judge reviews the case
and decides whether to put the dial-a-porn law on hold temporarily
pending further hearings, said Justice Department sources who spoke
on the condition they not be identified.
   The law applies only to interstate dial-a-porn calls and those
in the District of Columbia, but most dial-a-porn services use a
976 prefix and must be reached from a local exchange. Only in
California and a few other states can they be reached long-distance
with an area code.

   Two years ago, an editor besieged by Jim
Fitts' letters to his newspaper suggested that the retired
agriculture teacher start up his own publication to voice his
opinions.
   Fitts took the advice, and today his fledgling weekly is in the
midst of a legal battle involving First Amendment rights.
   Fitts, the 62-year-old editor of Williamsburg County's The Voice
newspaper, not only stirred up the political powers that be in this
poor, rural county of some 40,000 people. His denunciation of two
politicians and subsequent arrest on criminal libel charges caught
the attention of journalists around the country.
   Fitts has gone to jail once and could go again for expressing
his opinion in a newspaper. He awaits word Monday on whether he has
been indicted by a Williamsburg County grand jury on criminal libel
charges.
   If indicted and convicted, he faces a fine of up to $5,000 and a
year in jail.

   It sounds like grand prize in a supermarket sweepstakes: free
cash, land and a year of golf and swimming. What's more, ladies and
gentlemen, everybody can be a winner.
   A too-good-to-be-true offer? No. A gimmick? Yes.
   The promotion is brought to you by the friendly folks of Rolfe,
Iowa, who hope their slick campaign will entice people to move to a
tiny town itching to get bigger.
   Rolfe, which will provide $1,200, a free lot and recreation for
folks who build and live in a house worth at least $30,000, is
among a growing number of towns in rural America offering
incentives to lure new residents or industry.
   All across the heartland, small towns that have lost people,
jobs and schools to the farm crisis are now waging aggressive
campaigns in their struggle to expand or at least stay alive.
   ``Rural communities are fighting for survival,'' said Paul
Lasley, an Iowa State University sociologist. ``It's a very
competitive situation we've got out there.''
   Some towns make pitches in radio or newspaper ads. Many have
hired professionals. All are humming a tune of promises, promises,
promises _ low business rents, free buildings, tax breaks, cheap
utilities and, in some cases, hard cash.
   Some towns are angling for jobs. Others want people. Both are
important.
   ``It's kind of a chicken and egg question _ do jobs attract
people or do people attract employers who bring jobs?'' Lasley
said. ``It's some of both.''
   The increasing number of towns offering incentives, he added,
``reflects the desperate financial situation in rural America.''
   Not all the towns have been ravaged by hard times, but many have
seen neighboring communities wither away. They fear unless they
move fast, they'll be next. Strategies vary:
   _In Chetek, Wis., population 2,160, a bank is offering a $5,000
reward this year to anyone who can bring in a new business that
will employ at least 15 people full time.
   ``We're a small town. We're looking for any small employer.
We're not trying to recruit a Saturn (auto) plant,'' said Robert
Missling, president of the Chetek State Bank, which is offering the
reward.
   _In Rolfe, Iowa, the incentives include cash, one-year family
membership to the pool and golf course and 8.8 percent initial
financing.
   ``We feel like we have just about everything we need _ except
people,'' said Bill Winkleblack, president of the Rolfe Betterment
Corp. One couple has taken advantage of the offer and a house is
under construction, he said.
   _In Osakis, Minn., up to $5,000 is offered toward the cost of a
lot and home for anyone willing to build and stay five years. A
similar offer is available to businesses. The program is financed
with proceeds from the ``pull tab,'' a local instant lottery.
   ``We don't want to lose what we've got,'' said Tom Ellis, a
member of the Osakis Economic Development Corp. ``It's sort of a
circle-your-wagon defense.''
   One couple recently took advantage of the program and built a
home in town, Ellis said. Officials said since the incentive was
announced last fall, about 25 inquiries had come in from as far
away as California and Florida.
   _In Mexico, Mo., prospective businesses are being tempted with
offers of free land and cheaper rents. The town will also offer
cash to a company based on the number and skill level of the jobs
it brings to town, as long as the company stays 10 years.
   In the last two years, five manufacturers that will eventually
employ up to 630 people have moved to Mexico, said Jerry
Schmutzler, city director of economic development. Another company
that will provide 200 new jobs will open in July, he said, and
plans in the works could bring 300 more jobs to town by 1990.
   Schmutzler said special offers are important only after a
company has narrowed down possible locations to a few towns. Then,
he said, ``it's who wants (the company) the most. It's who's
offering the biggest incentives.''
   Scores of other rural towns have similar programs, leading some
experts to question whether they are giving away the store.
   ``They feel like they don't have a chance unless they sell their
soul,'' said Rex Campbell, a University of Missouri sociologist.
``They have to offer not just a building, but a building with free
taxes.
   ``Competition is so tough,'' he said, ``if you go 10 miles or
100 miles down the road, there's going to be some other community
that's willing to provide (a company) with free everything. Unless
you offer free everything, you'll lose them.''
   The drawback, he said, is ``there's only so many marbles to
spread around. There's only so many plants looking for a site.''
   And that can pit towns against each other.
   ``In some ways, it's a zero-sum game,'' said Lasley of Iowa
State. ``One community gains at the expense of another.''
   But town officials say they carefully analyze the cost-benefit
ratio before offering special deals.
   In Rolfe, for example, ``we need new housing,'' said David
Jochims, city administrator. ``It commits people to our community.
... We get a payback. We get tax dollars and utility dollars.''
   The town of 700 has lost about 10 percent of its population
since 1980, officials say, and the last new house was built seven
years ago.
   ``We need to offer jobs and housing ... to ensure we're going to
be here in the future,'' Jochims added. Iowa, federal statistics
show, lost 62,000 people from 1980 to 1986.
   In recruiting, many communities emphasize the Norman Rockwell
aspect of small-town U.S.A., such as low taxes, good schools,
little crime. But often, there's one missing piece in the puzzle _
jobs.
   And no matter what they offer, experts say, remotely located
towns aren't likely to attract industry, and without work, there's
little reason for people to relocate.
   While many say it's too early to judge the impact of incentives,
Bettendorf, Iowa, offers an example of where they worked _ too well.
   Last year, Bettendorf had to end its offer to pay up to $500 of
first-time homebuyers' closing costs when it ran out of money, said
Dick Kvach, planning coordinator. The program's cost: $106,000.
   ``The response was much greater than anticipated,'' Kvach said,
and 280 homes were bought and built in 10 months, with about 20
percent of the buyers coming from out of state.
   Money aside, Campbell said incentives also had intangible value.
   ``It makes a community feel better,'' he said. ``They're trying
to control their own destiny. ... In a few cases, it may succeed.''
   But, he added, ``for the great many, my answer would be no.''

<HEAD>GE, Unions Continue Contract Negotiations; Immediate Strike Seen
Unlikely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for General Electric Co. and its two
largest unions continued bargaining Sunday over a new contract for
47,000 workers, although no immediate strike was expected if
agreement was not reached by a midnight deadline.
   Negotiators resumed talks at a Manhattan hotel, according to
Jerry Borstel, a spokesman for the International Union of
Electronic, Electrical, Salaried Machine and Furniture Workers,
which represents 40,000 GE workers.
   GE's other national contract involves the United Electrical,
Radio, and Machine Workers of America, which represents about 6,300
GE employees.
   Borstel declined to characterize the tenor of the talks, or to
speculate about when agreement might be reached.
   But Borstel has said that if the talks produced no agreement by
the midnight EDT stroke deadline, the union was likely to give the
company a 10-day strike notice instead of actually striking.
   The unions are seeking a moratorium on plant closings, a
no-layoffs guarantee, better early retirement benefits, stronger
limits on subcontracting and other job security improvements.
   They also want wage increases in each year of the new contract,
improvements in the cost of living formula, increases in pension
benefits, improvements in health and hospitalization insurance,
reimbursement for dependent care and prepaid prescription drugs.

<HEAD>Survey: First Quarter Industry Profit Concentrated In 10
Investment Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten big investment banks accounted for 43
percent of the securities industry's first quarter profit,
indicating the impact of the October market crash still is being
felt by most U.S. firms, an industry trade group has reported.
   The industry posted a pre-tax profit of $1.1 billion in the
first quarter, compared with a $2.1 billion loss in fourth quarter
1987 and a $2 billion pre-tax profit for all of last year, the
Securities Industry Association said in a survey released Monday.
   Big investment banks constituting 2.5 percent of the New York
Stock Exchange member firms accounted for more than 43 of the
industry-wide profit, while just 23 percent of the NYSE firms
accounted for 61 percent of the profit, SIA stated.
   The figures indicated the ripples from the October crash still
were being felt mostly by the retail sector, where the bulk of the
nation's securities firms are focused, said SIA president, Edward
I. O'Brien.
   Industry-wide commission revenue fell by 25 percent, to $2.4
billion from $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, for the worst
quarterly shjowing since fourth quarter 1985.
   Mutual fund revenue rose to $430 million in the first quarter
from $360 million in the previous three months, although it was
below the 1987 quarterly average of $552 million, SIA reported.
   At the same time, industry-wide trading profit surged 63 percent
higher, to $3.1 billion from $1.9 billion in fourth quarter 1987,
while investment profit fell to $828 million from $1.3 billion in
the fourth quarter, but remained far over the 1987 quarterly
average of $17 million.
   Revenue related to other activitites such as mergers and
acquisitions and private stock placements nearly equaled the $2.9
billion quarterly average for 1987, the report stated.
   Those results indicate firms concentrating in investment banking
and trading continued to do well, ``while the retail hemisphere has
almost ground to a halt,'' the SIA stated.
   The report was included in the group's ``Trends'' publication,
which is issued several times a year.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministers Look For Solutions To Foreign Debt Problem</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Sunday communique. No pickup.</NOTE>

   The foreign ministers of seven leading
Latin American nations stated Sunday that the $8 billion in
outstanding mutual debt among their nations was the main obstacle
to creating a regional common market.
   Foreign ministers of the Group of Eight _ Mexico, Brazil,
Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Uruguay and Peru _ issued a
communique at the end of their weekend meeting saying they agreed
to work together to find a solution to the problem.
   Group member Panama was absent from the meeting. Panama was
suspended from the group at its last meeting in February, shortly
after military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was indicted in
the United States on drug trafficking charges. Noriega engineered
the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle after Delvalle tried
to fire him.
   The ministers, who also spent much of their time working on an
agenda for a summit meeting of their presidents later this year,
offered no specifics about that meeting.
   Latin American leaders have talked of a common market for years,
but earlier attempts at economic integration have failed.
   In the 1960s, a Central American Common Market and an 11-nation
Latin American Free Trade Association were formed but later broke
apart amid civil wars and squabbling over tariffs.
   Recently, the Group of Eight has been trying to revive the plan,
spurned on the economic stagnation blamed in part on the region's
massive foreign debts. Last year, for example, Argentina, Brazil
and Uruguay signed accords breaking down trade barriers.
   ``It is necessary to create mechanisms that will allow the
nations of Latin America to develop in the medium- and long-term,''
said Mexican Foreign Ministry spokesman Victor Flores Olea.
   The ministers also agreed that Latin American nations should
take the ``most concerted position possible'' in confronting their
international lenders.
   On Monday, the ministers will meet in Mexico City, turning their
attention to the problems of Central America and Panama's status in
the group
   They are to meet with President Miguel de la Madrid and with
Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter.

   New evidence has come in lately to buttress the
widely espoused belief that the stock market makes no sense.
   On May 17, the government reported a sharp drop in the trade
deficit and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 21.22
points.
   On June 14, the government reported another sharp drop in the
trade deficit and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
25.07 points.
   At least one large bank ran advertisements noting these
divergent performances, and suggested its certificates of deposit
as an alternative to stocks for people who wanted investments they
could understand.
   The bank had a point. Any investor with a strong desire for
order, simplicity and stability is probably better off avoiding any
strategy that depends on the day-to-day fluctuations of the stock
market.
   But to the charge that the market behaves irrationally, its
advocates respectfully plead innocent.
   Though the reasoning may get convoluted at times, they say,
there is almost always a method behind the madness portrayed on the
ticker tape.
   In the case of the recent trade reports, said Hugh Johnson, an
analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y., the explanation for
the market's differing responses lay not far below the surface.
   ``In both instances,'' he noted, ``the trade deficit declined
significantly.
   ``However, the decline in the March deficit (reported in May)
signaled that the economy may be strengthening, and the decline in
the April deficit (reported in June) signaled that the economy may
be weakening.
   ``The March trade deficit improved because exports surged,
suggesting that domestic demand in West Germany, Japan, etc., was
strengthening and was placing pressure on U.S. manufacturers to
meet that demand.
   ``This was viewed by the financial markets as inflationary.
   ``The April trade deficit improved because imports declined,
suggesting that domestic demand in the U.S. was slowing. This
suggested inflation may not be as big a problem as it has been made
out to be.
   ``The two events, when taken together and reviewed along with
the market's reaction to other recent releases, demonstrate how
important it is to the financial markets that the economy slows
down from the pace of the prior three quarters.''
   In other words, stock traders' reactions to the trade reports
were simply a new variation on a theme that has become familiar on
Wall Street in the 1980s: ``Good news is bad news,'' and vice versa.
   Favorable news for near-term business activity conjures up
images of increased inflation, rising interest rates and
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve, all of which could serve
as prelude to a recession.
   Unfavorable news for near-term business activity evokes visions
of reduced inflation, falling interest rates and stimulative credit
policy from the Fed, all of which could set the stage for renewed
growth later on.
   Suppose you have worked your way through all this and you still
don't buy it.
   How could one monthly report on a single aspect of the economy
send fears of inflation rippling through the market, and another
four weeks later persuade thousands of investors that things were
not so bad after all?
   Well, one could argue, expectations do not really change that
radically. When the market rises or falls 20 points as measured by
the Dow, it is actually moving up or down by about 1 percent to
adjust for the latest information received.
   And at the same time, one could acknowledge that this
``adjustment'' process is emotional, messy and sometimes outright
violent.
   Most devotees of the stock market will readily admit to all
that. Just don't try to tell them it is nonsensical.
